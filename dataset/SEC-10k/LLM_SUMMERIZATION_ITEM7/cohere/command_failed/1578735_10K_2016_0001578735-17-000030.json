Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This Form 10-K contains certain forward-looking statements that are intended to be covered by the safe harbors created by The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. See Note on Forward-Looking Statements.\u201d\nOverview\nWe are a specialty personal lines insurance holding company. Through our subsidiaries, we provide a variety of insurance products, including personal and commercial automobile, homeowners, umbrella, recreational vehicle, motorcycle, lender-placed, supplemental health and other niche insurance products. We sell insurance products with a focus on underwriting profitability through a combination of our customized and predictive analytics and our technology driven low cost infrastructure.\nWe manage our business through two segments: Property and Casualty ( P&C\u201d) and Accident and Health ( A&H\u201d). We transact business primarily through our twenty-two regulated domestic insurance subsidiaries: Integon Casualty Insurance Company, Integon General Insurance Corporation, Integon Indemnity Corporation, Integon National Insurance Company ( Integon National\u201d), Integon Preferred Insurance Company, New South Insurance Company, MIC General Insurance Corporation, National General Insurance Company, National General Assurance Company, National General Insurance Online, Inc., National Health Insurance Company, National General Premier Insurance Company, Imperial Fire and Casualty Insurance Company, Agent Alliance Insurance Company, Century-National Insurance Company, Standard Property and Casualty Insurance Company, Direct General Insurance Company, Direct General Insurance Company of Louisiana, Direct General Insurance Company of Mississippi, Direct General Life Insurance Company, Direct Insurance Company and Direct National Insurance Company. Our insurance subsidiaries that are part of our intercompany quota share agreement to Integon National, have an A-\u201d (Excellent) group rating by A.M. Best, subject to transition periods in the case of acquired companies. We currently conduct a limited amount of business outside the United States, primarily in Bermuda, Luxembourg and Sweden.\nThe operating results of property and casualty insurance companies are subject to quarterly and yearly fluctuations due to the effect of competition on pricing, the frequency and severity of losses, the effect of weather and natural disasters on losses, general economic conditions, the general regulatory environment in states in which an insurer operates, state regulation of premium rates, changes in fair value of investments, and other factors such as changes in tax laws. The property and casualty industry has been highly cyclical with periods of high premium rates and shortages of underwriting capacity followed by periods of severe price competition and excess capacity. While these cycles can have a large impact on a company's ability to grow and retain business, we have sought to focus on niche markets and regions where we are able to maintain premium rates at generally consistent levels and maintain underwriting discipline throughout these cycles. We believe that the nature of our P&C insurance products, including their relatively low limits, the relatively short duration of time between when claims are reported and when they are settled, and the broad geographic distribution of our customers, have allowed us to grow and retain our business throughout these cycles. In addition, we have limited our exposure to catastrophe losses through reinsurance. With regard to seasonality, we tend to experience higher claims and claims expense in our P&C segment during periods of severe or inclement weather.\nWe evaluate our operations by monitoring key measures of growth and profitability, including net loss ratio, net combined ratio (non-GAAP) and operating leverage. We target a net combined ratio (non-GAAP) between 90% and 95% while seeking to maintain optimal operating leverage in our insurance subsidiaries commensurate with our A.M. Best rating objectives. To achieve our targeted net combined ratio (non-GAAP) we continually seek ways to reduce our operating costs and lower our expense ratio. For the year ended December 31, 2016, our operating leverage (the ratio of net earned premium to average total stockholders' equity) was 1.7x, which was within our planned target operating leverage of between 1.5x and 2.0x.\nInvestment income is also an important part of our business. Because we often do not settle claims until several months or longer after we receive the original policy premiums, we are able to invest cash from premiums for significant periods of time. We invest our capital and surplus in accordance with state and regulatory guidelines. Our net investment income was $99.6 million, $75.3 million and $52.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. We held 5.8% and 7.8%, of total invested assets in cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nOur most significant balance sheet liability is our unpaid loss and loss adjustment expense ( LAE\u201d) reserves. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, our reserves, net of reinsurance recoverables, were $1,384.3 million and $922.4 million, respectively. We record reserves for estimated losses under insurance policies that we write and for LAE related to the investigation and settlement of policy claims. Our reserves for loss and LAE represent the estimated cost of all reported and unreported loss and LAE incurred and unpaid at any time based on known facts and circumstances. Our reserves, excluding life reserves, for loss and\nLAE incurred and unpaid are not discounted using present value factors. Our loss reserves are reviewed quarterly by internal actuaries and at least annually by our external actuaries. Reserves are based on estimates of the most likely ultimate cost of individual claims. These estimates are inherently uncertain. Judgment is required to determine the relevance of our historical experience and industry information under current facts and circumstances. The interpretation of this historical and industry data can be impacted by external forces, principally frequency and severity of future claims, the length of time needed to achieve ultimate settlement of claims, inflation of medical costs, insurance policy coverage interpretations, jury determinations and legislative changes. Accordingly, our reserves may prove to be inadequate to cover our actual losses. If we change our estimates, these changes would be reflected in our results of operations during the period in which they are made, with increases in our reserves resulting in decreases in our earnings.\nAcquisitions\nDuring 2016 and 2015, we have made the following significant acquisitions:\nProperty and Casualty:\nTable 137: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>In November 2016, we closed on the acquisition of Elara Holdings, Inc., the parent company of Direct General Corporation, a Tennessee based property and casualty insurance company ( Direct General\u201d), that predominantly writes nonstandard auto business in the Southeast. The acquisition added a direct distribution channel to our growing personal lines business. The purchase price for the transaction was approximately $162.0 million.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 138: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>In October 2016, we closed on the acquisition of Standard Property and Casualty Insurance Company (f/k/a Standard Mutual Insurance Company), an Illinois-based underwriter of personal auto and homeowners insurance in Illinois and Indiana ( SPCIC\u201d). The transaction provides us entry into these states for both homeowners and package products, and adds to our expansion of standard and preferred lines. The purchase price for the transaction was approximately $4.9 million.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 139: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>In June 2016, we closed on the acquisition of Century-National Insurance Company, a California domiciled property and casualty insurance company ( Century-National\u201d), and Western General Agency, Inc., a California corporation ( Western General\u201d), from Kramer-Wilson Company, Inc. This acquisition expands our standard and preferred product offering in both homeowners and personal auto in a key geographic area, enhancing our ability to bundle these products together and improve customer retention. The purchase price for the transaction was approximately $322.7 million.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 140: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>In October 2015, we closed on a master transaction agreement with QBE Investments (North America), Inc. ( QBE Parent\u201d) and its subsidiary, QBE Holdings, Inc. (together with QBE Parent, QBE\u201d), pursuant to which we acquired QBE's lender-placed insurance business, including certain of QBE's affiliates engaged in the lender-placed insurance business ( LPI Business\u201d). The transaction included the acquisition of certain assets, including loan-tracking systems and technology, client servicing accounts, intellectual property, and vendor relationships, as well as the assumption of the related insurance liabilities in a reinsurance transaction through which we received the loss reserves, unearned premium reserves, and invested assets. The aggregate consideration for the transaction was approximately $95.7 million.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAccident and Health:\nTable 141: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>In October 2015, we closed on the acquisition of certain business lines and assets from Assurant Health, which is a business segment of Assurant, Inc. As part of the transaction, we acquired the small group self-funded and supplemental product lines, as well as North Star Marketing Corporation, a proprietary small group sales channel (the Assurant Transaction\u201d). The purchase price was an aggregate cash payment of $14.0 million.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nPrincipal Revenue and Expense Items\nGross premium written. Gross premium written represents premium from each insurance policy that we write, including as a servicing carrier for assigned risk plans, during a reporting period based on the effective date of the individual policy, prior to ceding reinsurance to third parties.\nNet premium written. Net premium written is gross premium written less that portion of premium that we cede to third-party reinsurers under reinsurance agreements. The amount ceded under these reinsurance agreements is based on a contractual formula contained in the individual reinsurance agreement.\nChange in unearned premium. Change in unearned premium is the change in the balance of the portion of premium that we have written but have yet to earn during the relevant period because the policy is unexpired.\nNet earned premium. Net earned premium is the earned portion of our net premium written. We generally earn insurance premium on a pro rata basis over the term of the policy. At the end of each reporting period, premium written that is not earned is classified as unearned premium, which is earned in subsequent periods over the remaining term of the policy. Our policies typically have a term of six months or one year. For a six-month policy written on January 1, 2016, we would earn half of the premium in the first quarter of 2016 and the other half in the second quarter of 2016.\nCeding commission income. Ceding commission income is a commission we receive based on the earned premium ceded to third-party reinsurers to reimburse us for our acquisition, underwriting and other operating expenses. We earn commissions on reinsurance premium ceded in a manner consistent with the recognition of the earned premium on the underlying insurance policies, generally on a pro rata basis over the terms of the policies reinsured. The portion of ceding commission income which represents reimbursement of successful acquisition costs related to the underlying policies is recorded as an offset to acquisition and other underwriting expenses.\nService and fee income. We currently generate policy service and fee income from installment fees, late payment fees, and other finance and processing fees related to policy cancellation, policy reinstatement, and insufficient fund check returns. These fees are generally designed to offset expenses incurred in the administration of our insurance business, and are generated as follows. Installment fees are charged to permit a policyholder to pay premiums in installments rather than in a lump sum. Late payment fees are charged when premiums are remitted after the due date and any applicable grace periods. Policy cancellation fees are charged to policyholders when a policy is terminated by the policyholder prior to the expiration of the policy's term or renewal term, as applicable. Reinstatement fees are charged to reinstate a policy that has lapsed, generally as a result of non-payment of premiums. Insufficient fund fees are charged when the customer's payment is returned by the financial institution.\nAll fee income is recognized as follows. An installment fee is recognized at the time each policy installment bill is due. A late payment fee is recognized when the customer's payment is not received after the listed due date and any applicable grace period. A policy cancellation fee is recognized at the time the customer's policy is canceled. A policy reinstatement fee is recognized when the customer's policy is reinstated. An insufficient fund fee is recognized when the customer's payment is returned by the financial institution. The amounts charged are primarily intended to compensate us for the administrative costs associated with processing and administering policies that generate insurance premium; however, the amounts of fees charged are not dependent on the amount or period of insurance coverage provided and do not entail any obligation to return any portion of those funds. The direct and indirect costs associated with generating fee income are not separately tracked.\nWe also collect service fees in the form of commissions and general agent fees by selling policies issued by third-party insurance companies. We also collect management fees in connection with our management of the Reciprocal Exchanges. We do not bear insurance underwriting risk with respect to these policies. Commission income and general agent fees are recognized, net of an allowance for estimated policy cancellations, at the date the customer is initially billed or as of the effective date of the insurance policy, whichever is later. The allowance for estimated third-party cancellations is periodically evaluated and adjusted as necessary.\nNet investment income and realized and unrealized gains and (losses). We invest our statutory surplus funds and the funds supporting our insurance liabilities primarily in cash and cash equivalents, fixed maturities and equity securities. Our net investment income includes interest and dividends earned on our invested assets. We report net realized gains and losses on our investments separately from our net investment income. Net realized gains occur when we sell our investment securities for more than their costs or amortized costs, as applicable. Net realized losses occur when we sell our investment securities for less than their costs or amortized costs, as applicable, or we write down the investment securities as a result of other-than-temporary impairment loss. We classify our fixed maturities and equity securities as available for sale. We report net unrealized gains (losses) on those securities classified as available for sale separately in other comprehensive income (loss). Additionally, we have a small portfolio of fixed\nmaturities and equity securities classified as trading. We report realized and unrealized gains (losses) on those securities classified as trading in earnings.\nLoss and loss adjustment expenses. Loss and LAE represent our largest expense item and, for any given reporting period, include estimates of future claim payments, changes in those estimates from prior reporting periods and costs associated with investigating, defending and servicing claims. These expenses fluctuate based on the amount and types of risks we insure. We record loss and LAE related to estimates of future claim payments based on case-by-case valuations and statistical analyses. We seek to establish all reserves at the most likely ultimate exposure based on our historical claims experience. It is typical for our more serious bodily injury claims to take several years to settle, and we revise our estimates as we receive additional information about the condition of claimants and the costs of their medical treatment. Our ability to estimate loss and LAE accurately at the time of pricing our insurance policies is a critical factor in our profitability.\nAcquisition costs and other underwriting expenses. Acquisition costs and other underwriting expenses consist of policy acquisition and marketing expenses, salaries and benefits expenses. Policy acquisition expenses comprise commissions directly attributable to those agents, wholesalers or brokers that produce premiums written on our behalf and promotional fees directly attributable to our affinity relationships. Acquisition costs also include costs that are related to the successful acquisition of new or renewal insurance contracts including comprehensive loss underwriting exchange reports, motor vehicle reports, credit score checks, and policy issuance costs.\nGeneral and administrative expenses. General and administrative expenses are composed of all other operating expenses, including various departmental salaries and benefits expenses for employees that are directly involved in the maintenance of policies, information systems, and accounting for insurance transactions, and other insurance expenses such as federal excise tax, postage, telephones and Internet access charges, as well as legal and auditing fees and board and bureau charges. In addition, general and administrative expenses include those charges that are related to the amortization of tangible and intangible assets and non-insurance activities in which we engage.\nInterest expense. Interest expense represents amounts we incur on our outstanding indebtedness at the then-applicable interest rates.\nIncome tax expense. We incur federal, state and local income tax expenses as well as income tax expenses in certain foreign jurisdictions in which we operate.\nNet operating expense. These expenses consist of the sum of general and administrative expenses and acquisition costs and other underwriting expenses less ceding commission income and service and fee income.\nUnderwriting income. Underwriting income is a measure of an insurance company's overall operating profitability before items such as investment income, interest expense and income taxes. Underwriting income is calculated as net earned premium plus ceding commission income and service and fee income less loss and LAE, acquisition costs and other underwriting expenses, and general and administrative expenses.\nEquity in earnings (losses) from unconsolidated subsidiaries. This represents primarily our share in earnings or losses of our investment in four companies that own life settlement contracts, which includes the gain realized upon a mortality event and the change in fair value of the investments in life settlements as evaluated at the end of each reporting period. These unconsolidated subsidiaries determine the fair value of life settlement contracts based upon an estimate of the discounted cash flow of the anticipated death benefits incorporating a number of factors, such as current life expectancy assumptions, expected premium payment obligations and increased cost assumptions, credit exposure to the insurance companies that issued the life insurance policies and the rate of return that a buyer would require on the policies. The gain realized upon a mortality event is the difference between the death benefit received and the recorded fair value of that particular policy.\nInsurance Ratios\nNet loss ratio. The net loss ratio is a measure of the underwriting profitability of an insurance company's business. Expressed as a percentage, this is the ratio of loss and LAE incurred to net earned premium.\nNet operating expense ratio (non-GAAP). The net operating expense ratio (non-GAAP) is one component of an insurance company's operational efficiency in administering its business. Expressed as a percentage, this is the ratio of net operating expense to net earned premium.\nNet combined ratio (non-GAAP). The net combined ratio (non-GAAP) is a measure of an insurance company's overall underwriting profit. This is the sum of the net loss and net operating expense ratio (non-GAAP). If the net combined ratio (non-GAAP) is at or above 100 percent, an insurance company cannot be profitable without investment income, and may not be profitable if investment income is insufficient.\nNet operating expense ratio and net combined ratio are considered non-GAAP financial measures under applicable SEC rules because a component of those ratios, net operating expense, is calculated by offsetting acquisition costs and other underwriting expenses and general and administrative expenses by ceding commission income and service and fee income, and is therefore a non-GAAP measure. Management uses net operating expense ratio (non-GAAP) and net combined ratio (non-GAAP) to evaluate financial performance against historical results and establish targets on a consolidated basis. We believe this presentation enhances the understanding of our results by eliminating what we believe are volatile and unusual events and presenting the ratios with what we believe are the underlying run rates of the business. Other companies may calculate these measures differently, and, therefore, their measures may not be comparable to those used by the Company's management. For a reconciliation showing the total amounts by which acquisition costs and other underwriting expenses and general and administrative expenses were offset by ceding commission income and service and fee income in the calculation of net operating expense, see Results of Operations - Consolidated Results of Operations\u201d below.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur significant accounting policies are discussed in Note 2, Significant Accounting Policies\u201d in the notes to our consolidated financial statements.\nUse of estimates and assumptions. The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Our principal estimates include unpaid losses and LAE reserves; deferred acquisition costs; reinsurance recoverables, including the provision for uncollectible premiums; recording of impairment losses for other-than-temporary declines in fair value; determining the fair value of investments; determining the fair value of share-based awards for stock compensation; the valuation of intangibles and the determination of of goodwill and goodwill impairment; and income taxes. In developing the estimates and assumptions, management uses all available evidence. Because of uncertainties associated with estimating the amounts, timing and likelihood of possible outcomes, actual results could differ from estimates.\nPremiums. We recognize earned premium on a pro rata basis over the terms of the policies, generally periods of six or twelve months. Unearned premium represents the portion of premiums written applicable to the unexpired terms of the policies. Net premiums receivable represent premium written and not yet collected, net of an allowance for uncollectible premium. We regularly evaluate premium and other receivables and adjust for uncollectible amounts as appropriate. Receivables specifically identified as uncollectible are charged to expense in the period the determination is made.\nService and fee income. We currently generate policy service and fee income from installment fees, late payment fees, and other finance and processing fees related to policy cancellation, policy reinstatement, and insufficient fund check returns. These fees are generally designed to offset expenses incurred in the administration of our insurance business, and are generated as follows. Installment fees are charged to permit a policyholder to pay premiums in installments rather than in a lump sum. Late payment fees are charged when premiums are remitted after the due date and any applicable grace periods. Policy cancellation fees are charged to policyholders when a policy is terminated by the policyholder prior to the expiration of the policy's term or renewal term, as applicable. Reinstatement fees are charged to reinstate a policy that has lapsed, generally as a result of non-payment of premiums. Insufficient fund fees are charged when the customer's payment is returned by the financial institution.\nAll fee income is recognized as follows. An installment fee is recognized at the time each policy installment bill is due. A late payment fee is recognized when the customer's payment is not received after the listed due date and any applicable grace period. A policy cancellation fee is recognized at the time the customer's policy is canceled. A policy reinstatement fee is recognized when the customer's policy is reinstated. An insufficient fund fee is recognized when the customer's payment is returned by the financial institution. The amounts charged are primarily intended to compensate us for the administrative costs associated with processing and administering policies that generate insurance premium; however, the amounts of fees charged are not dependent on the amount or period of insurance coverage provided and do not entail any obligation to return any portion of those funds. The direct and indirect costs associated with generating fee income are not separately tracked. We estimate an allowance for doubtful accounts based on a percentage of fee income.\nWe also collect service fees in the form of commissions and general agent fees by selling policies issued by third-party insurance companies. We do not bear insurance underwriting risk with respect to these policies. Commission income and general agent fees are recognized, net of an allowance for estimated policy cancellations, at the date the customer is initially billed or as of the effective date of the insurance policy, whichever is later. The allowance for estimated third-party cancellations is periodically evaluated and adjusted as necessary.\nReserves for loss and loss adjustment expenses. We record reserves for estimated losses under insurance policies that we write and for LAE related to the investigation and settlement of policy claims. Our reserves for loss and LAE represent the estimated cost of all reported and unreported loss and LAE incurred and unpaid at any given point in time based on known facts and circumstances.\nLoss reserves include statistical reserves and case estimates for individual claims that have been reported and estimates for claims that have been incurred but not reported at the balance sheet date as well as estimates of the expenses associated with processing and settling all reported and unreported claims, less estimates of anticipated salvage and subrogation recoveries. Estimates are based upon past loss experience modified for current trends as well as economic, legal and social conditions. Loss reserves, except life reserves, are not discounted to present value, which would involve recognizing the time value of money and offsetting estimates of future payments by future expected investment income.\nIn establishing these estimates, we make various assumptions regarding a number of factors, including frequency and severity of claims, the length of time needed to achieve ultimate settlement of claims, inflation of medical costs, insurance policy coverage interpretations, jury determinations and legislative changes. Due to the inherent uncertainty associated with these estimates, and the cost of incurred but unreported claims, our actual liabilities may be different from our original estimates. On a quarterly basis, we review our reserves for loss and loss adjustment expenses to determine whether further adjustments are required. Any resulting adjustments are included in the current period's results. Additional information regarding the judgments and uncertainties surrounding our estimated reserves for loss and loss adjustment expenses can be found in Item 1, Business-Loss Reserves.\u201d\nReinsurance. We account for reinsurance premiums, losses and LAE ceded to other companies on a basis consistent with those used in accounting for the original policies issued and the terms of the reinsurance contracts. Earned premiums and losses and LAE incurred ceded to other companies have been recorded as a reduction of premium revenue and losses and LAE. Commissions allowed by reinsurers on business ceded have been recorded as ceding commission revenue. Ceding commission is a commission we receive based on the earned premium ceded to third-party reinsurers to reimburse us for our unallocated LAE and other operating expenses. We earn commissions on reinsurance premiums ceded in a manner consistent with the recognition of the earned premium on the underlying insurance policies, on a pro rata basis over the terms of the policies reinsured. In connection with the Personal Lines Quota Share, the amount we received is based on a contractual formula contained in the reinsurance agreements and is based on the ceded losses as a percentage of ceded premium. Reinsurance recoverables are reported based on the portion of reserves and paid losses and LAE that are ceded to other companies. Assessing whether or not a reinsurance contract meets the condition for risk transfer requires judgment. The determination of risk transfer is critical to reporting premiums and losses, and is based, in part, on the use of actuarial and pricing models and assumptions. If we determine that a reinsurance contract does not transfer sufficient risk, we account for the contract under deposit accounting.\nDeferred policy acquisition costs. Deferred acquisition costs include commissions, premium taxes, payments to affinity partners, promotional fees, and other direct sales costs that vary and are directly related to the successful acquisition of insurance policies. These costs are deferred and amortized to the extent recoverable over the policy period in which the related premiums are earned. We consider anticipated investment income in determining the recoverability of these costs. Management believes that these costs are recoverable in the near term. If management determined that these costs were not recoverable, then we could not continue to record deferred acquisition costs as an asset and would be required to establish a liability for a premium deficiency reserve.\nAssessments related to insurance premiums. We are subject to a variety of insurance-related assessments, such as assessments by state guaranty funds used by state insurance regulators to cover losses of policyholders of insolvent insurance companies and for the operating expenses of such agencies. A typical obligating event would be the issuance of an insurance policy or the occurrence of a claim. These assessments are accrued in the period in which they have been incurred. We use estimated assessment rates in determining the appropriate assessment expense and accrual. We use estimates derived from state regulators and/or National Association of Insurance Commissioners ( NAIC\u201d) Tax and Assessments Guidelines.\nUnearned premium reserves. Unearned premium reserves represent the portion of premiums written applicable to the unexpired terms of the policies.\nInvestments. We account for investments in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB\u201d) Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC\u201d) 320, Investments - Debt and Equity Securities,\u201d which requires that equity securities that have readily determinable fair values and all investments in debt securities to be segregated into categories based upon our intention for those securities. Based on our intention, we have classified our investments as available for sale or trading, with the exception of our equity and cost method investments. We may sell our available-for-sale securities in response to changes in interest rates, risk/reward characteristics, liquidity needs or other factors. Available-for-sale securities are reported at their estimated fair values based on a recognized pricing service, with unrealized gains and losses, net of tax effects, reported as a separate component of other comprehensive income in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income. Trading securities are reported at their estimated fair values with net realized and unrealized gains and losses included in earnings.\nPurchases and sales of investments are recorded on a trade date basis. Realized gains and losses are determined based on the specific identification method. Net investment income is recognized when earned and includes interest and dividend income together with amortization of market premiums and discounts using the effective yield method and is net of investment management fees and other expenses. For mortgage-backed securities and any other holdings for which there is a prepayment risk, prepayment assumptions are evaluated and revised as necessary. Any adjustments required due to the change in effective yields and maturities are recognized on a prospective basis through yield adjustments.\nWe use a set of quantitative and qualitative criteria to evaluate the necessity of recording impairment losses for other-than-temporary declines in fair value. These criteria include:\nTable 142: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the current fair value compared to amortized cost;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 143: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the length of time that the security's fair value has been below its amortized cost;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 144: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>specific credit issues related to the issuer such as changes in credit rating or non-payment of scheduled interest payments;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 145: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>whether management intends to sell the security and, if not, whether it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 146: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer of the security, including any specific events that may affect its operations or earnings;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 147: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the occurrence of a discrete credit event resulting in the issuer defaulting on a material outstanding obligation or the issuer seeking protection under bankruptcy laws; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 148: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>other items, including management, media exposure, sponsors, marketing and advertising agreements, debt restructurings, regulatory changes, acquisitions and dispositions, pending litigation, distribution agreements and general industry trends.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nImpairment of investment securities results in a charge to operations when a market decline below cost is deemed to be other-than-temporary. We immediately write down investments that we consider to be impaired based on the foregoing criteria collectively.\nIn the event of the decline in fair value of a debt security, a holder of that security that does not intend to sell the debt security and for whom it is not more likely than not that such holder will be required to sell the debt security before recovery of its amortized cost basis is required to separate the decline in fair value into (a) the amount representing the credit loss and (b) the amount related to other factors. The amount of total decline in fair value related to the credit loss shall be recognized in earnings as an other-than-temporary impairment ( OTTI\u201d) with the amount related to other factors recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss, net of tax. OTTI credit losses result in a permanent reduction of the cost basis of the underlying investment. The determination of OTTI is a subjective process, and different judgments and assumptions could affect the timing of the loss realization.\nGoodwill and intangible assets. We account for goodwill and intangible assets in accordance with ASC 350, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other.\u201d A purchase price paid that is in excess of net assets ( goodwill\u201d) arising from a business combination is recorded as an asset and is not amortized. Intangible assets with a finite life are amortized over the estimated useful life of the asset. Intangible assets with an indefinite useful life are not amortized. Goodwill and intangible assets are tested for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. If the goodwill or intangible asset is impaired, it is written down to its realizable value with a corresponding expense reflected in the consolidated statements of income.\nBusiness combinations. We account for business combinations under the acquisition method of accounting, which requires us to record assets acquired, liabilities assumed and any non-controlling interest in the acquiree at their respective fair values as of the acquisition date. We account for the insurance and reinsurance contracts under the acquisition method as new contracts, which requires us to record assets and liabilities at fair value. We adjust the fair value loss and LAE reserves by recording the acquired loss reserves based on our existing accounting policies and then discounting them based on expected reserve payout patterns using a current risk-free rate of interest. This risk-free interest rate is then adjusted based on different cash flow scenarios that use different payout and ultimate reserve assumptions deemed to be reasonably possible based upon the inherent uncertainties\npresent in determining the amount and timing of payment of such reserves. The difference between the acquired loss and LAE reserves and our best estimate of the fair value of such reserves at the acquisition date is recorded as either an intangible asset or another liability, as applicable and is amortized proportionately to the reduction in the related loss reserves (i.e., over the estimated payout period of the acquired loss and LAE reserves). We assign fair values to intangible assets acquired based on valuation techniques including the income and market approaches. We record contingent consideration at fair value based on the terms of the purchase agreement with subsequent changes in fair value recorded through earnings. The determination of fair value may require management to make significant estimates and assumptions. The purchase price is the fair value of the total consideration conveyed to the seller and we record the excess (deficiency) of the purchase price over the fair value of the acquired net assets, where applicable, as goodwill or bargain purchase gain in earnings. We expense costs associated with the acquisition of a business in the period incurred.\nNon-controlling Interest. The ownership interest in consolidated subsidiaries of non-controlling interests is reflected as non-controlling interest. Our consolidation principles also consolidate entities in which we are deemed a primary beneficiary. Non-controlling interest income or loss represents such non-controlling interests in the earnings of that entity. We consolidate the Reciprocal Exchanges as we have determined that these are variable interest entities and that we are the primary beneficiary.\nFair value of financial instruments. Our estimates of fair value for financial assets and financial liabilities are based on the framework established in ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures.\u201d The framework is based on the inputs used in valuation and gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets and requires that observable inputs be used in the valuations when available. The disclosure of fair value estimates in the ASC 820 hierarchy is based on whether the significant inputs into the valuation are observable. In determining the level of the hierarchy in which the estimate is disclosed, the highest priority is given to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs that reflect our significant market assumptions. Additionally, valuation of fixed-maturity investments is more subjective when markets are less liquid due to lack of market-based inputs, which may increase the potential that the estimated fair value of an investment is not reflective of the price at which an actual transaction could occur. Fair values of other financial instruments which are short-term in nature approximate their carrying values.\nASC 820 defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. ASC 820 clarifies that fair value should be based on the assumptions market participants would use when pricing an asset or liability and establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the information used to develop those assumptions. Additionally, ASC 820 requires an entity to consider all aspects of nonperformance risk, including the entity's own credit standing, when measuring the fair value of a liability.\nASC 820 establishes a three-level hierarchy to be used when measuring and disclosing fair value. An instrument's categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of significant input to its valuation. Following is a description of the three hierarchy levels:\nLevel 1 - Inputs are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the measurement date. Additionally, the entity must have the ability to access the active market and the quoted prices cannot be adjusted by the entity.\nLevel 2 - Inputs are other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. Level 2 inputs include quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in inactive markets for identical or similar assets or liabilities; or inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.\nLevel 3 - Unobservable inputs are supported by little or no market activity. The unobservable inputs represent management's best assumptions of how market participants would price the assets or liabilities. Generally, Level 3 assets and liabilities are valued using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies, or similar techniques that require significant judgment or estimation.\nThe availability of observable inputs can vary from financial instrument to financial instrument and is affected by a wide variety of factors, including, for example, the type of financial instrument, whether the financial instrument is new and not yet established in the marketplace, and other characteristics particular to the transaction. To the extent that valuation is based on models or inputs that are less observable or unobservable in the market, the determination of fair value requires significantly more judgment. Accordingly, the degree of judgment exercised by management in determining fair value is greatest for instruments categorized in Level 3. We use prices and inputs that are current as of the measurement date. In periods of market dislocation, the observability of prices and inputs may be reduced for many instruments. This condition could cause an instrument to be reclassified between levels.\nFor investments that have quoted market prices in active markets, we use the quoted market prices as fair value and include these prices in the amounts disclosed in the Level 1 hierarchy. We receive the quoted market prices from nationally recognized third-party pricing services ( pricing service\u201d). When quoted market prices are unavailable, we utilize the pricing service to determine an estimate of fair value. This pricing method is used, primarily, for fixed maturities. The fair value estimates provided by the pricing services are included in the Level 2 hierarchy. The pricing service utilizes evaluated pricing models that vary by asset class and incorporate available trade, bid and other market information and for structured securities, cash flow and, when available, loan performance data. The pricing service's evaluated pricing applications apply available information as applicable through processes such as benchmark curves, benchmarking of like securities, sector groupings and matrix pricing, to prepare evaluations. In addition, the pricing service uses model processes, such as the Option Adjusted Spread model, to assess interest rate impact and develop prepayment scenarios. The market inputs that the pricing service normally seeks for evaluations of securities, listed in approximate order of priority, include: benchmark yields, reported trades, broker/dealer quotes, issuer spreads, two-sided markets, benchmark securities, bids, offers and reference data including market research publications.\nWe utilize the fair values received from the pricing service to estimate fair value measurements for all our fixed maturities and equity securities. The following describes the valuation techniques we used to determine the fair value of financial instruments held as of December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015:\n\u2022U.S. Treasury and Federal Agencies - Comprised primarily of bonds issued by the U.S. Treasury. The fair values of U.S. government securities are based on quoted market prices in active markets, and are included in the Level 1 fair value hierarchy. We believe the market for U.S. government securities is an actively traded market given the high level of daily trading volume.\n\u2022States and Political Subdivision Bonds - Comprised of bonds and auction rate securities issued by U.S. states and municipal entities or agencies. The primary inputs to the valuation include quoted prices for identical or similar assets in markets that are not active, these are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. We also hold certain municipal bonds that finance economic development, infrastructure and environmental projects which do not have an active market. These bonds are valued based on non-binding broker quotes where the inputs have not been corroborated to be market observable and are classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy.\n\u2022Foreign Government - Comprised of bonds issued by foreign governments. The primary inputs to the valuation include quoted prices for identical or similar assets in markets that are not active, these are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. We also hold certain foreign government bonds that are valued based on non-binding broker quotes where the inputs have not been corroborated to be market observable and are classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy.\n\u2022Corporate Bonds - Comprised of bonds issued by corporations, public and privately placed. The fair values of short-term corporate bonds are priced using the spread above the London Interbank Offering Rate ( LIBOR\u201d) yield curve, and the fair value of long-term corporate bonds are priced using the spread above the risk-free yield curve. The spreads are sourced from broker-dealers, trade prices and the new issue market. Where pricing is unavailable from pricing services, we obtain non-binding quotes from broker-dealers. The primary inputs to the valuation include quoted prices for identical or similar assets in markets that are not active, these are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. We also hold certain structured notes and term loans that do not have an active market. These bonds are valued based on non-binding broker quotes where the inputs have not been corroborated to be market observable and are classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy.\n\u2022Mortgage and Structured Securities - Comprised of commercial and residential mortgage-backed and structured securities. The primary inputs to the valuation include quoted prices for identical or similar assets in markets that are not active, contractual cash flows, benchmark yields, prepayment speeds, collateral performance and credit spreads, these are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. We also hold certain mortgage and structured securities valued based on non-binding broker quotes received from brokers who are familiar with the investments and where the inputs have not been corroborated to be market observable, these are classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.\n\u2022Equity Securities - The pricing service utilizes market quotations for equity securities that have quoted market prices in active markets and their respective quoted prices are provided as fair value. We classified the values of these equity securities as Level 1. The pricing service also provides fair value estimates for certain equity securities whose fair value is based on observable market information rather than market quotes. We classified the value of these equity securities as Level 2. From time to time, we also hold certain equity securities that are issued by privately-held entities or direct equity investments that do not have an active market. We estimate the fair value of these securities primarily based on inputs such as third-party broker quote, issuers' book value, market multiples, and other inputs. These bonds are valued based on non-binding broker quotes where the inputs have not been corroborated to be market observable and are classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy.\n\u2022Other Investments, at fair value - Comprised of our rights to receive the Excess Servicing Spread ( ESS\u201d) related to servicing rights. We use a discounted cash flow approach to estimate their fair value. The key inputs used in the estimation of ESS include prepayment speed and discount rate. Changes in the fair value of the ESS are reported in earnings. We classified the fair value estimates of ESS as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy.\n\u2022Premiums and Other Receivables - The carrying values reported in the accompanying balance sheets for these financial instruments approximate their fair values due to the short-term nature of these assets.\n\u2022Debt - The amount reported in the accompanying balance sheets for these financial instruments represents the carrying value of our debt. We utilize a pricing service to estimate its fair value, other than our publicly traded debt.\nStock Compensation Expense. We recognize compensation expense for our share-based awards over the estimated vesting period based on estimated grant date fair value. Share-based payments include stock option grants and restricted stock units ( RSU\u201d) under our 2010 Equity Incentive Plan and our 2013 Equity Incentive Plan.\nEarnings per Share. Basic earnings per share are computed based on the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding. Dilutive earnings per share are computed using the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period adjusted for the dilutive impact of share options and restricted stock units using the treasury stock method.\nIncome Taxes. We join our subsidiaries in the filing of a consolidated federal income tax return and are party to federal income tax allocation agreements. Under the tax allocation agreements, we pay to or receive from our subsidiaries the amount, if any, by which the group's federal income tax liability was affected by virtue of inclusion of the subsidiary in the consolidated federal return. The Reciprocal Exchanges are not party to federal income tax allocation agreements but file separate tax returns annually.\nDeferred income taxes reflect the impact of temporary differences between the amount of our assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and such amounts as measured by tax laws and regulations. The deferred tax asset and liability primarily consists of book versus tax differences for earned premiums, loss and LAE reserve discounting, deferred acquisition costs, earned but unbilled premiums, and unrealized holding gains and losses on fixed maturities. We record changes in deferred income tax assets and liabilities that are associated with components of other comprehensive income, primarily unrealized investment gains and losses, directly to other comprehensive income. We include changes in deferred income tax assets and liabilities as a component of income tax expense.\nIn assessing the recoverability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that we will generate future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. Management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, tax planning strategies and projected future taxable income in making this assessment. If necessary, we establish a valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amounts that are more likely than not to be realized.\nWe recognize tax benefits only for tax positions that are more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities. Our policy is to prospectively classify accrued interest and penalties related to any unrecognized tax benefits in our income tax provision. We file our consolidated tax returns as prescribed by the tax laws of the jurisdictions in which we and our subsidiaries operate.\nResults of Operations\nConsolidated Results of Operations\nTable 149:

number of acquisitions and other transactions, including the following: (i) in 2016, the Direct General and Century-National acquisitions, the Reciprocal Exchanges deconsolidation at January 1, 2016, and subsequent consolidation at March 31, 2016, and the increase in premium volume from our 2015 acquired company Assigned Risk Solutions Ltd. ( ARS\u201d), which began being written on our paper on January 1, 2016; (ii) in 2015, the LPI Business acquisition and the Assurant Transaction; and (iii) in 2014, our personal lines reinsurance agreements with Tower Group International, Ltd. and its insurance subsidiaries (collectively, Tower\u201d), the Reciprocal Exchanges consolidation at September 14, 2014, and our purchase of certain assets from Imperial Management Corporation, including its underwriting subsidiaries, its retail agency and its managing general agency ( Imperial\u201d). Additionally, in 2013, we terminated the Personal Lines Quota Share on a run-off basis (the Quota Share Runoff\u201d). Due to these transactions, comparisons in our results of operations between 2016 and 2015, and between 2015 and 2014, are less meaningful.\nConsolidated Results of Operations for the Year Ended December 31, 2016 Compared with the Year Ended December 31, 2015\nGross premium written. Gross premium written increased by $909.8 million, or 35.1%, from $2,589.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 to $3,499.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, due to an increase of $697.7 million in premiums received from the P&C segment primarily as a result of the acquisitions of Direct General ($58.5 million) and Century-National ($140.0 million), additional premiums from the LPI Business ($249.5 million) and ARS ($74.6 million), and organic growth ($203.4 million), partially offset by the first quarter deconsolidation of the Reciprocal Exchanges ($40.8 million). Premiums received from the A&H segment increased by $212.1 million, primarily as a result of additional premiums from the Assurant Transaction ($133.7 million) and organic growth ($76.7 million).\nNet premium written. Net premium written increased by $885.1 million, or 40.5%, from $2,186.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 to $3,071.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Net premium written for the P&C segment increased by $682.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015, primarily as a result of the acquisitions of Direct General ($58.5 million) and Century-National ($122.1 million), additional premiums from the LPI Business ($238.2 million) and ARS ($74.6 million), and organic growth ($182.3 million), partially offset by the first quarter deconsolidation of the Reciprocal Exchanges ($5.5 million). Net premium written for the A&H segment increased by $202.7 million, primarily as a result of additional premiums from the Assurant Transaction ($133.7 million) and organic growth ($67.4 million).\nNet earned premium. Net earned premium increased by $864.0 million, or 40.6%, from $2,129.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 to $2,993.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase by segment was: P&C $660.8 million and A&H $203.1 million. The increase in the P&C segment was primarily attributable to the acquisitions of Direct General ($68.3 million) and Century-National ($122.4 million), additional premiums from the LPI Business ($299.4 million) and ARS ($42.5 million), and organic growth ($140.4 million), partially offset by the first quarter deconsolidation of the Reciprocal Exchanges ($24.3 million). The increase in the A&H segment was primarily due to additional premiums from the Assurant Transaction ($134.1 million) and organic growth ($66.9 million).\nCeding commission income. Ceding commission income increased from $43.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 to $45.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily driven by an increase attributable to the acquisition of Century-National, partially offset by an increase to the sliding scale adjustment on our terminated third-party quota share agreement and the first quarter deconsolidation of the Reciprocal Exchanges within our P&C segment.\nService and fee income. Service and fee income increased by $107.3 million, or 39.2%, from $273.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 to $380.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increases were attributable to our P&C segment ($67.1 million), resulting primarily from the Direct General and Century-National acquisitions, additional service and fee income from the LPI Business, ARS and organic growth; and the A&H segment ($40.1 million), primarily from the Assurant Transaction.\nThe components of service and fee income are as follows:\nTable 153: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(amounts in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commission revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>110,343\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>58,807\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>51,536\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General agent fees\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>73,484\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>76,855\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3,371\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Group health administrative fees\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>69,689\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>29,622\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>40,067\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Installment fees\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>43,460\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>32,404\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11,056\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Finance and processing fees\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>36,498\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>52,865\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(16,367\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Late payment fees\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20,226\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12,210\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,016\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Lender service fees\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16,910\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,364\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12,546\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,207\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,421\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,786\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>380,817\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>273,548\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>107,269\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nLoss and loss adjustment expense; net loss ratio. Loss and LAE increased by $576.9 million, or 41.8%, from $1,381.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 to $1,958.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily reflecting the Direct General and Century-National acquisitions; additional losses from the LPI Business, ARS and the Assurant Transaction; catastrophe losses related to hail storms that occurred in Dallas and San Antonio, Texas; floods that occurred in Louisiana; and Hurricane Matthew in the Southeast; and loss experience in our legacy domestic stop loss programs, partially offset by the first quarter deconsolidation of the Reciprocal Exchanges. The changes by segment were: P&C - increased $448.9 million and A&H - increased $128.0 million. Loss and LAE for the year ended December 31, 2016 included $13.5 million of unfavorable development on prior accident year loss and LAE reserves. The $4.2 million of unfavorable development in the P&C segment was primarily driven by higher than expected development in private passenger auto bodily injury coverage, and $9.3 million of unfavorable development in the A&H segment was primarily driven by unfavorable development in the domestic stop loss, short-term medical and European A&H policies. Our consolidated net loss ratio slightly increased from 64.9% for the year ended December 31, 2015 to 65.4% for the year ended December 31, 2016, with a higher P&C segment net loss ratio and a lower A&H segment net loss.\nAcquisition costs and other underwriting expenses. Acquisition costs and other underwriting expenses increased by $91.2 million, or 22.5%, from $405.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 to $497.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily as a result of the Direct General ($1.9 million) and Century-National ($12.0 million) acquisitions, additional costs from the LPI Business ($33.3 million), ARS ($7.3 million) and the Assurant Transaction ($23.9 million), and organic growth and other ($25.6 million), partially offset by lower costs on the Reciprocal Exchanges ($12.7 million).\nGeneral and administrative expenses. General and administrative expenses increased by $313.8 million, or 59.2%, from $530.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 to $844.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily as a result of the Direct General ($38.0 million) and Century-National ($34.4 million) acquisitions, additional expenses from the LPI Business ($148.7 million), ARS ($7.7 million) and the Assurant Transaction ($39.8 million), higher expenses on the Reciprocal Exchanges ($18.2 million), and organic growth and other ($26.8 million).\nNet operating expense; net operating expense ratio (non-GAAP). Net operating expense increased by $295.9 million, or 47.8%, from $618.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 to $914.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The consolidated net operating expense ratio, which includes the Reciprocal Exchanges, increased to 30.6% in the year ended December 31, 2016 from 29.1% in the year ended December 31, 2015. Excluding the Reciprocal Exchanges, the net operating expense ratio was 30.2% and 29.3% for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The Reciprocal Exchanges' net operating expense ratio was 41.2% and 25.1% for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nNet investment income. Net investment income increased by $24.2 million, or 32.2%, from $75.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 to $99.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily as a result of our higher amount of invested assets.\nNet realized and unrealized gain (loss) on investments. Net realized and unrealized gain (loss) on investments increased by $14.2 million from a loss of $10.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 to a $3.9 million gain for the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily from our trading activities offset by higher other-than-temporary impairments in 2016.\nBargain purchase gain and other revenue (expense). For the year ended December 31, 2016, we had a $24.3 million bargain purchase gains related to net assets acquired in excess of the purchase price paid for the acquisitions of Direct General ($7.1 million)\nand SPCIC ($17.2 million). The SPCIC transaction was sponsored by us, with the conversion of a mutual company to stock company and our offering of common stock at a discount to members, directors and officers of the acquired company.\nEquity in earnings of unconsolidated subsidiaries. Equity in earnings of unconsolidated subsidiaries, which primarily relates to our 50% interest in life settlement entities, increased by $14.8 million from $10.6 million in earnings for the year ended December 31, 2015 to $25.4 million in earnings for the year ended December 31, 2016, due to the change in fair market value of the life settlement contracts and income from our real estate investments.\nInterest expense. Interest expense for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 was $40.2 million and $28.9 million, respectively. The increase of $11.3 million is primarily due to interest under our credit facility and the promissory note issued in connection with the Century-National acquisition, partially offset by our purchase of the Reciprocal Exchanges' surplus notes.\nProvision for income taxes. Income tax expense increased by $23.7 million, or 124.8%, from $19.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, reflecting an effective tax rate of 11.5%, to $42.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, reflecting an effective tax rate of 20.3%. The primary driver of the increase in consolidated income tax expense was the increase in pre-tax income period over period. Income tax expense included a tax benefit of $5.9 million and $27.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, attributable to the reduction of the deferred tax liability associated with the equalization reserves of our Luxembourg reinsurers. The effect of this tax benefit reduced the effective tax rate for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 by 2.81% and 16.5%, respectively.\nThe increase in consolidated tax expense was primarily driven by several factors. Pre-tax income increased by 27.6% year over year. Additionally, there was a 78.2% decrease in the tax benefit attributable to the utilization of our Luxembourg equalization reserves. The effects of the Luxembourg technical reserve utilization will likely conclude in the next fiscal year. The upward trend in our effective tax rate was limited by the effects of bargain purchase gains associated with two acquisitions during 2016 as well as a reduction of the valuation allowance at the Reciprocal Exchanges. Combined these two items has a net benefit of 10.4% to the effective tax rate of the consolidated group.\nExcluding the Reciprocal Exchanges, income tax expense was $52.4 million and $24.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, reflecting effective tax rates of 26.3% and 15.9%, respectively. The Reciprocal Exchanges had pre-tax income of $10.8 million and $7.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. A full valuation allowance was recorded on the Reciprocal Exchanges at December 31, 2015. For the year ended December 31, 2016, the valuation allowance for two of the four Reciprocal Exchanges was released in full. The remaining two exchanges maintained their full valuation allowance. The valuation allowance across all exchanges was $7.1 million and $17.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nConsolidated Results of Operations for the Year Ended December 31, 2015 Compared with the Year Ended December 31, 2014\nGross premium written. Gross premium written increased by $454.6 million, or 21.3%, from $2,135.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 to $2,589.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, due to an increase of $343.1 million in premiums received from the P&C segment primarily as a result of an increase in Imperial premium ($61.0 million), the consolidation of the Reciprocal Exchanges ($209.9 million), acquisition of our LPI Business ($126.6 million) and organic growth ($75.5 million), partially offset by a decrease in our Tower business ($131.9 million) which included a large one-time unearned premium reserve assumption of $158.8 million in 2014. Premiums received from the A&H segment increased $111.5 million primarily as a result of premium from the Assurant Transaction ($55.7 million) and organic growth ($66.6 million), partially offset by a decrease in our European group life and health insurance managing general agent ( EHC\u201d) business ($10.8 million) which included a one-time unearned premium reserve assumption of $15.2 million in 2014.\nNet premium written. Net premium written increased by $316.2 million, or 16.9%, from $1,870.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 to $2,186.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. Net premium written for the P&C segment increased by $240.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the same period in 2014, primarily as a result of an increase in Imperial premium ($50.2 million), the Quota Share Runoff ($42.8 million), the consolidation of the Reciprocal Exchanges ($73.0 million), acquisition of our LPI Business ($125.7 million) and organic growth ($89.1 million), partially offset by a decrease in our Tower business ($140.6 million) which included a large one-time unearned premium reserve assumption of $158.8 million in 2014. Net premium written for the A&H segment increased by $76.0 million, primarily as a result of premium from the Assurant Transaction ($55.7 million) and organic growth ($31.0 million), partially offset by a decrease in our EHC business ($10.8 million) which included a one-time unearned premium reserve assumption of $15.2 million in 2014.\nNet earned premium.

The increase by segment was: P&C - $405.8\nmillion and A&H - $90.8 million. The increase in the P&C segment was primarily attributable to an increase in Tower premium retention ($39.0 million), the Quota Share Runoff ($42.8 million), Imperial premium ($50.8 million), the consolidation of the Reciprocal Exchanges ($87.1 million), acquisition of our LPI Business ($123.3 million) and organic growth ($62.8 million). The increase in the A&H segment was primarily due to earned premium from the Assurant Transaction ($55.8 million) and organic growth ($34.9 million).\nCeding commission income. Ceding commission income increased from $12.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 to $43.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, reflecting the consolidation of the Reciprocal Exchanges, partially offset by a decrease from the Quota Share Runoff, including a sliding scale adjustment to our terminated third-party quota share in 2015.\nService and fee income. Service and fee income increased by $105.0 million, or 62.3%, from $168.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 to $273.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase was primarily attributable to: (i) an increase of $40.4 million in service and fee income related to our A&H segment resulting from the Assurant Transaction and A&H organic growth and (ii) and an increase of $64.6 million related to our P&C segment resulting from the LPI Business acquisition and P&C organic growth.\nThe components of service and fee income are as follows:\nTable 154: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(amounts in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General agent fees\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>76,855\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>45,637\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>31,218\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commission revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>58,807\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>52,597\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,210\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Finance and processing fees\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>52,865\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13,569\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>39,296\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Installment fees\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>32,404\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>30,323\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,081\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Group health administrative fees\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>29,622\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,358\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25,264\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Late payment fees\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12,210\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11,658\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>552\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Lender service Fees\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,364\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,364\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,421\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,429\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4,008\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>273,548\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>168,571\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>104,977\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nLoss and loss adjustment expense; net loss ratio.

Loss and LAE for the year ended December 31, 2015 included $15.7 million of unfavorable development on prior accident year loss and LAE reserves ($18.4 million excluding $2.7 million of favorable development for the Reciprocal Exchanges) primarily caused by $17.2 million of A&H reserve strengthening predominantly with respect to business subject to the EHC Reinsurance Agreement and $1.2 million of unfavorable development in the P&C segment predominantly with respect to higher than expected loss emergence from commercial auto liability combined single limit insurance policies.\nOur consolidated net loss ratio, which includes the Reciprocal Exchanges, increased from 64.5% for the year ended December 31, 2014 to 64.9% for the year ended December 31, 2015 with a higher A&H segment net loss ratio resulting from higher loss experience in our domestic stop loss programs, partially offset by a lower P&C segment net loss ratio driven by product mix changes. Excluding the Reciprocal Exchanges, the net loss ratio was 64.4% and 64.7% for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The Reciprocal Exchanges' net loss ratio was 72.4% and 56.1% for the year ended December 31, 2015 and for the period ended December 31, 2014, respectively, including $2.7 million of favorable development on prior accident year loss and LAE reserves for the year ended December 31, 2015 and $1.3 million of unfavorable development on prior accident year loss and LAE reserves for the period ended December 31, 2014.\nAcquisition costs and other underwriting expenses. Acquisition costs and other underwriting expenses increased by $90.8 million, or 28.8%, from $315.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 to $405.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily due to an increase in Tower premium retention, the consolidation of the Reciprocal Exchanges, an increase resulting from the LPI Business acquisition, an increase resulting from the Assurant Transaction and as a result of organic growth, partially\noffset by the consolidation of our EHC business as all new and renewal policies placed by EHC after April 1, 2014 are underwritten by our European insurance subsidiaries.\nGeneral and administrative expenses. General and administrative expenses increased by $181.6 million, or 52.1%, from $348.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 to $530.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily as a result of an increase in Tower premium retention, the consolidation of the Reciprocal Exchanges, an increase resulting from the LPI Business acquisition, an increase resulting from the Assurant Transaction and higher organic growth.\nNet operating expense; net operating expense ratio (non-GAAP). Net operating expense increased by $136.1 million, or 28.2%, from $482.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 to $618.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The consolidated net operating expense ratio (non-GAAP), which includes the Reciprocal Exchanges, decreased to 29.1% in the year ended December 31, 2015 from 29.6% in the year ended December 31, 2014, primarily as a result of increased service and fee income and maturation of the A&H business, partially offset by increased general and administrative expenses, and increased acquisition costs and other underwriting expenses.\nExcluding the Reciprocal Exchanges, the net operating expense ratio was 29.3% and 29.6% for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The Reciprocal Exchanges' net operating expense ratio was 25.1% and 27.9% for the year ended December 31, 2015 and for the period ended December 31, 2014, respectively.\nNet investment income. Net investment income increased by $22.9 million, or 43.7%, from $52.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 to $75.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily due to an increase in average invested assets as a result of our (i) capital raising activities in the first half of 2014 and (ii) issuances of Series B preferred stock, debt and common stock during the year ended December 31, 2015.\nNet realized gain (loss) on investments. Net realized losses on investments increased by $7.4 million from a loss of $2.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 to a $10.3 million loss for the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily due to the recognition of a $15.2 million OTTI charge in the year ended December 31, 2015 relating to certain investments in the energy and natural resources sectors based on our qualitative and quantitative OTTI review as compared to a $2.2 million OTTI charge in the year ended December 31, 2014. These losses resulting from OTTI charges were partially offset by net realized gains on the sale of investments of $4.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to net realized losses on the sale of investments of $0.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nEquity in earnings (losses) of unconsolidated subsidiaries. Equity in earnings of unconsolidated subsidiaries, which primarily relates to our 50% interest in life settlement entities, increased $9.5 million, from $1.2 million in earnings for the year ended December 31, 2014 to $10.6 million in earnings for the year ended December 31, 2015, due to the change in fair market value of the life settlement contracts.\nInterest expense. Interest expense for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 was $28.9 million and $17.7 million, respectively, increasing primarily due to our (i) May 2014 issuance of $250.0 million aggregate principal amount of 6.75% Notes; (ii) August 2015 issuance of $100.0 million aggregate principal amount of 7.625% Notes; (iii) October 2015 issuance of $100.0 million aggregate principal amount of additional 6.75% Notes and (iv) the consolidation of the Reciprocal Exchanges.\nProvision for income taxes. Consolidated income tax expense, which includes the Reciprocal Exchanges, decreased by $4.9 million, or 20.6%, from $23.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, reflecting an effective tax rate of 18.7%, to $19.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, reflecting an effective tax rate of 11.5%. The primary driver of the decrease in consolidated income tax expense was an increase in tax exempt foreign income. Income tax expense included a tax benefit of $27.1 million and $21.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, attributable to the reduction of the deferred tax liability associated with the equalization reserves of our Luxembourg reinsurers. The effect of this tax benefit reduced the effective tax rate for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 by 16.5% and 16.7%, respectively.\nNGHC, excluding the Reciprocal Exchanges, had income tax expense of $24.9 million and $22.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, reflecting effective tax rates of 15.9% and 18.3%, respectively.\nThe Reciprocal Exchanges had pre-tax income of $7.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 and pre-tax income of $3.7 million for the period ended December 31, 2014, respectively. A full valuation allowance is recorded on the Reciprocal Exchanges. The Reciprocal Exchanges' valuation allowance as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 was $17.3 million and $21.5 million, respectively.\nP&C Segment - Results of Operations\nTable 155: <table><tr><td> </td>

The Reciprocal Exchanges' net operating expense ratio was 25.1% and 27.9% for the year ended December 31, 2015 and for the period ended December 31, 2014, respectively.\nUnderwriting income. Underwriting income increased from $115.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 to $137.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily as a result of an increase resulting from our LPI Business and higher organic growth. The P&C segment combined ratio, which includes the Reciprocal Exchanges, for the year ended December 31, 2015 increased to 92.8% compared to 92.3% for the same period in 2014, primarily as a result of a higher net operating expense ratio, partially offset by the improved net loss ratio. Excluding the Reciprocal Exchanges, the combined ratio was 92.5% and 92.6% for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The Reciprocal Exchanges' combined ratio was 97.5% and 84.0% for the year ended December 31, 2015 and for the period ended December 31, 2014, respectively.\nA&H Segment - Results of Operations\nTable

Our net loss ratio decreased from 81.1% for\nthe year ended December 31, 2015 to 72.2% for the year ended December 31, 2016. The loss ratio decrease in the year ended December 31, 2016, was primarily driven by our international business.\nAcquisition costs and other underwriting expenses.

The net operating expense ratio decreased from 22.8% for the year ended December 31, 2015 to 22.7% for the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily as a result of increased net earned premiums and higher service and fee income, partially offset by an increase in general and administrative expenses and acquisition costs and other underwriting expenses.\nUnderwriting income (loss). Underwriting income increased from a loss of $8.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 to income of $21.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, as a result of the Assurant Transaction, partially offset by underwriting loss in our legacy domestic and international businesses.

The loss ratio increase in the year ended December 31, 2015 was primarily driven by higher loss experience in our domestic stop loss programs.\nAcquisition costs and other underwriting expenses. Acquisition costs and other underwriting expenses increased by $11.3 million, or 20.7%, from $54.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 to $66.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily due to an increase resulting from the Assurant Transaction and as a result of organic growth, partially offset by the consolidation of our EHC business as all new and renewal policies placed by EHC after April 1, 2014 are underwritten by our European insurance subsidiaries.\nGeneral and administrative expenses. General and administrative expenses increased by $25.5 million, or 45.1%, from $56.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 to $82.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 as a result of an increase resulting from the Assurant Transaction and higher organic growth.\nNet operating expense; net operating expense ratio (non-GAAP).

Underwriting loss decreased from a loss of $18.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 to a loss of $8.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 due to maturation of the A&H business. The combined ratio for the year ended December 31, 2015 decreased to 103.9% compared to 115.2% for the same period in 2014. The combined ratio was lower due to improved profitability driven by a reduced expense ratio reflecting continued maturation of the A&H business and higher service and fee income, partially offset by a higher net loss ratio.\nInvestment Portfolio\nOur investment strategy emphasizes, first, the preservation of capital and, second, maximization of an appropriate risk-adjusted return. We seek to maximize investment returns using investment guidelines that stress prudent allocation among cash and cash equivalents, fixed maturities and, to a lesser extent, equity securities. Cash and cash equivalents include cash on deposit, commercial paper, pooled short-term money market funds and certificates of deposit with an original maturity of 90 days or less. Our fixed maturities include obligations of the U.S. Treasury or U.S. government agencies, obligations of U.S. and Canadian corporations, mortgages guaranteed by the Federal National Mortgage Association, the Government National Mortgage Association, the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, Federal Farm Credit entities, and structured securities and commercial mortgage obligations. Our equity securities include common and preferred stock of U.S. and Canadian corporations. From time to time, we also reclassify available-for-sale securities to trading securities for the purpose of buying and selling them in the near term and benefit from the change in market prices or spreads.\nThe average yield on our investment portfolio was 3.1% and 3.3% and the average duration of the portfolio was 5.08 and 5.31 years for the years ended at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nAvailable-for-Sale Securities.

December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, that account for the gross unrealized loss, none of which we deemed to be other-than-temporary impairments. Significant factors influencing our determination that none of these securities were OTTI included the length of time and/or magnitude of unrealized losses in relation to cost, the nature of the investment, the current financial condition of the issuer and its future prospects, the ability to recover to cost in the near term, and management's intent not to sell these securities and it being more likely than not that we will not be required to sell these investments before anticipated recovery of fair value to our cost basis.\nAs of December 31, 2016 and 2015, of the $2.1 million and $10.4 million, respectively, of unrealized losses related to securities in unrealized loss positions for a period of twelve or more consecutive months, none and $8.5 million, respectively, of those unrealized losses were related to securities in unrealized loss positions greater than or equal to 20% of its amortized cost or cost. The unrealized losses for securities greater than 20% were evaluated based on factors such as discounted cash flows and near-term and long-term prospects of the issue or issuer and were determined to have adequate resources to fulfill contractual obligations.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, we recognized an OTTI loss of $22.1 million, $15.2 million and $2.2 million, respectively, on investments based on our qualitative and quantitative review.\nTrading Securities.

We believe our exposure to risk associated with these investments is generally limited to the investment carrying amounts. The increase from December 31, 2015 to December 31, 2016 was to diversify our alternative investment portfolio.\nInvestment in Entities Holding Life Settlement Contracts\nA life settlement contract is a contract between the owner of a life insurance policy and a third party who obtains the ownership and beneficiary rights of the underlying life insurance policy. During 2010, we formed Tiger Capital LLC ( Tiger\u201d) with a subsidiary of AmTrust for the purpose of acquiring certain life settlement contracts. In 2011, we formed AMT Capital Alpha, LLC ( AMT Alpha\u201d) with a subsidiary of AmTrust for the purpose of acquiring additional life settlement contracts. In the first quarter of 2013, we acquired a 50% interest in AMT Capital Holdings, S.A. ( AMTCH\u201d), the other 50% of which is owned by AmTrust. We have a 50% ownership interest in each of Tiger, AMT Alpha and AMTCH (collectively, the LSC Entities\u201d). The LSC Entities may also acquire premium finance loans made in connection with the borrowers' purchase of life insurance policies that are secured by the policies. The LSC Entities acquire the underlying policies securing the loan through the borrowers' voluntary surrender of the policy in satisfaction of the loan or foreclosure.\nThe LSC Entities account for investments in life settlements in accordance with ASC 325-30, Investments in Insurance Contracts,\u201d which states that an investor shall elect to account for its investments in life settlement contracts by using either the investment method or the fair value method. The election is made on an instrument-by-instrument basis and is irrevocable. The LSC Entities have elected to account for these investments using the fair value method.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we have a 50% ownership interest in the LSC Entities that hold certain life settlement contracts, and the fair value of these contracts owned by the LSC Entities is $356.9 million, with our proportionate interest being $178.4 million. Total capital contributions of approximately $23.0 million and $1.1 million were made to the LSC Entities during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, for which we contributed approximately $11.5 million and $0.6 million, respectively, in those same periods. The LSC Entities used the contributed capital to pay premiums and purchase policies.\nAs of December 31, 2016, the face value amounts of the 254 life insurance policies disclosed in the table below was approximately $1.6 billion. As of December 31, 2016, the LSC Entities owned no premium finance loans. The following table describes details of our investment in LSC Entities as of December 31, 2016. This table shows the gross amounts for the portfolio of life insurance policies owned by the LSC Entities, in which we and AmTrust each own a 50% interest.\nTable 173: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(amounts in thousands, except number of life settlement contracts)\nExpected Maturity Term in Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Number of\nLife Settlement\nContracts\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Fair Value(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Face Value\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>As of December 31, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>0 - 1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>1 - 2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,873\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2 - 3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>39,495\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>63,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>3 - 4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>37,436\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>75,422\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>4 - 5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>34,003\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>82,900\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Thereafter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>225\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>237,049\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,405,414\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>254\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>356,856\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,639,236\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 174: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>The LSC Entities determined the fair value as of December 31, 2016 based on 236 policies out of 254 policies, as the LSC Entities assigned no value to 18 of the policies as of December 31, 2016. The LSC Entities estimated the fair value of a life insurance policy using a cash flow model with an appropriate discount rate. In some cases, the cash flow model calculates the value of an individual policy to be negative, and therefore the fair value of the policy is zero as no liability exists when a negative value is calculated. The LSC Entities are not contractually bound to pay the premium on its life settlement contracts and, therefore, would not pay a willing buyer to assume title of these contracts. Additionally, certain of the LSC Entities' acquired policies were structured to have low premium payments at inception of the policy term, which later escalate greatly towards the tail end of the policy term. At the current time, the LSC Entities expense all premiums paid, even on policies with zero fair value. Once the premium payments escalate, the LSC Entities may allow the policies to lapse. In the event that death benefits are realized in the time frame between initial acquisition and premium escalation, it is a benefit to cash flow of the LSC Entities.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor the contracts where the LSC Entities determined the fair value to be negative and therefore assigned a fair value of zero, the table below details the amount of premiums paid and the death benefits received for the year ended December 31, 2016:\nTable 175: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(amounts in thousands, except number of life settlement contracts)\n</td> <td>December 31, 2016\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Number of policies with a negative value from discounted cash flow model\n</td> <td>18\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Premiums paid for the year ended\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,640\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Death benefit received\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nPremiums to be paid by the LSC Entities, in which we have 50% ownership interests, for each of the five succeeding fiscal years to keep the life insurance policies in force as of December 31, 2016, are as follows:\nTable 176: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(amounts in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Premiums\nDue on Life\nSettlement\nContracts\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>61,518\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>49,683\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>50,396\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>46,632\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>43,223\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Thereafter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>503,818\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>755,270\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor additional information about the fair value of the life settlement contracts, see Note 6, Equity Investments in Unconsolidated Subsidiaries\u201d in the notes to our consolidated financial statements. For additional information about the risks inherent in determining the fair value of the portfolio of life insurance policies, see Item 1A, Risk Factors-Risks Relating to Our Business Generally-A portion of our financial assets consists of life settlement contracts that are subject to certain risks.\u201d\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWe are organized as a holding company with twenty-two domestic insurance company subsidiaries, various foreign insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries, as well as various other non-insurance subsidiaries. Our principal sources of operating funds are premiums, service and fee income, investment income and proceeds from sales and maturities of investments. The primary sources of cash for the management companies of the Reciprocal Exchanges are management fees for acting as the attorneys-in-fact for the exchanges. Our primary uses of operating funds include payments of claims and operating expenses. Currently, we pay claims using cash flow from operations and invest our excess cash primarily in fixed-maturity and, to a lesser extent, equity securities. Except as set forth below, we expect that projected cash flows from operations, as well as the net proceeds from our debt and equity issuances, will provide us with sufficient liquidity to fund our anticipated growth by providing capital to increase the surplus of our insurance subsidiaries, as well as to pay claims and operating expenses, and to pay interest and principal on debt and debt facilities and other holding company expenses for the foreseeable future. However, if our growth attributable to potential acquisitions, internally generated growth, or a combination of these factors, exceeds our expectations, we may have to raise additional capital. If we cannot obtain adequate capital on favorable terms or at all, we may be unable to support future growth or operating requirements and, as a result, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. To support our current and future policy writings, we have recently raised substantial capital using a combination of debt and equity, and we may raise additional capital over the next twelve months.\nWe may generate liquidity through the issuance of debt or equity securities or financing through borrowings under credit facilities, or a combination thereof. We also have a $225.0 million credit agreement, under which there was $50.0 million outstanding as of December 31, 2016. The proceeds of borrowings under the credit agreement may be used for working capital, acquisitions and general corporate purposes. See Revolving Credit Agreement\u201d below.\nOur insurance subsidiaries are subject to statutory and regulatory restrictions imposed on insurance companies by their place of domicile which limit the amount of cash dividends or distributions that they may pay to us unless special permission is received from the insurance regulator of the relevant domicile. The aggregate limit imposed by the various domiciliary regulatory authorities of our insurance subsidiaries was approximately $397.1 million and $360.1 million as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, taking into account dividends paid in the prior twelve month periods. During the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, there were $29.5 million, $23.8 million and $12.0 million, respectively, of dividends and return of capital paid by our insurance subsidiaries to their parent company or National General Holdings Corp.\nWe forecast claim payments based on our historical experience. We seek to manage the funding of claim payments by actively managing available cash and forecasting cash flows on both a short-term and long-term basis. Cash payments for claims were $1,794.9 million, $1,276.3 million and $866.0 million in the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Historically, we have funded claim payments from cash flow from operations (principally premiums), net of amounts ceded to our third-party reinsurers. We presently expect to maintain sufficient cash flow from operations to meet our anticipated claim obligations and operating and capital expenditure needs. Our cash and investment portfolio has increased from $1,998.7 million at December 31, 2014 to $2,893.6 million at December 31, 2015 and increased to $3,768.7 million at December 31, 2016. We do not anticipate selling securities in our investment portfolio to pay claims or to fund operating expenses. Should circumstances arise that would require us to do so, we may incur losses on such sales, which would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition and could reduce investment income in future periods.\nPursuant to a tax allocation agreement by and among us and certain of our direct and indirect subsidiaries, we compute and pay federal income taxes on a consolidated basis. Each subsidiary party to this agreement computes and pays to us its respective share of the federal income tax liability primarily based on separate return calculations.\nThe LSC Entities in which we own a 50% interest also purchase life settlement contracts that require the LSC Entities to make premium payments on individual life insurance policies in order to keep the policies in force. We presently expect to maintain sufficient cash flow to make future capital contributions to the LSC Entities to permit them to make future premium payments.\nThe following table is a summary of our statement of cash flows:\nTable 177: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(amounts in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash and cash equivalents provided by (used in):\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>315,414\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>316,064\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>388,731\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(462,041\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(720,647\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(656,484\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>155,436\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>554,588\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>324,758\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5,186\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(343\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,787\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net increase in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,623\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>149,662\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>58,792\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nComparison of Years Ended December 31, 2016 and 2015\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $315.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared with $316.1 million provided by operating activities for the same period in 2015.

Deferred acquisition costs increased $60.4 million compared to December 31, 2015, primarily due to the acquisition of Century-National, increased deferred acquisition costs in our P&C segment and the Reciprocal Exchanges. Prepaid reinsurance premiums increased $28.6 million compared to December 31, 2015, primarily due to the acquisition of Century-National, increased prepaid reinsurance premiums in our P&C segment and the Reciprocal Exchanges. Goodwill and Intangible assets, net increased $161.7 million compared to December 31, 2015, primarily due to the acquisitions of Direct General and Century-National, acquired renewal rights and the Reciprocal Exchanges.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, Unpaid loss and loss adjustment expense reserves increased by $509.4 million compared to December 31, 2015, primarily due to the acquisitions of Direct General and Century-National, increased ARS premium and catastrophe losses within our P&C segment, and the increase in incurred-but-not-reported claims in our A&H segment. Unearned premiums increased $443.1 million compared to December 31, 2015, primarily due to the acquisitions of Direct General, SPCIC and Century-National, increased ARS premium volume which is now written on our paper, increased organic growth and the Reciprocal Exchanges, partially offset by a decrease in our LPI Business. Debt increased by $260.5 million compared to December 31, 2015, due to borrowings under our credit facility loan, the promissory note issued in connection with our acquisition of Century-National, debt acquired from our recent acquisitions: Direct General and SPCIC, partially offset by our purchase of the Reciprocal Exchanges' surplus notes. Other liabilities increased $57.5 million compared to December 31, 2015, primarily due to the acquisitions of Direct General and Century-National, increases in premium tax reserves and outstanding in process disbursements.\nReinsurance\nOur insurance subsidiaries utilize reinsurance agreements to transfer portions of the underlying risk of the business we write to various affiliated and third-party reinsurance companies. Reinsurance does not discharge or diminish our obligation to pay claims covered by the insurance policies we issue; however, it does permit us to recover certain incurred losses from our reinsurers and our reinsurance recoveries reduce the maximum loss that we may incur as a result of a covered loss event. We believe it is important to ensure that our reinsurance partners are financially strong and they generally carry at least an A.M. Best rating of A-\u201d (Excellent) or are fully collateralized at the time we enter into our reinsurance agreements. We also enter reinsurance relationships with third-party captives formed by agents as a mechanism for sharing risk and profit. The total amount, cost and limits relating to the reinsurance coverage we purchase may vary from year to year based upon a variety of factors, including the availability of quality reinsurance at an acceptable price and the level of risk that we choose to retain for our own account.\nWe assume and cede insurance risks under various reinsurance agreements, on both a pro rata basis and an excess of loss basis. We purchase reinsurance to mitigate the volatility of direct and assumed business, which may be caused by the aggregate value or the concentration of written exposures in a particular geographic area or business segment and may arise from catastrophes or other events. As part of our overall risk and capacity management strategy, we purchase excess of loss catastrophic and casualty reinsurance for protection against catastrophic events and other large losses. The property catastrophe program provides a total of $475.0 million in coverage in excess of a $50.0 million retention, with one reinstatement. Included in this coverage is a Florida Hurricane Catastrophic Fund ( FHCF\u201d) cover of $52.2 million in excess of $16.3 million with no reinstatement. The casualty program provides $45.0 million in coverage in excess of a $5.0 million retention. We pay a premium as consideration for ceding the risk.\nOur reinsurance transactions include premiums written under state-mandated involuntary plans for commercial vehicles and premiums ceded to state-provided reinsurance facilities such as the Michigan Catastrophic Claims Association (the MCCA\u201d), and the North Carolina Reinsurance Facility (the NCRF\u201d) (collectively, State Plans\u201d), for which we retain no loss indemnity risk. Prepaid reinsurance premiums are earned on a pro rata basis over the period of risk, based on a daily earnings convention, which is consistent with premiums written.\nAll automobile insurers doing business in Michigan are required to participate in the MCCA. The MCCA is a reinsurance mechanism that covers no-fault first party medical losses of retentions in excess of a set limit. Insurers are reimbursed for their covered losses in excess of a $545,000 threshold for policies effective after July 1, 2015 through June 30, 2017. We currently have claims with retentions ranging from $250,000 to $545,000. Funding for the MCCA comes from assessments against automobile insurers based upon their share of insured automobiles in the state. Insurers are allowed to pass along this cost to Michigan automobile policyholders.\nThe following is a summary of premium and related losses ceded to the MCCA for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014:\nTable 181: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Year Ended December 31, (amounts in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Ceded earned premiums\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>9,404\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>12,146\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>12,968\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Ceded Loss and LAE\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26,510\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15,482\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12,529\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nReinsurance recoverables from the MCCA as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 are as follows:\nTable 182: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>December 31, (amounts in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Reinsurance recoverable on paid losses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,969\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,986\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Reinsurance recoverable on unpaid losses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>663,943\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>656,904\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe NCRF is a non-profit organization established to provide automobile liability reinsurance to those insurance companies that write automobile insurance in North Carolina. Companies licensed to write automobile insurance in the state must be members of the NCRF and must offer liability coverage to any eligible North Carolina resident applicant for coverages and limits which may be ceded to the NCRF. The NCRF accepts cession of liability for bodily injury and property damage, medical payments, uninsured and combined uninsured/underinsured motorist coverages. Funding for the NCRF comes from premiums collected from automobile insurers based upon the amounts of coverage provided with respect to insured automobiles in the state. North Carolina law provides that cumulative losses incurred by the NCRF are recoverable either through direct surcharges to North Carolina motorists or indirectly by assessments of member companies, which recoup the costs from individual policyholders.\nThe following is a summary of premium and related losses ceded to the NCRF for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014:\nTable 183: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Year Ended December 31, (amounts in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Ceded earned premiums\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>165,491\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>158,613\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>151,744\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Ceded Loss and LAE\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>173,926\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>144,350\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>130,265\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nReinsurance recoverables from the NCRF as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 are as follows:\nTable 184: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>December 31, (amounts in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Reinsurance recoverable on paid losses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>29,274\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>26,228\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Reinsurance recoverable on unpaid losses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100,470\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>86,941\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe believe that we are unlikely to incur any material loss as a result of non-payment of amounts owed to us by the MCCA and the NCRF because the payment obligations are extended over many years, resulting in relatively small current payment obligations; both the MCCA and the NCRF are supported by assessments permitted by statute; and we have not historically incurred losses as a result of non-payment by either MCCA or NCRF. Accordingly, we believe that we have no significant exposure to uncollectible reinsurance balances from these entities.\nIn addition to the reinsurance programs described above, until July 31, 2013, we used the Personal Lines Quota Share reinsurance arrangement to limit our maximum loss, provide greater diversification of risk and minimize exposure on larger risks. For further discussion on the Personal Lines Quota Share arrangement. (See Note 18, Related Party Transactions\u201d in the notes to our consolidated financial statements).\nWe have a concentration of credit risk associated with the MCCA, the NCRF and the reinsurance under the Personal Lines Quota Share arrangement. Reinsurance recoverables on unpaid losses from these entities at December 31, 2016 and 2015 are as follows:\nTable 185: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>December 31, (amounts in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>A.M.\nBest\nRating\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>MCCA\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>663,943\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>656,904\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/R\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>NCRF\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100,470\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>86,941\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/R\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Maiden Insurance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12,995\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21,075\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>A\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>ACP Re\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,797\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12,645\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>N/R\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Technology Insurance Company, Inc.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,197\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,430\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>A\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other reinsurers' balances - each less than 5% of total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>48,203\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,096\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Subtotal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>838,605\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>794,091\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Reciprocal Exchanges\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>42,192\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>39,085\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>880,797\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>833,176\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe have reinsurance with ACP Re and Maiden Insurance that requires the reinsurers to provide collateral to mitigate any risk of default. As of December 31, 2016, ACP Re and Maiden Insurance had provided collateral in the amounts of $0.8 million and $13.3 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2015, ACP Re and Maiden Insurance had provided collateral in the amounts of $18.7 million and $30.8 million, respectively.\nAs of July 1, 2016, a reinsurance property catastrophe excess of loss program went into effect protecting the Reciprocal Exchanges against accumulations of losses resulting from a catastrophic event. The program provides a total of $355.0 million in coverage in excess of a $20.0 million retention, with one reinstatement.\n7.625% Subordinated Notes due 2055\nOn August 18, 2015, we sold $100.0 million aggregate principal amount of our 7.625% subordinated notes due 2055 (the 7.625% Notes\u201d) in a public offering. The net proceeds we received from the issuance was approximately $96.6 million, after deducting the underwriting discount, commissions and expenses.\nThe 7.625% Notes bear interest at a rate equal to 7.625% per year, payable quarterly in arrears on March 15, June 15, September 15 and December 15 of each year, beginning on December 15, 2015.

In addition, the 7.625% Notes are structurally subordinated to all existing and future indebtedness, liabilities and other obligations of our subsidiaries. The 7.625% Notes mature on September 15, 2055, unless earlier redeemed or purchased by us.

The indenture also includes covenants relating to the incurrence of debt if our consolidated leverage ratio would exceed 0.35 to 1.00, a limitation on liens, a limitation on the disposition of stock of certain of our subsidiaries and a limitation on transactions with certain of our affiliates. We were in compliance with all covenants contained in the indenture as of December 31, 2016.\n6.75% Notes due 2024\nOn May 23, 2014, we sold $250.0 million aggregate principal amount of our 6.75% Notes due 2024 (the 6.75% Notes\u201d) to certain purchasers in a private placement.

The 6.75% Notes are our general unsecured obligations and rank equally in right of payment with our other existing and future senior unsecured indebtedness and senior in right of payment to any of our indebtedness that is contractually subordinated to the 6.75% Notes. The 6.75% Notes are also effectively subordinated to any of our existing and future secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the collateral securing such indebtedness and are structurally subordinated to the existing and future indebtedness of our subsidiaries (including trade payables). The 6.75% Notes mature on May 15, 2024, unless earlier redeemed or purchased by us.\nOn October 8, 2015, we sold an additional $100.0 million aggregate principal amount of our 6.75% Notes to certain purchasers in a private placement. The additional 6.75% Notes bear interest at a rate equal to 6.75% per year, payable semiannually in arrears on May 15 and November 15 of each year, beginning on November 15, 2015. The additional 6.75% Notes mature on May 15, 2024, unless earlier redeemed or purchased by us.

The additional 6.75% Notes were issued under the same indenture as the original 6.75% Notes. Interest expense on the 6.75% Notes, including the additional issuance, for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 was $23.6 million and $18.4 million, respectively.\nThe indenture contains customary covenants, such as reporting of annual and quarterly financial results, and restrictions on certain mergers and consolidations. The indenture also includes covenants relating to the incurrence of debt if our consolidated leverage ratio would exceed 0.35 to 1.00, a limitation on liens, a limitation on the disposition of stock of certain of our subsidiaries and a limitation on transactions with certain of our affiliates. We were in compliance with all covenants contained in the indenture as of December 31, 2016.\nRevolving Credit Agreement\nOn January 25, 2016, we entered into a $225.0 million credit agreement (the Credit Agreement\u201d), among JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as Administrative Agent, KeyBank National Association as Syndication Agent, and Associated Bank, National Association and First Niagara Bank, N.A., as Co-Documentation Agents, and the various lending institutions party thereto. The credit facility is a revolving credit facility with a letter of credit sublimit of $112.5 million and an expansion feature not to exceed $50.0 million. Proceeds of borrowings under the Credit Agreement may be used for working capital, acquisitions and general corporate purposes. The Credit Agreement has a maturity date of January 25, 2020.\nThe Credit Agreement contains certain restrictive covenants customary for facilities of this type (subject to negotiated exceptions and baskets), including restrictions on indebtedness, liens, acquisitions and investments, restricted payments and dispositions. There are also financial covenants that require us to maintain a minimum consolidated net worth, a maximum consolidated leverage ratio, a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio, a minimum risk-based capital and a minimum statutory surplus. The Credit Agreement also provides for customary events of default, with grace periods where customary, including failure to pay principal when due, failure to pay interest or fees within three business days after becoming due, failure to comply with covenants, breaches of representations and warranties, default under certain other indebtedness, certain insolvency or receivership events affecting us and our subsidiaries, the occurrence of certain material judgments, or a change in control of the Company. Upon the occurrence and during the continuation of an event of default, the administrative agent, upon the request of the requisite percentage of the lenders, may terminate the obligations of the lenders to make loans and to issue letters of credit under the Credit Agreement, declare the Company's obligations under the Credit Agreement to become immediately due and payable and/or exercise any and all remedies and other rights under the Credit Agreement.\nBorrowings under the Credit Agreement bear interest at either the Alternate Base Rate ( ABR\u201d) or LIBOR. ABR borrowings (which are borrowings bearing interest at a rate determined by reference to the ABR) under the Credit Agreement will bear interest at (x) the greatest of (a) the prime rate in effect on such day, (b) the federal funds effective rate on such day plus 0.5 percent or (c) the adjusted LIBOR for a one-month interest period on such day plus 1.0 percent. Eurodollar borrowings under the Credit Agreement will bear interest at the adjusted LIBOR for the interest period in effect. Fees payable by us under the Credit Agreement include a letter of credit participation fee (the margin applicable to Eurodollar borrowings), a letter of credit fronting fee with respect to each letter of credit (0.125%) and a commitment fee on the available commitments of the lenders (a range of 0.20% to 0.30% based on our consolidated leverage ratio, and which rate was 0.30% as of December 31, 2016).\nOn May 31, 2016, we borrowed $50.0 million under the Credit Agreement, Eurodollar borrowings was elected for interest rate. Interest payments are due the last day of the interest period in intervals of three months duration, commencing on the date of such borrowing. The borrowing bears interest at the adjusted LIBOR rate which was 3.5625% as of December 31, 2016. Interest expense on the Credit Agreement for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $0.9 million. We were in compliance with all covenants under the Credit Agreement as of December 31, 2016.\nCentury-National Promissory Note\nOn June 1, 2016, in connection with the closing of our acquisition of all of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of Century-National and Western General, we issued a promissory note ( Century-National Promissory Note\u201d) in the approximate amount of $178.9 million to the seller to fund a portion of the purchase price for the acquisition. The Century-National Promissory Note is unsecured and has a two-year term. Principal on the Century-National Promissory Note is payable in two equal installments of approximately $89.4 million on June 1, 2017 and 2018, respectively. Interest on the outstanding principal balance of the Century-National Promissory Note accrues at an annual rate of 4.4% and is payable in arrears on each of the two payment dates. The Century-National Promissory Note may be prepaid at any time, without penalty. The Century-National Promissory Note contains a cross-acceleration provision that is triggered in the event that payment under our $225.0 million Credit Agreement is accelerated and such acceleration is not revoked, rescinded or withdrawn within 30 days of such acceleration. The Century-National Promissory Note also contains customary events of default. Interest expense on the Century-National Promissory Note for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $4.6 million.\nCommon Stock\nOn February 19, 2014, we sold 13,570,000 shares of common stock in a private placement in reliance on exemptions from registration under the Securities Act of 1933 at a price of $14.00 per share, subject to a placement fee of $0.840 per share. We recorded the cost of obtaining new capital as a reduction of the related proceeds. The cost of issuance of stock of approximately $12.1 million was charged directly to additional paid-in capital. The net proceeds to us after expenses were approximately $177.8 million.\nOn August 18, 2015, we issued 11,500,000 shares of common stock in a public offering, including 1,500,000 shares issued pursuant to the underwriters' over-allotment option. The common stock offering was priced to the public at $19.00 per share, resulting in net proceeds of $210.9 million, after deducting underwriting discount, but before expenses.

Dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock when, as and if declared by our Board of Directors (the Board\u201d) or a duly authorized committee of the Board, will be payable on the liquidation preference amount of $25.00 per share, on a non-cumulative basis, quarterly in arrears on the 15th day of January, April, July and October of each year (each, a dividend payment date\u201d), commencing on October 15, 2014, at an annual rate of 7.50%. Dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock are not cumulative. Accordingly, in the event dividends are not declared on the Series A Preferred Stock for payment on any dividend payment date, then those dividends will not accumulate and will not be payable. If we have not declared a dividend before the dividend payment date for any dividend period, we will have no obligation to pay dividends for that dividend period, whether or not dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock are declared for any future dividend payment. The net proceeds we received from the issuance was approximately $53.2 million, after deducting the underwriting discount and issuance expenses.\nSeries B Preferred Stock\nOn March 27, 2015, we completed a public offering of 6,000,000 of our depositary shares, each representing a 1/40th interest in a share of our 7.50% Non-Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series B, $0.01 par value per share (the Series B Preferred Stock\u201d), with a liquidation preference of $1,000 per share (equivalent to $25 per depositary share). Each depositary share entitles the holder to a proportional fractional interest in all rights and preferences of the Series B Preferred Stock represented thereby (including any dividend, liquidation, redemption and voting rights). Dividends on the Series B Preferred Stock represented by the depositary shares will be payable on the liquidation preference amount, on a non-cumulative basis, when, as and if declared by our Board of Directors, at a rate of 7.50% per annum, quarterly in arrears, on January 15, April 15, July 15, and October 15 of each year, beginning on July 15, 2015, from and including the date of original issuance. The Series B Preferred Stock represented by the depositary shares is not redeemable prior to April 15, 2020. After that date, we may redeem at our option, in whole or in part, the Series B Preferred Stock represented by the depositary shares at a redemption price of $1,000 per share (equivalent to $25 per depositary share) plus any declared and unpaid dividends for prior dividend periods and accrued but unpaid dividends (whether or not declared) for the then current dividend period. A total of 6,000,000 depositary shares (equivalent to 150,000 shares of Series B Preferred Stock) were issued. Net proceeds from this offering were $145.3 million. We incurred $5.0 million in underwriting discount and commissions and expenses, which were recognized as a reduction to additional paid-in capital.\nOn April 6, 2015, the underwriters exercised their over-allotment option with respect to an additional 600,000 depositary shares (equivalent to 15,000 shares of Series B Preferred Stock), on the same terms and conditions as the original March 27, 2015 issuance.

We incurred approximately $6.5 million in underwriting discounts, commissions and expenses, which were recognized as a reduction to additional paid-in capital.\nACP Re Credit Agreement\nOn July 28, 2016, NG Re Ltd., a subsidiary of the Company, AmTrust and its wholly-owned subsidiary AmTrust International Insurance, Ltd. ( AIIL\u201d), entered into a restatement agreement (the Restatement Agreement\u201d) to the ACP Re Credit Agreement, dated September 15, 2014, among AmTrust, as Administrative Agent, ACP Re, ACP Re Holdings, LLC, as Guarantor, and AIIL and NG Re Ltd., as Lenders.\nOn September 20, 2016, the terms of the Restatement Agreement became effective altering the original terms of the ACP Re Credit Agreement principally by changing the borrower from ACP Re to ACP Re Holdings, LLC, lengthening the maturity date, reducing the interest rate and improving the credit profile. Such modification of terms was deemed to be a troubled debt restructuring under GAAP. Based on the maintenance covenant within the Restatement Agreement, we possess a collateral interest of at least 115% of the $125.0 million outstanding balance. At December 31, 2016, management determined no write down or reserve in the carrying value of the loan was required as a result of the new terms of the Restatement Agreement.

Inflation in excess of the levels we have assumed could cause loss and LAE to be higher than we anticipated, which would require us to increase reserves and reduce earnings.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This Form 10-K contains certain forward-looking statements that are intended to be covered by the safe harbors created by The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. See Note on Forward-Looking Statements.\u201d\nOverview\nWe are a specialty personal lines insurance holding company. Through our subsidiaries, we provide a variety of insurance products, including personal and commercial automobile, homeowners, umbrella, recreational vehicle, motorcycle, lender-placed, supplemental health and other niche insurance products. We sell insurance products with a focus on underwriting profitability through a combination of our customized and predictive analytics and our technology driven low cost infrastructure.\nWe manage our business through two segments: Property and Casualty ( P&C\u201d) and Accident and Health ( A&H\u201d). We transact business primarily through our twenty-two regulated domestic insurance subsidiaries: Integon Casualty Insurance Company, Integon General Insurance Corporation, Integon Indemnity Corporation, Integon National Insurance Company ( Integon National\u201d), Integon Preferred Insurance Company, New South Insurance Company, MIC General Insurance Corporation, National General Insurance Company, National General Assurance Company, National General Insurance Online, Inc., National Health Insurance Company, National General Premier Insurance Company, Imperial Fire and Casualty Insurance Company, Agent Alliance Insurance Company, Century-National Insurance Company, Standard Property and Casualty Insurance Company, Direct General Insurance Company, Direct General Insurance Company of Louisiana, Direct General Insurance Company of Mississippi, Direct General Life Insurance Company, Direct Insurance Company and Direct National Insurance Company. Our insurance subsidiaries that are part of our intercompany quota share agreement to Integon National, have an A-\u201d (Excellent) group rating by A.M. Best, subject to transition periods in the case of acquired companies. We currently conduct a limited amount of business outside the United States, primarily in Bermuda, Luxembourg and Sweden.\nThe operating results of property and casualty insurance companies are subject to quarterly and yearly fluctuations due to the effect of competition on pricing, the frequency and severity of losses, the effect of weather and natural disasters on losses, general economic conditions, the general regulatory environment in states in which an insurer operates, state regulation of premium rates, changes in fair value of investments, and other factors such as changes in tax laws. The property and casualty industry has been highly cyclical with periods of high premium rates and shortages of underwriting capacity followed by periods of severe price competition and excess capacity. While these cycles can have a large impact on a company's ability to grow and retain business, we have sought to focus on niche markets and regions where we are able to maintain premium rates at generally consistent levels and maintain underwriting discipline throughout these cycles. We believe that the nature of our P&C insurance products, including their relatively low limits, the relatively short duration of time between when claims are reported and when they are settled, and the broad geographic distribution of our customers, have allowed us to grow and retain our business throughout these cycles. In addition, we have limited our exposure to catastrophe losses through reinsurance. With regard to seasonality, we tend to experience higher claims and claims expense in our P&C segment during periods of severe or inclement weather.\nWe evaluate our operations by monitoring key measures of growth and profitability, including net loss ratio, net combined ratio (non-GAAP) and operating leverage. We target a net combined ratio (non-GAAP) between 90% and 95% while seeking to maintain optimal operating leverage in our insurance subsidiaries commensurate with our A.M. Best rating objectives. To achieve our targeted net combined ratio (non-GAAP) we continually seek ways to reduce our operating costs and lower our expense ratio. For the year ended December 31, 2016, our operating leverage (the ratio of net earned premium to average total stockholders' equity) was 1.7x, which was within our planned target operating leverage of between 1.5x and 2.0x.\nInvestment income is also an important part of our business. Because we often do not settle claims until several months or longer after we receive the original policy premiums, we are able to invest cash from premiums for significant periods of time. We invest our capital and surplus in accordance with state and regulatory guidelines. Our net investment income was $99.6 million, $75.3 million and $52.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. We held 5.8% and 7.8%, of total invested assets in cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nOur most significant balance sheet liability is our unpaid loss and loss adjustment expense ( LAE\u201d) reserves. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, our reserves, net of reinsurance recoverables, were $1,384.3 million and $922.4 million, respectively. We record reserves for estimated losses under insurance policies that we write and for LAE related to the investigation and settlement of policy claims. Our reserves for loss and LAE represent the estimated cost of all reported and unreported loss and LAE incurred and unpaid at any time based on known facts and circumstances. Our reserves, excluding life reserves, for loss and\nLAE incurred and unpaid are not discounted using present value factors. Our loss reserves are reviewed quarterly by internal actuaries and at least annually by our external actuaries. Reserves are based on estimates of the most likely ultimate cost of individual claims. These estimates are inherently uncertain. Judgment is required to determine the relevance of our historical experience and industry information under current facts and circumstances. The interpretation of this historical and industry data can be impacted by external forces, principally frequency and severity of future claims, the length of time needed to achieve ultimate settlement of claims, inflation of medical costs, insurance policy coverage interpretations, jury determinations and legislative changes. Accordingly, our reserves may prove to be inadequate to cover our actual losses. If we change our estimates, these changes would be reflected in our results of operations during the period in which they are made, with increases in our reserves resulting in decreases in our earnings.\nAcquisitions\nDuring 2016 and 2015, we have made the following significant acquisitions:\nProperty and Casualty:\n \u2022 In November 2016, we closed on the acquisition of Elara Holdings, Inc., the parent company of Direct General Corporation, a Tennessee based property and casualty insurance company ( Direct General\u201d), that predominantly writes nonstandard auto business in the Southeast. The acquisition added a direct distribution channel to our growing personal lines business. The purchase price for the transaction was approximately $162.0 million. \n \u2022 In October 2016, we closed on the acquisition of Standard Property and Casualty Insurance Company (f/k/a Standard Mutual Insurance Company), an Illinois-based underwriter of personal auto and homeowners insurance in Illinois and Indiana ( SPCIC\u201d). The transaction provides us entry into these states for both homeowners and package products, and adds to our expansion of standard and preferred lines. The purchase price for the transaction was approximately $4.9 million. \n \u2022 In June 2016, we closed on the acquisition of Century-National Insurance Company, a California domiciled property and casualty insurance company ( Century-National\u201d), and Western General Agency, Inc., a California corporation ( Western General\u201d), from Kramer-Wilson Company, Inc. This acquisition expands our standard and preferred product offering in both homeowners and personal auto in a key geographic area, enhancing our ability to bundle these products together and improve customer retention. The purchase price for the transaction was approximately $322.7 million. \n \u2022 In October 2015, we closed on a master transaction agreement with QBE Investments (North America), Inc. ( QBE Parent\u201d) and its subsidiary, QBE Holdings, Inc. (together with QBE Parent, QBE\u201d), pursuant to which we acquired QBE's lender-placed insurance business, including certain of QBE's affiliates engaged in the lender-placed insurance business ( LPI Business\u201d). The transaction included the acquisition of certain assets, including loan-tracking systems and technology, client servicing accounts, intellectual property, and vendor relationships, as well as the assumption of the related insurance liabilities in a reinsurance transaction through which we received the loss reserves, unearned premium reserves, and invested assets. The aggregate consideration for the transaction was approximately $95.7 million. \nAccident and Health:\n \u2022 In October 2015, we closed on the acquisition of certain business lines and assets from Assurant Health, which is a business segment of Assurant, Inc. As part of the transaction, we acquired the small group self-funded and supplemental product lines, as well as North Star Marketing Corporation, a proprietary small group sales channel (the Assurant Transaction\u201d). The purchase price was an aggregate cash payment of $14.0 million. \nPrincipal Revenue and Expense Items\nGross premium written. Gross premium written represents premium from each insurance policy that we write, including as a servicing carrier for assigned risk plans, during a reporting period based on the effective date of the individual policy, prior to ceding reinsurance to third parties.\nNet premium written. Net premium written is gross premium written less that portion of premium that we cede to third-party reinsurers under reinsurance agreements. The amount ceded under these reinsurance agreements is based on a contractual formula contained in the individual reinsurance agreement.\nChange in unearned premium. Change in unearned premium is the change in the balance of the portion of premium that we have written but have yet to earn during the relevant period because the policy is unexpired.\nNet earned premium. Net earned premium is the earned portion of our net premium written. We generally earn insurance premium on a pro rata basis over the term of the policy. At the end of each reporting period, premium written that is not earned is classified as unearned premium, which is earned in subsequent periods over the remaining term of the policy. Our policies typically have a term of six months or one year. For a six-month policy written on January 1, 2016, we would earn half of the premium in the first quarter of 2016 and the other half in the second quarter of 2016.\nCeding commission income. Ceding commission income is a commission we receive based on the earned premium ceded to third-party reinsurers to reimburse us for our acquisition, underwriting and other operating expenses. We earn commissions on reinsurance premium ceded in a manner consistent with the recognition of the earned premium on the underlying insurance policies, generally on a pro rata basis over the terms of the policies reinsured. The portion of ceding commission income which represents reimbursement of successful acquisition costs related to the underlying policies is recorded as an offset to acquisition and other underwriting expenses.\nService and fee income. We currently generate policy service and fee income from installment fees, late payment fees, and other finance and processing fees related to policy cancellation, policy reinstatement, and insufficient fund check returns. These fees are generally designed to offset expenses incurred in the administration of our insurance business, and are generated as follows. Installment fees are charged to permit a policyholder to pay premiums in installments rather than in a lump sum. Late payment fees are charged when premiums are remitted after the due date and any applicable grace periods. Policy cancellation fees are charged to policyholders when a policy is terminated by the policyholder prior to the expiration of the policy's term or renewal term, as applicable. Reinstatement fees are charged to reinstate a policy that has lapsed, generally as a result of non-payment of premiums. Insufficient fund fees are charged when the customer's payment is returned by the financial institution.\nAll fee income is recognized as follows. An installment fee is recognized at the time each policy installment bill is due. A late payment fee is recognized when the customer's payment is not received after the listed due date and any applicable grace period. A policy cancellation fee is recognized at the time the customer's policy is canceled. A policy reinstatement fee is recognized when the customer's policy is reinstated. An insufficient fund fee is recognized when the customer's payment is returned by the financial institution. The amounts charged are primarily intended to compensate us for the administrative costs associated with processing and administering policies that generate insurance premium; however, the amounts of fees charged are not dependent on the amount or period of insurance coverage provided and do not entail any obligation to return any portion of those funds. The direct and indirect costs associated with generating fee income are not separately tracked.\nWe also collect service fees in the form of commissions and general agent fees by selling policies issued by third-party insurance companies. We also collect management fees in connection with our management of the Reciprocal Exchanges. We do not bear insurance underwriting risk with respect to these policies. Commission income and general agent fees are recognized, net of an allowance for estimated policy cancellations, at the date the customer is initially billed or as of the effective date of the insurance policy, whichever is later. The allowance for estimated third-party cancellations is periodically evaluated and adjusted as necessary.\nNet investment income and realized and unrealized gains and (losses). We invest our statutory surplus funds and the funds supporting our insurance liabilities primarily in cash and cash equivalents, fixed maturities and equity securities. Our net investment income includes interest and dividends earned on our invested assets. We report net realized gains and losses on our investments separately from our net investment income. Net realized gains occur when we sell our investment securities for more than their costs or amortized costs, as applicable. Net realized losses occur when we sell our investment securities for less than their costs or amortized costs, as applicable, or we write down the investment securities as a result of other-than-temporary impairment loss. We classify our fixed maturities and equity securities as available for sale. We report net unrealized gains (losses) on those securities classified as available for sale separately in other comprehensive income (loss). Additionally, we have a small portfolio of fixed\nmaturities and equity securities classified as trading. We report realized and unrealized gains (losses) on those securities classified as trading in earnings.\nLoss and loss adjustment expenses. Loss and LAE represent our largest expense item and, for any given reporting period, include estimates of future claim payments, changes in those estimates from prior reporting periods and costs associated with investigating, defending and servicing claims. These expenses fluctuate based on the amount and types of risks we insure. We record loss and LAE related to estimates of future claim payments based on case-by-case valuations and statistical analyses. We seek to establish all reserves at the most likely ultimate exposure based on our historical claims experience. It is typical for our more serious bodily injury claims to take several years to settle, and we revise our estimates as we receive additional information about the condition of claimants and the costs of their medical treatment. Our ability to estimate loss and LAE accurately at the time of pricing our insurance policies is a critical factor in our profitability.\nAcquisition costs and other underwriting expenses. Acquisition costs and other underwriting expenses consist of policy acquisition and marketing expenses, salaries and benefits expenses. Policy acquisition expenses comprise commissions directly attributable to those agents, wholesalers or brokers that produce premiums written on our behalf and promotional fees directly attributable to our affinity relationships. Acquisition costs also include costs that are related to the successful acquisition of new or renewal insurance contracts including comprehensive loss underwriting exchange reports, motor vehicle reports, credit score checks, and policy issuance costs.\nGeneral and administrative expenses. General and administrative expenses are composed of all other operating expenses, including various departmental salaries and benefits expenses for employees that are directly involved in the maintenance of policies, information systems, and accounting for insurance transactions, and other insurance expenses such as federal excise tax, postage, telephones and Internet access charges, as well as legal and auditing fees and board and bureau charges. In addition, general and administrative expenses include those charges that are related to the amortization of tangible and intangible assets and non-insurance activities in which we engage.\nInterest expense. Interest expense represents amounts we incur on our outstanding indebtedness at the then-applicable interest rates.\nIncome tax expense. We incur federal, state and local income tax expenses as well as income tax expenses in certain foreign jurisdictions in which we operate.\nNet operating expense. These expenses consist of the sum of general and administrative expenses and acquisition costs and other underwriting expenses less ceding commission income and service and fee income.\nUnderwriting income. Underwriting income is a measure of an insurance company's overall operating profitability before items such as investment income, interest expense and income taxes. Underwriting income is calculated as net earned premium plus ceding commission income and service and fee income less loss and LAE, acquisition costs and other underwriting expenses, and general and administrative expenses.\nEquity in earnings (losses) from unconsolidated subsidiaries. This represents primarily our share in earnings or losses of our investment in four companies that own life settlement contracts, which includes the gain realized upon a mortality event and the change in fair value of the investments in life settlements as evaluated at the end of each reporting period. These unconsolidated subsidiaries determine the fair value of life settlement contracts based upon an estimate of the discounted cash flow of the anticipated death benefits incorporating a number of factors, such as current life expectancy assumptions, expected premium payment obligations and increased cost assumptions, credit exposure to the insurance companies that issued the life insurance policies and the rate of return that a buyer would require on the policies. The gain realized upon a mortality event is the difference between the death benefit received and the recorded fair value of that particular policy.\nInsurance Ratios\nNet loss ratio. The net loss ratio is a measure of the underwriting profitability of an insurance company's business. Expressed as a percentage, this is the ratio of loss and LAE incurred to net earned premium.\nNet operating expense ratio (non-GAAP). The net operating expense ratio (non-GAAP) is one component of an insurance company's operational efficiency in administering its business. Expressed as a percentage, this is the ratio of net operating expense to net earned premium.\nNet combined ratio (non-GAAP). The net combined ratio (non-GAAP) is a measure of an insurance company's overall underwriting profit. This is the sum of the net loss and net operating expense ratio (non-GAAP). If the net combined ratio (non-GAAP) is at or above 100 percent, an insurance company cannot be profitable without investment income, and may not be profitable if investment income is insufficient.\nNet operating expense ratio and net combined ratio are considered non-GAAP financial measures under applicable SEC rules because a component of those ratios, net operating expense, is calculated by offsetting acquisition costs and other underwriting expenses and general and administrative expenses by ceding commission income and service and fee income, and is therefore a non-GAAP measure. Management uses net operating expense ratio (non-GAAP) and net combined ratio (non-GAAP) to evaluate financial performance against historical results and establish targets on a consolidated basis. We believe this presentation enhances the understanding of our results by eliminating what we believe are volatile and unusual events and presenting the ratios with what we believe are the underlying run rates of the business. Other companies may calculate these measures differently, and, therefore, their measures may not be comparable to those used by the Company's management. For a reconciliation showing the total amounts by which acquisition costs and other underwriting expenses and general and administrative expenses were offset by ceding commission income and service and fee income in the calculation of net operating expense, see Results of Operations - Consolidated Results of Operations\u201d below.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur significant accounting policies are discussed in Note 2, Significant Accounting Policies\u201d in the notes to our consolidated financial statements.\nUse of estimates and assumptions. The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Our principal estimates include unpaid losses and LAE reserves; deferred acquisition costs; reinsurance recoverables, including the provision for uncollectible premiums; recording of impairment losses for other-than-temporary declines in fair value; determining the fair value of investments; determining the fair value of share-based awards for stock compensation; the valuation of intangibles and the determination of of goodwill and goodwill impairment; and income taxes. In developing the estimates and assumptions, management uses all available evidence. Because of uncertainties associated with estimating the amounts, timing and likelihood of possible outcomes, actual results could differ from estimates.\nPremiums. We recognize earned premium on a pro rata basis over the terms of the policies, generally periods of six or twelve months. Unearned premium represents the portion of premiums written applicable to the unexpired terms of the policies. Net premiums receivable represent premium written and not yet collected, net of an allowance for uncollectible premium. We regularly evaluate premium and other receivables and adjust for uncollectible amounts as appropriate. Receivables specifically identified as uncollectible are charged to expense in the period the determination is made.\nService and fee income. We currently generate policy service and fee income from installment fees, late payment fees, and other finance and processing fees related to policy cancellation, policy reinstatement, and insufficient fund check returns. These fees are generally designed to offset expenses incurred in the administration of our insurance business, and are generated as follows. Installment fees are charged to permit a policyholder to pay premiums in installments rather than in a lump sum. Late payment fees are charged when premiums are remitted after the due date and any applicable grace periods. Policy cancellation fees are charged to policyholders when a policy is terminated by the policyholder prior to the expiration of the policy's term or renewal term, as applicable. Reinstatement fees are charged to reinstate a policy that has lapsed, generally as a result of non-payment of premiums. Insufficient fund fees are charged when the customer's payment is returned by the financial institution.\nAll fee income is recognized as follows. An installment fee is recognized at the time each policy installment bill is due. A late payment fee is recognized when the customer's payment is not received after the listed due date and any applicable grace period. A policy cancellation fee is recognized at the time the customer's policy is canceled. A policy reinstatement fee is recognized when the customer's policy is reinstated. An insufficient fund fee is recognized when the customer's payment is returned by the financial institution. The amounts charged are primarily intended to compensate us for the administrative costs associated with processing and administering policies that generate insurance premium; however, the amounts of fees charged are not dependent on the amount or period of insurance coverage provided and do not entail any obligation to return any portion of those funds. The direct and indirect costs associated with generating fee income are not separately tracked. We estimate an allowance for doubtful accounts based on a percentage of fee income.\nWe also collect service fees in the form of commissions and general agent fees by selling policies issued by third-party insurance companies. We do not bear insurance underwriting risk with respect to these policies. Commission income and general agent fees are recognized, net of an allowance for estimated policy cancellations, at the date the customer is initially billed or as of the effective date of the insurance policy, whichever is later. The allowance for estimated third-party cancellations is periodically evaluated and adjusted as necessary.\nReserves for loss and loss adjustment expenses. We record reserves for estimated losses under insurance policies that we write and for LAE related to the investigation and settlement of policy claims. Our reserves for loss and LAE represent the estimated cost of all reported and unreported loss and LAE incurred and unpaid at any given point in time based on known facts and circumstances.\nLoss reserves include statistical reserves and case estimates for individual claims that have been reported and estimates for claims that have been incurred but not reported at the balance sheet date as well as estimates of the expenses associated with processing and settling all reported and unreported claims, less estimates of anticipated salvage and subrogation recoveries. Estimates are based upon past loss experience modified for current trends as well as economic, legal and social conditions. Loss reserves, except life reserves, are not discounted to present value, which would involve recognizing the time value of money and offsetting estimates of future payments by future expected investment income.\nIn establishing these estimates, we make various assumptions regarding a number of factors, including frequency and severity of claims, the length of time needed to achieve ultimate settlement of claims, inflation of medical costs, insurance policy coverage interpretations, jury determinations and legislative changes. Due to the inherent uncertainty associated with these estimates, and the cost of incurred but unreported claims, our actual liabilities may be different from our original estimates. On a quarterly basis, we review our reserves for loss and loss adjustment expenses to determine whether further adjustments are required. Any resulting adjustments are included in the current period's results. Additional information regarding the judgments and uncertainties surrounding our estimated reserves for loss and loss adjustment expenses can be found in Item 1, Business-Loss Reserves.\u201d\nReinsurance. We account for reinsurance premiums, losses and LAE ceded to other companies on a basis consistent with those used in accounting for the original policies issued and the terms of the reinsurance contracts. Earned premiums and losses and LAE incurred ceded to other companies have been recorded as a reduction of premium revenue and losses and LAE. Commissions allowed by reinsurers on business ceded have been recorded as ceding commission revenue. Ceding commission is a commission we receive based on the earned premium ceded to third-party reinsurers to reimburse us for our unallocated LAE and other operating expenses. We earn commissions on reinsurance premiums ceded in a manner consistent with the recognition of the earned premium on the underlying insurance policies, on a pro rata basis over the terms of the policies reinsured. In connection with the Personal Lines Quota Share, the amount we received is based on a contractual formula contained in the reinsurance agreements and is based on the ceded losses as a percentage of ceded premium. Reinsurance recoverables are reported based on the portion of reserves and paid losses and LAE that are ceded to other companies. Assessing whether or not a reinsurance contract meets the condition for risk transfer requires judgment. The determination of risk transfer is critical to reporting premiums and losses, and is based, in part, on the use of actuarial and pricing models and assumptions. If we determine that a reinsurance contract does not transfer sufficient risk, we account for the contract under deposit accounting.\nDeferred policy acquisition costs. Deferred acquisition costs include commissions, premium taxes, payments to affinity partners, promotional fees, and other direct sales costs that vary and are directly related to the successful acquisition of insurance policies. These costs are deferred and amortized to the extent recoverable over the policy period in which the related premiums are earned. We consider anticipated investment income in determining the recoverability of these costs. Management believes that these costs are recoverable in the near term. If management determined that these costs were not recoverable, then we could not continue to record deferred acquisition costs as an asset and would be required to establish a liability for a premium deficiency reserve.\nAssessments related to insurance premiums. We are subject to a variety of insurance-related assessments, such as assessments by state guaranty funds used by state insurance regulators to cover losses of policyholders of insolvent insurance companies and for the operating expenses of such agencies. A typical obligating event would be the issuance of an insurance policy or the occurrence of a claim. These assessments are accrued in the period in which they have been incurred. We use estimated assessment rates in determining the appropriate assessment expense and accrual. We use estimates derived from state regulators and/or National Association of Insurance Commissioners ( NAIC\u201d) Tax and Assessments Guidelines.\nUnearned premium reserves. Unearned premium reserves represent the portion of premiums written applicable to the unexpired terms of the policies.\nInvestments. We account for investments in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB\u201d) Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC\u201d) 320, Investments - Debt and Equity Securities,\u201d which requires that equity securities that have readily determinable fair values and all investments in debt securities to be segregated into categories based upon our intention for those securities. Based on our intention, we have classified our investments as available for sale or trading, with the exception of our equity and cost method investments. We may sell our available-for-sale securities in response to changes in interest rates, risk/reward characteristics, liquidity needs or other factors. Available-for-sale securities are reported at their estimated fair values based on a recognized pricing service, with unrealized gains and losses, net of tax effects, reported as a separate component of other comprehensive income in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income. Trading securities are reported at their estimated fair values with net realized and unrealized gains and losses included in earnings.\nPurchases and sales of investments are recorded on a trade date basis. Realized gains and losses are determined based on the specific identification method. Net investment income is recognized when earned and includes interest and dividend income together with amortization of market premiums and discounts using the effective yield method and is net of investment management fees and other expenses. For mortgage-backed securities and any other holdings for which there is a prepayment risk, prepayment assumptions are evaluated and revised as necessary. Any adjustments required due to the change in effective yields and maturities are recognized on a prospective basis through yield adjustments.\nWe use a set of quantitative and qualitative criteria to evaluate the necessity of recording impairment losses for other-than-temporary declines in fair value. These criteria include:\n \u2022 the current fair value compared to amortized cost; \n \u2022 the length of time that the security's fair value has been below its amortized cost; \n \u2022 specific credit issues related to the issuer such as changes in credit rating or non-payment of scheduled interest payments; \n \u2022 whether management intends to sell the security and, if not, whether it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis; \n \u2022 the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer of the security, including any specific events that may affect its operations or earnings; \n \u2022 the occurrence of a discrete credit event resulting in the issuer defaulting on a material outstanding obligation or the issuer seeking protection under bankruptcy laws; and \n \u2022 other items, including management, media exposure, sponsors, marketing and advertising agreements, debt restructurings, regulatory changes, acquisitions and dispositions, pending litigation, distribution agreements and general industry trends. \nImpairment of investment securities results in a charge to operations when a market decline below cost is deemed to be other-than-temporary. We immediately write down investments that we consider to be impaired based on the foregoing criteria collectively.\nIn the event of the decline in fair value of a debt security, a holder of that security that does not intend to sell the debt security and for whom it is not more likely than not that such holder will be required to sell the debt security before recovery of its amortized cost basis is required to separate the decline in fair value into (a) the amount representing the credit loss and (b) the amount related to other factors. The amount of total decline in fair value related to the credit loss shall be recognized in earnings as an other-than-temporary impairment ( OTTI\u201d) with the amount related to other factors recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss, net of tax. OTTI credit losses result in a permanent reduction of the cost basis of the underlying investment. The determination of OTTI is a subjective process, and different judgments and assumptions could affect the timing of the loss realization.\nGoodwill and intangible assets. We account for goodwill and intangible assets in accordance with ASC 350, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other.\u201d A purchase price paid that is in excess of net assets ( goodwill\u201d) arising from a business combination is recorded as an asset and is not amortized. Intangible assets with a finite life are amortized over the estimated useful life of the asset. Intangible assets with an indefinite useful life are not amortized. Goodwill and intangible assets are tested for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. If the goodwill or intangible asset is impaired, it is written down to its realizable value with a corresponding expense reflected in the consolidated statements of income.\nBusiness combinations. We account for business combinations under the acquisition method of accounting, which requires us to record assets acquired, liabilities assumed and any non-controlling interest in the acquiree at their respective fair values as of the acquisition date. We account for the insurance and reinsurance contracts under the acquisition method as new contracts, which requires us to record assets and liabilities at fair value. We adjust the fair value loss and LAE reserves by recording the acquired loss reserves based on our existing accounting policies and then discounting them based on expected reserve payout patterns using a current risk-free rate of interest. This risk-free interest rate is then adjusted based on different cash flow scenarios that use different payout and ultimate reserve assumptions deemed to be reasonably possible based upon the inherent uncertainties\npresent in determining the amount and timing of payment of such reserves. The difference between the acquired loss and LAE reserves and our best estimate of the fair value of such reserves at the acquisition date is recorded as either an intangible asset or another liability, as applicable and is amortized proportionately to the reduction in the related loss reserves (i.e., over the estimated payout period of the acquired loss and LAE reserves). We assign fair values to intangible assets acquired based on valuation techniques including the income and market approaches. We record contingent consideration at fair value based on the terms of the purchase agreement with subsequent changes in fair value recorded through earnings. The determination of fair value may require management to make significant estimates and assumptions. The purchase price is the fair value of the total consideration conveyed to the seller and we record the excess (deficiency) of the purchase price over the fair value of the acquired net assets, where applicable, as goodwill or bargain purchase gain in earnings. We expense costs associated with the acquisition of a business in the period incurred.\nNon-controlling Interest. The ownership interest in consolidated subsidiaries of non-controlling interests is reflected as non-controlling interest. Our consolidation principles also consolidate entities in which we are deemed a primary beneficiary. Non-controlling interest income or loss represents such non-controlling interests in the earnings of that entity. We consolidate the Reciprocal Exchanges as we have determined that these are variable interest entities and that we are the primary beneficiary.\nFair value of financial instruments. Our estimates of fair value for financial assets and financial liabilities are based on the framework established in ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures.\u201d The framework is based on the inputs used in valuation and gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets and requires that observable inputs be used in the valuations when available. The disclosure of fair value estimates in the ASC 820 hierarchy is based on whether the significant inputs into the valuation are observable. In determining the level of the hierarchy in which the estimate is disclosed, the highest priority is given to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs that reflect our significant market assumptions. Additionally, valuation of fixed-maturity investments is more subjective when markets are less liquid due to lack of market-based inputs, which may increase the potential that the estimated fair value of an investment is not reflective of the price at which an actual transaction could occur. Fair values of other financial instruments which are short-term in nature approximate their carrying values.\nASC 820 defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. ASC 820 clarifies that fair value should be based on the assumptions market participants would use when pricing an asset or liability and establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the information used to develop those assumptions. Additionally, ASC 820 requires an entity to consider all aspects of nonperformance risk, including the entity's own credit standing, when measuring the fair value of a liability.\nASC 820 establishes a three-level hierarchy to be used when measuring and disclosing fair value. An instrument's categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of significant input to its valuation. Following is a description of the three hierarchy levels:\nLevel 1 - Inputs are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the measurement date. Additionally, the entity must have the ability to access the active market and the quoted prices cannot be adjusted by the entity.\nLevel 2 - Inputs are other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. Level 2 inputs include quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in inactive markets for identical or similar assets or liabilities; or inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.\nLevel 3 - Unobservable inputs are supported by little or no market activity. The unobservable inputs represent management's best assumptions of how market participants would price the assets or liabilities. Generally, Level 3 assets and liabilities are valued using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies, or similar techniques that require significant judgment or estimation.\nThe availability of observable inputs can vary from financial instrument to financial instrument and is affected by a wide variety of factors, including, for example, the type of financial instrument, whether the financial instrument is new and not yet established in the marketplace, and other characteristics particular to the transaction. To the extent that valuation is based on models or inputs that are less observable or unobservable in the market, the determination of fair value requires significantly more judgment. Accordingly, the degree of judgment exercised by management in determining fair value is greatest for instruments categorized in Level 3. We use prices and inputs that are current as of the measurement date. In periods of market dislocation, the observability of prices and inputs may be reduced for many instruments. This condition could cause an instrument to be reclassified between levels.\nFor investments that have quoted market prices in active markets, we use the quoted market prices as fair value and include these prices in the amounts disclosed in the Level 1 hierarchy. We receive the quoted market prices from nationally recognized third-party pricing services ( pricing service\u201d). When quoted market prices are unavailable, we utilize the pricing service to determine an estimate of fair value. This pricing method is used, primarily, for fixed maturities. The fair value estimates provided by the pricing services are included in the Level 2 hierarchy. The pricing service utilizes evaluated pricing models that vary by asset class and incorporate available trade, bid and other market information and for structured securities, cash flow and, when available, loan performance data. The pricing service's evaluated pricing applications apply available information as applicable through processes such as benchmark curves, benchmarking of like securities, sector groupings and matrix pricing, to prepare evaluations. In addition, the pricing service uses model processes, such as the Option Adjusted Spread model, to assess interest rate impact and develop prepayment scenarios. The market inputs that the pricing service normally seeks for evaluations of securities, listed in approximate order of priority, include: benchmark yields, reported trades, broker/dealer quotes, issuer spreads, two-sided markets, benchmark securities, bids, offers and reference data including market research publications.\nWe utilize the fair values received from the pricing service to estimate fair value measurements for all our fixed maturities and equity securities. The following describes the valuation techniques we used to determine the fair value of financial instruments held as of December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015:\n\u2022U.S. Treasury and Federal Agencies - Comprised primarily of bonds issued by the U.S. Treasury. The fair values of U.S. government securities are based on quoted market prices in active markets, and are included in the Level 1 fair value hierarchy. We believe the market for U.S. government securities is an actively traded market given the high level of daily trading volume.\n\u2022States and Political Subdivision Bonds - Comprised of bonds and auction rate securities issued by U.S. states and municipal entities or agencies. The primary inputs to the valuation include quoted prices for identical or similar assets in markets that are not active, these are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. We also hold certain municipal bonds that finance economic development, infrastructure and environmental projects which do not have an active market. These bonds are valued based on non-binding broker quotes where the inputs have not been corroborated to be market observable and are classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy.\n\u2022Foreign Government - Comprised of bonds issued by foreign governments. The primary inputs to the valuation include quoted prices for identical or similar assets in markets that are not active, these are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. We also hold certain foreign government bonds that are valued based on non-binding broker quotes where the inputs have not been corroborated to be market observable and are classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy.\n\u2022Corporate Bonds - Comprised of bonds issued by corporations, public and privately placed. The fair values of short-term corporate bonds are priced using the spread above the London Interbank Offering Rate ( LIBOR\u201d) yield curve, and the fair value of long-term corporate bonds are priced using the spread above the risk-free yield curve. The spreads are sourced from broker-dealers, trade prices and the new issue market. Where pricing is unavailable from pricing services, we obtain non-binding quotes from broker-dealers. The primary inputs to the valuation include quoted prices for identical or similar assets in markets that are not active, these are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. We also hold certain structured notes and term loans that do not have an active market. These bonds are valued based on non-binding broker quotes where the inputs have not been corroborated to be market observable and are classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy.\n\u2022Mortgage and Structured Securities - Comprised of commercial and residential mortgage-backed and structured securities. The primary inputs to the valuation include quoted prices for identical or similar assets in markets that are not active, contractual cash flows, benchmark yields, prepayment speeds, collateral performance and credit spreads, these are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. We also hold certain mortgage and structured securities valued based on non-binding broker quotes received from brokers who are familiar with the investments and where the inputs have not been corroborated to be market observable, these are classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.\n\u2022Equity Securities - The pricing service utilizes market quotations for equity securities that have quoted market prices in active markets and their respective quoted prices are provided as fair value. We classified the values of these equity securities as Level 1. The pricing service also provides fair value estimates for certain equity securities whose fair value is based on observable market information rather than market quotes. We classified the value of these equity securities as Level 2. From time to time, we also hold certain equity securities that are issued by privately-held entities or direct equity investments that do not have an active market. We estimate the fair value of these securities primarily based on inputs such as third-party broker quote, issuers' book value, market multiples, and other inputs. These bonds are valued based on non-binding broker quotes where the inputs have not been corroborated to be market observable and are classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy.\n\u2022Other Investments, at fair value - Comprised of our rights to receive the Excess Servicing Spread ( ESS\u201d) related to servicing rights. We use a discounted cash flow approach to estimate their fair value. The key inputs used in the estimation of ESS include prepayment speed and discount rate. Changes in the fair value of the ESS are reported in earnings. We classified the fair value estimates of ESS as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy.\n\u2022Premiums and Other Receivables - The carrying values reported in the accompanying balance sheets for these financial instruments approximate their fair values due to the short-term nature of these assets.\n\u2022Debt - The amount reported in the accompanying balance sheets for these financial instruments represents the carrying value of our debt. We utilize a pricing service to estimate its fair value, other than our publicly traded debt.\nStock Compensation Expense. We recognize compensation expense for our share-based awards over the estimated vesting period based on estimated grant date fair value. Share-based payments include stock option grants and restricted stock units ( RSU\u201d) under our 2010 Equity Incentive Plan and our 2013 Equity Incentive Plan.\nEarnings per Share. Basic earnings per share are computed based on the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding. Dilutive earnings per share are computed using the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period adjusted for the dilutive impact of share options and restricted stock units using the treasury stock method.\nIncome Taxes. We join our subsidiaries in the filing of a consolidated federal income tax return and are party to federal income tax allocation agreements. Under the tax allocation agreements, we pay to or receive from our subsidiaries the amount, if any, by which the group's federal income tax liability was affected by virtue of inclusion of the subsidiary in the consolidated federal return. The Reciprocal Exchanges are not party to federal income tax allocation agreements but file separate tax returns annually.\nDeferred income taxes reflect the impact of temporary differences between the amount of our assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and such amounts as measured by tax laws and regulations. The deferred tax asset and liability primarily consists of book versus tax differences for earned premiums, loss and LAE reserve discounting, deferred acquisition costs, earned but unbilled premiums, and unrealized holding gains and losses on fixed maturities. We record changes in deferred income tax assets and liabilities that are associated with components of other comprehensive income, primarily unrealized investment gains and losses, directly to other comprehensive income. We include changes in deferred income tax assets and liabilities as a component of income tax expense.\nIn assessing the recoverability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that we will generate future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. Management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, tax planning strategies and projected future taxable income in making this assessment. If necessary, we establish a valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amounts that are more likely than not to be realized.\nWe recognize tax benefits only for tax positions that are more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities. Our policy is to prospectively classify accrued interest and penalties related to any unrecognized tax benefits in our income tax provision. We file our consolidated tax returns as prescribed by the tax laws of the jurisdictions in which we and our subsidiaries operate.\nResults of Operations\nConsolidated Results of Operations\n\n\n", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This Form 10-K contains certain forward-looking statements that are intended to be covered by the safe harbors created by The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. See Note on Forward-Looking Statements.\u201d\nOverview\nWe are a specialty personal lines insurance holding company. Through our subsidiaries, we provide a variety of insurance products, including personal and commercial automobile, homeowners, umbrella, recreational vehicle, motorcycle, lender-placed, supplemental health and other niche insurance products. We sell insurance products with a focus on underwriting profitability through a combination of our customized and predictive analytics and our technology driven low cost infrastructure.\nWe manage our business through two segments: Property and Casualty ( P&C\u201d) and Accident and Health ( A&H\u201d). We transact business primarily through our twenty-two regulated domestic insurance subsidiaries: Integon Casualty Insurance Company, Integon General Insurance Corporation, Integon Indemnity Corporation, Integon National Insurance Company ( Integon National\u201d), Integon Preferred Insurance Company, New South Insurance Company, MIC General Insurance Corporation, National General Insurance Company, National General Assurance Company, National General Insurance Online, Inc., National Health Insurance Company, National General Premier Insurance Company, Imperial Fire and Casualty Insurance Company, Agent Alliance Insurance Company, Century-National Insurance Company, Standard Property and Casualty Insurance Company, Direct General Insurance Company, Direct General Insurance Company of Louisiana, Direct General Insurance Company of Mississippi, Direct General Life Insurance Company, Direct Insurance Company and Direct National Insurance Company. Our insurance subsidiaries that are part of our intercompany quota share agreement to Integon National, have an A-\u201d (Excellent) group rating by A.M. Best, subject to transition periods in the case of acquired companies. We currently conduct a limited amount of business outside the United States, primarily in Bermuda, Luxembourg and Sweden.\nThe operating results of property and casualty insurance companies are subject to quarterly and yearly fluctuations due to the effect of competition on pricing, the frequency and severity of losses, the effect of weather and natural disasters on losses, general economic conditions, the general regulatory environment in states in which an insurer operates, state regulation of premium rates, changes in fair value of investments, and other factors such as changes in tax laws. The property and casualty industry has been highly cyclical with periods of high premium rates and shortages of underwriting capacity followed by periods of severe price competition and excess capacity. While these cycles can have a large impact on a company's ability to grow and retain business, we have sought to focus on niche markets and regions where we are able to maintain premium rates at generally consistent levels and maintain underwriting discipline throughout these cycles. We believe that the nature of our P&C insurance products, including their relatively low limits, the relatively short duration of time between when claims are reported and when they are settled, and the broad geographic distribution of our customers, have allowed us to grow and retain our business throughout these cycles. In addition, we have limited our exposure to catastrophe losses through reinsurance. With regard to seasonality, we tend to experience higher claims and claims expense in our P&C segment during periods of severe or inclement weather.\nWe evaluate our operations by monitoring key measures of growth and profitability, including net loss ratio, net combined ratio (non-GAAP) and operating leverage. We target a net combined ratio (non-GAAP) between 90% and 95% while seeking to maintain optimal operating leverage in our insurance subsidiaries commensurate with our A.M. Best rating objectives. To achieve our targeted net combined ratio (non-GAAP) we continually seek ways to reduce our operating costs and lower our expense ratio. For the year ended December 31, 2016, our operating leverage (the ratio of net earned premium to average total stockholders' equity) was 1.7x, which was within our planned target operating leverage of between 1.5x and 2.0x.\nInvestment income is also an important part of our business. Because we often do not settle claims until several months or longer after we receive the original policy premiums, we are able to invest cash from premiums for significant periods of time. We invest our capital and surplus in accordance with state and regulatory guidelines. Our net investment income was $99.6 million, $75.3 million and $52.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. We held 5.8% and 7.8%, of total invested assets in cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nOur most significant balance sheet liability is our unpaid loss and loss adjustment expense ( LAE\u201d) reserves. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, our reserves, net of reinsurance recoverables, were $1,384.3 million and $922.4 million, respectively. We record reserves for estimated losses under insurance policies that we write and for LAE related to the investigation and settlement of policy claims. Our reserves for loss and LAE represent the estimated cost of all reported and unreported loss and LAE incurred and unpaid at any time based on known facts and circumstances. Our reserves, excluding life reserves, for loss and\nLAE incurred and unpaid are not discounted using present value factors. Our loss reserves are reviewed quarterly by internal actuaries and at least annually by our external actuaries. Reserves are based on estimates of the most likely ultimate cost of individual claims. These estimates are inherently uncertain. Judgment is required to determine the relevance of our historical experience and industry information under current facts and circumstances. The interpretation of this historical and industry data can be impacted by external forces, principally frequency and severity of future claims, the length of time needed to achieve ultimate settlement of claims, inflation of medical costs, insurance policy coverage interpretations, jury determinations and legislative changes. Accordingly, our reserves may prove to be inadequate to cover our actual losses. If we change our estimates, these changes would be reflected in our results of operations during the period in which they are made, with increases in our reserves resulting in decreases in our earnings.\nAcquisitions\nDuring 2016 and 2015, we have made the following significant acquisitions:\nProperty and Casualty:\n \u2022 In November 2016, we closed on the acquisition of Elara Holdings, Inc., the parent company of Direct General Corporation, a Tennessee based property and casualty insurance company ( Direct General\u201d), that predominantly writes nonstandard auto business in the Southeast. The acquisition added a direct distribution channel to our growing personal lines business. The purchase price for the transaction was approximately $162.0 million. \n \u2022 In October 2016, we closed on the acquisition of Standard Property and Casualty Insurance Company (f/k/a Standard Mutual Insurance Company), an Illinois-based underwriter of personal auto and homeowners insurance in Illinois and Indiana ( SPCIC\u201d). The transaction provides us entry into these states for both homeowners and package products, and adds to our expansion of standard and preferred lines. The purchase price for the transaction was approximately $4.9 million. \n \u2022 In June 2016, we closed on the acquisition of Century-National Insurance Company, a California domiciled property and casualty insurance company ( Century-National\u201d), and Western General Agency, Inc., a California corporation ( Western General\u201d), from Kramer-Wilson Company, Inc. This acquisition expands our standard and preferred product offering in both homeowners and personal auto in a key geographic area, enhancing our ability to bundle these products together and improve customer retention. The purchase price for the transaction was approximately $322.7 million. \n \u2022 In October 2015, we closed on a master transaction agreement with QBE Investments (North America), Inc. ( QBE Parent\u201d) and its subsidiary, QBE Holdings, Inc. (together with QBE Parent, QBE\u201d), pursuant to which we acquired QBE's lender-placed insurance business, including certain of QBE's affiliates engaged in the lender-placed insurance business ( LPI Business\u201d). The transaction included the acquisition of certain assets, including loan-tracking systems and technology, client servicing accounts, intellectual property, and vendor relationships, as well as the assumption of the related insurance liabilities in a reinsurance transaction through which we received the loss reserves, unearned premium reserves, and invested assets. The aggregate consideration for the transaction was approximately $95.7 million. \nAccident and Health:\n \u2022 In October 2015, we closed on the acquisition of certain business lines and assets from Assurant Health, which is a business segment of Assurant, Inc. As part of the transaction, we acquired the small group self-funded and supplemental product lines, as well as North Star Marketing Corporation, a proprietary small group sales channel (the Assurant Transaction\u201d). The purchase price was an aggregate cash payment of $14.0 million. \nPrincipal Revenue and Expense Items\nGross premium written. Gross premium written represents premium from each insurance policy that we write, including as a servicing carrier for assigned risk plans, during a reporting period based on the effective date of the individual policy, prior to ceding reinsurance to third parties.\nNet premium written. Net premium written is gross premium written less that portion of premium that we cede to third-party reinsurers under reinsurance agreements. The amount ceded under these reinsurance agreements is based on a contractual formula contained in the individual reinsurance agreement.\nChange in unearned premium. Change in unearned premium is the change in the balance of the portion of premium that we have written but have yet to earn during the relevant period because the policy is unexpired.\nNet earned premium. Net earned premium is the earned portion of our net premium written. We generally earn insurance premium on a pro rata basis over the term of the policy. At the end of each reporting period, premium written that is not earned is classified as unearned premium, which is earned in subsequent periods over the remaining term of the policy. Our policies typically have a term of six months or one year. For a six-month policy written on January 1, 2016, we would earn half of the premium in the first quarter of 2016 and the other half in the second quarter of 2016.\nCeding commission income. Ceding commission income is a commission we receive based on the earned premium ceded to third-party reinsurers to reimburse us for our acquisition, underwriting and other operating expenses. We earn commissions on reinsurance premium ceded in a manner consistent with the recognition of the earned premium on the underlying insurance policies, generally on a pro rata basis over the terms of the policies reinsured. The portion of ceding commission income which represents reimbursement of successful acquisition costs related to the underlying policies is recorded as an offset to acquisition and other underwriting expenses.\nService and fee income. We currently generate policy service and fee income from installment fees, late payment fees, and other finance and processing fees related to policy cancellation, policy reinstatement, and insufficient fund check returns. These fees are generally designed to offset expenses incurred in the administration of our insurance business, and are generated as follows. Installment fees are charged to permit a policyholder to pay premiums in installments rather than in a lump sum. Late payment fees are charged when premiums are remitted after the due date and any applicable grace periods. Policy cancellation fees are charged to policyholders when a policy is terminated by the policyholder prior to the expiration of the policy's term or renewal term, as applicable. Reinstatement fees are charged to reinstate a policy that has lapsed, generally as a result of non-payment of premiums. Insufficient fund fees are charged when the customer's payment is returned by the financial institution.\nAll fee income is recognized as follows. An installment fee is recognized at the time each policy installment bill is due. A late payment fee is recognized when the customer's payment is not received after the listed due date and any applicable grace period. A policy cancellation fee is recognized at the time the customer's policy is canceled. A policy reinstatement fee is recognized when the customer's policy is reinstated. An insufficient fund fee is recognized when the customer's payment is returned by the financial institution. The amounts charged are primarily intended to compensate us for the administrative costs associated with processing and administering policies that generate insurance premium; however, the amounts of fees charged are not dependent on the amount or period of insurance coverage provided and do not entail any obligation to return any portion of those funds. The direct and indirect costs associated with generating fee income are not separately tracked.\nWe also collect service fees in the form of commissions and general agent fees by selling policies issued by third-party insurance companies. We also collect management fees in connection with our management of the Reciprocal Exchanges. We do not bear insurance underwriting risk with respect to these policies. Commission income and general agent fees are recognized, net of an allowance for estimated policy cancellations, at the date the customer is initially billed or as of the effective date of the insurance policy, whichever is later. The allowance for estimated third-party cancellations is periodically evaluated and adjusted as necessary.\nNet investment income and realized and unrealized gains and (losses). We invest our statutory surplus funds and the funds supporting our insurance liabilities primarily in cash and cash equivalents, fixed maturities and equity securities. Our net investment income includes interest and dividends earned on our invested assets. We report net realized gains and losses on our investments separately from our net investment income. Net realized gains occur when we sell our investment securities for more than their costs or amortized costs, as applicable. Net realized losses occur when we sell our investment securities for less than their costs or amortized costs, as applicable, or we write down the investment securities as a result of other-than-temporary impairment loss. We classify our fixed maturities and equity securities as available for sale. We report net unrealized gains (losses) on those securities classified as available for sale separately in other comprehensive income (loss). Additionally, we have a small portfolio of fixed\nmaturities and equity securities classified as trading. We report realized and unrealized gains (losses) on those securities classified as trading in earnings.\nLoss and loss adjustment expenses. Loss and LAE represent our largest expense item and, for any given reporting period, include estimates of future claim payments, changes in those estimates from prior reporting periods and costs associated with investigating, defending and servicing claims. These expenses fluctuate based on the amount and types of risks we insure. We record loss and LAE related to estimates of future claim payments based on case-by-case valuations and statistical analyses. We seek to establish all reserves at the most likely ultimate exposure based on our historical claims experience. It is typical for our more serious bodily injury claims to take several years to settle, and we revise our estimates as we receive additional information about the condition of claimants and the costs of their medical treatment. Our ability to estimate loss and LAE accurately at the time of pricing our insurance policies is a critical factor in our profitability.\nAcquisition costs and other underwriting expenses. Acquisition costs and other underwriting expenses consist of policy acquisition and marketing expenses, salaries and benefits expenses. Policy acquisition expenses comprise commissions directly attributable to those agents, wholesalers or brokers that produce premiums written on our behalf and promotional fees directly attributable to our affinity relationships. Acquisition costs also include costs that are related to the successful acquisition of new or renewal insurance contracts including comprehensive loss underwriting exchange reports, motor vehicle reports, credit score checks, and policy issuance costs.\nGeneral and administrative expenses. General and administrative expenses are composed of all other operating expenses, including various departmental salaries and benefits expenses for employees that are directly involved in the maintenance of policies, information systems, and accounting for insurance transactions, and other insurance expenses such as federal excise tax, postage, telephones and Internet access charges, as well as legal and auditing fees and board and bureau charges. In addition, general and administrative expenses include those charges that are related to the amortization of tangible and intangible assets and non-insurance activities in which we engage.\nInterest expense. Interest expense represents amounts we incur on our outstanding indebtedness at the then-applicable interest rates.\nIncome tax expense. We incur federal, state and local income tax expenses as well as income tax expenses in certain foreign jurisdictions in which we operate.\nNet operating expense. These expenses consist of the sum of general and administrative expenses and acquisition costs and other underwriting expenses less ceding commission income and service and fee income.\nUnderwriting income. Underwriting income is a measure of an insurance company's overall operating profitability before items such as investment income, interest expense and income taxes. Underwriting income is calculated as net earned premium plus ceding commission income and service and fee income less loss and LAE, acquisition costs and other underwriting expenses, and general and administrative expenses.\nEquity in earnings (losses) from unconsolidated subsidiaries. This represents primarily our share in earnings or losses of our investment in four companies that own life settlement contracts, which includes the gain realized upon a mortality event and the change in fair value of the investments in life settlements as evaluated at the end of each reporting period. These unconsolidated subsidiaries determine the fair value of life settlement contracts based upon an estimate of the discounted cash flow of the anticipated death benefits incorporating a number of factors, such as current life expectancy assumptions, expected premium payment obligations and increased cost assumptions, credit exposure to the insurance companies that issued the life insurance policies and the rate of return that a buyer would require on the policies. The gain realized upon a mortality event is the difference between the death benefit received and the recorded fair value of that particular policy.\nInsurance Ratios\nNet loss ratio. The net loss ratio is a measure of the underwriting profitability of an insurance company's business. Expressed as a percentage, this is the ratio of loss and LAE incurred to net earned premium.\nNet operating expense ratio (non-GAAP). The net operating expense ratio (non-GAAP) is one component of an insurance company's operational efficiency in administering its business. Expressed as a percentage, this is the ratio of net operating expense to net earned premium.\nNet combined ratio (non-GAAP). The net combined ratio (non-GAAP) is a measure of an insurance company's overall underwriting profit. This is the sum of the net loss and net operating expense ratio (non-GAAP). If the net combined ratio (non-GAAP) is at or above 100 percent, an insurance company cannot be profitable without investment income, and may not be profitable if investment income is insufficient.\nNet operating expense ratio and net combined ratio are considered non-GAAP financial measures under applicable SEC rules because a component of those ratios, net operating expense, is calculated by offsetting acquisition costs and other underwriting expenses and general and administrative expenses by ceding commission income and service and fee income, and is therefore a non-GAAP measure. Management uses net operating expense ratio (non-GAAP) and net combined ratio (non-GAAP) to evaluate financial performance against historical results and establish targets on a consolidated basis. We believe this presentation enhances the understanding of our results by eliminating what we believe are volatile and unusual events and presenting the ratios with what we believe are the underlying run rates of the business. Other companies may calculate these measures differently, and, therefore, their measures may not be comparable to those used by the Company's management. For a reconciliation showing the total amounts by which acquisition costs and other underwriting expenses and general and administrative expenses were offset by ceding commission income and service and fee income in the calculation of net operating expense, see Results of Operations - Consolidated Results of Operations\u201d below.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur significant accounting policies are discussed in Note 2, Significant Accounting Policies\u201d in the notes to our consolidated financial statements.\nUse of estimates and assumptions. The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Our principal estimates include unpaid losses and LAE reserves; deferred acquisition costs; reinsurance recoverables, including the provision for uncollectible premiums; recording of impairment losses for other-than-temporary declines in fair value; determining the fair value of investments; determining the fair value of share-based awards for stock compensation; the valuation of intangibles and the determination of of goodwill and goodwill impairment; and income taxes. In developing the estimates and assumptions, management uses all available evidence. Because of uncertainties associated with estimating the amounts, timing and likelihood of possible outcomes, actual results could differ from estimates.\nPremiums. We recognize earned premium on a pro rata basis over the terms of the policies, generally periods of six or twelve months. Unearned premium represents the portion of premiums written applicable to the unexpired terms of the policies. Net premiums receivable represent premium written and not yet collected, net of an allowance for uncollectible premium. We regularly evaluate premium and other receivables and adjust for uncollectible amounts as appropriate. Receivables specifically identified as uncollectible are charged to expense in the period the determination is made.\nService and fee income. We currently generate policy service and fee income from installment fees, late payment fees, and other finance and processing fees related to policy cancellation, policy reinstatement, and insufficient fund check returns. These fees are generally designed to offset expenses incurred in the administration of our insurance business, and are generated as follows. Installment fees are charged to permit a policyholder to pay premiums in installments rather than in a lump sum. Late payment fees are charged when premiums are remitted after the due date and any applicable grace periods. Policy cancellation fees are charged to policyholders when a policy is terminated by the policyholder prior to the expiration of the policy's term or renewal term, as applicable. Reinstatement fees are charged to reinstate a policy that has lapsed, generally as a result of non-payment of premiums. Insufficient fund fees are charged when the customer's payment is returned by the financial institution.\nAll fee income is recognized as follows. An installment fee is recognized at the time each policy installment bill is due. A late payment fee is recognized when the customer's payment is not received after the listed due date and any applicable grace period. A policy cancellation fee is recognized at the time the customer's policy is canceled. A policy reinstatement fee is recognized when the customer's policy is reinstated. An insufficient fund fee is recognized when the customer's payment is returned by the financial institution. The amounts charged are primarily intended to compensate us for the administrative costs associated with processing and administering policies that generate insurance premium; however, the amounts of fees charged are not dependent on the amount or period of insurance coverage provided and do not entail any obligation to return any portion of those funds. The direct and indirect costs associated with generating fee income are not separately tracked. We estimate an allowance for doubtful accounts based on a percentage of fee income.\nWe also collect service fees in the form of commissions and general agent fees by selling policies issued by third-party insurance companies. We do not bear insurance underwriting risk with respect to these policies. Commission income and general agent fees are recognized, net of an allowance for estimated policy cancellations, at the date the customer is initially billed or as of the effective date of the insurance policy, whichever is later. The allowance for estimated third-party cancellations is periodically evaluated and adjusted as necessary.\nReserves for loss and loss adjustment expenses. We record reserves for estimated losses under insurance policies that we write and for LAE related to the investigation and settlement of policy claims. Our reserves for loss and LAE represent the estimated cost of all reported and unreported loss and LAE incurred and unpaid at any given point in time based on known facts and circumstances.\nLoss reserves include statistical reserves and case estimates for individual claims that have been reported and estimates for claims that have been incurred but not reported at the balance sheet date as well as estimates of the expenses associated with processing and settling all reported and unreported claims, less estimates of anticipated salvage and subrogation recoveries. Estimates are based upon past loss experience modified for current trends as well as economic, legal and social conditions. Loss reserves, except life reserves, are not discounted to present value, which would involve recognizing the time value of money and offsetting estimates of future payments by future expected investment income.\nIn establishing these estimates, we make various assumptions regarding a number of factors, including frequency and severity of claims, the length of time needed to achieve ultimate settlement of claims, inflation of medical costs, insurance policy coverage interpretations, jury determinations and legislative changes. Due to the inherent uncertainty associated with these estimates, and the cost of incurred but unreported claims, our actual liabilities may be different from our original estimates. On a quarterly basis, we review our reserves for loss and loss adjustment expenses to determine whether further adjustments are required. Any resulting adjustments are included in the current period's results. Additional information regarding the judgments and uncertainties surrounding our estimated reserves for loss and loss adjustment expenses can be found in Item 1, Business-Loss Reserves.\u201d\nReinsurance. We account for reinsurance premiums, losses and LAE ceded to other companies on a basis consistent with those used in accounting for the original policies issued and the terms of the reinsurance contracts. Earned premiums and losses and LAE incurred ceded to other companies have been recorded as a reduction of premium revenue and losses and LAE. Commissions allowed by reinsurers on business ceded have been recorded as ceding commission revenue. Ceding commission is a commission we receive based on the earned premium ceded to third-party reinsurers to reimburse us for our unallocated LAE and other operating expenses. We earn commissions on reinsurance premiums ceded in a manner consistent with the recognition of the earned premium on the underlying insurance policies, on a pro rata basis over the terms of the policies reinsured. In connection with the Personal Lines Quota Share, the amount we received is based on a contractual formula contained in the reinsurance agreements and is based on the ceded losses as a percentage of ceded premium. Reinsurance recoverables are reported based on the portion of reserves and paid losses and LAE that are ceded to other companies. Assessing whether or not a reinsurance contract meets the condition for risk transfer requires judgment. The determination of risk transfer is critical to reporting premiums and losses, and is based, in part, on the use of actuarial and pricing models and assumptions. If we determine that a reinsurance contract does not transfer sufficient risk, we account for the contract under deposit accounting.\nDeferred policy acquisition costs. Deferred acquisition costs include commissions, premium taxes, payments to affinity partners, promotional fees, and other direct sales costs that vary and are directly related to the successful acquisition of insurance policies. These costs are deferred and amortized to the extent recoverable over the policy period in which the related premiums are earned. We consider anticipated investment income in determining the recoverability of these costs. Management believes that these costs are recoverable in the near term. If management determined that these costs were not recoverable, then we could not continue to record deferred acquisition costs as an asset and would be required to establish a liability for a premium deficiency reserve.\nAssessments related to insurance premiums. We are subject to a variety of insurance-related assessments, such as assessments by state guaranty funds used by state insurance regulators to cover losses of policyholders of insolvent insurance companies and for the operating expenses of such agencies. A typical obligating event would be the issuance of an insurance policy or the occurrence of a claim. These assessments are accrued in the period in which they have been incurred. We use estimated assessment rates in determining the appropriate assessment expense and accrual. We use estimates derived from state regulators and/or National Association of Insurance Commissioners ( NAIC\u201d) Tax and Assessments Guidelines.\nUnearned premium reserves. Unearned premium reserves represent the portion of premiums written applicable to the unexpired terms of the policies.\nInvestments. We account for investments in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB\u201d) Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC\u201d) 320, Investments - Debt and Equity Securities,\u201d which requires that equity securities that have readily determinable fair values and all investments in debt securities to be segregated into categories based upon our intention for those securities. Based on our intention, we have classified our investments as available for sale or trading, with the exception of our equity and cost method investments. We may sell our available-for-sale securities in response to changes in interest rates, risk/reward characteristics, liquidity needs or other factors. Available-for-sale securities are reported at their estimated fair values based on a recognized pricing service, with unrealized gains and losses, net of tax effects, reported as a separate component of other comprehensive income in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income. Trading securities are reported at their estimated fair values with net realized and unrealized gains and losses included in earnings.\nPurchases and sales of investments are recorded on a trade date basis. Realized gains and losses are determined based on the specific identification method. Net investment income is recognized when earned and includes interest and dividend income together with amortization of market premiums and discounts using the effective yield method and is net of investment management fees and other expenses. For mortgage-backed securities and any other holdings for which there is a prepayment risk, prepayment assumptions are evaluated and revised as necessary. Any adjustments required due to the change in effective yields and maturities are recognized on a prospective basis through yield adjustments.\nWe use a set of quantitative and qualitative criteria to evaluate the necessity of recording impairment losses for other-than-temporary declines in fair value. These criteria include:\n \u2022 the current fair value compared to amortized cost; \n \u2022 the length of time that the security's fair value has been below its amortized cost; \n \u2022 specific credit issues related to the issuer such as changes in credit rating or non-payment of scheduled interest payments; \n \u2022 whether management intends to sell the security and, if not, whether it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis; \n \u2022 the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer of the security, including any specific events that may affect its operations or earnings; \n \u2022 the occurrence of a discrete credit event resulting in the issuer defaulting on a material outstanding obligation or the issuer seeking protection under bankruptcy laws; and \n \u2022 other items, including management, media exposure, sponsors, marketing and advertising agreements, debt restructurings, regulatory changes, acquisitions and dispositions, pending litigation, distribution agreements and general industry trends. \nImpairment of investment securities results in a charge to operations when a market decline below cost is deemed to be other-than-temporary. We immediately write down investments that we consider to be impaired based on the foregoing criteria collectively.\nIn the event of the decline in fair value of a debt security, a holder of that security that does not intend to sell the debt security and for whom it is not more likely than not that such holder will be required to sell the debt security before recovery of its amortized cost basis is required to separate the decline in fair value into (a) the amount representing the credit loss and (b) the amount related to other factors. The amount of total decline in fair value related to the credit loss shall be recognized in earnings as an other-than-temporary impairment ( OTTI\u201d) with the amount related to other factors recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss, net of tax. OTTI credit losses result in a permanent reduction of the cost basis of the underlying investment. The determination of OTTI is a subjective process, and different judgments and assumptions could affect the timing of the loss realization.\nGoodwill and intangible assets. We account for goodwill and intangible assets in accordance with ASC 350, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other.\u201d A purchase price paid that is in excess of net assets ( goodwill\u201d) arising from a business combination is recorded as an asset and is not amortized. Intangible assets with a finite life are amortized over the estimated useful life of the asset. Intangible assets with an indefinite useful life are not amortized. Goodwill and intangible assets are tested for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. If the goodwill or intangible asset is impaired, it is written down to its realizable value with a corresponding expense reflected in the consolidated statements of income.\nBusiness combinations. We account for business combinations under the acquisition method of accounting, which requires us to record assets acquired, liabilities assumed and any non-controlling interest in the acquiree at their respective fair values as of the acquisition date. We account for the insurance and reinsurance contracts under the acquisition method as new contracts, which requires us to record assets and liabilities at fair value. We adjust the fair value loss and LAE reserves by recording the acquired loss reserves based on our existing accounting policies and then discounting them based on expected reserve payout patterns using a current risk-free rate of interest. This risk-free interest rate is then adjusted based on different cash flow scenarios that use different payout and ultimate reserve assumptions deemed to be reasonably possible based upon the inherent uncertainties\npresent in determining the amount and timing of payment of such reserves. The difference between the acquired loss and LAE reserves and our best estimate of the fair value of such reserves at the acquisition date is recorded as either an intangible asset or another liability, as applicable and is amortized proportionately to the reduction in the related loss reserves (i.e., over the estimated payout period of the acquired loss and LAE reserves). We assign fair values to intangible assets acquired based on valuation techniques including the income and market approaches. We record contingent consideration at fair value based on the terms of the purchase agreement with subsequent changes in fair value recorded through earnings. The determination of fair value may require management to make significant estimates and assumptions. The purchase price is the fair value of the total consideration conveyed to the seller and we record the excess (deficiency) of the purchase price over the fair value of the acquired net assets, where applicable, as goodwill or bargain purchase gain in earnings. We expense costs associated with the acquisition of a business in the period incurred.\nNon-controlling Interest. The ownership interest in consolidated subsidiaries of non-controlling interests is reflected as non-controlling interest. Our consolidation principles also consolidate entities in which we are deemed a primary beneficiary. Non-controlling interest income or loss represents such non-controlling interests in the earnings of that entity. We consolidate the Reciprocal Exchanges as we have determined that these are variable interest entities and that we are the primary beneficiary.\nFair value of financial instruments. Our estimates of fair value for financial assets and financial liabilities are based on the framework established in ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures.\u201d The framework is based on the inputs used in valuation and gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets and requires that observable inputs be used in the valuations when available. The disclosure of fair value estimates in the ASC 820 hierarchy is based on whether the significant inputs into the valuation are observable. In determining the level of the hierarchy in which the estimate is disclosed, the highest priority is given to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs that reflect our significant market assumptions. Additionally, valuation of fixed-maturity investments is more subjective when markets are less liquid due to lack of market-based inputs, which may increase the potential that the estimated fair value of an investment is not reflective of the price at which an actual transaction could occur. Fair values of other financial instruments which are short-term in nature approximate their carrying values.\nASC 820 defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. ASC 820 clarifies that fair value should be based on the assumptions market participants would use when pricing an asset or liability and establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the information used to develop those assumptions. Additionally, ASC 820 requires an entity to consider all aspects of nonperformance risk, including the entity's own credit standing, when measuring the fair value of a liability.\nASC 820 establishes a three-level hierarchy to be used when measuring and disclosing fair value. An instrument's categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of significant input to its valuation. Following is a description of the three hierarchy levels:\nLevel 1 - Inputs are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the measurement date. Additionally, the entity must have the ability to access the active market and the quoted prices cannot be adjusted by the entity.\nLevel 2 - Inputs are other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. Level 2 inputs include quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in inactive markets for identical or similar assets or liabilities; or inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.\nLevel 3 - Unobservable inputs are supported by little or no market activity. The unobservable inputs represent management's best assumptions of how market participants would price the assets or liabilities. Generally, Level 3 assets and liabilities are valued using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies, or similar techniques that require significant judgment or estimation.\nThe availability of observable inputs can vary from financial instrument to financial instrument and is affected by a wide variety of factors, including, for example, the type of financial instrument, whether the financial instrument is new and not yet established in the marketplace, and other characteristics particular to the transaction. To the extent that valuation is based on models or inputs that are less observable or unobservable in the market, the determination of fair value requires significantly more judgment. Accordingly, the degree of judgment exercised by management in determining fair value is greatest for instruments categorized in Level 3. We use prices and inputs that are current as of the measurement date. In periods of market dislocation, the observability of prices and inputs may be reduced for many instruments. This condition could cause an instrument to be reclassified between levels.\nFor investments that have quoted market prices in active markets, we use the quoted market prices as fair value and include these prices in the amounts disclosed in the Level 1 hierarchy. We receive the quoted market prices from nationally recognized third-party pricing services ( pricing service\u201d). When quoted market prices are unavailable, we utilize the pricing service to determine an estimate of fair value. This pricing method is used, primarily, for fixed maturities. The fair value estimates provided by the pricing services are included in the Level 2 hierarchy. The pricing service utilizes evaluated pricing models that vary by asset class and incorporate available trade, bid and other market information and for structured securities, cash flow and, when available, loan performance data. The pricing service's evaluated pricing applications apply available information as applicable through processes such as benchmark curves, benchmarking of like securities, sector groupings and matrix pricing, to prepare evaluations. In addition, the pricing service uses model processes, such as the Option Adjusted Spread model, to assess interest rate impact and develop prepayment scenarios. The market inputs that the pricing service normally seeks for evaluations of securities, listed in approximate order of priority, include: benchmark yields, reported trades, broker/dealer quotes, issuer spreads, two-sided markets, benchmark securities, bids, offers and reference data including market research publications.\nWe utilize the fair values received from the pricing service to estimate fair value measurements for all our fixed maturities and equity securities. The following describes the valuation techniques we used to determine the fair value of financial instruments held as of December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015:\n\u2022U.S. Treasury and Federal Agencies - Comprised primarily of bonds issued by the U.S. Treasury. The fair values of U.S. government securities are based on quoted market prices in active markets, and are included in the Level 1 fair value hierarchy. We believe the market for U.S. government securities is an actively traded market given the high level of daily trading volume.\n\u2022States and Political Subdivision Bonds - Comprised of bonds and auction rate securities issued by U.S. states and municipal entities or agencies. The primary inputs to the valuation include quoted prices for identical or similar assets in markets that are not active, these are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. We also hold certain municipal bonds that finance economic development, infrastructure and environmental projects which do not have an active market. These bonds are valued based on non-binding broker quotes where the inputs have not been corroborated to be market observable and are classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy.\n\u2022Foreign Government - Comprised of bonds issued by foreign governments. The primary inputs to the valuation include quoted prices for identical or similar assets in markets that are not active, these are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. We also hold certain foreign government bonds that are valued based on non-binding broker quotes where the inputs have not been corroborated to be market observable and are classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy.\n\u2022Corporate Bonds - Comprised of bonds issued by corporations, public and privately placed. The fair values of short-term corporate bonds are priced using the spread above the London Interbank Offering Rate ( LIBOR\u201d) yield curve, and the fair value of long-term corporate bonds are priced using the spread above the risk-free yield curve. The spreads are sourced from broker-dealers, trade prices and the new issue market. Where pricing is unavailable from pricing services, we obtain non-binding quotes from broker-dealers. The primary inputs to the valuation include quoted prices for identical or similar assets in markets that are not active, these are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. We also hold certain structured notes and term loans that do not have an active market. These bonds are valued based on non-binding broker quotes where the inputs have not been corroborated to be market observable and are classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy.\n\u2022Mortgage and Structured Securities - Comprised of commercial and residential mortgage-backed and structured securities. The primary inputs to the valuation include quoted prices for identical or similar assets in markets that are not active, contractual cash flows, benchmark yields, prepayment speeds, collateral performance and credit spreads, these are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. We also hold certain mortgage and structured securities valued based on non-binding broker quotes received from brokers who are familiar with the investments and where the inputs have not been corroborated to be market observable, these are classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.\n\u2022Equity Securities - The pricing service utilizes market quotations for equity securities that have quoted market prices in active markets and their respective quoted prices are provided as fair value. We classified the values of these equity securities as Level 1. The pricing service also provides fair value estimates for certain equity securities whose fair value is based on observable market information rather than market quotes. We classified the value of these equity securities as Level 2. From time to time, we also hold certain equity securities that are issued by privately-held entities or direct equity investments that do not have an active market. We estimate the fair value of these securities primarily based on inputs such as third-party broker quote, issuers' book value, market multiples, and other inputs. These bonds are valued based on non-binding broker quotes where the inputs have not been corroborated to be market observable and are classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy.\n\u2022Other Investments, at fair value - Comprised of our rights to receive the Excess Servicing Spread ( ESS\u201d) related to servicing rights. We use a discounted cash flow approach to estimate their fair value. The key inputs used in the estimation of ESS include prepayment speed and discount rate. Changes in the fair value of the ESS are reported in earnings. We classified the fair value estimates of ESS as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy.\n\u2022Premiums and Other Receivables - The carrying values reported in the accompanying balance sheets for these financial instruments approximate their fair values due to the short-term nature of these assets.\n\u2022Debt - The amount reported in the accompanying balance sheets for these financial instruments represents the carrying value of our debt. We utilize a pricing service to estimate its fair value, other than our publicly traded debt.\nStock Compensation Expense. We recognize compensation expense for our share-based awards over the estimated vesting period based on estimated grant date fair value. Share-based payments include stock option grants and restricted stock units ( RSU\u201d) under our 2010 Equity Incentive Plan and our 2013 Equity Incentive Plan.\nEarnings per Share. Basic earnings per share are computed based on the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding. Dilutive earnings per share are computed using the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period adjusted for the dilutive impact of share options and restricted stock units using the treasury stock method.\nIncome Taxes. We join our subsidiaries in the filing of a consolidated federal income tax return and are party to federal income tax allocation agreements. Under the tax allocation agreements, we pay to or receive from our subsidiaries the amount, if any, by which the group's federal income tax liability was affected by virtue of inclusion of the subsidiary in the consolidated federal return. The Reciprocal Exchanges are not party to federal income tax allocation agreements but file separate tax returns annually.\nDeferred income taxes reflect the impact of temporary differences between the amount of our assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and such amounts as measured by tax laws and regulations. The deferred tax asset and liability primarily consists of book versus tax differences for earned premiums, loss and LAE reserve discounting, deferred acquisition costs, earned but unbilled premiums, and unrealized holding gains and losses on fixed maturities. We record changes in deferred income tax assets and liabilities that are associated with components of other comprehensive income, primarily unrealized investment gains and losses, directly to other comprehensive income. We include changes in deferred income tax assets and liabilities as a component of income tax expense.\nIn assessing the recoverability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that we will generate future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. Management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, tax planning strategies and projected future taxable income in making this assessment. If necessary, we establish a valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amounts that are more likely than not to be realized.\nWe recognize tax benefits only for tax positions that are more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities. Our policy is to prospectively classify accrued interest and penalties related to any unrecognized tax benefits in our income tax provision. We file our consolidated tax returns as prescribed by the tax laws of the jurisdictions in which we and our subsidiaries operate.\nResults of Operations\nConsolidated Results of Operations\nTable 149:
