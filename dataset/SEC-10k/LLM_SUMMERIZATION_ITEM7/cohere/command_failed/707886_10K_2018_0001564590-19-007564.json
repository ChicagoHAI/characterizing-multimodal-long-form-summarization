Pursuant to the terms of the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated September 8, 2016, among United Community, OLCB, Premier Bank & Trust, OLCB's wholly owned subsidiary bank (PB&T), The Home Savings and Loan Company of Youngstown, Ohio, United Community's wholly owned subsidiary bank (the Merger Agreement), OLCB was merged with and into United Community (the merger). Immediately following the merger, Home Savings was merged with and into PB&T and the surviving bank changed its name to Home Savings Bank.\u201d\nAs a result of the merger and in accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement, each preferred share of OLCB was deemed to have been converted into OLCB common shares. Each OLCB common share was converted into the right to receive either $18.00 in cash or 2.736 United Community common shares, subject to certain allocation procedures set forth in the Merger Agreement that ensured that 50% of OLCB's common shares outstanding were converted into United Community common shares, and 50% of OLCB's common shares outstanding were converted into the right to receive the cash consideration. The Company paid cash in lieu of issuing fractional shares. This transaction resulted in the addition of approximately $349.3 million in assets and the addition of four branches in Summit, Stark and Belmont counties. See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding this transaction.\nIn addition to Home Savings, United Community operates through three other wholly-owned subsidiaries: HSB Insurance, LLC, HSB Capital, LLC and HSB Insurance, Inc. HSB Capital, LLC was formed as an Ohio limited liability company by United Community during 2016 for the purpose of providing mezzanine funding for customers of the Bank. Mezzanine loans are offered by HSB Capital, LLC to customers in United Community's market area, as defined below, and are expected to be repaid from the cash flow from operations of the business.\nHSB Insurance, LLC, (d/b/a James & Sons Insurance), United Community's wholly-owned insurance subsidiary, was formed on April 6, 2016 to acquire James & Sons Insurance. As a result of this acquisition, HSB Insurance, LLC now offers a variety of insurance products for business and residential customers, including auto, homeowners, life-health, commercial, surety bonds and aviation, within United Community's market area. HSB Insurance, LLC completed two additional acquisitions of insurance companies in 2017 and one in 2018 to expand its offerings and market area.\nHSB Insurance, Inc., a Delaware-based captive insurance company, was formed by United Community and began operations on June 1, 2017. HSB Insurance, Inc. insures against certain risks unique to the operations of United Community and its subsidiaries and for which insurance may not be currently available or economically feasible in today's insurance marketplace. HSB Insurance, Inc. pools resources with several other similar insurance company subsidiaries of financial institutions to spread a limited amount of risk among themselves. HSB Insurance, Inc. is subject to regulations of the State of Delaware and undergoes periodic examinations by the Delaware Division of Insurance.\nMaterial Changes in Financial Condition\nCash and cash equivalents increased $14.1 million, or 30.1%, to $61.0 million at December 31, 2018, compared to $46.9 million at December 31, 2017. Cash and cash equivalents increased in 2018 primarily as a result of increased fed funds sold on hand at the end of the year.\nTrading securities increased to $364,000 at December 31, 2018. The Company had no trading securities as of December 31, 2017. During the fourth quarter of 2018, the Company sold approximately 50% of its Visa Class B shares and the remaining shares were placed into trading securities at fair market value.\nAvailable for sale securities decreased $28.9 million, or 10.7% to $241.6 million at December 31, 2018. The change in available for sale securities was affected by maturities, pay downs and amortization totaling $12.6 million and sales of $36.6 million. There was also a decrease in the market value adjustment on the securities totaling $3.7 million. Partially offsetting this were purchases during 2018 of $24.0 million. The balance of the unrealized loss position at December 31, 2018 was $4.8 million, pretax, compared to a loss position of $1.1 million, pretax, at December 31, 2017. The unrealized loss position recognized in available for sale securities is primarily driven by market conditions. To that end, the Company expects to receive all principal and interest payments contractually due and has no intent to sell and more than likely will not be required to sell these securities until maturity. The majority of the securities are Government Sponsored Entities (GSE) issued debt, mortgage-backed securities or collateralized mortgage obligations and carry the same rating as the U.S. Government.\nThe duration of the available for sale securities portfolio was approximately 5.2 years at December 31, 2018. There is risk that longer-term rates could rise, resulting in greater unrealized losses. It is also possible, however, that longer term rates could fall, resulting in the recovery of all of the unrealized losses. Management continues to allow the balance of the portfolio to decline as planned. In addition, the Company may look for opportunities to sell securities and replace them with securities to change the duration characteristics of the portfolio and/or change the mix of the portfolio.\nHeld to maturity securities decreased $5.4 million, or 6.5% to $77.5 million at December 31, 2018. The change in held to maturity securities is the result of maturities, pay downs and amortization offset by the purchase of $3.8 million in securities during the year.\nAt December 31, 2018, there were no loans held for sale, carried at lower of cost or market, and $91.5 million of loans held for sale, carried at fair value. Loans held for sale, carried at lower of cost or market, were $211,000 and loans held for sale, carried at fair value, were $83.5 million at December 31, 2017. The increase in loans held for sale, carried at fair value, was primarily attributable to the originations of permanent construction loans during the period. These loans are not sold until construction of the residence is complete, which is usually within nine to ten months of origination. Home Savings continues to sell a majority of its newly originated fixed rate mortgage loans into the secondary market as part of its risk management strategy and anticipates continuing to do so in the future.\nNet loans increased $177.0 million, or 8.9%, to $2.2 billion at December 31, 2018, compared to $2.0 billion at December 31, 2017. Total commercial loans increased $120.3 million in 2018 while total residential mortgage loans increased $50.7 million and total consumer loans increased $3.5 million. The Company continues to focus on growth in commercial real estate and commercial and industrial loans. See Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the composition of net loans.\nAllowance for Loan Losses. The allowance for loan losses is a valuation allowance for probable incurred credit losses established through a provision for probable loan losses charged to expense. The allowance for loan losses was $20.4 million at December 31, 2018, compared to $21.2 million at December 31, 2017. The allowance for loan losses as a percentage of loans was 0.93% at December 31, 2018, compared to 1.05% at December 31, 2017. This change is a result of growth in the loan portfolio along with improving credit metrics which lowered the amount of allowance for loan losses. The allowance for loan losses as a percentage of nonperforming loans was 312.6% at December 31, 2018, compared to 181.2% at December 31, 2017. Loan losses are charged against the allowance when the uncollectability of a loan balance is confirmed. Subsequent recoveries, if any, are added back to the allowance. Home Savings' allowance for loan loss methodology includes allowance allocations calculated in accordance with ASC Topic 310, Receivables,\u201d and allowance allocations calculated in accordance with ASC Topic 450, Contingencies\u201d. Accordingly, the methodology is based on historical loss experience by type of credit plus specific loss allocations and adjustments for current events and conditions. Home Savings' process for determining the appropriate level of the allowance for probable loan losses is designed to account for credit deterioration as it occurs. The provision for probable loan losses reflects loan quality trends, including the levels of and trends related to nonaccrual loans, past due loans, classified loans and net charge-offs or recoveries, among other factors.\nDuring 2018, the Company recorded a loan loss provision of $699,000. This recognition was primarily due to the growth of the loan portfolio and, to a lesser extent, net charge-offs, offset by improvements in factors used in calculating the allowance for loan loss reserve.\nImpaired Loans. A loan is considered impaired when there is a deterioration of the credit worthiness of the borrower to the extent that there is no longer reasonable assurance of the timely collection of the full amount of principal and interest. The total outstanding balance of all impaired loans was $20.6 million at December 31, 2018 as compared to $26.2 million at December 31, 2017. The decrease in impaired loans can be largely attributed to the resolution of loans through principal payments, charge-offs, sale of the loan or collateral or by Home Savings taking possession of the collateral.\nIncluded in impaired loans above are certain loans Home Savings considers to be troubled debt restructurings (TDR). A loan is considered a TDR if Home Savings grants a concession to a debtor experiencing financial difficulty that it would otherwise not consider. The concession either stems from an agreement between the creditor and the debtor or is imposed by law or a court. If the debtor is not currently experiencing financial difficulties but would probably be in payment default in the future without the modification, then this type of restructure also could be considered a TDR.\nA restructured loan that has fallen into nonaccrual status will return to accruing status if either of the following criteria are met: (i) none of the principal and interest is due or unpaid and Home Savings expects repayment of the remaining contractual principal and interest, or (ii) the borrower has resumed paying the full amount of the scheduled contractual interest and principal payments on a loan that is between 30 and 89 days past due and there is reasonable assurance of prepayment established through payment performance over a period of six months. TDR loans aggregated $16.6 million at December 31, 2018 compared to $19.8 million at December 31, 2017. TDR loans that were on nonaccrual status aggregated $1.7 million and $2.4 million at December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively. Such loans are considered nonperforming loans. TDR loans that were accruing according to their terms aggregated $14.9 million and $17.9 million at December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively.\nNonperforming Loans. Nonperforming loans consist of nonaccrual loans and loans past due 90 days and still accruing. Nonperforming loans were $6.5 million, or 0.30% of total loans, at December 31, 2018, compared to $11.7 million, or 0.59% of total loans, at December 31, 2017.\nGenerally, loans are placed on nonaccrual status if principal or interest payments become 90 days past due and/or management deems the collectability of the principal and/or interest to be in question, as well as when required by regulatory guidance. Loans to a customer whose financial condition has deteriorated are considered for nonaccrual status whether or not the loan is 90 or more days past due. Once interest accruals are discontinued, accrued but uncollected interest is charged to current year operations. Subsequent cash receipts on nonaccrual loans are recorded as a reduction of principal. Interest income is recorded only after principal recovery is reasonably assured. Classification of a loan as nonaccrual does not preclude the ultimate collection of loan principal or interest.\nFederal Home Loan Bank Stock. FHLB stock was $19.1 million at December 31, 2018 compared to $19.3 million at December 31, 2017. The decrease was due to a redemption of stock by the FHLB during 2018. In 2018, the FHLB paid cash dividends of $1.1 million in lieu of stock dividends to its member banks.\nReal Estate Owned and Other Repossessed Assets. Real estate owned and other repossessed assets decreased $165,000 during the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. Property acquired in the settlement of loans is recorded at the lower of the loan's acquisition balance less cost to sell or the fair market value of the property secured less costs to sell. Appraisals are obtained at least annually on properties that exceed $1.0 million in value. Based on current appraisals, a valuation allowance may be established to reflect properly the asset at fair value.\nBank Owned Life Insurance. Bank Owned Life Insurance (BOLI) is maintained on select officers and employees of Home Savings whereby Home Savings is the beneficiary. BOLI is recorded at its cash surrender value, or the amount currently realizable. Increases in the Home Savings' policy cash surrender value are tax exempt and death benefit proceeds received by Home Savings are tax-free. Income from these policies and changes in the cash surrender value are recorded in other income. There is no post-termination coverage, split dollar or other benefits provided to participants covered by the BOLI. Home Savings recognized $1.7 million and $1.6 million as other non-interest income based on the change in cash value of the policies in the twelve months ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nOther Assets. Other assets decreased $5.3 million during 2018. The decrease was driven by declines in various accounts receivable accounts offset by an increase in an investment related to low-income housing aggregating $3.0 million in 2018.\nTotal Deposits. Total deposits increased $256.5 million to $2.2 billion at December 31, 2018, compared to $2.0 billion at December 31, 2017. Non-interest bearing accounts increased $39.2 million during 2018 to $394.2 million while interest bearing deposits increased $217.2 million to $1.8 billion in 2018. The Company continues to see increased deposit balances in public funds, business and treasury management along with retail deposits. Brokered deposits increased $134.5 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018 as favorable pricing compared to FHLB advances led the Company to utilize this funding source more often.\nFHLB Advances. Funds needed in excess of deposit growth are borrowed in the normal course of business, if necessary. Home Savings has an established credit relationship with the FHLB of Cincinnati under which Home Savings could borrow up to an additional $403.0 million as of December 31, 2018. These borrowings are collateralized by residential mortgage loans. Of the total borrowing capacity at the FHLB, Home Savings had outstanding short term advances of $243.0 million with a rate of 2.45% at December 31, 2018 compared to a balance of $308,000 at December 31, 2017. The Company had no long term advances at December 31, 2018 compared to $48.5 million at December 31, 2017. In December of 2018, the Company elected to terminate the long term advance with the FHLB. A charge of $936,000 was incurred to terminate this advance.\nShareholders' Equity. Shareholders' equity increased $15.1 million to $309.3 million at December 31, 2018, from $294.3 million at December 31, 2017. The change was primarily driven by net income of $37.2 million offset by cash dividends of $13.0 million, an increase in accumulated other comprehensive loss of $2.8 million and an increase in treasury stock of $6.4 million. The Company repurchased 811,000 of its shares during 2018 via open market purchases.\nAccumulated other comprehensive income increased $2.8 million from December 31, 2017 to December 31, 2018. Unrealized losses on securities included in other comprehensive income have not been recognized in income at December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017 because the issuer's securities are of high credit quality (rated AA or higher), management does not intend to sell (and it is likely that management will not be required to sell) the securities prior to their anticipated recovery, and the decline in fair value is largely due to the level of longer-term interest rates in 2018 and 2017. The fair value is expected to recover as the investments approach maturity.\nEvents beyond management's control, such as fluctuations in interest rates or a downturn in the economy in areas in which Home Savings' loans and securities are concentrated, could adversely affect future earnings and consequently Home Savings' ability to meet its future capital requirements.\nBook value per common share as of December 31, 2018 was $6.30 as compared to $5.90 per common share as of December 31, 2017. Book value per share is calculated as total common equity divided by the number of common shares outstanding. Book value was impacted by the overall change in equity as discussed above.\nMaterial Changes in Operating Results for the Years Ended December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017\nNet Income. United Community recognized net income for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018, of $37.2 million, or $0.74 per diluted common share, compared to net income of $21.8 million, or $0.44 per diluted common share.\nThe significant change in earnings for 2018 was primarily a result of higher pretax income due to growth in earning assets, a lower loan provision and lower noninterest expense. Net interest income for 2018 increased $7.6 million while the provision for loan losses decreased $3.6 million during the same period. Additionally, non-interest income decreased $1.8 million and noninterest expense decreased $3.2 million primarily due to a decrease of $5.0 million of merger expense. United Community's return on average assets and return on average equity were 1.35% and 12.10%, respectively for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018 and 0.85% and 7.63%, respectively, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017. Impacting the comparison were three charges that were recognized in 2017. In the fourth quarter of 2017, a revaluation of net deferred tax assets increased tax expense $1.5 million due to the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act on December 22, 2017and an asset write down of $1.5 million, after tax, was prompted by an unfavorable ruling from an Appellate Court. For the year, non-recurring merger related expenses totaling $3.3 million, after tax, were also recognized.\nNet Interest Income. Net interest income was $88.3 million in 2018, up from the $81.3 million recorded in 2017. Net interest margin increased 2 basis points to 3.43% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018 compared to 3.41% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017.\nTotal interest income increased by $16.5 million in 2018 compared to 2017, to $111.0 million from $94.4 million. The increase is primarily a result of an increase in average net loans and loans held for sale along with an increased yield on loans. The increased loan yield was due to higher yields being realized on net loans as interest rates rose in 2018. Average net loans increased $231.1 million in 2018 compared to the same period in 2017 and yields increased 34 basis points to 4.62% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018 from 4.28% for the same period in 2017. Average loans held for sale increased $14.8 million in 2018 compared to 2017, while yields climbed to 4.49% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018 from 4.06% for the same period in 2017. Interest income from net loans increased to $96.7 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018 compared to $79.8 million for the same period in 2017, and income from loans held for sale increased to $4.3 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018 compared to $3.3 million for the same period in 2017. These increases were partially offset by a decline of $1.8 million in income on available for sale and held to maturity securities.\nInterest expense increased by $9.4 million in 2018 to $22.6 million compared to $13.2 million during the same period in 2017. This increase was due to a $114.8 million increase in average interest-bearing liabilities along with a 43 basis point increase in the cost of interest-bearing liabilities in 2018. The increase in average interest-bearing liabilities was due to growth in deposits offset by a decrease in total borrowed funds. During 2018, the Company utilized brokered certificates of deposits more often in lieu of short term FHLB advances as the deposits were priced less expensively than the advances. The increase in the cost of interest-bearing liabilities was driven by increases in yields on both deposits and borrowed funds due to rising interest rates. Interest expense related to interest-bearing deposits was $17.8 million in 2018 compared to $8.4 million in 2017. Interest expense on borrowed funds totaled $4.8 million in 2018 compared to $4.7 million in 2017.\nProvision for Loan Losses. A provision for loan losses is charged to income to bring the total allowance for loan losses to a level considered by management to be adequate, based on management's evaluation of such factors as the delinquency status of loans, current economic conditions, the net realizable value of the underlying collateral, changes in the composition of the loan portfolio and prior loan loss experience. The Company recognized a loan loss provision of $700,000 in 2018, compared to $4.3 million in 2017. The decrease in provision expense during 2018 was driven by lower net charge-offs and the release of reserves due to lower quantitative and qualitative factors offset by strong loan growth. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2018, net charge-offs to average outstanding loans were 7 basis points. This compares to 12 basis points for the same period in 2017.\nNoninterest Income. Non-interest income was $23.4 million in 2018 compared to $25.2 million in 2017. Negatively impacting the comparison was a decline in mortgage banking income of $1.4 million during 2018 along with losses on the sale of available for sale securities of $627,000 compared to gains on the sale of available for sale securities of $566,000 during 2017. There was also a one-time gain of $595,000 in 2017 for the sale of a building the Company owned that did not reoccur in 2018. Offsetting these items were increases of $191,000 for insurance agency income, $299,000 for mortgage servicing income, $287,000 for trust fee income and $105,000 for bank owned life insurance. In addition, the Company sold approximately 50% of the Company's VISA Class B shares and moved the remainder of the shares into trading securities. The gain resulting from these two transactions resulted in a gain of $669,000 for 2018.\nNoninterest Expense. Non-interest expense was $65.1 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018, which represented a decrease of $3.2 million, from the twelve months ended December 31, 2017. Positively impacting this comparison was merger related expenses totaling $5.0 million in 2017 and the recognition of a $2.3 million asset write down in 2017. The efficiency ratio decreased to 56.85% for 2018 compared to 64.28% for 2017.\nFederal Income Taxes. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2018, the Company recognized tax expense of $8.4 million on pre-tax income of $45.6 million, compared to tax expense of $11.3 million on pre-tax income of $33.1 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017. The primary reason for the variance was the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act on December 22, 2017 which lowered the Company's marginal tax rate from 35% to 21%. In addition, the Company recognized $1.5 million of additional tax expense in 2017 from the revaluation of its deferred tax assets due to this change in tax law.\nMaterial Changes in Operating Results for the Years Ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016\nNet Income. United Community recognized net income for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, of $21.8 million, or $0.44 per diluted common share, compared to net income of $18.8 million, or $0.40 per diluted common share as of December 31, 2016.\nThe significant change in earnings for 2017 was primarily a result of higher pretax income due to the merger and organic growth. Net interest income for 2017 increased $18.3 million while the provision for loan losses decreased $1.1 million during the same period. Additionally, non-interest income increased $3.2 million and noninterest expense increased $16.2 million with $4.2 million of the increase related to merger costs. United Community's return on average assets and return on average equity were 0.85% and 7.63%, respectively for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 and 0.91% and 7.58%, respectively, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016. Impacting the comparison were three charges that were recognized. In the fourth quarter, a revaluation of net deferred tax assets increased tax expense $1.5 million and an asset write down of $1.5 million, after tax, was prompted by an unfavorable ruling from an Appellate Court. For the year, non-recurring merger related expenses totaling $3.3 million, after tax, were also recognized.\nNet Interest Income. Net interest income was $81.3 million in 2017, up from the $63.0 million recorded in 2016. Net interest margin increased 17 basis points to 3.41% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 compared to 3.24% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016.\nTotal interest income increased by $23.0 million in 2017 compared to 2016, to $94.4 million from $71.4 million. The increase is primarily a result of an increase in average net loans and loans held for sale and along with increased yield on loans and securities. The increased loan yield was due to the impact of purchase accounting adjustments from the merger along with higher yields being realized on net loans as interest rates rose in 2017. Average net loans increased $461.2 million in 2017 compared to the same period in 2016 and yields increased 15 basis points to 4.28% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 from 4.13% for the same period in 2016. Average loans held for sale increased $35.5 million in 2017 compared to 2016, while yields climbed to 4.06% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 from 3.82% for the same period in 2016. Interest income from net loans increased to $79.8 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 compared to $57.9 million for the same period in 2016, and income from loans held for sale increased to $3.3 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 compared to $1.8 million for the same period in 2016. These increases were partially offset by a decline of $1.1 million in income on available for sale and held to maturity securities.\nInterest expense increased by $4.7 million in 2017 to $13.2 million compared to $8.4 million during the same period in 2016. This increase was due to a $349.1 million increase in average interest-bearing liabilities along with a 14 basis point increase in the cost of interest-bearing liabilities in 2017. The increase in average interest-bearing liabilities was due to the merger, organic growth in deposits and an increased used of brokered certificates of deposit. The increase in the cost of interest-bearing liabilities was primarily driven by increases in yields on brokered certificates of deposits and borrowed funds due to rising interest rates. Interest expense related to interest-bearing deposits was $8.4 million in 2017 compared to $5.9 million in 2016. Interest expense on borrowed funds totaled $13.2 million in 2017 compared to $8.4 million in 2016.\nProvision for Loan Losses. A provision for loan losses is charged to income to bring the total allowance for loan losses to a level considered by management to be adequate, based on management's evaluation of such factors as the delinquency status of loans, current economic conditions, the net realizable value of the underlying collateral, changes in the composition of the loan portfolio and prior loan loss experience. The Company recognized a loan loss provision of $4.3 million in 2017, compared to $5.4 million in 2016. The decrease in provision expense during 2017 was driven by lower net charge-offs offset by strong loan growth. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, net charge-offs to average outstanding loans were 12 basis points. This compares to 29 basis points for the same period in 2016. The Company recorded a charge-off of $2.5 million during 2016, related to one long-held nonresidential commercial real estate loan which contributed to the higher charge-off ratio.\nNoninterest Income. Non-interest income was $25.2 million in 2017 compared to $22.1 million in 2016. Positively impacting the comparison was the benefit of trust fee income totaling $1.6 million associated with the merger of OLCB. Also contributing to the change were increases of $320,000 for insurance agency income, $150,000 for deposit related fees, $274,000 for mortgage banking income, $369,000 for debit/credit card fees and a one-time gain of $595,000 for the sale of a building the Company owned. Offsetting this was a $123,000 decline in brokerage income and a $96,000 increase in the losses associated with the sale of real estate owned and other repossessed assets.\nNoninterest Expense. Non-interest expense was $68.3 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, which represented an increase of $16.2 million, or 31.2%, from the twelve months ended December 31, 2016. The merger of OLCB and the operating expenses of the acquired branches for the year negatively affected the current comparison along with an increase in merger related expenses. The merger related expenses totaled $5.0 million in 2017 compared to $787,000 in 2016. In addition, the Company recognized a $2.3 million asset write down in 2017. In 2003, Home Savings entered into two development loans on which the borrower subsequently filed bankruptcy, and a court appointed receiver liquidated the collateral. The proceeds from the sale of the collateral have remained in escrow with the court since 2007 as a number of competing claims were made against the proceeds. In 2011, a lower court affirmed Home Savings' priority position in the proceeds, and its lien validity was affirmed by the same court in 2016. However, in December 2017, an appellate court ruled that a portion of the proceeds should be awarded to another claimant. The $2.3 million charge reflects the Appellate court ruling. The efficiency ratio increased to 64.28% for 2017 compared to 61.01% for 2016 primarily due to the merger expenses and the write down.\nFederal Income Taxes. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, the Company recognized tax expense of $11.3 million on pre-tax income of $33.1 million, compared to tax expense of $8.1 million on pre-tax income of $27.0 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016. The primary reason for the variance was higher pre-tax income. In addition, the Company recognized $1.5 million of additional tax expense in 2017 from the revaluation of its deferred tax assets and liabilities due to the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act on December 22, 2017.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe accounting and reporting policies of United Community comply with accounting principles generally accepted within the United States of America and conform to general practices within the financial services industry. Application of these principles requires management to make estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. These estimates, assumptions and judgments are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements. Accordingly, as this information changes, the financial statements could reflect different estimates, assumptions and judgments.\nThe most significant accounting policies followed by United Community are presented in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements. Accounting and reporting policies for the allowance for loan losses, income taxes, mortgage servicing rights and other-than-temporary impairment are deemed critical since they involve the use of estimates and require significant management judgments. Application of assumptions different from those used by management could result in material changes in United Community's financial position or results of operations.\nAllowance for Loan Losses. The allowance for loan losses is an amount that management believes will be adequate to absorb probable incurred losses in existing loans taking into consideration such factors as past loss experience, changes in the nature and volume of the portfolio, overall portfolio quality, loan concentrations, specific problem loans, collateral values securing loans and current economic conditions that affect the borrower's ability to pay. Determination of the allowance inherently is subjective due to the aforementioned reasons. Loan losses are charged-off against the allowance when management believes that the full collectability of the loan is unlikely. Recoveries of amounts previously charged-off are credited to the allowance.\nHome Savings maintains a well-documented methodology for maintaining an allowance for loan losses that management believes is compliant with all applicable regulatory guidance and GAAP. The documentation of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is reviewed by the board of directors on a quarterly basis.\nThe allowance is based on management's evaluation of homogeneous groups of loans (single-family residential mortgage loans and all consumer credit except marine loans) to which loss factors have been applied, as well as an evaluation of individual credits (multi-family, nonresidential mortgage loans, marine loans and commercial loans) based on internal risk ratings, collateral and other unique characteristics of each loan.\nManagement believes that it uses the best information available to determine the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses. However, future adjustments to the allowance may be necessary and the results of operations could be significantly and adversely affected if circumstances differ substantially from the assumptions used in making the determinations.\nLoans Held for Sale. Mortgage loans originated and intended for sale in the secondary market are carried at fair value, as determined by outstanding commitments from investors. Net unrealized losses, if any, are recorded as a valuation allowance and charged to earnings.\nMortgage loans held for sale are generally sold with servicing rights retained. The carrying value of mortgage loans sold is reduced by the amount allocated to the servicing right. Gains and losses on sales of mortgage loans are based on the difference between the selling price and the carrying value of the related loan sold.\nThe fair value of conventional loans held for sale is determined using the current 15 day forward contract price for either 15 or 30 year conventional mortgages and the 60 day forward contract price for either 15 or 30 year Federal Housing Authority mortgages. Additionally, the fair value of permanent construction loans held for sale is determined using the current 60 day forward contract price for 30 year conventional mortgages which is then adjusted by extrapolating this rate to the estimated time period remaining until construction is complete. The fair value is also adjusted for unobservable market data such as estimated fall out rate and the estimated time from origination to completion of construction.\nMortgage Servicing Rights. The cost of mortgage loans sold or securitized is allocated between the mortgage servicing rights and the mortgage loans based on the relative fair values of each. The fair value of the mortgage servicing rights is determined by using a discounted cash flow model, which estimates the present value of the future net cash flows of the servicing portfolio, about which management must make assumptions considering future expectations based on various factors, such as servicing costs, expected prepayment speeds and discount rates.\nMortgage servicing rights are amortized in proportion to, and over the period of, estimated net servicing income. Management evaluates mortgage servicing rights for impairment on a quarterly basis by stratifying the loans by original maturity, interest rate and loan type. Impairment is measured by estimating the fair value of each pool, taking into consideration the estimated level of\nprepayments based upon current industry expectations. An impairment allowance is recorded for a pool when, and in an amount which, its fair value is less than its carrying value.\nThe value of mortgage servicing rights is subject to prepayment risk. Future expected net cash flows from servicing a loan will not be realized if the loan pays off earlier than anticipated. Since most of these loans do not contain prepayment penalties, the Company receives no economic benefit if the loan pays off earlier than anticipated.\nIncome Taxes. We are subject to the income tax laws of the United States, its states and the municipalities in which we operate. These tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and the relevant government taxing authorities. We review income tax expense and the carrying value of deferred tax assets quarterly, and as new information becomes available, the balances are adjusted as appropriate. We assess any uncertain tax positions using a recognition threshold of more-likely-than-not, and a measurement attribute for all tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return, in order for those tax positions to be recognized in the financial statements.\nValuation of Investment Securities. Management evaluates securities for other-than-temporary impairment on at least a quarterly basis, and more frequently when economic or market concerns warrant such evaluation. When an other-than-temporary impairment has occurred, the amount of the other-than-temporary impairment recognized in earnings depends on whether we intend to sell the security or more likely than not will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis less any current-period credit loss. To determine whether impairment is other-than-temporary, we consider all available information relevant to the collectability of the security, including past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts when developing estimates of cash flows expected to be collected. Factors considered in this assessment include the reasons for the impairment, the severity and duration of the impairment, changes in value subsequent to year-end, forecasted performance of the obligor, and the general market conditions in the geographic area or industry the investee operates in.\nIf we intend to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis less any current-period credit loss, the impairment is recognized in earnings equal to the entire difference between the investment's amortized cost basis and its fair value at the balance sheet date. If we do not intend to sell the security and it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis less any current-period credit loss, the other-than-temporary impairment is separated, into the amount representing the credit loss and the amount related to all other factors. The amount of the total other-than-temporary impairment related to the credit loss is recognized in earnings. The amount of the total impairment related to other factors is recognized in other comprehensive income.\nYields Earned and Rates Paid\nThe following table sets forth certain information relating to United Community's average balance sheet and reflects the average yield on interest earning assets, on a fully tax equivalent basis, and the average cost of interest bearing liabilities for the periods indicated. Such yields and costs are derived by dividing income or expense by the average balances of interest earning assets or interest bearing liabilities, respectively, for the periods presented. Average balances are derived from daily balances. Nonaccruing loans have been included in the table as loans carrying a zero yield. Loan fees are included in interest income. The average balance for securities available for sale is computed using the carrying value, and the average yield on securities available for sale has been computed using the historical amortized cost average balance.\nTable 94: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td>

Like most financial institutions, Home Savings' short-term interest income and interest expense are significantly affected by changes in market interest rates and other economic factors beyond its control. Accordingly, Home Savings' earnings could be adversely affected during a continued period of low interest rates or a continued period of rising interest rates.\nThe impact of changes in interest rates is further described in", "summary": "- I'm sorry, but I am unable to complete your request because I am unable to identify the specific cells in the table you would like to copy.\n- Would you be able to clarify which cells you would like to copy?

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nGeneral\nUnited Community was incorporated in the State of Ohio in February 1998 for the purpose of owning all of the outstanding capital stock of Home Savings issued upon the Conversion, which was completed on July 8, 1998.\nThe following discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations of United Community and its subsidiary, Home Savings, should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements, and the notes thereto, included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOverview\nOn January 31, 2017, United Community completed its acquisition of Ohio Legacy Corp (OLCB). Pursuant to the terms of the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated September 8, 2016, among United Community, OLCB, Premier Bank & Trust, OLCB's wholly owned subsidiary bank (PB&T), The Home Savings and Loan Company of Youngstown, Ohio, United Community's wholly owned subsidiary bank (the Merger Agreement), OLCB was merged with and into United Community (the merger). Immediately following the merger, Home Savings was merged with and into PB&T and the surviving bank changed its name to Home Savings Bank.\u201d\nAs a result of the merger and in accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement, each preferred share of OLCB was deemed to have been converted into OLCB common shares. Each OLCB common share was converted into the right to receive either $18.00 in cash or 2.736 United Community common shares, subject to certain allocation procedures set forth in the Merger Agreement that ensured that 50% of OLCB's common shares outstanding were converted into United Community common shares, and 50% of OLCB's common shares outstanding were converted into the right to receive the cash consideration. The Company paid cash in lieu of issuing fractional shares. This transaction resulted in the addition of approximately $349.3 million in assets and the addition of four branches in Summit, Stark and Belmont counties. See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding this transaction.\nIn addition to Home Savings, United Community operates through three other wholly-owned subsidiaries: HSB Insurance, LLC, HSB Capital, LLC and HSB Insurance, Inc. HSB Capital, LLC was formed as an Ohio limited liability company by United Community during 2016 for the purpose of providing mezzanine funding for customers of the Bank. Mezzanine loans are offered by HSB Capital, LLC to customers in United Community's market area, as defined below, and are expected to be repaid from the cash flow from operations of the business.\nHSB Insurance, LLC, (d/b/a James & Sons Insurance), United Community's wholly-owned insurance subsidiary, was formed on April 6, 2016 to acquire James & Sons Insurance. As a result of this acquisition, HSB Insurance, LLC now offers a variety of insurance products for business and residential customers, including auto, homeowners, life-health, commercial, surety bonds and aviation, within United Community's market area. HSB Insurance, LLC completed two additional acquisitions of insurance companies in 2017 and one in 2018 to expand its offerings and market area.\nHSB Insurance, Inc., a Delaware-based captive insurance company, was formed by United Community and began operations on June 1, 2017. HSB Insurance, Inc. insures against certain risks unique to the operations of United Community and its subsidiaries and for which insurance may not be currently available or economically feasible in today's insurance marketplace. HSB Insurance, Inc. pools resources with several other similar insurance company subsidiaries of financial institutions to spread a limited amount of risk among themselves. HSB Insurance, Inc. is subject to regulations of the State of Delaware and undergoes periodic examinations by the Delaware Division of Insurance.\nMaterial Changes in Financial Condition\nCash and cash equivalents increased $14.1 million, or 30.1%, to $61.0 million at December 31, 2018, compared to $46.9 million at December 31, 2017. Cash and cash equivalents increased in 2018 primarily as a result of increased fed funds sold on hand at the end of the year.\nTrading securities increased to $364,000 at December 31, 2018. The Company had no trading securities as of December 31, 2017. During the fourth quarter of 2018, the Company sold approximately 50% of its Visa Class B shares and the remaining shares were placed into trading securities at fair market value.\nAvailable for sale securities decreased $28.9 million, or 10.7% to $241.6 million at December 31, 2018. The change in available for sale securities was affected by maturities, pay downs and amortization totaling $12.6 million and sales of $36.6 million. There was also a decrease in the market value adjustment on the securities totaling $3.7 million. Partially offsetting this were purchases during 2018 of $24.0 million. The balance of the unrealized loss position at December 31, 2018 was $4.8 million, pretax, compared to a loss position of $1.1 million, pretax, at December 31, 2017. The unrealized loss position recognized in available for sale securities is primarily driven by market conditions. To that end, the Company expects to receive all principal and interest payments contractually due and has no intent to sell and more than likely will not be required to sell these securities until maturity. The majority of the securities are Government Sponsored Entities (GSE) issued debt, mortgage-backed securities or collateralized mortgage obligations and carry the same rating as the U.S. Government.\nThe duration of the available for sale securities portfolio was approximately 5.2 years at December 31, 2018. There is risk that longer-term rates could rise, resulting in greater unrealized losses. It is also possible, however, that longer term rates could fall, resulting in the recovery of all of the unrealized losses. Management continues to allow the balance of the portfolio to decline as planned. In addition, the Company may look for opportunities to sell securities and replace them with securities to change the duration characteristics of the portfolio and/or change the mix of the portfolio.\nHeld to maturity securities decreased $5.4 million, or 6.5% to $77.5 million at December 31, 2018. The change in held to maturity securities is the result of maturities, pay downs and amortization offset by the purchase of $3.8 million in securities during the year.\nAt December 31, 2018, there were no loans held for sale, carried at lower of cost or market, and $91.5 million of loans held for sale, carried at fair value. Loans held for sale, carried at lower of cost or market, were $211,000 and loans held for sale, carried at fair value, were $83.5 million at December 31, 2017. The increase in loans held for sale, carried at fair value, was primarily attributable to the originations of permanent construction loans during the period. These loans are not sold until construction of the residence is complete, which is usually within nine to ten months of origination. Home Savings continues to sell a majority of its newly originated fixed rate mortgage loans into the secondary market as part of its risk management strategy and anticipates continuing to do so in the future.\nNet loans increased $177.0 million, or 8.9%, to $2.2 billion at December 31, 2018, compared to $2.0 billion at December 31, 2017. Total commercial loans increased $120.3 million in 2018 while total residential mortgage loans increased $50.7 million and total consumer loans increased $3.5 million. The Company continues to focus on growth in commercial real estate and commercial and industrial loans. See Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the composition of net loans.\nAllowance for Loan Losses. The allowance for loan losses is a valuation allowance for probable incurred credit losses established through a provision for probable loan losses charged to expense. The allowance for loan losses was $20.4 million at December 31, 2018, compared to $21.2 million at December 31, 2017. The allowance for loan losses as a percentage of loans was 0.93% at December 31, 2018, compared to 1.05% at December 31, 2017. This change is a result of growth in the loan portfolio along with improving credit metrics which lowered the amount of allowance for loan losses. The allowance for loan losses as a percentage of nonperforming loans was 312.6% at December 31, 2018, compared to 181.2% at December 31, 2017. Loan losses are charged against the allowance when the uncollectability of a loan balance is confirmed. Subsequent recoveries, if any, are added back to the allowance. Home Savings' allowance for loan loss methodology includes allowance allocations calculated in accordance with ASC Topic 310, Receivables,\u201d and allowance allocations calculated in accordance with ASC Topic 450, Contingencies\u201d. Accordingly, the methodology is based on historical loss experience by type of credit plus specific loss allocations and adjustments for current events and conditions. Home Savings' process for determining the appropriate level of the allowance for probable loan losses is designed to account for credit deterioration as it occurs. The provision for probable loan losses reflects loan quality trends, including the levels of and trends related to nonaccrual loans, past due loans, classified loans and net charge-offs or recoveries, among other factors.\nDuring 2018, the Company recorded a loan loss provision of $699,000. This recognition was primarily due to the growth of the loan portfolio and, to a lesser extent, net charge-offs, offset by improvements in factors used in calculating the allowance for loan loss reserve.\nImpaired Loans. A loan is considered impaired when there is a deterioration of the credit worthiness of the borrower to the extent that there is no longer reasonable assurance of the timely collection of the full amount of principal and interest. The total outstanding balance of all impaired loans was $20.6 million at December 31, 2018 as compared to $26.2 million at December 31, 2017. The decrease in impaired loans can be largely attributed to the resolution of loans through principal payments, charge-offs, sale of the loan or collateral or by Home Savings taking possession of the collateral.\nIncluded in impaired loans above are certain loans Home Savings considers to be troubled debt restructurings (TDR). A loan is considered a TDR if Home Savings grants a concession to a debtor experiencing financial difficulty that it would otherwise not consider. The concession either stems from an agreement between the creditor and the debtor or is imposed by law or a court. If the debtor is not currently experiencing financial difficulties but would probably be in payment default in the future without the modification, then this type of restructure also could be considered a TDR.\nA restructured loan that has fallen into nonaccrual status will return to accruing status if either of the following criteria are met: (i) none of the principal and interest is due or unpaid and Home Savings expects repayment of the remaining contractual principal and interest, or (ii) the borrower has resumed paying the full amount of the scheduled contractual interest and principal payments on a loan that is between 30 and 89 days past due and there is reasonable assurance of prepayment established through payment performance over a period of six months. TDR loans aggregated $16.6 million at December 31, 2018 compared to $19.8 million at December 31, 2017. TDR loans that were on nonaccrual status aggregated $1.7 million and $2.4 million at December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively. Such loans are considered nonperforming loans. TDR loans that were accruing according to their terms aggregated $14.9 million and $17.9 million at December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively.\nNonperforming Loans. Nonperforming loans consist of nonaccrual loans and loans past due 90 days and still accruing. Nonperforming loans were $6.5 million, or 0.30% of total loans, at December 31, 2018, compared to $11.7 million, or 0.59% of total loans, at December 31, 2017.\nGenerally, loans are placed on nonaccrual status if principal or interest payments become 90 days past due and/or management deems the collectability of the principal and/or interest to be in question, as well as when required by regulatory guidance. Loans to a customer whose financial condition has deteriorated are considered for nonaccrual status whether or not the loan is 90 or more days past due. Once interest accruals are discontinued, accrued but uncollected interest is charged to current year operations. Subsequent cash receipts on nonaccrual loans are recorded as a reduction of principal. Interest income is recorded only after principal recovery is reasonably assured. Classification of a loan as nonaccrual does not preclude the ultimate collection of loan principal or interest.\nFederal Home Loan Bank Stock. FHLB stock was $19.1 million at December 31, 2018 compared to $19.3 million at December 31, 2017. The decrease was due to a redemption of stock by the FHLB during 2018. In 2018, the FHLB paid cash dividends of $1.1 million in lieu of stock dividends to its member banks.\nReal Estate Owned and Other Repossessed Assets. Real estate owned and other repossessed assets decreased $165,000 during the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. Property acquired in the settlement of loans is recorded at the lower of the loan's acquisition balance less cost to sell or the fair market value of the property secured less costs to sell. Appraisals are obtained at least annually on properties that exceed $1.0 million in value. Based on current appraisals, a valuation allowance may be established to reflect properly the asset at fair value.\nBank Owned Life Insurance. Bank Owned Life Insurance (BOLI) is maintained on select officers and employees of Home Savings whereby Home Savings is the beneficiary. BOLI is recorded at its cash surrender value, or the amount currently realizable. Increases in the Home Savings' policy cash surrender value are tax exempt and death benefit proceeds received by Home Savings are tax-free. Income from these policies and changes in the cash surrender value are recorded in other income. There is no post-termination coverage, split dollar or other benefits provided to participants covered by the BOLI. Home Savings recognized $1.7 million and $1.6 million as other non-interest income based on the change in cash value of the policies in the twelve months ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nOther Assets. Other assets decreased $5.3 million during 2018. The decrease was driven by declines in various accounts receivable accounts offset by an increase in an investment related to low-income housing aggregating $3.0 million in 2018.\nTotal Deposits. Total deposits increased $256.5 million to $2.2 billion at December 31, 2018, compared to $2.0 billion at December 31, 2017. Non-interest bearing accounts increased $39.2 million during 2018 to $394.2 million while interest bearing deposits increased $217.2 million to $1.8 billion in 2018. The Company continues to see increased deposit balances in public funds, business and treasury management along with retail deposits. Brokered deposits increased $134.5 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018 as favorable pricing compared to FHLB advances led the Company to utilize this funding source more often.\nFHLB Advances. Funds needed in excess of deposit growth are borrowed in the normal course of business, if necessary. Home Savings has an established credit relationship with the FHLB of Cincinnati under which Home Savings could borrow up to an additional $403.0 million as of December 31, 2018. These borrowings are collateralized by residential mortgage loans. Of the total borrowing capacity at the FHLB, Home Savings had outstanding short term advances of $243.0 million with a rate of 2.45% at December 31, 2018 compared to a balance of $308,000 at December 31, 2017. The Company had no long term advances at December 31, 2018 compared to $48.5 million at December 31, 2017. In December of 2018, the Company elected to terminate the long term advance with the FHLB. A charge of $936,000 was incurred to terminate this advance.\nShareholders' Equity. Shareholders' equity increased $15.1 million to $309.3 million at December 31, 2018, from $294.3 million at December 31, 2017. The change was primarily driven by net income of $37.2 million offset by cash dividends of $13.0 million, an increase in accumulated other comprehensive loss of $2.8 million and an increase in treasury stock of $6.4 million. The Company repurchased 811,000 of its shares during 2018 via open market purchases.\nAccumulated other comprehensive income increased $2.8 million from December 31, 2017 to December 31, 2018. Unrealized losses on securities included in other comprehensive income have not been recognized in income at December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017 because the issuer's securities are of high credit quality (rated AA or higher), management does not intend to sell (and it is likely that management will not be required to sell) the securities prior to their anticipated recovery, and the decline in fair value is largely due to the level of longer-term interest rates in 2018 and 2017. The fair value is expected to recover as the investments approach maturity.\nEvents beyond management's control, such as fluctuations in interest rates or a downturn in the economy in areas in which Home Savings' loans and securities are concentrated, could adversely affect future earnings and consequently Home Savings' ability to meet its future capital requirements.\nBook value per common share as of December 31, 2018 was $6.30 as compared to $5.90 per common share as of December 31, 2017. Book value per share is calculated as total common equity divided by the number of common shares outstanding. Book value was impacted by the overall change in equity as discussed above.\nMaterial Changes in Operating Results for the Years Ended December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017\nNet Income. United Community recognized net income for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018, of $37.2 million, or $0.74 per diluted common share, compared to net income of $21.8 million, or $0.44 per diluted common share.\nThe significant change in earnings for 2018 was primarily a result of higher pretax income due to growth in earning assets, a lower loan provision and lower noninterest expense. Net interest income for 2018 increased $7.6 million while the provision for loan losses decreased $3.6 million during the same period. Additionally, non-interest income decreased $1.8 million and noninterest expense decreased $3.2 million primarily due to a decrease of $5.0 million of merger expense. United Community's return on average assets and return on average equity were 1.35% and 12.10%, respectively for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018 and 0.85% and 7.63%, respectively, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017. Impacting the comparison were three charges that were recognized in 2017. In the fourth quarter of 2017, a revaluation of net deferred tax assets increased tax expense $1.5 million due to the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act on December 22, 2017and an asset write down of $1.5 million, after tax, was prompted by an unfavorable ruling from an Appellate Court. For the year, non-recurring merger related expenses totaling $3.3 million, after tax, were also recognized.\nNet Interest Income. Net interest income was $88.3 million in 2018, up from the $81.3 million recorded in 2017. Net interest margin increased 2 basis points to 3.43% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018 compared to 3.41% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017.\nTotal interest income increased by $16.5 million in 2018 compared to 2017, to $111.0 million from $94.4 million. The increase is primarily a result of an increase in average net loans and loans held for sale along with an increased yield on loans. The increased loan yield was due to higher yields being realized on net loans as interest rates rose in 2018. Average net loans increased $231.1 million in 2018 compared to the same period in 2017 and yields increased 34 basis points to 4.62% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018 from 4.28% for the same period in 2017. Average loans held for sale increased $14.8 million in 2018 compared to 2017, while yields climbed to 4.49% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018 from 4.06% for the same period in 2017. Interest income from net loans increased to $96.7 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018 compared to $79.8 million for the same period in 2017, and income from loans held for sale increased to $4.3 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018 compared to $3.3 million for the same period in 2017. These increases were partially offset by a decline of $1.8 million in income on available for sale and held to maturity securities.\nInterest expense increased by $9.4 million in 2018 to $22.6 million compared to $13.2 million during the same period in 2017. This increase was due to a $114.8 million increase in average interest-bearing liabilities along with a 43 basis point increase in the cost of interest-bearing liabilities in 2018. The increase in average interest-bearing liabilities was due to growth in deposits offset by a decrease in total borrowed funds. During 2018, the Company utilized brokered certificates of deposits more often in lieu of short term FHLB advances as the deposits were priced less expensively than the advances. The increase in the cost of interest-bearing liabilities was driven by increases in yields on both deposits and borrowed funds due to rising interest rates. Interest expense related to interest-bearing deposits was $17.8 million in 2018 compared to $8.4 million in 2017. Interest expense on borrowed funds totaled $4.8 million in 2018 compared to $4.7 million in 2017.\nProvision for Loan Losses. A provision for loan losses is charged to income to bring the total allowance for loan losses to a level considered by management to be adequate, based on management's evaluation of such factors as the delinquency status of loans, current economic conditions, the net realizable value of the underlying collateral, changes in the composition of the loan portfolio and prior loan loss experience. The Company recognized a loan loss provision of $700,000 in 2018, compared to $4.3 million in 2017. The decrease in provision expense during 2018 was driven by lower net charge-offs and the release of reserves due to lower quantitative and qualitative factors offset by strong loan growth. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2018, net charge-offs to average outstanding loans were 7 basis points. This compares to 12 basis points for the same period in 2017.\nNoninterest Income. Non-interest income was $23.4 million in 2018 compared to $25.2 million in 2017. Negatively impacting the comparison was a decline in mortgage banking income of $1.4 million during 2018 along with losses on the sale of available for sale securities of $627,000 compared to gains on the sale of available for sale securities of $566,000 during 2017. There was also a one-time gain of $595,000 in 2017 for the sale of a building the Company owned that did not reoccur in 2018. Offsetting these items were increases of $191,000 for insurance agency income, $299,000 for mortgage servicing income, $287,000 for trust fee income and $105,000 for bank owned life insurance. In addition, the Company sold approximately 50% of the Company's VISA Class B shares and moved the remainder of the shares into trading securities. The gain resulting from these two transactions resulted in a gain of $669,000 for 2018.\nNoninterest Expense. Non-interest expense was $65.1 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018, which represented a decrease of $3.2 million, from the twelve months ended December 31, 2017. Positively impacting this comparison was merger related expenses totaling $5.0 million in 2017 and the recognition of a $2.3 million asset write down in 2017. The efficiency ratio decreased to 56.85% for 2018 compared to 64.28% for 2017.\nFederal Income Taxes. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2018, the Company recognized tax expense of $8.4 million on pre-tax income of $45.6 million, compared to tax expense of $11.3 million on pre-tax income of $33.1 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017. The primary reason for the variance was the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act on December 22, 2017 which lowered the Company's marginal tax rate from 35% to 21%. In addition, the Company recognized $1.5 million of additional tax expense in 2017 from the revaluation of its deferred tax assets due to this change in tax law.\nMaterial Changes in Operating Results for the Years Ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016\nNet Income. United Community recognized net income for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, of $21.8 million, or $0.44 per diluted common share, compared to net income of $18.8 million, or $0.40 per diluted common share as of December 31, 2016.\nThe significant change in earnings for 2017 was primarily a result of higher pretax income due to the merger and organic growth. Net interest income for 2017 increased $18.3 million while the provision for loan losses decreased $1.1 million during the same period. Additionally, non-interest income increased $3.2 million and noninterest expense increased $16.2 million with $4.2 million of the increase related to merger costs. United Community's return on average assets and return on average equity were 0.85% and 7.63%, respectively for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 and 0.91% and 7.58%, respectively, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016. Impacting the comparison were three charges that were recognized. In the fourth quarter, a revaluation of net deferred tax assets increased tax expense $1.5 million and an asset write down of $1.5 million, after tax, was prompted by an unfavorable ruling from an Appellate Court. For the year, non-recurring merger related expenses totaling $3.3 million, after tax, were also recognized.\nNet Interest Income. Net interest income was $81.3 million in 2017, up from the $63.0 million recorded in 2016. Net interest margin increased 17 basis points to 3.41% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 compared to 3.24% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016.\nTotal interest income increased by $23.0 million in 2017 compared to 2016, to $94.4 million from $71.4 million. The increase is primarily a result of an increase in average net loans and loans held for sale and along with increased yield on loans and securities. The increased loan yield was due to the impact of purchase accounting adjustments from the merger along with higher yields being realized on net loans as interest rates rose in 2017. Average net loans increased $461.2 million in 2017 compared to the same period in 2016 and yields increased 15 basis points to 4.28% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 from 4.13% for the same period in 2016. Average loans held for sale increased $35.5 million in 2017 compared to 2016, while yields climbed to 4.06% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 from 3.82% for the same period in 2016. Interest income from net loans increased to $79.8 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 compared to $57.9 million for the same period in 2016, and income from loans held for sale increased to $3.3 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 compared to $1.8 million for the same period in 2016. These increases were partially offset by a decline of $1.1 million in income on available for sale and held to maturity securities.\nInterest expense increased by $4.7 million in 2017 to $13.2 million compared to $8.4 million during the same period in 2016. This increase was due to a $349.1 million increase in average interest-bearing liabilities along with a 14 basis point increase in the cost of interest-bearing liabilities in 2017. The increase in average interest-bearing liabilities was due to the merger, organic growth in deposits and an increased used of brokered certificates of deposit. The increase in the cost of interest-bearing liabilities was primarily driven by increases in yields on brokered certificates of deposits and borrowed funds due to rising interest rates. Interest expense related to interest-bearing deposits was $8.4 million in 2017 compared to $5.9 million in 2016. Interest expense on borrowed funds totaled $13.2 million in 2017 compared to $8.4 million in 2016.\nProvision for Loan Losses. A provision for loan losses is charged to income to bring the total allowance for loan losses to a level considered by management to be adequate, based on management's evaluation of such factors as the delinquency status of loans, current economic conditions, the net realizable value of the underlying collateral, changes in the composition of the loan portfolio and prior loan loss experience. The Company recognized a loan loss provision of $4.3 million in 2017, compared to $5.4 million in 2016. The decrease in provision expense during 2017 was driven by lower net charge-offs offset by strong loan growth. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, net charge-offs to average outstanding loans were 12 basis points. This compares to 29 basis points for the same period in 2016. The Company recorded a charge-off of $2.5 million during 2016, related to one long-held nonresidential commercial real estate loan which contributed to the higher charge-off ratio.\nNoninterest Income. Non-interest income was $25.2 million in 2017 compared to $22.1 million in 2016. Positively impacting the comparison was the benefit of trust fee income totaling $1.6 million associated with the merger of OLCB. Also contributing to the change were increases of $320,000 for insurance agency income, $150,000 for deposit related fees, $274,000 for mortgage banking income, $369,000 for debit/credit card fees and a one-time gain of $595,000 for the sale of a building the Company owned. Offsetting this was a $123,000 decline in brokerage income and a $96,000 increase in the losses associated with the sale of real estate owned and other repossessed assets.\nNoninterest Expense. Non-interest expense was $68.3 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, which represented an increase of $16.2 million, or 31.2%, from the twelve months ended December 31, 2016. The merger of OLCB and the operating expenses of the acquired branches for the year negatively affected the current comparison along with an increase in merger related expenses. The merger related expenses totaled $5.0 million in 2017 compared to $787,000 in 2016. In addition, the Company recognized a $2.3 million asset write down in 2017. In 2003, Home Savings entered into two development loans on which the borrower subsequently filed bankruptcy, and a court appointed receiver liquidated the collateral. The proceeds from the sale of the collateral have remained in escrow with the court since 2007 as a number of competing claims were made against the proceeds. In 2011, a lower court affirmed Home Savings' priority position in the proceeds, and its lien validity was affirmed by the same court in 2016. However, in December 2017, an appellate court ruled that a portion of the proceeds should be awarded to another claimant. The $2.3 million charge reflects the Appellate court ruling. The efficiency ratio increased to 64.28% for 2017 compared to 61.01% for 2016 primarily due to the merger expenses and the write down.\nFederal Income Taxes. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, the Company recognized tax expense of $11.3 million on pre-tax income of $33.1 million, compared to tax expense of $8.1 million on pre-tax income of $27.0 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016. The primary reason for the variance was higher pre-tax income. In addition, the Company recognized $1.5 million of additional tax expense in 2017 from the revaluation of its deferred tax assets and liabilities due to the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act on December 22, 2017.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe accounting and reporting policies of United Community comply with accounting principles generally accepted within the United States of America and conform to general practices within the financial services industry. Application of these principles requires management to make estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. These estimates, assumptions and judgments are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements. Accordingly, as this information changes, the financial statements could reflect different estimates, assumptions and judgments.\nThe most significant accounting policies followed by United Community are presented in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements. Accounting and reporting policies for the allowance for loan losses, income taxes, mortgage servicing rights and other-than-temporary impairment are deemed critical since they involve the use of estimates and require significant management judgments. Application of assumptions different from those used by management could result in material changes in United Community's financial position or results of operations.\nAllowance for Loan Losses. The allowance for loan losses is an amount that management believes will be adequate to absorb probable incurred losses in existing loans taking into consideration such factors as past loss experience, changes in the nature and volume of the portfolio, overall portfolio quality, loan concentrations, specific problem loans, collateral values securing loans and current economic conditions that affect the borrower's ability to pay. Determination of the allowance inherently is subjective due to the aforementioned reasons. Loan losses are charged-off against the allowance when management believes that the full collectability of the loan is unlikely. Recoveries of amounts previously charged-off are credited to the allowance.\nHome Savings maintains a well-documented methodology for maintaining an allowance for loan losses that management believes is compliant with all applicable regulatory guidance and GAAP. The documentation of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is reviewed by the board of directors on a quarterly basis.\nThe allowance is based on management's evaluation of homogeneous groups of loans (single-family residential mortgage loans and all consumer credit except marine loans) to which loss factors have been applied, as well as an evaluation of individual credits (multi-family, nonresidential mortgage loans, marine loans and commercial loans) based on internal risk ratings, collateral and other unique characteristics of each loan.\nManagement believes that it uses the best information available to determine the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses. However, future adjustments to the allowance may be necessary and the results of operations could be significantly and adversely affected if circumstances differ substantially from the assumptions used in making the determinations.\nLoans Held for Sale. Mortgage loans originated and intended for sale in the secondary market are carried at fair value, as determined by outstanding commitments from investors. Net unrealized losses, if any, are recorded as a valuation allowance and charged to earnings.\nMortgage loans held for sale are generally sold with servicing rights retained. The carrying value of mortgage loans sold is reduced by the amount allocated to the servicing right. Gains and losses on sales of mortgage loans are based on the difference between the selling price and the carrying value of the related loan sold.\nThe fair value of conventional loans held for sale is determined using the current 15 day forward contract price for either 15 or 30 year conventional mortgages and the 60 day forward contract price for either 15 or 30 year Federal Housing Authority mortgages. Additionally, the fair value of permanent construction loans held for sale is determined using the current 60 day forward contract price for 30 year conventional mortgages which is then adjusted by extrapolating this rate to the estimated time period remaining until construction is complete. The fair value is also adjusted for unobservable market data such as estimated fall out rate and the estimated time from origination to completion of construction.\nMortgage Servicing Rights. The cost of mortgage loans sold or securitized is allocated between the mortgage servicing rights and the mortgage loans based on the relative fair values of each. The fair value of the mortgage servicing rights is determined by using a discounted cash flow model, which estimates the present value of the future net cash flows of the servicing portfolio, about which management must make assumptions considering future expectations based on various factors, such as servicing costs, expected prepayment speeds and discount rates.\nMortgage servicing rights are amortized in proportion to, and over the period of, estimated net servicing income. Management evaluates mortgage servicing rights for impairment on a quarterly basis by stratifying the loans by original maturity, interest rate and loan type. Impairment is measured by estimating the fair value of each pool, taking into consideration the estimated level of\nprepayments based upon current industry expectations. An impairment allowance is recorded for a pool when, and in an amount which, its fair value is less than its carrying value.\nThe value of mortgage servicing rights is subject to prepayment risk. Future expected net cash flows from servicing a loan will not be realized if the loan pays off earlier than anticipated. Since most of these loans do not contain prepayment penalties, the Company receives no economic benefit if the loan pays off earlier than anticipated.\nIncome Taxes. We are subject to the income tax laws of the United States, its states and the municipalities in which we operate. These tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and the relevant government taxing authorities. We review income tax expense and the carrying value of deferred tax assets quarterly, and as new information becomes available, the balances are adjusted as appropriate. We assess any uncertain tax positions using a recognition threshold of more-likely-than-not, and a measurement attribute for all tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return, in order for those tax positions to be recognized in the financial statements.\nValuation of Investment Securities. Management evaluates securities for other-than-temporary impairment on at least a quarterly basis, and more frequently when economic or market concerns warrant such evaluation. When an other-than-temporary impairment has occurred, the amount of the other-than-temporary impairment recognized in earnings depends on whether we intend to sell the security or more likely than not will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis less any current-period credit loss. To determine whether impairment is other-than-temporary, we consider all available information relevant to the collectability of the security, including past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts when developing estimates of cash flows expected to be collected. Factors considered in this assessment include the reasons for the impairment, the severity and duration of the impairment, changes in value subsequent to year-end, forecasted performance of the obligor, and the general market conditions in the geographic area or industry the investee operates in.\nIf we intend to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis less any current-period credit loss, the impairment is recognized in earnings equal to the entire difference between the investment's amortized cost basis and its fair value at the balance sheet date. If we do not intend to sell the security and it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis less any current-period credit loss, the other-than-temporary impairment is separated, into the amount representing the credit loss and the amount related to all other factors. The amount of the total other-than-temporary impairment related to the credit loss is recognized in earnings. The amount of the total impairment related to other factors is recognized in other comprehensive income.\nYields Earned and Rates Paid\nThe following table sets forth certain information relating to United Community's average balance sheet and reflects the average yield on interest earning assets, on a fully tax equivalent basis, and the average cost of interest bearing liabilities for the periods indicated. Such yields and costs are derived by dividing income or expense by the average balances of interest earning assets or interest bearing liabilities, respectively, for the periods presented. Average balances are derived from daily balances. Nonaccruing loans have been included in the table as loans carrying a zero yield. Loan fees are included in interest income. The average balance for securities available for sale is computed using the carrying value, and the average yield on securities available for sale has been computed using the historical amortized cost average balance.\n\n (1) Nonaccrual loans are included in the average balance. \nThe table below describes the extent to which changes in interest rates and changes in volume of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities have affected United Community's interest income and interest expense during the periods indicated. For each category of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities, information is provided on changes attributable to (i) changes in volume (change in volume multiplied by prior period rate), (ii) changes in rate (change in rate multiplied by prior period volume) and (iii) total changes in rate and volume. The combined effects of changes in both volume and rate, which cannot be separately identified, have been allocated in proportion to the changes due to volume and rate:\n\nContractual Obligations, Commitments, Contingent Liabilities and Off-balance Sheet Arrangements\nThe following table presents, as of December 31, 2018, United Community's significant fixed and determinable contractual obligations by payment date. The payment amounts represent those amounts contractually due to the recipient and do not include any unamortized premiums, discounts, or other similar carrying value adjustments. Further detail of the nature of each obligation is included in the relevant note to the consolidated financial statements, which is identified following the below table.\n\nDiscussion of loan commitments is included in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements. In addition, United Community has commitments under benefit plans as described in Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements. Discussion of off-balance", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7.\n</td> <td> Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nGeneral\nUnited Community was incorporated in the State of Ohio in February 1998 for the purpose of owning all of the outstanding capital stock of Home Savings issued upon the Conversion, which was completed on July 8, 1998.\nThe following discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations of United Community and its subsidiary, Home Savings, should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements, and the notes thereto, included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOverview\nOn January 31, 2017, United Community completed its acquisition of Ohio Legacy Corp (OLCB). Pursuant to the terms of the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated September 8, 2016, among United Community, OLCB, Premier Bank & Trust, OLCB's wholly owned subsidiary bank (PB&T), The Home Savings and Loan Company of Youngstown, Ohio, United Community's wholly owned subsidiary bank (the Merger Agreement), OLCB was merged with and into United Community (the merger). Immediately following the merger, Home Savings was merged with and into PB&T and the surviving bank changed its name to Home Savings Bank.\u201d\nAs a result of the merger and in accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement, each preferred share of OLCB was deemed to have been converted into OLCB common shares. Each OLCB common share was converted into the right to receive either $18.00 in cash or 2.736 United Community common shares, subject to certain allocation procedures set forth in the Merger Agreement that ensured that 50% of OLCB's common shares outstanding were converted into United Community common shares, and 50% of OLCB's common shares outstanding were converted into the right to receive the cash consideration. The Company paid cash in lieu of issuing fractional shares. This transaction resulted in the addition of approximately $349.3 million in assets and the addition of four branches in Summit, Stark and Belmont counties. See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding this transaction.\nIn addition to Home Savings, United Community operates through three other wholly-owned subsidiaries: HSB Insurance, LLC, HSB Capital, LLC and HSB Insurance, Inc. HSB Capital, LLC was formed as an Ohio limited liability company by United Community during 2016 for the purpose of providing mezzanine funding for customers of the Bank. Mezzanine loans are offered by HSB Capital, LLC to customers in United Community's market area, as defined below, and are expected to be repaid from the cash flow from operations of the business.\nHSB Insurance, LLC, (d/b/a James & Sons Insurance), United Community's wholly-owned insurance subsidiary, was formed on April 6, 2016 to acquire James & Sons Insurance. As a result of this acquisition, HSB Insurance, LLC now offers a variety of insurance products for business and residential customers, including auto, homeowners, life-health, commercial, surety bonds and aviation, within United Community's market area. HSB Insurance, LLC completed two additional acquisitions of insurance companies in 2017 and one in 2018 to expand its offerings and market area.\nHSB Insurance, Inc., a Delaware-based captive insurance company, was formed by United Community and began operations on June 1, 2017. HSB Insurance, Inc. insures against certain risks unique to the operations of United Community and its subsidiaries and for which insurance may not be currently available or economically feasible in today's insurance marketplace. HSB Insurance, Inc. pools resources with several other similar insurance company subsidiaries of financial institutions to spread a limited amount of risk among themselves. HSB Insurance, Inc. is subject to regulations of the State of Delaware and undergoes periodic examinations by the Delaware Division of Insurance.\nMaterial Changes in Financial Condition\nCash and cash equivalents increased $14.1 million, or 30.1%, to $61.0 million at December 31, 2018, compared to $46.9 million at December 31, 2017. Cash and cash equivalents increased in 2018 primarily as a result of increased fed funds sold on hand at the end of the year.\nTrading securities increased to $364,000 at December 31, 2018. The Company had no trading securities as of December 31, 2017. During the fourth quarter of 2018, the Company sold approximately 50% of its Visa Class B shares and the remaining shares were placed into trading securities at fair market value.\nAvailable for sale securities decreased $28.9 million, or 10.7% to $241.6 million at December 31, 2018. The change in available for sale securities was affected by maturities, pay downs and amortization totaling $12.6 million and sales of $36.6 million. There was also a decrease in the market value adjustment on the securities totaling $3.7 million. Partially offsetting this were purchases during 2018 of $24.0 million. The balance of the unrealized loss position at December 31, 2018 was $4.8 million, pretax, compared to a loss position of $1.1 million, pretax, at December 31, 2017. The unrealized loss position recognized in available for sale securities is primarily driven by market conditions. To that end, the Company expects to receive all principal and interest payments contractually due and has no intent to sell and more than likely will not be required to sell these securities until maturity. The majority of the securities are Government Sponsored Entities (GSE) issued debt, mortgage-backed securities or collateralized mortgage obligations and carry the same rating as the U.S. Government.\nThe duration of the available for sale securities portfolio was approximately 5.2 years at December 31, 2018. There is risk that longer-term rates could rise, resulting in greater unrealized losses. It is also possible, however, that longer term rates could fall, resulting in the recovery of all of the unrealized losses. Management continues to allow the balance of the portfolio to decline as planned. In addition, the Company may look for opportunities to sell securities and replace them with securities to change the duration characteristics of the portfolio and/or change the mix of the portfolio.\nHeld to maturity securities decreased $5.4 million, or 6.5% to $77.5 million at December 31, 2018. The change in held to maturity securities is the result of maturities, pay downs and amortization offset by the purchase of $3.8 million in securities during the year.\nAt December 31, 2018, there were no loans held for sale, carried at lower of cost or market, and $91.5 million of loans held for sale, carried at fair value. Loans held for sale, carried at lower of cost or market, were $211,000 and loans held for sale, carried at fair value, were $83.5 million at December 31, 2017. The increase in loans held for sale, carried at fair value, was primarily attributable to the originations of permanent construction loans during the period. These loans are not sold until construction of the residence is complete, which is usually within nine to ten months of origination. Home Savings continues to sell a majority of its newly originated fixed rate mortgage loans into the secondary market as part of its risk management strategy and anticipates continuing to do so in the future.\nNet loans increased $177.0 million, or 8.9%, to $2.2 billion at December 31, 2018, compared to $2.0 billion at December 31, 2017. Total commercial loans increased $120.3 million in 2018 while total residential mortgage loans increased $50.7 million and total consumer loans increased $3.5 million. The Company continues to focus on growth in commercial real estate and commercial and industrial loans. See Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the composition of net loans.\nAllowance for Loan Losses. The allowance for loan losses is a valuation allowance for probable incurred credit losses established through a provision for probable loan losses charged to expense. The allowance for loan losses was $20.4 million at December 31, 2018, compared to $21.2 million at December 31, 2017. The allowance for loan losses as a percentage of loans was 0.93% at December 31, 2018, compared to 1.05% at December 31, 2017. This change is a result of growth in the loan portfolio along with improving credit metrics which lowered the amount of allowance for loan losses. The allowance for loan losses as a percentage of nonperforming loans was 312.6% at December 31, 2018, compared to 181.2% at December 31, 2017. Loan losses are charged against the allowance when the uncollectability of a loan balance is confirmed. Subsequent recoveries, if any, are added back to the allowance. Home Savings' allowance for loan loss methodology includes allowance allocations calculated in accordance with ASC Topic 310, Receivables,\u201d and allowance allocations calculated in accordance with ASC Topic 450, Contingencies\u201d. Accordingly, the methodology is based on historical loss experience by type of credit plus specific loss allocations and adjustments for current events and conditions. Home Savings' process for determining the appropriate level of the allowance for probable loan losses is designed to account for credit deterioration as it occurs. The provision for probable loan losses reflects loan quality trends, including the levels of and trends related to nonaccrual loans, past due loans, classified loans and net charge-offs or recoveries, among other factors.\nDuring 2018, the Company recorded a loan loss provision of $699,000. This recognition was primarily due to the growth of the loan portfolio and, to a lesser extent, net charge-offs, offset by improvements in factors used in calculating the allowance for loan loss reserve.\nImpaired Loans. A loan is considered impaired when there is a deterioration of the credit worthiness of the borrower to the extent that there is no longer reasonable assurance of the timely collection of the full amount of principal and interest. The total outstanding balance of all impaired loans was $20.6 million at December 31, 2018 as compared to $26.2 million at December 31, 2017. The decrease in impaired loans can be largely attributed to the resolution of loans through principal payments, charge-offs, sale of the loan or collateral or by Home Savings taking possession of the collateral.\nIncluded in impaired loans above are certain loans Home Savings considers to be troubled debt restructurings (TDR). A loan is considered a TDR if Home Savings grants a concession to a debtor experiencing financial difficulty that it would otherwise not consider. The concession either stems from an agreement between the creditor and the debtor or is imposed by law or a court. If the debtor is not currently experiencing financial difficulties but would probably be in payment default in the future without the modification, then this type of restructure also could be considered a TDR.\nA restructured loan that has fallen into nonaccrual status will return to accruing status if either of the following criteria are met: (i) none of the principal and interest is due or unpaid and Home Savings expects repayment of the remaining contractual principal and interest, or (ii) the borrower has resumed paying the full amount of the scheduled contractual interest and principal payments on a loan that is between 30 and 89 days past due and there is reasonable assurance of prepayment established through payment performance over a period of six months. TDR loans aggregated $16.6 million at December 31, 2018 compared to $19.8 million at December 31, 2017. TDR loans that were on nonaccrual status aggregated $1.7 million and $2.4 million at December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively. Such loans are considered nonperforming loans. TDR loans that were accruing according to their terms aggregated $14.9 million and $17.9 million at December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, respectively.\nNonperforming Loans. Nonperforming loans consist of nonaccrual loans and loans past due 90 days and still accruing. Nonperforming loans were $6.5 million, or 0.30% of total loans, at December 31, 2018, compared to $11.7 million, or 0.59% of total loans, at December 31, 2017.\nGenerally, loans are placed on nonaccrual status if principal or interest payments become 90 days past due and/or management deems the collectability of the principal and/or interest to be in question, as well as when required by regulatory guidance. Loans to a customer whose financial condition has deteriorated are considered for nonaccrual status whether or not the loan is 90 or more days past due. Once interest accruals are discontinued, accrued but uncollected interest is charged to current year operations. Subsequent cash receipts on nonaccrual loans are recorded as a reduction of principal. Interest income is recorded only after principal recovery is reasonably assured. Classification of a loan as nonaccrual does not preclude the ultimate collection of loan principal or interest.\nFederal Home Loan Bank Stock. FHLB stock was $19.1 million at December 31, 2018 compared to $19.3 million at December 31, 2017. The decrease was due to a redemption of stock by the FHLB during 2018. In 2018, the FHLB paid cash dividends of $1.1 million in lieu of stock dividends to its member banks.\nReal Estate Owned and Other Repossessed Assets. Real estate owned and other repossessed assets decreased $165,000 during the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017. Property acquired in the settlement of loans is recorded at the lower of the loan's acquisition balance less cost to sell or the fair market value of the property secured less costs to sell. Appraisals are obtained at least annually on properties that exceed $1.0 million in value. Based on current appraisals, a valuation allowance may be established to reflect properly the asset at fair value.\nBank Owned Life Insurance. Bank Owned Life Insurance (BOLI) is maintained on select officers and employees of Home Savings whereby Home Savings is the beneficiary. BOLI is recorded at its cash surrender value, or the amount currently realizable. Increases in the Home Savings' policy cash surrender value are tax exempt and death benefit proceeds received by Home Savings are tax-free. Income from these policies and changes in the cash surrender value are recorded in other income. There is no post-termination coverage, split dollar or other benefits provided to participants covered by the BOLI. Home Savings recognized $1.7 million and $1.6 million as other non-interest income based on the change in cash value of the policies in the twelve months ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\nOther Assets. Other assets decreased $5.3 million during 2018. The decrease was driven by declines in various accounts receivable accounts offset by an increase in an investment related to low-income housing aggregating $3.0 million in 2018.\nTotal Deposits. Total deposits increased $256.5 million to $2.2 billion at December 31, 2018, compared to $2.0 billion at December 31, 2017. Non-interest bearing accounts increased $39.2 million during 2018 to $394.2 million while interest bearing deposits increased $217.2 million to $1.8 billion in 2018. The Company continues to see increased deposit balances in public funds, business and treasury management along with retail deposits. Brokered deposits increased $134.5 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018 as favorable pricing compared to FHLB advances led the Company to utilize this funding source more often.\nFHLB Advances. Funds needed in excess of deposit growth are borrowed in the normal course of business, if necessary. Home Savings has an established credit relationship with the FHLB of Cincinnati under which Home Savings could borrow up to an additional $403.0 million as of December 31, 2018. These borrowings are collateralized by residential mortgage loans. Of the total borrowing capacity at the FHLB, Home Savings had outstanding short term advances of $243.0 million with a rate of 2.45% at December 31, 2018 compared to a balance of $308,000 at December 31, 2017. The Company had no long term advances at December 31, 2018 compared to $48.5 million at December 31, 2017. In December of 2018, the Company elected to terminate the long term advance with the FHLB. A charge of $936,000 was incurred to terminate this advance.\nShareholders' Equity. Shareholders' equity increased $15.1 million to $309.3 million at December 31, 2018, from $294.3 million at December 31, 2017. The change was primarily driven by net income of $37.2 million offset by cash dividends of $13.0 million, an increase in accumulated other comprehensive loss of $2.8 million and an increase in treasury stock of $6.4 million. The Company repurchased 811,000 of its shares during 2018 via open market purchases.\nAccumulated other comprehensive income increased $2.8 million from December 31, 2017 to December 31, 2018. Unrealized losses on securities included in other comprehensive income have not been recognized in income at December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017 because the issuer's securities are of high credit quality (rated AA or higher), management does not intend to sell (and it is likely that management will not be required to sell) the securities prior to their anticipated recovery, and the decline in fair value is largely due to the level of longer-term interest rates in 2018 and 2017. The fair value is expected to recover as the investments approach maturity.\nEvents beyond management's control, such as fluctuations in interest rates or a downturn in the economy in areas in which Home Savings' loans and securities are concentrated, could adversely affect future earnings and consequently Home Savings' ability to meet its future capital requirements.\nBook value per common share as of December 31, 2018 was $6.30 as compared to $5.90 per common share as of December 31, 2017. Book value per share is calculated as total common equity divided by the number of common shares outstanding. Book value was impacted by the overall change in equity as discussed above.\nMaterial Changes in Operating Results for the Years Ended December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017\nNet Income. United Community recognized net income for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018, of $37.2 million, or $0.74 per diluted common share, compared to net income of $21.8 million, or $0.44 per diluted common share.\nThe significant change in earnings for 2018 was primarily a result of higher pretax income due to growth in earning assets, a lower loan provision and lower noninterest expense. Net interest income for 2018 increased $7.6 million while the provision for loan losses decreased $3.6 million during the same period. Additionally, non-interest income decreased $1.8 million and noninterest expense decreased $3.2 million primarily due to a decrease of $5.0 million of merger expense. United Community's return on average assets and return on average equity were 1.35% and 12.10%, respectively for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018 and 0.85% and 7.63%, respectively, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017. Impacting the comparison were three charges that were recognized in 2017. In the fourth quarter of 2017, a revaluation of net deferred tax assets increased tax expense $1.5 million due to the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act on December 22, 2017and an asset write down of $1.5 million, after tax, was prompted by an unfavorable ruling from an Appellate Court. For the year, non-recurring merger related expenses totaling $3.3 million, after tax, were also recognized.\nNet Interest Income. Net interest income was $88.3 million in 2018, up from the $81.3 million recorded in 2017. Net interest margin increased 2 basis points to 3.43% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018 compared to 3.41% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017.\nTotal interest income increased by $16.5 million in 2018 compared to 2017, to $111.0 million from $94.4 million. The increase is primarily a result of an increase in average net loans and loans held for sale along with an increased yield on loans. The increased loan yield was due to higher yields being realized on net loans as interest rates rose in 2018. Average net loans increased $231.1 million in 2018 compared to the same period in 2017 and yields increased 34 basis points to 4.62% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018 from 4.28% for the same period in 2017. Average loans held for sale increased $14.8 million in 2018 compared to 2017, while yields climbed to 4.49% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018 from 4.06% for the same period in 2017. Interest income from net loans increased to $96.7 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018 compared to $79.8 million for the same period in 2017, and income from loans held for sale increased to $4.3 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018 compared to $3.3 million for the same period in 2017. These increases were partially offset by a decline of $1.8 million in income on available for sale and held to maturity securities.\nInterest expense increased by $9.4 million in 2018 to $22.6 million compared to $13.2 million during the same period in 2017. This increase was due to a $114.8 million increase in average interest-bearing liabilities along with a 43 basis point increase in the cost of interest-bearing liabilities in 2018. The increase in average interest-bearing liabilities was due to growth in deposits offset by a decrease in total borrowed funds. During 2018, the Company utilized brokered certificates of deposits more often in lieu of short term FHLB advances as the deposits were priced less expensively than the advances. The increase in the cost of interest-bearing liabilities was driven by increases in yields on both deposits and borrowed funds due to rising interest rates. Interest expense related to interest-bearing deposits was $17.8 million in 2018 compared to $8.4 million in 2017. Interest expense on borrowed funds totaled $4.8 million in 2018 compared to $4.7 million in 2017.\nProvision for Loan Losses. A provision for loan losses is charged to income to bring the total allowance for loan losses to a level considered by management to be adequate, based on management's evaluation of such factors as the delinquency status of loans, current economic conditions, the net realizable value of the underlying collateral, changes in the composition of the loan portfolio and prior loan loss experience. The Company recognized a loan loss provision of $700,000 in 2018, compared to $4.3 million in 2017. The decrease in provision expense during 2018 was driven by lower net charge-offs and the release of reserves due to lower quantitative and qualitative factors offset by strong loan growth. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2018, net charge-offs to average outstanding loans were 7 basis points. This compares to 12 basis points for the same period in 2017.\nNoninterest Income. Non-interest income was $23.4 million in 2018 compared to $25.2 million in 2017. Negatively impacting the comparison was a decline in mortgage banking income of $1.4 million during 2018 along with losses on the sale of available for sale securities of $627,000 compared to gains on the sale of available for sale securities of $566,000 during 2017. There was also a one-time gain of $595,000 in 2017 for the sale of a building the Company owned that did not reoccur in 2018. Offsetting these items were increases of $191,000 for insurance agency income, $299,000 for mortgage servicing income, $287,000 for trust fee income and $105,000 for bank owned life insurance. In addition, the Company sold approximately 50% of the Company's VISA Class B shares and moved the remainder of the shares into trading securities. The gain resulting from these two transactions resulted in a gain of $669,000 for 2018.\nNoninterest Expense. Non-interest expense was $65.1 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018, which represented a decrease of $3.2 million, from the twelve months ended December 31, 2017. Positively impacting this comparison was merger related expenses totaling $5.0 million in 2017 and the recognition of a $2.3 million asset write down in 2017. The efficiency ratio decreased to 56.85% for 2018 compared to 64.28% for 2017.\nFederal Income Taxes. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2018, the Company recognized tax expense of $8.4 million on pre-tax income of $45.6 million, compared to tax expense of $11.3 million on pre-tax income of $33.1 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017. The primary reason for the variance was the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act on December 22, 2017 which lowered the Company's marginal tax rate from 35% to 21%. In addition, the Company recognized $1.5 million of additional tax expense in 2017 from the revaluation of its deferred tax assets due to this change in tax law.\nMaterial Changes in Operating Results for the Years Ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016\nNet Income. United Community recognized net income for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, of $21.8 million, or $0.44 per diluted common share, compared to net income of $18.8 million, or $0.40 per diluted common share as of December 31, 2016.\nThe significant change in earnings for 2017 was primarily a result of higher pretax income due to the merger and organic growth. Net interest income for 2017 increased $18.3 million while the provision for loan losses decreased $1.1 million during the same period. Additionally, non-interest income increased $3.2 million and noninterest expense increased $16.2 million with $4.2 million of the increase related to merger costs. United Community's return on average assets and return on average equity were 0.85% and 7.63%, respectively for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 and 0.91% and 7.58%, respectively, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016. Impacting the comparison were three charges that were recognized. In the fourth quarter, a revaluation of net deferred tax assets increased tax expense $1.5 million and an asset write down of $1.5 million, after tax, was prompted by an unfavorable ruling from an Appellate Court. For the year, non-recurring merger related expenses totaling $3.3 million, after tax, were also recognized.\nNet Interest Income. Net interest income was $81.3 million in 2017, up from the $63.0 million recorded in 2016. Net interest margin increased 17 basis points to 3.41% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 compared to 3.24% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016.\nTotal interest income increased by $23.0 million in 2017 compared to 2016, to $94.4 million from $71.4 million. The increase is primarily a result of an increase in average net loans and loans held for sale and along with increased yield on loans and securities. The increased loan yield was due to the impact of purchase accounting adjustments from the merger along with higher yields being realized on net loans as interest rates rose in 2017. Average net loans increased $461.2 million in 2017 compared to the same period in 2016 and yields increased 15 basis points to 4.28% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 from 4.13% for the same period in 2016. Average loans held for sale increased $35.5 million in 2017 compared to 2016, while yields climbed to 4.06% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 from 3.82% for the same period in 2016. Interest income from net loans increased to $79.8 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 compared to $57.9 million for the same period in 2016, and income from loans held for sale increased to $3.3 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 compared to $1.8 million for the same period in 2016. These increases were partially offset by a decline of $1.1 million in income on available for sale and held to maturity securities.\nInterest expense increased by $4.7 million in 2017 to $13.2 million compared to $8.4 million during the same period in 2016. This increase was due to a $349.1 million increase in average interest-bearing liabilities along with a 14 basis point increase in the cost of interest-bearing liabilities in 2017. The increase in average interest-bearing liabilities was due to the merger, organic growth in deposits and an increased used of brokered certificates of deposit. The increase in the cost of interest-bearing liabilities was primarily driven by increases in yields on brokered certificates of deposits and borrowed funds due to rising interest rates. Interest expense related to interest-bearing deposits was $8.4 million in 2017 compared to $5.9 million in 2016. Interest expense on borrowed funds totaled $13.2 million in 2017 compared to $8.4 million in 2016.\nProvision for Loan Losses. A provision for loan losses is charged to income to bring the total allowance for loan losses to a level considered by management to be adequate, based on management's evaluation of such factors as the delinquency status of loans, current economic conditions, the net realizable value of the underlying collateral, changes in the composition of the loan portfolio and prior loan loss experience. The Company recognized a loan loss provision of $4.3 million in 2017, compared to $5.4 million in 2016. The decrease in provision expense during 2017 was driven by lower net charge-offs offset by strong loan growth. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, net charge-offs to average outstanding loans were 12 basis points. This compares to 29 basis points for the same period in 2016. The Company recorded a charge-off of $2.5 million during 2016, related to one long-held nonresidential commercial real estate loan which contributed to the higher charge-off ratio.\nNoninterest Income. Non-interest income was $25.2 million in 2017 compared to $22.1 million in 2016. Positively impacting the comparison was the benefit of trust fee income totaling $1.6 million associated with the merger of OLCB. Also contributing to the change were increases of $320,000 for insurance agency income, $150,000 for deposit related fees, $274,000 for mortgage banking income, $369,000 for debit/credit card fees and a one-time gain of $595,000 for the sale of a building the Company owned. Offsetting this was a $123,000 decline in brokerage income and a $96,000 increase in the losses associated with the sale of real estate owned and other repossessed assets.\nNoninterest Expense. Non-interest expense was $68.3 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, which represented an increase of $16.2 million, or 31.2%, from the twelve months ended December 31, 2016. The merger of OLCB and the operating expenses of the acquired branches for the year negatively affected the current comparison along with an increase in merger related expenses. The merger related expenses totaled $5.0 million in 2017 compared to $787,000 in 2016. In addition, the Company recognized a $2.3 million asset write down in 2017. In 2003, Home Savings entered into two development loans on which the borrower subsequently filed bankruptcy, and a court appointed receiver liquidated the collateral. The proceeds from the sale of the collateral have remained in escrow with the court since 2007 as a number of competing claims were made against the proceeds. In 2011, a lower court affirmed Home Savings' priority position in the proceeds, and its lien validity was affirmed by the same court in 2016. However, in December 2017, an appellate court ruled that a portion of the proceeds should be awarded to another claimant. The $2.3 million charge reflects the Appellate court ruling. The efficiency ratio increased to 64.28% for 2017 compared to 61.01% for 2016 primarily due to the merger expenses and the write down.\nFederal Income Taxes. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, the Company recognized tax expense of $11.3 million on pre-tax income of $33.1 million, compared to tax expense of $8.1 million on pre-tax income of $27.0 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016. The primary reason for the variance was higher pre-tax income. In addition, the Company recognized $1.5 million of additional tax expense in 2017 from the revaluation of its deferred tax assets and liabilities due to the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act on December 22, 2017.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe accounting and reporting policies of United Community comply with accounting principles generally accepted within the United States of America and conform to general practices within the financial services industry. Application of these principles requires management to make estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. These estimates, assumptions and judgments are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements. Accordingly, as this information changes, the financial statements could reflect different estimates, assumptions and judgments.\nThe most significant accounting policies followed by United Community are presented in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements. Accounting and reporting policies for the allowance for loan losses, income taxes, mortgage servicing rights and other-than-temporary impairment are deemed critical since they involve the use of estimates and require significant management judgments. Application of assumptions different from those used by management could result in material changes in United Community's financial position or results of operations.\nAllowance for Loan Losses. The allowance for loan losses is an amount that management believes will be adequate to absorb probable incurred losses in existing loans taking into consideration such factors as past loss experience, changes in the nature and volume of the portfolio, overall portfolio quality, loan concentrations, specific problem loans, collateral values securing loans and current economic conditions that affect the borrower's ability to pay. Determination of the allowance inherently is subjective due to the aforementioned reasons. Loan losses are charged-off against the allowance when management believes that the full collectability of the loan is unlikely. Recoveries of amounts previously charged-off are credited to the allowance.\nHome Savings maintains a well-documented methodology for maintaining an allowance for loan losses that management believes is compliant with all applicable regulatory guidance and GAAP. The documentation of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is reviewed by the board of directors on a quarterly basis.\nThe allowance is based on management's evaluation of homogeneous groups of loans (single-family residential mortgage loans and all consumer credit except marine loans) to which loss factors have been applied, as well as an evaluation of individual credits (multi-family, nonresidential mortgage loans, marine loans and commercial loans) based on internal risk ratings, collateral and other unique characteristics of each loan.\nManagement believes that it uses the best information available to determine the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses. However, future adjustments to the allowance may be necessary and the results of operations could be significantly and adversely affected if circumstances differ substantially from the assumptions used in making the determinations.\nLoans Held for Sale. Mortgage loans originated and intended for sale in the secondary market are carried at fair value, as determined by outstanding commitments from investors. Net unrealized losses, if any, are recorded as a valuation allowance and charged to earnings.\nMortgage loans held for sale are generally sold with servicing rights retained. The carrying value of mortgage loans sold is reduced by the amount allocated to the servicing right. Gains and losses on sales of mortgage loans are based on the difference between the selling price and the carrying value of the related loan sold.\nThe fair value of conventional loans held for sale is determined using the current 15 day forward contract price for either 15 or 30 year conventional mortgages and the 60 day forward contract price for either 15 or 30 year Federal Housing Authority mortgages. Additionally, the fair value of permanent construction loans held for sale is determined using the current 60 day forward contract price for 30 year conventional mortgages which is then adjusted by extrapolating this rate to the estimated time period remaining until construction is complete. The fair value is also adjusted for unobservable market data such as estimated fall out rate and the estimated time from origination to completion of construction.\nMortgage Servicing Rights. The cost of mortgage loans sold or securitized is allocated between the mortgage servicing rights and the mortgage loans based on the relative fair values of each. The fair value of the mortgage servicing rights is determined by using a discounted cash flow model, which estimates the present value of the future net cash flows of the servicing portfolio, about which management must make assumptions considering future expectations based on various factors, such as servicing costs, expected prepayment speeds and discount rates.\nMortgage servicing rights are amortized in proportion to, and over the period of, estimated net servicing income. Management evaluates mortgage servicing rights for impairment on a quarterly basis by stratifying the loans by original maturity, interest rate and loan type. Impairment is measured by estimating the fair value of each pool, taking into consideration the estimated level of\nprepayments based upon current industry expectations. An impairment allowance is recorded for a pool when, and in an amount which, its fair value is less than its carrying value.\nThe value of mortgage servicing rights is subject to prepayment risk. Future expected net cash flows from servicing a loan will not be realized if the loan pays off earlier than anticipated. Since most of these loans do not contain prepayment penalties, the Company receives no economic benefit if the loan pays off earlier than anticipated.\nIncome Taxes. We are subject to the income tax laws of the United States, its states and the municipalities in which we operate. These tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and the relevant government taxing authorities. We review income tax expense and the carrying value of deferred tax assets quarterly, and as new information becomes available, the balances are adjusted as appropriate. We assess any uncertain tax positions using a recognition threshold of more-likely-than-not, and a measurement attribute for all tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return, in order for those tax positions to be recognized in the financial statements.\nValuation of Investment Securities. Management evaluates securities for other-than-temporary impairment on at least a quarterly basis, and more frequently when economic or market concerns warrant such evaluation. When an other-than-temporary impairment has occurred, the amount of the other-than-temporary impairment recognized in earnings depends on whether we intend to sell the security or more likely than not will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis less any current-period credit loss. To determine whether impairment is other-than-temporary, we consider all available information relevant to the collectability of the security, including past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts when developing estimates of cash flows expected to be collected. Factors considered in this assessment include the reasons for the impairment, the severity and duration of the impairment, changes in value subsequent to year-end, forecasted performance of the obligor, and the general market conditions in the geographic area or industry the investee operates in.\nIf we intend to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis less any current-period credit loss, the impairment is recognized in earnings equal to the entire difference between the investment's amortized cost basis and its fair value at the balance sheet date. If we do not intend to sell the security and it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis less any current-period credit loss, the other-than-temporary impairment is separated, into the amount representing the credit loss and the amount related to all other factors. The amount of the total other-than-temporary impairment related to the credit loss is recognized in earnings. The amount of the total impairment related to other factors is recognized in other comprehensive income.\nYields Earned and Rates Paid\nThe following table sets forth certain information relating to United Community's average balance sheet and reflects the average yield on interest earning assets, on a fully tax equivalent basis, and the average cost of interest bearing liabilities for the periods indicated. Such yields and costs are derived by dividing income or expense by the average balances of interest earning assets or interest bearing liabilities, respectively, for the periods presented. Average balances are derived from daily balances. Nonaccruing loans have been included in the table as loans carrying a zero yield. Loan fees are included in interest income. The average balance for securities available for sale is computed using the carrying value, and the average yield on securities available for sale has been computed using the historical amortized cost average balance.\nTable 94: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td>
