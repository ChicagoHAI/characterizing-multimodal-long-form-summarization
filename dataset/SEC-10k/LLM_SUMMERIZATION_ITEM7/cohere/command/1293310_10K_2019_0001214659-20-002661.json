MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis together with our Consolidated Financial Statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. For additional discussion, see SPECIAL NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\u201d above.\nOverview\nWe were incorporated on March 15, 2000 in California and reincorporated as a Delaware corporation in September 2001 under the name KaloBios Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Effective August 7, 2017, we changed our legal name to Humanigen, Inc.\nDuring February 2018, we completed the financial restructuring transactions announced in December 2017 and furthered our transformation into a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company.\nDuring 2019, we completed our transformation into a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing our clinical stage immuno-oncology and immunology portfolio of monoclonal antibodies. We are focusing our efforts on the development of our lead product candidate, lenzilumab, through our collaboration with Kite to study the effect of lenzilumab on the safety of Yescarta, including CRS, with a secondary endpoint of increased efficacy. We believe this study, ZUMA-19, may be the basis for registration of lenzilumab given the similar trial design to Yescarta's and Kymriah's registration trials.\nWe are also exploring the effectiveness of our GM-CSF neutralization technologies (either through the use of lenzilumab as a neutralizing antibody or through GM-CSF gene knockout) in combination with other CAR-T, T-cell engaging, and immunotherapy treatments to break the efficacy/toxicity linkage including the prevention and/or treatment of GvHD while preserving GvL benefits in patients undergoing allogeneic HSCT. In this context, GvHD is akin to CRS, or cytokine storm and we believe the mechanism to be driven by GM-CSF levels. The recent coronavirus pandemic which is due to the SARS-CoV-2 virus and leads to the condition referred to as COVID-19, is characterized in the later and sometimes fatal stages by lung dysfunction which is triggered by CRS, or cytokine storm. Recent publications point to GM-CSF being a key cytokine, with elevated levels especially in those patients who transition to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). We have established several partnerships with leading institutions to advance our innovative pipeline and are in active discussion with several government and commercial organizations.\nWe believe that we have a dominant intellectual property position in the area of GM-CSF neutralization through multiple approaches and mechanisms, as they pertain to COVID-19, CAR-T, GvHD and multiple other oncology/transplantation, inflammation, fibrosis and autoimmune conditions which may be driven by GM-CSF.\nDuring 2019, we have also advanced our preclinical next-generation cell and gene therapies for the treatment of cancers via our novel GM-CSF neutralization and gene-knockout platforms.\nAs a leader in GM-CSF pathway science, we believe that we have the ability to transform prevention of CRS in SARS-CoV-2 infection. The virus associated with the current COVID-19 pandemic, SARS-Cov-2, is one of a group of several betacoronaviruses, which includes the viruses responsible for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV). These viruses infect predominantly the lower lung and cause fatal pneumonia. Other coronaviruses infect the upper respiratory tract and cause some cases of the common cold. The clinical course of COVID-19 can be mistaken for influenza infection - patients in both cases often suffer from aches and pains throughout the body, fever, cough and general malaise. COVID-19 is not typically associated with a productive cough - rather it tends to be a dry cough - and sneezing is less common. A nasal or throat swab can be used to test for SARS-CoV-2 infection, and blood tests can be run to check for viral titers. Travel to areas where COVID-19 appears to have a large number of cases and exposure to people who are known to have suffered from the condition or carriers of SARS-CoV-2 also increases the clinical suspicion of possible infection. Data generated during the SARS and MERS outbreaks point to cytokine storm as a phase of the illness which is characterized by an immune hyperactive phase, which then can progress to lung dysfunction and death. The natural history of SARS infection shows viral load actually decreases as patients enter the second phase.\nTable 370: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>77 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 371: <table><tr><td>Table of Contents </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nRecent data from China and the subject of a pre-publication titled Aberrant pathogenic GM-CSF+ T cells and inflammatory CD14+CD16+ monocytes in severe pulmonary syndrome patients of a new coronavirus\u201d, supports the hypothesis that cytokine storm-induced immune mechanisms have contributed to patient mortality with the current pandemic strain of coronavirus.\nThe severe clinical features associated with some COVID-19 infections result from an inflammation-induced lung injury requiring Intensive Care Unit (ICU) care and mechanical ventilation. This lung injury is a result of a cytokine storm resulting from a hyper-reactive immune response. The lung injury that leads to death is not directly related to the virus, but appears to be a result of a hyper-reactive immune response to the virus triggering a cytokine storm that can continue even after viral titers begin to fall.\nThe authors of the study assessed samples from patients with severe pneumonia resulting from COVID-19 infection to identify whether inflammatory factors such as GM-CSF, G-CSF, IL-6, MCP-1, MIP 1 alpha, IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha were implicated.\nThe authors noted that steroid treatment in such cases has been disappointing in terms of outcome, but suggested that a monoclonal antibody that targets GM-CSF may prevent or curb the hyper-active immune response caused by COVID-19 in this setting. Humanigen believes that the authors' findings are worthy of further investigation, suggesting that to reduce or eradicate ICU care and prevent deaths from COVID-19 infection, an intervention may be needed to prevent cytokine storm.\nSeparate publications confirm that cytokine storm is characterized by surge of high levels of circulating inflammatory cytokines, and is an overreaction of the immune system under the conditions, such as CAR-T therapy and patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. These recent studies revealed that high levels of GM-CSF, along with a few other cytokines, are critically associated with severe clinical complications in COVID-19 patients. High concentration of GM-CSF was found in the plasma of severe and critically ill patients, which account for approximately 20% of all patients, especially in those requiring intensive care.\nLenzilumab has been shown to prevent cytokine storm in animal models and this work has been published in peer reviewed journals. Patients are expected to be enrolled soon in a clinical study to determine lenzilumab's effect on cytokine storm associated with the hyper-active immune response associated with CAR-T therapy in collaboration with Kite Pharma.\nThe Company believes these new data suggest that GM-CSF may be a critical triggering cytokine in the increased mortality in the current coronavirus pandemic. A potential program in COVID-19 to prevent cytokine storm is complementary to the programs in CAR-T and GvHD, which are also focused on preventing or reducing cytokine storm in those disease states.\nAs a leader in GM-CSF pathway science, we believe that we have the ability to transform CAR-T therapy and a broad range of other T-cell engaging therapies, including both autologous and allogeneic cell transplantation. There is a direct correlation between the efficacy of CAR-T therapy and the incidence of life-threatening toxicities (referred to as the efficacy/toxicity linkage).We believe that our GM-CSF neutralization and gene-editing CAR-T platform technologies have the potential to reduce the inflammatory cascade associated with serious and potentially life-threatening CAR-T therapy-related side-effects while preserving and potentially improving the efficacy of the CAR-T therapy itself, thereby breaking the efficacy/toxicity linkage. Clinical correlative analysis and preclinical in vivo evidence points to GM-CSF as the key initiator of the inflammatory cascade resulting in CAR-T therapy's side-effects, including CRS and NT. GM-CSF has also been linked to the suppressive myeloid cell axis through recruitment of MDSCs that reduce CAR-T cell expansion and hamper CAR-T cell efficacy. Our strategy is to continue to pioneer the use of GM-CSF neutralization and GM-CSF gene knockout technologies to improve efficacy and prevent or significantly reduce the serious side-effects associated with CAR-T therapy.\nWe believe that our GM-CSF pathway science, assets and expertise create two technology platforms to assist in the development of next-generation CAR-T therapies. Lenzilumab has the potential to be used in combination with any FDA-approved or development stage T-cell therapy, including CAR-T therapy, as well as in combination with other cell therapies such as HSCT to make these treatments safer and more effective.\nTable 372: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>78 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 373: <table><tr><td>Table of Contents </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe have utilized a precision medicine approach and personalized the development of lenzilumab based on specific genetic mutations or biomarkers at baseline. We recently reported on a Phase I study of lenzilumab as monotherapy in refractory chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) and are now planning a potential Phase II study of lenzilumab in combination with azacitidine (current standard therapy) in newly-diagnosed CMML patients with certain genetic mutations. We are also planning a potential Phase II/III study focused on early intervention with lenzilumab in patients at high risk for acute Graft versus Host Disease (GvHD) based on specific biomarkers. We have also reported on a Phase II study in severe asthma utilizing lenzilumab, which showed a statistically significant improvement in efficacy and favorable safety profile in patients with eosinophilic asthma, 21 of whom received lenzilumab vs. 20 patients who received placebo. In addition, our GM-CSF knockout gene-editing CAR-T platform has the potential to create next-generation CAR-T therapies that may inherently avoid any efficacy/toxicity linkage, thereby potentially preserving the benefits of the CAR-T therapy while reducing or altogether avoiding its serious and potentially life-threatening side-effects.\nOur immediate focus is combining FDA-approved and development stage CAR-T therapies with lenzilumab, our lead product candidate. A clinical collaboration with Kite was recently announced to evaluate the use of lenzilumab with Yescarta.\nWe are also creating next-generation combinatory gene-edited CAR-T therapies using strategies to improve efficacy while employing GM-CSF gene knockout technologies to control toxicity. This includes developing our own portfolio of proprietary first-in-class EphA3-CAR-Ts for various solid cancers and EMR1-CAR-Ts for various eosinophilic disorders.\nLenzilumab\nLenzilumab neutralizes human GM-CSF and has the potential to prevent or reduce certain serious side-effects associated with CAR-T therapy (CRS and neurotoxicity) and improve upon the efficacy of CAR-T therapy. This same mechanism we believe to be the causation of CRS/cytokine storm which precedes the decline in lung function seen with severe cases of COVID-19. Preclinical data generated in collaboration with the Mayo Clinic, which was published in \u2018blood\u00ae', a premier journal in hematology, indicates that the use of lenzilumab in combination with CAR-T therapy may also enhance the proliferation and improve the efficacy of CAR-T therapy. This may also result in durable, or longer term, responses in CAR-T therapies.\nThere are currently no products approved by the FDA for the prevention of CRS/cytokine storm associated with COVID-19. Also there are currently no products approved by the FDA for the prevention of CAR-T therapy-related side effects, nor are there any approved therapies for the treatment of CAR-T therapy related NT. We continue to advance the development of lenzilumab in combination with CAR-T therapy through a non-exclusive clinical collaboration with Kite, pursuant to which we are conducting a multi-center Phase Ib/II study (the Study\u201d) of lenzilumab with Kite's Yescarta in patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell lymphoma, including diffuse large B-cell lymphoma ( DLBCL\u201d). The Study has been designated the nomenclature \u2018ZUMA-19', consistent with the other Kite CAR-T studies, which also receive a \u2018ZUMA' designation. The primary objective of ZUMA-19 is to determine the effect of lenzilumab on the safety and efficacy of Yescarta. Kite's Yescarta is one of two CAR-T therapies that have been approved by the FDA and is the CAR-T therapy market leader, and our collaboration with Kite is currently the only clinical collaboration which is now enrolling patients with the potential to improve both the safety and efficacy of CAR-T therapy. We also plan to measure other potentially beneficial effects on efficacy and healthcare resource utilization. In addition, lenzilumab's success in preventing serious and potentially life-threatening side-effects could offer economic benefits to medical system payers by making the CAR-T therapy capable of being administered, and follow-up care subsequently monitored and managed, potentially on an out-patient basis in certain patients and circumstances. In turn, we believe that delivering such provider and payer benefits might accelerate the use of the CAR-T therapy itself, and thereby permit us to generate further revenues from sales of lenzilumab.\nTable 374: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>79 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 375: <table><tr><td>Table of Contents </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn addition to COVID-19 and CAR-T therapy, we are committed to advancing our diverse platform for GM-CSF axis suppression for a broad range of other T-cell engaging therapies, including both autologous and allogeneic next generation CAR-T therapies, bi-specific antibody therapies, as well as other cell-based immunotherapies in development, including allogeneic HSCT, with our current and future partners.\nIn July 2019, we entered into the Zurich Agreement with UZH. Under the Zurich Agreement, we have in-licensed certain technologies that we believe may be used to prevent or treat GvHD, thereby expanding our development platform to include improving the safety and effectiveness of allogeneic HSCT, a potentially curative therapy for patients with hematological cancers. There are currently no FDA-approved agents for the prevention of GvHD, nor treatment of GvHD in patients identified as high risk by certain biomarkers. We believe that GM-CSF neutralization with lenzilumab has the potential to prevent or treat GvHD without compromising, and potentially improving, the beneficial GvL effect in patients undergoing allogeneic HSCT, thereby making allogeneic HSCT safer. Several recent papers have been published which support this approach, including in Science Translational Medicine in November 2018 and in \u2018blood advances' in October 2019.\nWe aim to position lenzilumab as a necessary companion product to any allogeneic HSCT and as a part of the standard pre-conditioning that all patients receiving allogeneic HSCT should receive or as an early treatment option in patients identified as high risk for GvHD.\nGiven our interest in developing lenzilumab to prevent CRS/cytokine storm in COVID-19 as well as in the treatment of rare cancers and other orphan conditions such as GvHD, we believe that we have the opportunity to benefit from various regulatory incentives, such as orphan drug exclusivity, breakthrough therapy designation, fast track designation, priority review and accelerated approval.\nGM-CSF Gene Knockout\nWe are advancing our GM-CSF knockout gene-editing CAR-T platform through the Mayo Agreement that we entered into in June 2019 with the Mayo Foundation. Under the Mayo Agreement, we have in-licensed certain technologies that we believe may be used to create CAR-T cells lacking GM-CSF expression through various gene-editing tools, including CRISPR-Cas9. We believe that our GM-CSF knockout gene-editing CAR-T platform has the potential to create next-generation CAR-T therapies that improve the efficacy and safety profile of CAR-T therapy. In addition, we have and continue to file intellectual property encompassing a broad range of gene-editing approaches related to GM-CSF knockout.\nPreclinical data indicates that GM-CSF gene knockout CAR-T cells show improved overall survival compared to wild-type CAR-T cells in addition to the expected benefits of reduced serious side-effects associated with CAR-T therapy. We are establishing a platform of next-generation combinatorial gene knockout CAR-T cells that have potential to be applied across both autologous and allogeneic approaches and we are also investigating multiple CAR-T cell designs using precise dual and triple gene editing to significantly enhance the anti-tumor activity while simultaneously preventing CAR-T therapy induced toxicities. Through targeted gene expression and modulating cytokine activation signaling, we may be able to increase the proportion of fitter T-cells produced during expansion, increase their proliferative potential, and inhibit activation-induced cell death, thereby improving the cancer killing activity of our engineered CAR-T cells thereby making them more effective and safer in the treatment of cancers. Initial data were published in an abstract that was presented at the December 2019 ASH meeting and also won an ASH Abstract Achievement award.\nWe plan to continue development of this technology in combination approaches that could add to the observed efficacy benefits of current generation CAR-T products. In addition, we anticipate that our GM-CSF knockout gene-editing CAR-T platform may be a future backbone for controlling the serious side-effects that hamper CAR-T therapy that lead to serious and sometimes fatal outcomes for patients as a result of the CAR-T therapy itself.\nTable 376: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>80 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 377: <table><tr><td>Table of Contents </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nEphA3-CAR: Targeting Tumor Stroma and Tumor Vasculature\nWe have begun to generate our own pipeline of CAR-T therapies including an EphA3-CAR-T based on the ifabotuzumab v-region and backbone. Ifabotuzumab is a Humaneered anti-EphA3 monoclonal antibody. Ifabotuzumab has the potential to kill tumor cells by targeting tumor stroma that protects them and the vasculature that feeds them. This unique combination of activities as a backbone of a CAR-T therapy may provide the potential to generate durable responses in a range of solid tumors by targeting the tissues that surround, protect, and nourish a growing cancer.\nBy developing an EphA3-CAR-T using ifabotuzumab as the backbone, we may have the ability to target the tumor, tumor stroma, and tumor vasculature in a novel manner. We are collaborating with the Mayo Clinic and plan to move to clinical testing with an anti-EphA3 construct for a range of cancer types after completing IND-enabling work. We have published initial data from our Phase I study in an abstract that was accepted for the November 2019 SNO meeting, showing data in glioblastoma multiforme, a form of brain cancer.\nEMR1-CAR: Targeting Eosinophils\nOur EMR1-CAR-T product is based on the HGEN005 (anti-EMR1 Humaneered monoclonal antibody) backbone and targets EMR1. Our EMR1-CAR-T based on the HGEN005 backbone is another approach in our growing platform of CAR-T therapies. We believe that because of its high selectivity, EMR1-CAR-T has significant potential to treat serious eosinophil diseases.\nIn preclinical work, HGEN005's anti-EMR1 activity resulted in dramatically enhanced killing of eosinophils from normal and eosinophilic donors and also induced a rapid and sustained depletion of eosinophils in a non-human primate model without any clinically significant adverse events. We have engaged with NIH to discuss expanding the initial work they have conducted utilizing HGEN005 and discussions are underway with a leading center in the U.S. to perform the IND-enabling testing in eosinophilic leukemia, an orphan condition with significant unmet need, as well as with several other potential partners, although we cannot assure you that we will reach any agreements for these next steps.\nOperating Losses and Liquidity\nWe have incurred significant losses and had an accumulated deficit of $284.9 million as of December 31, 2019. We expect to continue to incur net losses for the foreseeable future as we develop our drug candidates, expand clinical trials for our drug candidates currently in clinical development, expand our development activities and seek regulatory approvals. Significant capital is required to continue to develop and to launch a product and many expenses are incurred before revenue is received, if any. We are unable to predict the extent of any future losses or when we will receive revenue or become profitable, if at all.\nWe will require substantial additional capital to continue as a going concern and to support our business efforts, including obtaining regulatory approvals for our product candidates, clinical trials and other studies, and, if approved, the commercialization of our product candidates. We anticipate that we will seek additional financing from a number of sources, including, but not limited to, the sale of equity or debt securities, strategic collaborations, and licensing of our product candidates. Additional funding may not be available to us on a timely basis or at acceptable terms, if at all. Our ability to access capital when needed is not assured and, if not achieved on a timely basis, would materially harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. If adequate funds are not available, we may be required to delay, reduce the scope of, or eliminate one or more of our development programs. We may also be required to sell or license to others our technologies, product candidates, or development programs that we would have preferred to develop and commercialize ourselves and on less than favorable terms, if at all. If in the best interests of our stockholders, we may also find it appropriate to enter into a strategic transaction that could result in, among other things, a sale, merger, consolidation or business combination.\nTable 378: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>81 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 379: <table><tr><td>Table of Contents </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nIf management is unsuccessful in efforts to raise additional capital, based on our current levels of operating expenses, our current capital is not expected to be sufficient to fund our operations for the next twelve months. These conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. The Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm at the beginning of the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K includes an explanatory paragraph about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2019 were prepared on the basis of a going concern, which contemplates that we will be able to realize our assets and discharge liabilities in the normal course of business. Our ability to meet our liabilities and to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the availability of future funding. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if we are unable to continue as a going concern.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates\nOur management's discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S., or GAAP. The preparation of our financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts and disclosures reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates. Our management believes judgment is involved in determining revenue recognition, the fair value-based measurement of stock-based compensation and accruals. Our management evaluates estimates and assumptions as facts and circumstances dictate. As future events and their effects cannot be determined with precision, actual results could differ from these estimates and assumptions, and those differences could be material to the Consolidated Financial Statements. If our assumptions change, we may need to revise our estimates, or take other corrective actions, either of which may also have a material adverse effect on our statements of operations, liquidity and financial condition.\nUntil December 31, 2018, we qualified as an emerging growth company ( EGC\u201d) under the JOBS Act. Emerging growth companies can delay adopting new or revised accounting standards until such time as those standards apply to private companies. We elected to avail ourselves of this exemption from new or revised accounting standards and, therefore, we may not be subject to the same new or revised accounting standards as other public companies that are not emerging growth companies.\nA registrant with EGC status loses its eligibility as an EGC five years after its common equity initial public offering, December 31, 2018 for our company. Accordingly, we are required to adopt new accounting standards on the same timeline as other public companies effective January 1, 2018. See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of the impact of new accounting standards adopted in 2019.\nWhile our significant accounting policies are described in more detail in Note 3 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we believe the following accounting policies to be critical to the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements.\nAccrued Research and Development Expenses\nAs part of the process of preparing our Consolidated Financial Statements, we are required to estimate our accrued research and development expenses. This process involves reviewing contracts and purchase orders, reviewing the terms of our license agreements, communicating with our applicable personnel to identify services that have been performed on our behalf, and estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred for the service when we have not yet been invoiced or otherwise notified of actual cost. Some of our service providers invoice us monthly in arrears for services performed. We make estimates of our accrued expenses as of each balance sheet date based on facts and circumstances known to us at that time. Examples of estimated accrued research and development expenses include fees to:\nTable 380: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>contract research organizations and other service providers in connection with clinical studies; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 381: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>contract manufacturers in connection with the production of clinical trial materials; and </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 382: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>vendors in connection with preclinical development activities. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 383: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>82 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 384: <table><tr><td>Table of Contents </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe base our expenses related to clinical studies on our estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to contracts with multiple research institutions and contract research organizations that conduct and manage clinical studies on our behalf. The financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation, vary from contract to contract, and may result in uneven payment flows and expense recognition. Payments under some of these contracts depend on factors such as the successful enrollment of patients and the completion of clinical trial milestones. In accruing these costs, we estimate the time period over which services will be performed for which we have not been invoiced and the level of effort to be expended in each period. If the actual timing of the performance of services or the level of effort varies from our estimate, we adjust the accrual accordingly. Our understanding of the status and timing of services performed relative to the actual status and timing of services performed may vary and may result in our reporting changes in estimates in any particular period.\nStock-Based Compensation\nOur stock-based compensation expense for stock options is estimated at the grant date based on the award's fair value as calculated by the Black-Scholes option pricing model and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period. The Black-Scholes option pricing model requires various highly judgmental assumptions including expected volatility and expected term. The expected volatility is based on the historical stock volatilities of several of our publicly listed peers over a period equal to the expected terms of the options as we do not have a sufficient trading history to use the volatility of our own common stock. To estimate the expected term, we have opted to use the simplified method, which is the use of the midpoint of the vesting term and the contractual term. If any of the assumptions used in the Black-Scholes option pricing model changes significantly, stock-based compensation expense may differ materially in the future from that recorded in the current period. In addition, we are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and only recognize expense for those shares expected to vest. We estimate the forfeiture rate based on historical experience and our expectations regarding future pre-vesting termination behavior of employees. To the extent our actual forfeiture rate is different from our estimate, stock-based compensation expense is adjusted accordingly.\nRevenue Recognition\nOur revenue to date has been generated primarily through license agreements and research and development collaboration agreements. We had no revenues for the years ending December 31, 2018 and 2019. Commencing January 1, 2018, we recognize revenue in accordance with Accounting Standards Update ( ASU\u201d) 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)\u201d ( ASC 606\u201d). The core principle of ASC 606 is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods and/or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods and/or services. To determine the appropriate amount of revenue to be recognized for arrangements that we determine are within the scope of ASC 606, the Company performs the following steps: (i) identify the contract(s) with the customer, (ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract, (iii) determine the transaction price, (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract and (v) recognize revenue when (or as) each performance obligation is satisfied.\nRevenue under technology licenses and collaborative agreements typically consists of nonrefundable and/or guaranteed license fees, collaborative research funding, and various milestone and future product royalty or profit-sharing payments. These agreements are generally referred to as multiple element arrangements\u201d.\nWe apply the accounting standard on revenue recognition for multiple element arrangements. The fair value of deliverables under the arrangement may be derived using a best estimate of selling price if vendor specific objective evidence and third-party evidence is not available. Deliverables under the arrangement will be separate units of accounting if a delivered item has value to the customer on a standalone basis and if the arrangement includes a general right of return for the delivered item, delivery or performance of the undelivered item is considered probable and substantially in our control.\nTable 385: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>83 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 386: <table><tr><td>Table of Contents </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe recognize upfront license payments as revenue upon delivery of the license only if the license has standalone value from any undelivered performance obligations and that value can be determined. The undelivered performance obligations typically include manufacturing or development services or research and/or steering committee services. If the fair value of the undelivered performance obligations can be determined, then these obligations would be accounted for separately. If the license is not considered to have standalone value, then the license and other undelivered performance obligations would be accounted for as a single unit of accounting. In this case, the license payments and payments for performance obligations are recognized as revenue over the estimated period of when the performance obligations are performed or deferred indefinitely until the undelivered performance obligation is determined.\nWhenever we determine that an arrangement should be accounted for as a single unit of accounting, we determine the period over which the performance obligations will be performed, and revenue will be recognized. Revenue is recognized using a proportional performance or straight-line method. The proportional performance method is used when the level of effort required to complete performance obligations under an arrangement can be reasonably estimated. The amount of revenue recognized under the proportional performance method is determined by multiplying the total payments under the contract, excluding royalties and payments contingent upon achievement of milestones, by the ratio of the level of effort performed to date to the estimated total level of effort required to complete performance obligations under the arrangement. If we cannot reasonably estimate the level of effort to complete performance obligations under an arrangement, we recognize revenue under the arrangement on a straight-line basis over the period we are expected to complete our performance obligations. Significant management judgment is required in determining the level of effort required under an arrangement and the period over which we are expected to complete our performance obligations under an arrangement.\nOur collaboration agreements typically entitle us to additional payments upon the achievement of development, regulatory and sales performance-based milestones. If the achievement of a milestone is considered probable at the inception of the collaboration, the related milestone payment is included with other collaboration consideration, such as upfront fees and research funding, in our revenue calculation. Typically, these milestones are not considered probable at the inception of the collaboration. As such, milestones will typically be recognized in one of two ways depending on the timing of when the milestone is achieved. If the milestone is achieved during the performance period, then we will only recognize revenue to the extent of the proportional performance achieved at that date, or the proportion of the straight-line basis achieved at that date, and the remainder will be recorded as deferred revenue to be amortized over the remaining performance period. If the milestone is achieved after the performance period has completed and all performance obligations have been delivered, then we will recognize the milestone payment as Revenue in its entirety in the period the milestone was achieved.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nFor a discussion of new accounting pronouncements, see Note 3, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nResults of Operations\nGeneral\nAt December 31, 2019, we had an accumulated deficit of $284.9 million, primarily as a result of research and development and general and administrative expenses as well as costs incurred in reorganization. While we may in the future generate revenue from a variety of sources, including license fees, milestone payments, and research and development payments in connection with strategic partnerships, our product candidates are at an early stage of development and may never be successfully developed or commercialized. Accordingly, we expect to continue to incur substantial losses from operations for the foreseeable future, and there can be no assurance that we will ever generate significant revenue or profits.\nTable 387: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>84 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 388: <table><tr><td>Table of Contents </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nResearch and Development Expenses\n\tConducting research and development is central to our business model. We expense both internal and external research and development costs as incurred. We track external research and development costs incurred by project for each of our clinical programs. We have continued to refine our systems and our methodology in tracking external research and development costs. Our external research and development costs consist primarily of:\nTable 389: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>expenses incurred under agreements with contract research organizations, investigative sites, and consultants that conduct our clinical trials and a substantial portion of our preclinical activities; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 390: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>the cost of acquiring and manufacturing clinical trial and other materials; and </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 391: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>other costs associated with development activities, including additional studies. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOther research and development costs consist primarily of internal research and development costs such as salaries and related fringe benefit costs for our employees (such as workers compensation and health insurance premiums), stock-based compensation charges, travel costs, lab supplies, overhead expenses such as rent and utilities, and external costs not allocated to one of our clinical programs. Internal research and development costs generally benefit multiple projects and are not separately tracked per project. The following table shows our total research and development expenses for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 ($000's):\nTable 392: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>(in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>External Costs </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Lenzilumab </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,046 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,662 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Ifabotuzumab </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>104 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>105 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Internal costs </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>466 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>452 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total research and development </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,616 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,219 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe expect to continue to incur substantial expenses related to our research and development activities for the foreseeable future as we continue product development including our development efforts for lenzilumab to reduce the serious and potentially life-threatening side-effects associated with CAR-T therapy and potentially improve efficacy. Depending on the results of our development efforts we expect to incur substantial costs to prepare for potential clinical trials and activities for lenzilumab.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses consist principally of personnel-related costs, professional fees for legal, consulting, audit and tax services, rent and other general operating expenses not otherwise included in research and development. For the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, general and administrative expenses were $6.3 million and $9.1 million, respectively.\nTable 393: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>85 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 394: <table><tr><td>Table of Contents </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nComparison of Years Ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 ($000's)\nTable 395: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Increase/ (Decrease) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>(in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Amount </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Operating expenses: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Research and development </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,616 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,219 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>397 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>General and administrative </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,328 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9,112 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2,784 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(31 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Loss from operations </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(8,944 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(11,331 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2,387 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(21 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Interest expense </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,349 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(852 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>497 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>58 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Other income (expense), net </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>324 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>325 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Reorganization items, net </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(145 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(145 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(100 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net loss </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(10,294 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(12,004 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(1,710 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(14 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n</table>\nResearch and development expenses increased $0.4 million in 2019 from $2.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 to $2.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase is primarily due to the increase in spending in preparation for the phase Ib/II clinical trial of Lenzilumab with Kite's Yescarta in CAR-T therapy. We expect our research and development expenses will increase substantially in 2020 compared to 2019, due to the commencement of enrollment in the trial.\nGeneral and administrative expenses decreased $2.8 million in 2019 from $9.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 to $6.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease in general and administrative expenses is primarily attributable to a $2.7 million decrease in stock-based compensation expense related to the issuance of options to management, consultants and board members subsequent to the completion of the Restructuring Transactions in 2018 without such issuances in 2019. We expect our general and administrative expenses to increase somewhat in 2020 as compared to 2019 due to the expected addition of positions in the finance and accounting area with the objective of improving internal controls and eliminating the material weakness that exists as of December 31, 2019.\nInterest expense increased $0.5 million from $0.8 million recognized for the year ended December 31, 2018 to $1.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily consisted of $0.2 million for interest and amortization of debt discount related to the Advance Notes, entered into in June, July and August 2018, $0.8 million for interest and amortization of debt discount related to the 2018 Convertible Notes entered into in September 2018, $0.1 million in interest and amortization of debt discount related to the 2019 Convertible Notes entered into in April 2019, $0.1 million in interest related to the 2019 Bridge Notes entered into in June and November 2019 and $0.1 million in interest related to the Notes payable to vendors related to our 2016 bankruptcy filing. Interest expense of $0.9 million recognized for the year ended December 31, 2018 is comprised of $0.4 million for interest and loan issuance costs related to the Term Loans (as defined below), $0.2 million for interest and amortization of debt discount related to the Advance Notes, $0.2 million for interest and amortization of debt discount related to the 2018 Convertible Notes and $0.1 million for interest related to the Notes payable to vendors related to our 2016 bankruptcy filing.\nReorganization items, net for the year ended December 31, 2018 primarily consisted of legal fees. There were no Reorganization items, net incurred for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nOther income, net for the year ended December 31, 2018 primarily consisted of legal fees assumed by Madison Joint Venture LLC related to their positive election related to the assets related to benznidazole, our former drug candidate (see Note 9).\nTable 396: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>86 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 397: <table><tr><td>Table of Contents </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nIncome Taxes\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $166.2 million to offset future federal income taxes which expire in the years 2021 through 2037, and approximately $172.1 million that may offset future state income taxes which expire in the years 2028 through 2039. We also have federal net operating loss carryforwards generated in 2018 and 2019 of $15.4 million that have no expiration date as a result of the tax law changes signed into law on December 22, 2017. Current federal and state tax laws include substantial restrictions on the utilization of net operating losses and tax credits in the event of an ownership change. Even if the carryforwards are available, they may be subject to annual limitations, lack of future taxable income, or future ownership changes that could result in the expiration of the carryforwards before they are utilized. At December 31, 2019, we recorded a 100% valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets of approximately $57.4 million, as at that time our management believed it was uncertain that they would be fully realized. If we determine in the future that we will be able to realize all or a portion of our deferred tax assets, an adjustment to our valuation allowance would increase net income in the period in which we make such a determination.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nSince our inception, we have financed our operations primarily through proceeds from the public offerings and private placements of our common stock, private placements of our preferred stock, debt financings, interest income earned on cash, and cash equivalents, and marketable securities, borrowings against lines of credit, and receipts from prior collaboration agreements. At December 31, 2019, we had cash and cash equivalents of $0.1 million. As of March 13, 2020, we had cash and cash equivalents of $268,000.\nThe following table sets forth the primary sources and uses of cash and cash equivalents for each of the periods presented below ($000's):\nTable 398: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Twelve Months Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>(In thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net cash (used in) provided by: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating activities </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(4,001 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(6,209 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Financing activities </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,330 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,256 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(671 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>47 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet cash used in operating activities was $4.0 million and $6.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Cash used in operating activities in 2018 primarily related to our net loss of $12.0 million, adjusted for non-cash items, such as $4.8 million in stock-based compensation, $0.8 million in non-cash interest expense and other non-cash items of $0.2 million. Cash used in operating activities in 2019 primarily related to our net loss of $10.3 million, adjusted for non-cash items, such as $2.0 million in stock-based compensation, $1.3 million in non-cash interest expense, changes in operating assets and liabilities of $2.8 million and other non-cash items of $0.2 million.\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $3.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This amount consists primarily of $2.0 million received from the issuance of the 2019 Bridge Notes (as defined below) entered into in June and November 2019, $1.3 million from the issuance of the 2019 Notes (as defined below) entered into in April 2019, $0.3 million received from the exercise of stock options, $0.2 million received from the issuance of common stock under the equity line of credit with Lincoln Park Capital Fund, LLC ( Lincoln Park\u201d), offset by $0.5 million in payments made against the Notes payable to vendors.\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $6.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This amount consists primarily of $1.5 million received from Cheval Holdings, Ltd. ( Cheval\u201d), an affiliate of Black Horse Capital, L.P., the Company's controlling stockholder ( BHC\u201d), related to the Restructuring Transactions (see Restructuring Transactions\u201d below), $1.1 million from the issuance of 2,445,557 shares of our common stock to accredited investors on March 12, 2018, $0.2 million received from the issuance of 400,000 shares of our common stock to an accredited investor on June 4, 2018, $0.9 million received from the issuance of the Advance Notes in June, July and August 2018 and $2.5 million received for the issuance of the Notes in September 2018.\nTable 399: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>87 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 400: <table><tr><td>Table of Contents </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nRestructuring Transactions\nIn December 2016, we entered into a Credit and Security Agreement (as amended, the Term Loan Credit Agreement\u201d) providing for an original $3.0 million credit facility (the December 2016 Term Loan\u201d), net of certain fees and expenses. On March 21, 2017, we entered into an amendment to the Term Loan Credit Agreement to obtain an additional $5.5 million (the March 2017 Term Loan\u201d), net of certain fees and expenses, providing additional working capital. On July 8, 2017, we entered into a second amendment to the Term Loan Credit Agreement to obtain an additional $5.0 million (the July 2017 Term Loan\u201d), net of certain fees and expenses, providing additional working capital. As of the third quarter of 2017, we had received the entire amount available under the Term Loan Credit Agreement.\nOn December 21, 2017, we entered into a Securities Purchase and Loan Satisfaction Agreement (the Purchase Agreement\u201d) and a Forbearance and Loan Modification Agreement (the Forbearance Agreement\u201d and, together with the Purchase Agreement, the Restructuring Agreements\u201d), each with the Term Loan Lenders, in connection with a series of transactions providing for, among other things, the satisfaction and extinguishment of our outstanding obligations under the Term Loan Credit Agreement and the infusion of $3.0 million of new capital. The Restructuring Transactions were completed on February 27, 2018. For additional information regarding the Restructuring Transactions, see Restructuring Transactions\u201d in Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nLiquidity\nDespite completing the Restructuring Transactions, we will require substantial additional capital to continue as a going concern and to support our business efforts, including pursuing our collaboration with Kite and obtaining regulatory approvals for our product candidates, lenzilumab, ifabotuzumab and HGEN005, clinical trials and other studies, and, if approved, the commercialization of our product candidates. Under the Kite Agreement, the parties have agreed to conduct a multi-center Phase 1/2 study of lenzilumab with Kite's Yescarta in patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell lymphoma. We currently project we will be responsible for an aggregate of approximately $8 million in out-of-pocket costs assuming a total of 72 patients are enrolled in the Study, of which $2 million will be required to be paid to Kite thirty days prior to the initiation of the Study. The amount of capital we will require and the timing of our need for additional capital will depend on many factors, including:\nTable 401: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>the type, number, timing, progress, costs, and results of the product candidate development programs that we are pursuing or may choose to pursue in the future; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 402: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>the scope, progress, expansion, costs, and results of our preclinical and clinical trials; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 403: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>the timing of and costs involved in obtaining regulatory approvals; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 404: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>the success, progress, timing and costs of our efforts to evaluate or consummate various strategic alternatives if in the best interests of our stockholders; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 405: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>our ability to re-list our common stock on a national securities exchange, whether through a new listing or by completing a strategic transaction; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 406: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>our ability to establish and maintain development partnering arrangements and any associated funding; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 407: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>the emergence of competing products or technologies and other adverse market developments; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 408: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>the costs of maintaining, expanding, and protecting our intellectual property portfolio, including potential litigation costs and liabilities; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 409: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>the resources we devote to marketing, and, if approved, commercializing our product candidates; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 410: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>the scope, progress, expansion and costs of manufacturing our product candidates; and </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 411: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>the costs associated with being a public company. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 412: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>88 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 413: <table><tr><td>Table of Contents </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs of December 31, 2019, our current liabilities of approximately $13.6 million exceeded our current assets of approximately $0.5 million. Our cash position as of June 30, 2019 was insufficient for us to satisfy in full at maturity on June 30, 2019 all of the outstanding principal amount and accrued but unpaid interest on unsecured promissory notes we made to certain of our vendors upon our emergence from bankruptcy. We paid approximately $0.5 million to extinguish certain of these notes in July and August 2019. As of December 31, 2019, the aggregate principal amount and accrued but unpaid interest on these notes approximates $1.1 million. The outstanding principal amount and accrued but unpaid interest on these notes is currently payable to the respective holders without demand, notice or declaration, and the holders, without demand or notice of any kind, may exercise any and all other rights and remedies available to them under the notes, our bankruptcy plan, at law or in equity. We do not have sufficient funds to repay the principal and accrued but unpaid notes.\nAccordingly, we will need to seek additional financing from a number of sources, including, but not limited to, the sale of equity or debt securities, strategic collaborations, and licensing of our product candidates, to enable us to pursue the Kite collaboration and our other business initiatives. Since 2018, our capital-raising efforts have succeeded in raising a series of short-term bridge loans and convertible debt financings, including short-term bridge financings in June 2019 and November 2019 advanced, as applicable, by our two largest stockholders, which collectively control approximately 88% of our outstanding common stock as of December 31, 2019, and our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Dr. Durrant. In December 2019 we also effected an equity line of credit with LPC.\nAdditional funding may not be available to us on a timely basis or at acceptable terms, if at all. Our ability to access capital when needed is not assured and, if not achieved on a timely basis, would materially harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. If adequate funds are not available, we may be required to delay, reduce the scope of, or eliminate one or more of our development programs. We may also be required to sell or license to others our technologies, product candidates, or development programs that we would have preferred to develop and commercialize ourselves and on less than favorable terms, if at all. If in the best interests of our stockholders, we may also find it appropriate to enter into a strategic transaction that could result in, among other things, a sale, merger, consolidation or business combination.\nIf management is unsuccessful in efforts to raise additional capital, based on our current levels of operating expenses, our current capital will not be sufficient to fund our operations for the next twelve months. These conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nOur common stock currently trades on the OTCQB Venture Market under the ticker symbol HGEN\u201d. Although our common stock is listed for quotation on the OTCQB Venture Market, trading is limited and an active market for our common stock may never develop in the future, which could harm our ability to raise capital to continue to fund operations.\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nThe following table summarizes our contractual obligations at December 31, 2019 and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future years.

The lease commenced in April 2016. This lease expired on September 30, 2018. In May 2018, we entered into a month-to-month lease agreement for a new facility in Burlingame, California. We terminated the lease on November 1, 2019 and entered into a sub-lease agreement for space in the same building in Burlingame, California. The sub-lease initial term expires on March 31, 2020 and is renewable for additional terms by mutual agreement.\nNotes Payable to Vendors\nOn June 30, 2016, we issued promissory notes in an aggregate principal amount of approximately $1.2 million to certain claimants in accordance with the Plan. The notes are unsecured, bear interest at 10% per annum and became due and payable in full, including principal and accrued interest on June 30, 2019. In July and August, 2019, following the receipt of proceeds from the 2019 Bridge Notes, we used approximately $0.5 million of the proceeds to retire a portion of these notes, including accrued interest. After giving effect to these payments, the aggregate principal amount and accrued but unpaid interest on these notes approximates $1.1 million as of December 31, 2019. As of December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, we have accrued $0.3 million and $0.3 million in interest related to these promissory notes, respectively. The outstanding principal amount and accrued but unpaid interest on these notes is currently payable to the respective holders without demand, notice or declaration, and the holders, without demand or notice of any kind, may exercise any and all other rights and remedies available to them under the notes, the Plan, at law or in equity. Currently, we do not have sufficient funds to repay the principal and accrued but unpaid interest on these notes in their entirety.\nAdvance Notes\nIn June, July and August 2018, we received an aggregate of $0.9 million of proceeds from advances made to us (the Advance Notes\u201d) by four different lenders including Dr. Cameron Durrant, the Company's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Cheval, an affiliate of BHC, the Company's controlling stockholder; and Ronald Barliant, a director of the Company (collectively the Advance Note Lenders\u201d). The Advance Notes accrued interest at a rate of 7% per year, compounded annually.\nIn accordance with their terms, on May 30, 2019, in connection with our announcement of the Kite Agreement, the Advance Note Lenders converted the amounts due under the Advance Notes into common stock at the conversion price of $0.45 per share. We issued a total of 2,179,622 shares of common stock in connection with the conversion.\n2018 Convertible Notes\nCommencing September 19, 2018, we delivered a series of convertible promissory notes (the 2018 Notes\u201d) evidencing an aggregate of $2.5 million of loans made to us by six different lenders, including an affiliate of BHC, our controlling stockholder. The 2018 Notes bear interest at a rate of 7% per annum and will mature on the earliest of (i) twenty-four months from the date the 2018 Notes were signed, (ii) the occurrence of any customary event of default, or (iii) the certain liquidation events including any dissolution or winding up of our company or merger or sale by us of all or substantially all of our assets (in any case, a Liquidation Event\u201d). We used the proceeds from the 2018 Notes for working capital.\nThe 2018 Notes are convertible into our equity securities in three different scenarios:\nIf we sell our equity securities on or before the date of repayment of the 2018 Notes in any financing transaction that results in gross proceeds to us of at least $10 million (a Qualified Financing\u201d), the 2018 Notes will be converted into either (i) such equity securities as the noteholder would acquire if the principal and accrued but unpaid interest thereon (the Conversion Amount\u201d) were invested directly in the financing on the same terms and conditions as given to the financing investors in the Qualified Financing, or (ii) common stock at a conversion price equal to $0.45 per share (subject to ratable adjustment for any stock split, stock dividend, stock combination or other recapitalization occurring subsequent to the date of the Notes).\nTable 417: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>90 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 418: <table><tr><td>Table of Contents </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nIf we sell our equity securities on or before the date of repayment of the 2018 Notes in any financing transaction that results in gross proceeds to us of less than $10 million (a Non-Qualified Financing\u201d), the noteholders may convert their remaining 2018 Notes into either (i) such equity securities as the noteholder would acquire if the Conversion Amount were invested directly in the financing on the same terms and conditions as given to the financing investors in the Non-Qualified Financing, or (ii) common stock at a conversion price equal to $0.45 per share (subject to ratable adjustment for any stock split, stock dividend, stock combination or other recapitalization occurring subsequent to the date of the Notes). Our sales of shares pursuant to the Purchase Agreement with Lincoln Park constitute a Non-Qualified Financing, and, thus, holders of the 2018 Notes have the ability to convert in accordance with the terms described above.\n2019 Convertible Notes\nCommencing on April 23, 2019, we delivered a series of convertible promissory notes (the 2019 Notes\u201d and together with the 2018 Notes, the Convertible Notes\u201d) evidencing an aggregate of $1.3 million of loans made to us.\nThe 2019 Notes bear interest at a rate of 7.5% per annum and will mature on the earliest of (i) twenty-four months from the date the 2019 Notes are signed (the Stated Maturity Date\u201d), (ii) the occurrence of any customary event of default, or (iii) the certain liquidation events including any dissolution or winding up of the Company or merger or sale by us of all or substantially all of our assets (in any case, a Liquidation Event\u201d). We used the proceeds from the 2019 Notes for working capital.\nThe 2019 Notes are convertible into our equity securities in four different scenarios:\nIf we sell our equity securities on or before the Stated Maturity Date in any financing transaction that results in gross proceeds to us of at least $10.0 million (a Qualified Financing\u201d) or we consummate a reverse merger or similar transaction, the 2019 Notes will be converted into either (i) (a) in the case of a Qualified Financing, such equity securities as the noteholder would acquire if the principal and accrued but unpaid interest thereon together with such additional amount of interest as would have been paid on the 2019 Notes if held to the Stated Maturity Date (the Conversion Amount\u201d) were invested directly in the financing on the same terms and conditions (including price) as given to the financing investors in the Qualified Financing or (b) in the case of a reverse merger, common stock at the same price per share paid by the buyer in such transaction (which in a stock for stock transaction, shall be based on the price per share used by the parties for purposes of setting the applicable exchange ration), or (ii) common stock at a conversion price equal to $1.25 per share (subject to ratable adjustment for any stock split, stock dividend, stock combination or other recapitalization occurring subsequent to the date of the 2019 Notes).\nIf we sell our equity securities on or before the date of repayment of the 2019 Notes in any financing transaction that results in gross proceeds to us of less than $ 10.0 million (a Non-Qualified Financing\u201d), the noteholders may convert their remaining Convertible Notes into either (i) such equity securities as the noteholder would acquire if the Conversion Amount were invested directly in the financing on the same terms and conditions (including price) as given to the financing investors in the Non-Qualified Financing, or (ii) common stock at a conversion price equal to $1.25 per share (subject to ratable adjustment for any stock split, stock dividend, stock combination or other recapitalization occurring subsequent to the date of the 2019 Notes). Our sales of shares pursuant to the Purchase Agreement with Lincoln Park constitute a Non-Qualified Financing, and, thus, holders of the 2019 Notes have the ability to convert in accordance with the terms described above.\n2019 Bridge Notes\nOn June 28, 2019, we issued three short-term, secured bridge notes (the June Bridge Notes\u201d) evidencing an aggregate of $1.7 million of loans made to us by three parties: Cheval, an affiliate of BHC, our controlling stockholder, lent $750,000; Nomis Bay LTD, our second largest stockholder, lent $750,000; and Cameron Durrant, M.D., MBA, our Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of our Board of Directors, lent $200,000. The proceeds from the June Bridge Notes were used to satisfy a portion of the unsecured obligations incurred in connection with our emergence from bankruptcy in 2016 and for working capital and general corporate purposes. Of the $1.7 million in proceeds received, $950,000 was received on June 28, 2019 and was recorded as Advance notes in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet as of June 30, 2019. The remaining proceeds of $750,000 were received July 1, 2019 and recorded accordingly.\nTable 419: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>91 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 420: <table><tr><td>Table of Contents </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe June Bridge Notes bear interest at a rate of 7.0% per annum and had an original maturity date of October 1, 2019. On October 8, 2019, the Company and the lenders agreed to extend the maturity date of the 2019 Bridge Notes from October 1, 2019 until December 31, 2019 and to waive any prior default up to and including the date of the amendment. On December 30, 2019, we and the lenders agreed to further extend the maturity date of the June Bridge Notes until March 31, 2020. No other changes to the terms of the June Bridge Notes were made in connection with either extension of the maturity date. The June Bridge Notes may become due and payable at such earlier time as we raise more than $3,000,000 in a bona fide financing transaction or upon a change in control. The June Bridge Notes are secured by liens of substantially all of the Company's assets.\nOn November 12, 2019, we issued two short-term, secured bridge notes (the November Bridge Notes\u201d and together with the June Bridge Notes, the 2019 Bridge Notes\u201d) evidencing an aggregate of $350,000 of loans made us by two parties: Cheval, an affiliate BHC, our controlling stockholder, lent $250,000; and Cameron Durrant, M.D., MBA, our Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of our Board of Directors, lent $100,000. The proceeds from the November Bridge Notes will be used for working capital and general corporate purposes.\nThe November Bridge Notes rank on par with the June Bridge Notes, and possess other terms and conditions substantially consistent with those notes. The November Bridge Notes bear interest at a rate of 7.0% per annum and will mature on December 31, 2019. The November Bridge Notes may become due and payable at such earlier time as we raise more than $3,000,000 in a bona fide financing transaction or upon a change in control. The November Bridge Notes also are secured by a lien of substantially all of the Company's assets.\nUpon an event of default, which events include, but are not limited to, (1) our failure to timely pay any monetary obligation under the 2019 Bridge Notes; (2) our failure to pay our debts generally as they become due and (3) our commencing any proceeding relating to the Company under any bankruptcy reorganization, arrangement, insolvency, readjustment of debt, dissolution or liquidation or similar laws of any jurisdiction now or hereafter in effect, the interest payable on the 2019 Bridge Notes increases to 10.0% per annum. Further, upon certain events of default, all payments and obligations due and owed under the 2019 Bridge Notes shall immediately become due and payable without demand and without notice to the Company.\nEquity Line of Credit\nOn November 8, 2019, we entered into a purchase agreement (the Purchase Agreement\u201d) and a registration rights agreement (the Registration Rights Agreement\u201d) with Lincoln Park Capital Fund, LLC ( Lincoln Park\u201d), pursuant to which we have the right to sell to Lincoln Park up to $20,000,000 in shares of our common stock, subject to certain limitations and conditions set forth in the Purchase Agreement.\nUnder the Purchase Agreement, we have the right, from time to time at our sole discretion and subject to certain conditions, to direct Lincoln Park to purchase up to 100,000 shares of our common stock, with such amounts increasing based on certain threshold prices but not to exceed $750,000 in total proceeds on any purchase date. The purchase price of shares of our common stock pursuant to the Purchase Agreement will be based on the market prices of our common stock at the time of such purchases as set forth in the Purchase Agreement. Such sales of our common stock by us, if any, may occur from time to time, at our option, over the 36-month period commencing on December 2, 2019, the date that the terms and conditions of the Purchase Agreement were satisfied, including the Company's filing of a registration statement with the SEC pursuant to the Registration Rights Agreement that was declared effective by the SEC on December 2, 2019 and the filing of a final prospectus in connection therewith dated as of December 2, 2019.\nTable 421: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>92 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 422: <table><tr><td>Table of Contents </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn addition to regular purchases, as described above, we may also direct Lincoln Park to purchase additional amounts as accelerated purchases if the closing sale price of our common stock is not below certain threshold prices, as set forth in the Purchase Agreement. In all instances, we may not sell shares of our common stock to Lincoln Park under the Purchase Agreement if it would result in Lincoln Park beneficially owning more than 4.99% of our common stock then outstanding.\nThe Purchase Agreement and the Registration Rights Agreement contain customary representations, warranties, agreements and conditions to completing future sale transactions, indemnification rights and obligations of the parties. We have the right to terminate the Purchase Agreement at any time, at no cost or penalty. During any event of default\u201d under the Purchase Agreement, all of which are outside of Lincoln Park's control, Lincoln Park does not have the right to terminate the Purchase Agreement; however, we may not initiate any regular or other sale of shares to Lincoln Park until such event of default is cured.\nActual sales of shares of our common stock to Lincoln Park under the Purchase Agreement will depend on a variety of factors to be determined by us from time to time, including, among others, market conditions, the trading price of our common stock and our determinations as to the appropriate sources of funding for our company and our operations. Upon the execution of the Purchase Agreement, we issued 706,592 shares of our common stock to Lincoln Park as consideration for its commitment to purchase shares of our common stock under the Purchase Agreement. We did not receive any cash proceeds from the issuance of these shares. As of March 16, 2020, we have sold a total of 700,000 shares of our common stock for proceeds of approximately $250,000.\nThe net proceeds under the Purchase Agreement to the Company will depend on the frequency and prices at which we sell shares of our common stock to Lincoln Park. We expect that any proceeds received by us from such sales to Lincoln Park will be used for working capital and general corporate purposes.\nContracts\nWe are obligated to make future payments to third parties under in-license agreements, including sublicense fees, royalties, and payments that become due and payable on the achievement of certain development and commercialization milestones.\nWe record upfront and milestone payments made to third parties under licensing arrangements as an expense. Upfront payments are recorded when incurred and milestone payments are recorded when the specific milestone has been achieved.\nLicense with the University of Zurich\nOn July 19, 2019, we entered into the Zurich Agreement with UZH. Under the Zurich Agreement, we have in-licensed certain technologies that we believe may be used to prevent GvHD through GM-CSF neutralization. The Zurich Agreement required an initial one-time payment of $100,000, which we paid to UZH on July 29, 2019. The Zurich Agreement also requires the payment of annual license maintenance fees, as well as milestones and royalties upon the achievement of certain regulatory and commercialization milestones.\nLicense with the Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research\nOn June 19, 2019, we entered into the Mayo Agreement with the Mayo Foundation. Under the Mayo Agreement, we have in-licensed certain technologies that we believe may be used to create CAR-T cells lacking GM-CSF expression through various gene-editing tools including CRISPR-Cas9. Pursuant to the Mayo Agreement, we were required to pay $200,000 to the Mayo Foundation within six months of the effective date of the Mayo Agreement, or upon completion of a qualified financing, whichever is earlier. We did not pay the initial payment as of the due date and will incur interest on the unpaid balance at the prime rate plus 2%. The Mayo Agreement also requires the payment of milestones and royalties upon the achievement of certain regulatory and commercialization milestones.\nTable 423: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>93 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 424: <table><tr><td>Table of Contents </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nCollaboration Agreement with Kite\nOn May 30, 2019, we entered into the Kite Agreement.

We currently project we will be responsible for an aggregate of approximately $8 million in out-of-pocket costs, assuming up to a total of 72 patients are recruited for a multi-center Study. Each party will otherwise be responsible for its own internal costs, including internal personnel costs, incurred in connection with the Study.\nIndemnification\nIn the normal course of business, we enter into contracts and agreements that contain a variety of representations and warranties and provide for general indemnifications. Our exposure under these agreements is unknown because it involves claims that may be made against us in the future, but have not yet been made. To date, we have not paid any claims or been required to defend any action related to our indemnification obligations. However, we may record charges in the future as a result of these indemnification obligations.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe currently have no off-balance sheet arrangements, such as structured

"item_7_text": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis together with our Consolidated Financial Statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. For additional discussion, see SPECIAL NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\u201d above.\nOverview\nWe were incorporated on March 15, 2000 in California and reincorporated as a Delaware corporation in September 2001 under the name KaloBios Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Effective August 7, 2017, we changed our legal name to Humanigen, Inc.\nDuring February 2018, we completed the financial restructuring transactions announced in December 2017 and furthered our transformation into a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company.\nDuring 2019, we completed our transformation into a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing our clinical stage immuno-oncology and immunology portfolio of monoclonal antibodies. We are focusing our efforts on the development of our lead product candidate, lenzilumab, through our collaboration with Kite to study the effect of lenzilumab on the safety of Yescarta, including CRS, with a secondary endpoint of increased efficacy. We believe this study, ZUMA-19, may be the basis for registration of lenzilumab given the similar trial design to Yescarta's and Kymriah's registration trials.\nWe are also exploring the effectiveness of our GM-CSF neutralization technologies (either through the use of lenzilumab as a neutralizing antibody or through GM-CSF gene knockout) in combination with other CAR-T, T-cell engaging, and immunotherapy treatments to break the efficacy/toxicity linkage including the prevention and/or treatment of GvHD while preserving GvL benefits in patients undergoing allogeneic HSCT. In this context, GvHD is akin to CRS, or cytokine storm and we believe the mechanism to be driven by GM-CSF levels. The recent coronavirus pandemic which is due to the SARS-CoV-2 virus and leads to the condition referred to as COVID-19, is characterized in the later and sometimes fatal stages by lung dysfunction which is triggered by CRS, or cytokine storm. Recent publications point to GM-CSF being a key cytokine, with elevated levels especially in those patients who transition to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). We have established several partnerships with leading institutions to advance our innovative pipeline and are in active discussion with several government and commercial organizations.\nWe believe that we have a dominant intellectual property position in the area of GM-CSF neutralization through multiple approaches and mechanisms, as they pertain to COVID-19, CAR-T, GvHD and multiple other oncology/transplantation, inflammation, fibrosis and autoimmune conditions which may be driven by GM-CSF.\nDuring 2019, we have also advanced our preclinical next-generation cell and gene therapies for the treatment of cancers via our novel GM-CSF neutralization and gene-knockout platforms.\nAs a leader in GM-CSF pathway science, we believe that we have the ability to transform prevention of CRS in SARS-CoV-2 infection. The virus associated with the current COVID-19 pandemic, SARS-Cov-2, is one of a group of several betacoronaviruses, which includes the viruses responsible for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV). These viruses infect predominantly the lower lung and cause fatal pneumonia. Other coronaviruses infect the upper respiratory tract and cause some cases of the common cold. The clinical course of COVID-19 can be mistaken for influenza infection - patients in both cases often suffer from aches and pains throughout the body, fever, cough and general malaise. COVID-19 is not typically associated with a productive cough - rather it tends to be a dry cough - and sneezing is less common. A nasal or throat swab can be used to test for SARS-CoV-2 infection, and blood tests can be run to check for viral titers. Travel to areas where COVID-19 appears to have a large number of cases and exposure to people who are known to have suffered from the condition or carriers of SARS-CoV-2 also increases the clinical suspicion of possible infection. Data generated during the SARS and MERS outbreaks point to cytokine storm as a phase of the illness which is characterized by an immune hyperactive phase, which then can progress to lung dysfunction and death. The natural history of SARS infection shows viral load actually decreases as patients enter the second phase.\n 77 \n\nRecent data from China and the subject of a pre-publication titled Aberrant pathogenic GM-CSF+ T cells and inflammatory CD14+CD16+ monocytes in severe pulmonary syndrome patients of a new coronavirus\u201d, supports the hypothesis that cytokine storm-induced immune mechanisms have contributed to patient mortality with the current pandemic strain of coronavirus.\nThe severe clinical features associated with some COVID-19 infections result from an inflammation-induced lung injury requiring Intensive Care Unit (ICU) care and mechanical ventilation. This lung injury is a result of a cytokine storm resulting from a hyper-reactive immune response. The lung injury that leads to death is not directly related to the virus, but appears to be a result of a hyper-reactive immune response to the virus triggering a cytokine storm that can continue even after viral titers begin to fall.\nThe authors of the study assessed samples from patients with severe pneumonia resulting from COVID-19 infection to identify whether inflammatory factors such as GM-CSF, G-CSF, IL-6, MCP-1, MIP 1 alpha, IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha were implicated.\nThe authors noted that steroid treatment in such cases has been disappointing in terms of outcome, but suggested that a monoclonal antibody that targets GM-CSF may prevent or curb the hyper-active immune response caused by COVID-19 in this setting. Humanigen believes that the authors' findings are worthy of further investigation, suggesting that to reduce or eradicate ICU care and prevent deaths from COVID-19 infection, an intervention may be needed to prevent cytokine storm.\nSeparate publications confirm that cytokine storm is characterized by surge of high levels of circulating inflammatory cytokines, and is an overreaction of the immune system under the conditions, such as CAR-T therapy and patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. These recent studies revealed that high levels of GM-CSF, along with a few other cytokines, are critically associated with severe clinical complications in COVID-19 patients. High concentration of GM-CSF was found in the plasma of severe and critically ill patients, which account for approximately 20% of all patients, especially in those requiring intensive care.\nLenzilumab has been shown to prevent cytokine storm in animal models and this work has been published in peer reviewed journals. Patients are expected to be enrolled soon in a clinical study to determine lenzilumab's effect on cytokine storm associated with the hyper-active immune response associated with CAR-T therapy in collaboration with Kite Pharma.\nThe Company believes these new data suggest that GM-CSF may be a critical triggering cytokine in the increased mortality in the current coronavirus pandemic. A potential program in COVID-19 to prevent cytokine storm is complementary to the programs in CAR-T and GvHD, which are also focused on preventing or reducing cytokine storm in those disease states.\nAs a leader in GM-CSF pathway science, we believe that we have the ability to transform CAR-T therapy and a broad range of other T-cell engaging therapies, including both autologous and allogeneic cell transplantation. There is a direct correlation between the efficacy of CAR-T therapy and the incidence of life-threatening toxicities (referred to as the efficacy/toxicity linkage).We believe that our GM-CSF neutralization and gene-editing CAR-T platform technologies have the potential to reduce the inflammatory cascade associated with serious and potentially life-threatening CAR-T therapy-related side-effects while preserving and potentially improving the efficacy of the CAR-T therapy itself, thereby breaking the efficacy/toxicity linkage. Clinical correlative analysis and preclinical in vivo evidence points to GM-CSF as the key initiator of the inflammatory cascade resulting in CAR-T therapy's side-effects, including CRS and NT. GM-CSF has also been linked to the suppressive myeloid cell axis through recruitment of MDSCs that reduce CAR-T cell expansion and hamper CAR-T cell efficacy. Our strategy is to continue to pioneer the use of GM-CSF neutralization and GM-CSF gene knockout technologies to improve efficacy and prevent or significantly reduce the serious side-effects associated with CAR-T therapy.\nWe believe that our GM-CSF pathway science, assets and expertise create two technology platforms to assist in the development of next-generation CAR-T therapies. Lenzilumab has the potential to be used in combination with any FDA-approved or development stage T-cell therapy, including CAR-T therapy, as well as in combination with other cell therapies such as HSCT to make these treatments safer and more effective.\n 78 \n\nWe have utilized a precision medicine approach and personalized the development of lenzilumab based on specific genetic mutations or biomarkers at baseline. We recently reported on a Phase I study of lenzilumab as monotherapy in refractory chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) and are now planning a potential Phase II study of lenzilumab in combination with azacitidine (current standard therapy) in newly-diagnosed CMML patients with certain genetic mutations. We are also planning a potential Phase II/III study focused on early intervention with lenzilumab in patients at high risk for acute Graft versus Host Disease (GvHD) based on specific biomarkers. We have also reported on a Phase II study in severe asthma utilizing lenzilumab, which showed a statistically significant improvement in efficacy and favorable safety profile in patients with eosinophilic asthma, 21 of whom received lenzilumab vs. 20 patients who received placebo. In addition, our GM-CSF knockout gene-editing CAR-T platform has the potential to create next-generation CAR-T therapies that may inherently avoid any efficacy/toxicity linkage, thereby potentially preserving the benefits of the CAR-T therapy while reducing or altogether avoiding its serious and potentially life-threatening side-effects.\nOur immediate focus is combining FDA-approved and development stage CAR-T therapies with lenzilumab, our lead product candidate. A clinical collaboration with Kite was recently announced to evaluate the use of lenzilumab with Yescarta.\nWe are also creating next-generation combinatory gene-edited CAR-T therapies using strategies to improve efficacy while employing GM-CSF gene knockout technologies to control toxicity. This includes developing our own portfolio of proprietary first-in-class EphA3-CAR-Ts for various solid cancers and EMR1-CAR-Ts for various eosinophilic disorders.\nLenzilumab\nLenzilumab neutralizes human GM-CSF and has the potential to prevent or reduce certain serious side-effects associated with CAR-T therapy (CRS and neurotoxicity) and improve upon the efficacy of CAR-T therapy. This same mechanism we believe to be the causation of CRS/cytokine storm which precedes the decline in lung function seen with severe cases of COVID-19. Preclinical data generated in collaboration with the Mayo Clinic, which was published in \u2018blood\u00ae', a premier journal in hematology, indicates that the use of lenzilumab in combination with CAR-T therapy may also enhance the proliferation and improve the efficacy of CAR-T therapy. This may also result in durable, or longer term, responses in CAR-T therapies.\nThere are currently no products approved by the FDA for the prevention of CRS/cytokine storm associated with COVID-19. Also there are currently no products approved by the FDA for the prevention of CAR-T therapy-related side effects, nor are there any approved therapies for the treatment of CAR-T therapy related NT. We continue to advance the development of lenzilumab in combination with CAR-T therapy through a non-exclusive clinical collaboration with Kite, pursuant to which we are conducting a multi-center Phase Ib/II study (the Study\u201d) of lenzilumab with Kite's Yescarta in patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell lymphoma, including diffuse large B-cell lymphoma ( DLBCL\u201d). The Study has been designated the nomenclature \u2018ZUMA-19', consistent with the other Kite CAR-T studies, which also receive a \u2018ZUMA' designation. The primary objective of ZUMA-19 is to determine the effect of lenzilumab on the safety and efficacy of Yescarta. Kite's Yescarta is one of two CAR-T therapies that have been approved by the FDA and is the CAR-T therapy market leader, and our collaboration with Kite is currently the only clinical collaboration which is now enrolling patients with the potential to improve both the safety and efficacy of CAR-T therapy. We also plan to measure other potentially beneficial effects on efficacy and healthcare resource utilization. In addition, lenzilumab's success in preventing serious and potentially life-threatening side-effects could offer economic benefits to medical system payers by making the CAR-T therapy capable of being administered, and follow-up care subsequently monitored and managed, potentially on an out-patient basis in certain patients and circumstances. In turn, we believe that delivering such provider and payer benefits might accelerate the use of the CAR-T therapy itself, and thereby permit us to generate further revenues from sales of lenzilumab.\n 79 \n\nIn addition to COVID-19 and CAR-T therapy, we are committed to advancing our diverse platform for GM-CSF axis suppression for a broad range of other T-cell engaging therapies, including both autologous and allogeneic next generation CAR-T therapies, bi-specific antibody therapies, as well as other cell-based immunotherapies in development, including allogeneic HSCT, with our current and future partners.\nIn July 2019, we entered into the Zurich Agreement with UZH. Under the Zurich Agreement, we have in-licensed certain technologies that we believe may be used to prevent or treat GvHD, thereby expanding our development platform to include improving the safety and effectiveness of allogeneic HSCT, a potentially curative therapy for patients with hematological cancers. There are currently no FDA-approved agents for the prevention of GvHD, nor treatment of GvHD in patients identified as high risk by certain biomarkers. We believe that GM-CSF neutralization with lenzilumab has the potential to prevent or treat GvHD without compromising, and potentially improving, the beneficial GvL effect in patients undergoing allogeneic HSCT, thereby making allogeneic HSCT safer. Several recent papers have been published which support this approach, including in Science Translational Medicine in November 2018 and in \u2018blood advances' in October 2019.\nWe aim to position lenzilumab as a necessary companion product to any allogeneic HSCT and as a part of the standard pre-conditioning that all patients receiving allogeneic HSCT should receive or as an early treatment option in patients identified as high risk for GvHD.\nGiven our interest in developing lenzilumab to prevent CRS/cytokine storm in COVID-19 as well as in the treatment of rare cancers and other orphan conditions such as GvHD, we believe that we have the opportunity to benefit from various regulatory incentives, such as orphan drug exclusivity, breakthrough therapy designation, fast track designation, priority review and accelerated approval.\nGM-CSF Gene Knockout\nWe are advancing our GM-CSF knockout gene-editing CAR-T platform through the Mayo Agreement that we entered into in June 2019 with the Mayo Foundation. Under the Mayo Agreement, we have in-licensed certain technologies that we believe may be used to create CAR-T cells lacking GM-CSF expression through various gene-editing tools, including CRISPR-Cas9. We believe that our GM-CSF knockout gene-editing CAR-T platform has the potential to create next-generation CAR-T therapies that improve the efficacy and safety profile of CAR-T therapy. In addition, we have and continue to file intellectual property encompassing a broad range of gene-editing approaches related to GM-CSF knockout.\nPreclinical data indicates that GM-CSF gene knockout CAR-T cells show improved overall survival compared to wild-type CAR-T cells in addition to the expected benefits of reduced serious side-effects associated with CAR-T therapy. We are establishing a platform of next-generation combinatorial gene knockout CAR-T cells that have potential to be applied across both autologous and allogeneic approaches and we are also investigating multiple CAR-T cell designs using precise dual and triple gene editing to significantly enhance the anti-tumor activity while simultaneously preventing CAR-T therapy induced toxicities. Through targeted gene expression and modulating cytokine activation signaling, we may be able to increase the proportion of fitter T-cells produced during expansion, increase their proliferative potential, and inhibit activation-induced cell death, thereby improving the cancer killing activity of our engineered CAR-T cells thereby making them more effective and safer in the treatment of cancers. Initial data were published in an abstract that was presented at the December 2019 ASH meeting and also won an ASH Abstract Achievement award.\nWe plan to continue development of this technology in combination approaches that could add to the observed efficacy benefits of current generation CAR-T products. In addition, we anticipate that our GM-CSF knockout gene-editing CAR-T platform may be a future backbone for controlling the serious side-effects that hamper CAR-T therapy that lead to serious and sometimes fatal outcomes for patients as a result of the CAR-T therapy itself.\n 80 \n\nEphA3-CAR: Targeting Tumor Stroma and Tumor Vasculature\nWe have begun to generate our own pipeline of CAR-T therapies including an EphA3-CAR-T based on the ifabotuzumab v-region and backbone. Ifabotuzumab is a Humaneered anti-EphA3 monoclonal antibody. Ifabotuzumab has the potential to kill tumor cells by targeting tumor stroma that protects them and the vasculature that feeds them. This unique combination of activities as a backbone of a CAR-T therapy may provide the potential to generate durable responses in a range of solid tumors by targeting the tissues that surround, protect, and nourish a growing cancer.\nBy developing an EphA3-CAR-T using ifabotuzumab as the backbone, we may have the ability to target the tumor, tumor stroma, and tumor vasculature in a novel manner. We are collaborating with the Mayo Clinic and plan to move to clinical testing with an anti-EphA3 construct for a range of cancer types after completing IND-enabling work. We have published initial data from our Phase I study in an abstract that was accepted for the November 2019 SNO meeting, showing data in glioblastoma multiforme, a form of brain cancer.\nEMR1-CAR: Targeting Eosinophils\nOur EMR1-CAR-T product is based on the HGEN005 (anti-EMR1 Humaneered monoclonal antibody) backbone and targets EMR1. Our EMR1-CAR-T based on the HGEN005 backbone is another approach in our growing platform of CAR-T therapies. We believe that because of its high selectivity, EMR1-CAR-T has significant potential to treat serious eosinophil diseases.\nIn preclinical work, HGEN005's anti-EMR1 activity resulted in dramatically enhanced killing of eosinophils from normal and eosinophilic donors and also induced a rapid and sustained depletion of eosinophils in a non-human primate model without any clinically significant adverse events. We have engaged with NIH to discuss expanding the initial work they have conducted utilizing HGEN005 and discussions are underway with a leading center in the U.S. to perform the IND-enabling testing in eosinophilic leukemia, an orphan condition with significant unmet need, as well as with several other potential partners, although we cannot assure you that we will reach any agreements for these next steps.\nOperating Losses and Liquidity\nWe have incurred significant losses and had an accumulated deficit of $284.9 million as of December 31, 2019. We expect to continue to incur net losses for the foreseeable future as we develop our drug candidates, expand clinical trials for our drug candidates currently in clinical development, expand our development activities and seek regulatory approvals. Significant capital is required to continue to develop and to launch a product and many expenses are incurred before revenue is received, if any. We are unable to predict the extent of any future losses or when we will receive revenue or become profitable, if at all.\nWe will require substantial additional capital to continue as a going concern and to support our business efforts, including obtaining regulatory approvals for our product candidates, clinical trials and other studies, and, if approved, the commercialization of our product candidates. We anticipate that we will seek additional financing from a number of sources, including, but not limited to, the sale of equity or debt securities, strategic collaborations, and licensing of our product candidates. Additional funding may not be available to us on a timely basis or at acceptable terms, if at all. Our ability to access capital when needed is not assured and, if not achieved on a timely basis, would materially harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. If adequate funds are not available, we may be required to delay, reduce the scope of, or eliminate one or more of our development programs. We may also be required to sell or license to others our technologies, product candidates, or development programs that we would have preferred to develop and commercialize ourselves and on less than favorable terms, if at all. If in the best interests of our stockholders, we may also find it appropriate to enter into a strategic transaction that could result in, among other things, a sale, merger, consolidation or business combination.\n 81 \n\nIf management is unsuccessful in efforts to raise additional capital, based on our current levels of operating expenses, our current capital is not expected to be sufficient to fund our operations for the next twelve months. These conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. The Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm at the beginning of the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K includes an explanatory paragraph about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2019 were prepared on the basis of a going concern, which contemplates that we will be able to realize our assets and discharge liabilities in the normal course of business. Our ability to meet our liabilities and to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the availability of future funding. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if we are unable to continue as a going concern.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates\nOur management's discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S., or GAAP. The preparation of our financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts and disclosures reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates. Our management believes judgment is involved in determining revenue recognition, the fair value-based measurement of stock-based compensation and accruals. Our management evaluates estimates and assumptions as facts and circumstances dictate. As future events and their effects cannot be determined with precision, actual results could differ from these estimates and assumptions, and those differences could be material to the Consolidated Financial Statements. If our assumptions change, we may need to revise our estimates, or take other corrective actions, either of which may also have a material adverse effect on our statements of operations, liquidity and financial condition.\nUntil December 31, 2018, we qualified as an emerging growth company ( EGC\u201d) under the JOBS Act. Emerging growth companies can delay adopting new or revised accounting standards until such time as those standards apply to private companies. We elected to avail ourselves of this exemption from new or revised accounting standards and, therefore, we may not be subject to the same new or revised accounting standards as other public companies that are not emerging growth companies.\nA registrant with EGC status loses its eligibility as an EGC five years after its common equity initial public offering, December 31, 2018 for our company. Accordingly, we are required to adopt new accounting standards on the same timeline as other public companies effective January 1, 2018. See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of the impact of new accounting standards adopted in 2019.\nWhile our significant accounting policies are described in more detail in Note 3 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we believe the following accounting policies to be critical to the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements.\nAccrued Research and Development Expenses\nAs part of the process of preparing our Consolidated Financial Statements, we are required to estimate our accrued research and development expenses. This process involves reviewing contracts and purchase orders, reviewing the terms of our license agreements, communicating with our applicable personnel to identify services that have been performed on our behalf, and estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred for the service when we have not yet been invoiced or otherwise notified of actual cost. Some of our service providers invoice us monthly in arrears for services performed. We make estimates of our accrued expenses as of each balance sheet date based on facts and circumstances known to us at that time. Examples of estimated accrued research and development expenses include fees to:\n \u00b7 contract research organizations and other service providers in connection with clinical studies; \n \u00b7 contract manufacturers in connection with the production of clinical trial materials; and \n \u00b7 vendors in connection with preclinical development activities. \n 82 \n\nWe base our expenses related to clinical studies on our estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to contracts with multiple research institutions and contract research organizations that conduct and manage clinical studies on our behalf. The financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation, vary from contract to contract, and may result in uneven payment flows and expense recognition. Payments under some of these contracts depend on factors such as the successful enrollment of patients and the completion of clinical trial milestones. In accruing these costs, we estimate the time period over which services will be performed for which we have not been invoiced and the level of effort to be expended in each period. If the actual timing of the performance of services or the level of effort varies from our estimate, we adjust the accrual accordingly. Our understanding of the status and timing of services performed relative to the actual status and timing of services performed may vary and may result in our reporting changes in estimates in any particular period.\nStock-Based Compensation\nOur stock-based compensation expense for stock options is estimated at the grant date based on the award's fair value as calculated by the Black-Scholes option pricing model and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period. The Black-Scholes option pricing model requires various highly judgmental assumptions including expected volatility and expected term. The expected volatility is based on the historical stock volatilities of several of our publicly listed peers over a period equal to the expected terms of the options as we do not have a sufficient trading history to use the volatility of our own common stock. To estimate the expected term, we have opted to use the simplified method, which is the use of the midpoint of the vesting term and the contractual term. If any of the assumptions used in the Black-Scholes option pricing model changes significantly, stock-based compensation expense may differ materially in the future from that recorded in the current period. In addition, we are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and only recognize expense for those shares expected to vest. We estimate the forfeiture rate based on historical experience and our expectations regarding future pre-vesting termination behavior of employees. To the extent our actual forfeiture rate is different from our estimate, stock-based compensation expense is adjusted accordingly.\nRevenue Recognition\nOur revenue to date has been generated primarily through license agreements and research and development collaboration agreements. We had no revenues for the years ending December 31, 2018 and 2019. Commencing January 1, 2018, we recognize revenue in accordance with Accounting Standards Update ( ASU\u201d) 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)\u201d ( ASC 606\u201d). The core principle of ASC 606 is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods and/or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods and/or services. To determine the appropriate amount of revenue to be recognized for arrangements that we determine are within the scope of ASC 606, the Company performs the following steps: (i) identify the contract(s) with the customer, (ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract, (iii) determine the transaction price, (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract and (v) recognize revenue when (or as) each performance obligation is satisfied.\nRevenue under technology licenses and collaborative agreements typically consists of nonrefundable and/or guaranteed license fees, collaborative research funding, and various milestone and future product royalty or profit-sharing payments. These agreements are generally referred to as multiple element arrangements\u201d.\nWe apply the accounting standard on revenue recognition for multiple element arrangements. The fair value of deliverables under the arrangement may be derived using a best estimate of selling price if vendor specific objective evidence and third-party evidence is not available. Deliverables under the arrangement will be separate units of accounting if a delivered item has value to the customer on a standalone basis and if the arrangement includes a general right of return for the delivered item, delivery or performance of the undelivered item is considered probable and substantially in our control.\n 83 \n\nWe recognize upfront license payments as revenue upon delivery of the license only if the license has standalone value from any undelivered performance obligations and that value can be determined. The undelivered performance obligations typically include manufacturing or development services or research and/or steering committee services. If the fair value of the undelivered performance obligations can be determined, then these obligations would be accounted for separately. If the license is not considered to have standalone value, then the license and other undelivered performance obligations would be accounted for as a single unit of accounting. In this case, the license payments and payments for performance obligations are recognized as revenue over the estimated period of when the performance obligations are performed or deferred indefinitely until the undelivered performance obligation is determined.\nWhenever we determine that an arrangement should be accounted for as a single unit of accounting, we determine the period over which the performance obligations will be performed, and revenue will be recognized. Revenue is recognized using a proportional performance or straight-line method. The proportional performance method is used when the level of effort required to complete performance obligations under an arrangement can be reasonably estimated. The amount of revenue recognized under the proportional performance method is determined by multiplying the total payments under the contract, excluding royalties and payments contingent upon achievement of milestones, by the ratio of the level of effort performed to date to the estimated total level of effort required to complete performance obligations under the arrangement. If we cannot reasonably estimate the level of effort to complete performance obligations under an arrangement, we recognize revenue under the arrangement on a straight-line basis over the period we are expected to complete our performance obligations. Significant management judgment is required in determining the level of effort required under an arrangement and the period over which we are expected to complete our performance obligations under an arrangement.\nOur collaboration agreements typically entitle us to additional payments upon the achievement of development, regulatory and sales performance-based milestones. If the achievement of a milestone is considered probable at the inception of the collaboration, the related milestone payment is included with other collaboration consideration, such as upfront fees and research funding, in our revenue calculation. Typically, these milestones are not considered probable at the inception of the collaboration. As such, milestones will typically be recognized in one of two ways depending on the timing of when the milestone is achieved. If the milestone is achieved during the performance period, then we will only recognize revenue to the extent of the proportional performance achieved at that date, or the proportion of the straight-line basis achieved at that date, and the remainder will be recorded as deferred revenue to be amortized over the remaining performance period. If the milestone is achieved after the performance period has completed and all performance obligations have been delivered, then we will recognize the milestone payment as Revenue in its entirety in the period the milestone was achieved.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nFor a discussion of new accounting pronouncements, see Note 3, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nResults of Operations\nGeneral\nAt December 31, 2019, we had an accumulated deficit of $284.9 million, primarily as a result of research and development and general and administrative expenses as well as costs incurred in reorganization. While we may in the future generate revenue from a variety of sources, including license fees, milestone payments, and research and development payments in connection with strategic partnerships, our product candidates are at an early stage of development and may never be successfully developed or commercialized. Accordingly, we expect to continue to incur substantial losses from operations for the foreseeable future, and there can be no assurance that we will ever generate significant revenue or profits.\n 84 \n\nResearch and Development Expenses\n\tConducting research and development is central to our business model. We expense both internal and external research and development costs as incurred. We track external research and development costs incurred by project for each of our clinical programs. We have continued to refine our systems and our methodology in tracking external research and development costs. Our external research and development costs consist primarily of:\n \u00b7 expenses incurred under agreements with contract research organizations, investigative sites, and consultants that conduct our clinical trials and a substantial portion of our preclinical activities; \n \u00b7 the cost of acquiring and manufacturing clinical trial and other materials; and \n \u00b7 other costs associated with development activities, including additional studies. \nOther research and development costs consist primarily of internal research and development costs such as salaries and related fringe benefit costs for our employees (such as workers compensation and health insurance premiums), stock-based compensation charges, travel costs, lab supplies, overhead expenses such as rent and utilities, and external costs not allocated to one of our clinical programs. Internal research and development costs generally benefit multiple projects and are not separately tracked per project. The following table shows our total research and development expenses for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 ($000's):\n\nWe expect to continue to incur substantial expenses related to our research and development activities for the foreseeable future as we continue product development including our development efforts for lenzilumab to reduce the serious and potentially life-threatening side-effects associated with CAR-T therapy and potentially improve efficacy. Depending on the results of our development efforts we expect to incur substantial costs to prepare for potential clinical trials and activities for lenzilumab.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses consist principally of personnel-related costs, professional fees for legal, consulting, audit and tax services, rent and other general operating expenses not otherwise included in research and development. For the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, general and administrative expenses were $6.3 million and $9.1 million, respectively.\n 85 \n\nComparison of Years Ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 ($000's)\n\nResearch and development expenses increased $0.4 million in 2019 from $2.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 to $2.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase is primarily due to the increase in spending in preparation for the phase Ib/II clinical trial of Lenzilumab with Kite's Yescarta in CAR-T therapy. We expect our research and development expenses will increase substantially in 2020 compared to 2019, due to the commencement of enrollment in the trial.\nGeneral and administrative expenses decreased $2.8 million in 2019 from $9.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 to $6.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease in general and administrative expenses is primarily attributable to a $2.7 million decrease in stock-based compensation expense related to the issuance of options to management, consultants and board members subsequent to the completion of the Restructuring Transactions in 2018 without such issuances in 2019. We expect our general and administrative expenses to increase somewhat in 2020 as compared to 2019 due to the expected addition of positions in the finance and accounting area with the objective of improving internal controls and eliminating the material weakness that exists as of December 31, 2019.\nInterest expense increased $0.5 million from $0.8 million recognized for the year ended December 31, 2018 to $1.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily consisted of $0.2 million for interest and amortization of debt discount related to the Advance Notes, entered into in June, July and August 2018, $0.8 million for interest and amortization of debt discount related to the 2018 Convertible Notes entered into in September 2018, $0.1 million in interest and amortization of debt discount related to the 2019 Convertible Notes entered into in April 2019, $0.1 million in interest related to the 2019 Bridge Notes entered into in June and November 2019 and $0.1 million in interest related to the Notes payable to vendors related to our 2016 bankruptcy filing. Interest expense of $0.9 million recognized for the year ended December 31, 2018 is comprised of $0.4 million for interest and loan issuance costs related to the Term Loans (as defined below), $0.2 million for interest and amortization of debt discount related to the Advance Notes, $0.2 million for interest and amortization of debt discount related to the 2018 Convertible Notes and $0.1 million for interest related to the Notes payable to vendors related to our 2016 bankruptcy filing.\nReorganization items, net for the year ended December 31, 2018 primarily consisted of legal fees. There were no Reorganization items, net incurred for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nOther income, net for the year ended December 31, 2018 primarily consisted of legal fees assumed by Madison Joint Venture LLC related to their positive election related to the assets related to benznidazole, our former drug candidate (see Note 9).\n 86 \n\nIncome Taxes\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $166.2 million to offset future federal income taxes which expire in the years 2021 through 2037, and approximately $172.1 million that may offset future state income taxes which expire in the years 2028 through 2039. We also have federal net operating loss carryforwards generated in 2018 and 2019 of $15.4 million that have no expiration date as a result of the tax law changes signed into law on December 22, 2017. Current federal and state tax laws include substantial restrictions on the utilization of net operating losses and tax credits in the event of an ownership change. Even if the carryforwards are available, they may be subject to annual limitations, lack of future taxable income, or future ownership changes that could result in the expiration of the carryforwards before they are utilized. At December 31, 2019, we recorded a 100% valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets of approximately $57.4 million, as at that time our management believed it was uncertain that they would be fully realized. If we determine in the future that we will be able to realize all or a portion of our deferred tax assets, an adjustment to our valuation allowance would increase net income in the period in which we make such a determination.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nSince our inception, we have financed our operations primarily through proceeds from the public offerings and private placements of our common stock, private placements of our preferred stock, debt financings, interest income earned on cash, and cash equivalents, and marketable securities, borrowings against lines of credit, and receipts from prior collaboration agreements. At December 31, 2019, we had cash and cash equivalents of $0.1 million. As of March 13, 2020, we had cash and cash equivalents of $268,000.\nThe following table sets forth the primary sources and uses of cash and cash equivalents for each of the periods presented below ($000's):\n\nNet cash used in operating activities was $4.0 million and $6.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Cash used in operating activities in 2018 primarily related to our net loss of $12.0 million, adjusted for non-cash items, such as $4.8 million in stock-based compensation, $0.8 million in non-cash interest expense and other non-cash items of $0.2 million. Cash used in operating activities in 2019 primarily related to our net loss of $10.3 million, adjusted for non-cash items, such as $2.0 million in stock-based compensation, $1.3 million in non-cash interest expense, changes in operating assets and liabilities of $2.8 million and other non-cash items of $0.2 million.\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $3.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This amount consists primarily of $2.0 million received from the issuance of the 2019 Bridge Notes (as defined below) entered into in June and November 2019, $1.3 million from the issuance of the 2019 Notes (as defined below) entered into in April 2019, $0.3 million received from the exercise of stock options, $0.2 million received from the issuance of common stock under the equity line of credit with Lincoln Park Capital Fund, LLC ( Lincoln Park\u201d), offset by $0.5 million in payments made against the Notes payable to vendors.\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $6.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This amount consists primarily of $1.5 million received from Cheval Holdings, Ltd. ( Cheval\u201d), an affiliate of Black Horse Capital, L.P., the Company's controlling stockholder ( BHC\u201d), related to the Restructuring Transactions (see Restructuring Transactions\u201d below), $1.1 million from the issuance of 2,445,557 shares of our common stock to accredited investors on March 12, 2018, $0.2 million received from the issuance of 400,000 shares of our common stock to an accredited investor on June 4, 2018, $0.9 million received from the issuance of the Advance Notes in June, July and August 2018 and $2.5 million received for the issuance of the Notes in September 2018.\n 87 \n\nRestructuring Transactions\nIn December 2016, we entered into a Credit and Security Agreement (as amended, the Term Loan Credit Agreement\u201d) providing for an original $3.0 million credit facility (the December 2016 Term Loan\u201d), net of certain fees and expenses. On March 21, 2017, we entered into an amendment to the Term Loan Credit Agreement to obtain an additional $5.5 million (the March 2017 Term Loan\u201d), net of certain fees and expenses, providing additional working capital. On July 8, 2017, we entered into a second amendment to the Term Loan Credit Agreement to obtain an additional $5.0 million (the July 2017 Term Loan\u201d), net of certain fees and expenses, providing additional working capital. As of the third quarter of 2017, we had received the entire amount available under the Term Loan Credit Agreement.\nOn December 21, 2017, we entered into a Securities Purchase and Loan Satisfaction Agreement (the Purchase Agreement\u201d) and a Forbearance and Loan Modification Agreement (the Forbearance Agreement\u201d and, together with the Purchase Agreement, the Restructuring Agreements\u201d), each with the Term Loan Lenders, in connection with a series of transactions providing for, among other things, the satisfaction and extinguishment of our outstanding obligations under the Term Loan Credit Agreement and the infusion of $3.0 million of new capital. The Restructuring Transactions were completed on February 27, 2018. For additional information regarding the Restructuring Transactions, see Restructuring Transactions\u201d in Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nLiquidity\nDespite completing the Restructuring Transactions, we will require substantial additional capital to continue as a going concern and to support our business efforts, including pursuing our collaboration with Kite and obtaining regulatory approvals for our product candidates, lenzilumab, ifabotuzumab and HGEN005, clinical trials and other studies, and, if approved, the commercialization of our product candidates. Under the Kite Agreement, the parties have agreed to conduct a multi-center Phase 1/2 study of lenzilumab with Kite's Yescarta in patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell lymphoma. We currently project we will be responsible for an aggregate of approximately $8 million in out-of-pocket costs assuming a total of 72 patients are enrolled in the Study, of which $2 million will be required to be paid to Kite thirty days prior to the initiation of the Study. The amount of capital we will require and the timing of our need for additional capital will depend on many factors, including:\n \u00b7 the type, number, timing, progress, costs, and results of the product candidate development programs that we are pursuing or may choose to pursue in the future; \n \u00b7 the scope, progress, expansion, costs, and results of our preclinical and clinical trials; \n \u00b7 the timing of and costs involved in obtaining regulatory approvals; \n \u00b7 the success, progress, timing and costs of our efforts to evaluate or consummate various strategic alternatives if in the best interests of our stockholders; \n \u00b7 our ability to re-list our common stock on a national securities exchange, whether through a new listing or by completing a strategic transaction; \n \u00b7 our ability to establish and maintain development partnering arrangements and any associated funding; \n \u00b7 the emergence of competing products or technologies and other adverse market developments; \n \u00b7 the costs of maintaining, expanding, and protecting our intellectual property portfolio, including potential litigation costs and liabilities; \n \u00b7 the resources we devote to marketing, and, if approved, commercializing our product candidates; \n \u00b7 the scope, progress, expansion and costs of manufacturing our product candidates; and \n \u00b7 the costs associated with being a public company. \n 88 \n\nAs of December 31, 2019, our current liabilities of approximately $13.6 million exceeded our current assets of approximately $0.5 million. Our cash position as of June 30, 2019 was insufficient for us to satisfy in full at maturity on June 30, 2019 all of the outstanding principal amount and accrued but unpaid interest on unsecured promissory notes we made to certain of our vendors upon our emergence from bankruptcy. We paid approximately $0.5 million to extinguish certain of these notes in July and August 2019. As of December 31, 2019, the aggregate principal amount and accrued but unpaid interest on these notes approximates $1.1 million. The outstanding principal amount and accrued but unpaid interest on these notes is currently payable to the respective holders without demand, notice or declaration, and the holders, without demand or notice of any kind, may exercise any and all other rights and remedies available to them under the notes, our bankruptcy plan, at law or in equity. We do not have sufficient funds to repay the principal and accrued but unpaid notes.\nAccordingly, we will need to seek additional financing from a number of sources, including, but not limited to, the sale of equity or debt securities, strategic collaborations, and licensing of our product candidates, to enable us to pursue the Kite collaboration and our other business initiatives. Since 2018, our capital-raising efforts have succeeded in raising a series of short-term bridge loans and convertible debt financings, including short-term bridge financings in June 2019 and November 2019 advanced, as applicable, by our two largest stockholders, which collectively control approximately 88% of our outstanding common stock as of December 31, 2019, and our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Dr. Durrant. In December 2019 we also effected an equity line of credit with LPC.\nAdditional funding may not be available to us on a timely basis or at acceptable terms, if at all. Our ability to access capital when needed is not assured and, if not achieved on a timely basis, would materially harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. If adequate funds are not available, we may be required to delay, reduce the scope of, or eliminate one or more of our development programs. We may also be required to sell or license to others our technologies, product candidates, or development programs that we would have preferred to develop and commercialize ourselves and on less than favorable terms, if at all. If in the best interests of our stockholders, we may also find it appropriate to enter into a strategic transaction that could result in, among other things, a sale, merger, consolidation or business combination.\nIf management is unsuccessful in efforts to raise additional capital, based on our current levels of operating expenses, our current capital will not be sufficient to fund our operations for the next twelve months. These conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nOur common stock currently trades on the OTCQB Venture Market under the ticker symbol HGEN\u201d. Although our common stock is listed for quotation on the OTCQB Venture Market, trading is limited and an active market for our common stock may never develop in the future, which could harm our ability to raise capital to continue to fund operations.\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nThe following table summarizes our contractual obligations at December 31, 2019 and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future years. ($000's)\n\n 89 \n\nOperating Leases\nIn April 2016 we entered into a lease agreement for a facility in Brisbane, California. The lease commenced in April 2016. This lease expired on September 30, 2018. In May 2018, we entered into a month-to-month lease agreement for a new facility in Burlingame, California. We terminated the lease on November 1, 2019 and entered into a sub-lease agreement for space in the same building in Burlingame, California. The sub-lease initial term expires on March 31, 2020 and is renewable for additional terms by mutual agreement.\nNotes Payable to Vendors\nOn June 30, 2016, we issued promissory notes in an aggregate principal amount of approximately $1.2 million to certain claimants in accordance with the Plan. The notes are unsecured, bear interest at 10% per annum and became due and payable in full, including principal and accrued interest on June 30, 2019. In July and August, 2019, following the receipt of proceeds from the 2019 Bridge Notes, we used approximately $0.5 million of the proceeds to retire a portion of these notes, including accrued interest. After giving effect to these payments, the aggregate principal amount and accrued but unpaid interest on these notes approximates $1.1 million as of December 31, 2019. As of December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, we have accrued $0.3 million and $0.3 million in interest related to these promissory notes, respectively. The outstanding principal amount and accrued but unpaid interest on these notes is currently payable to the respective holders without demand, notice or declaration, and the holders, without demand or notice of any kind, may exercise any and all other rights and remedies available to them under the notes, the Plan, at law or in equity. Currently, we do not have sufficient funds to repay the principal and accrued but unpaid interest on these notes in their entirety.\nAdvance Notes\nIn June, July and August 2018, we received an aggregate of $0.9 million of proceeds from advances made to us (the Advance Notes\u201d) by four different lenders including Dr. Cameron Durrant, the Company's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Cheval, an affiliate of BHC, the Company's controlling stockholder; and Ronald Barliant, a director of the Company (collectively the Advance Note Lenders\u201d). The Advance Notes accrued interest at a rate of 7% per year, compounded annually.\nIn accordance with their terms, on May 30, 2019, in connection with our announcement of the Kite Agreement, the Advance Note Lenders converted the amounts due under the Advance Notes into common stock at the conversion price of $0.45 per share. We issued a total of 2,179,622 shares of common stock in connection with the conversion.\n2018 Convertible Notes\nCommencing September 19, 2018, we delivered a series of convertible promissory notes (the 2018 Notes\u201d) evidencing an aggregate of $2.5 million of loans made to us by six different lenders, including an affiliate of BHC, our controlling stockholder. The 2018 Notes bear interest at a rate of 7% per annum and will mature on the earliest of (i) twenty-four months from the date the 2018 Notes were signed, (ii) the occurrence of any customary event of default, or (iii) the certain liquidation events including any dissolution or winding up of our company or merger or sale by us of all or substantially all of our assets (in any case, a Liquidation Event\u201d). We used the proceeds from the 2018 Notes for working capital.\nThe 2018 Notes are convertible into our equity securities in three different scenarios:\nIf we sell our equity securities on or before the date of repayment of the 2018 Notes in any financing transaction that results in gross proceeds to us of at least $10 million (a Qualified Financing\u201d), the 2018 Notes will be converted into either (i) such equity securities as the noteholder would acquire if the principal and accrued but unpaid interest thereon (the Conversion Amount\u201d) were invested directly in the financing on the same terms and conditions as given to the financing investors in the Qualified Financing, or (ii) common stock at a conversion price equal to $0.45 per share (subject to ratable adjustment for any stock split, stock dividend, stock combination or other recapitalization occurring subsequent to the date of the Notes).\n 90 \n\nIf we sell our equity securities on or before the date of repayment of the 2018 Notes in any financing transaction that results in gross proceeds to us of less than $10 million (a Non-Qualified Financing\u201d),", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis together with our Consolidated Financial Statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. For additional discussion, see SPECIAL NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\u201d above.\nOverview\nWe were incorporated on March 15, 2000 in California and reincorporated as a Delaware corporation in September 2001 under the name KaloBios Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Effective August 7, 2017, we changed our legal name to Humanigen, Inc.\nDuring February 2018, we completed the financial restructuring transactions announced in December 2017 and furthered our transformation into a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company.\nDuring 2019, we completed our transformation into a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing our clinical stage immuno-oncology and immunology portfolio of monoclonal antibodies. We are focusing our efforts on the development of our lead product candidate, lenzilumab, through our collaboration with Kite to study the effect of lenzilumab on the safety of Yescarta, including CRS, with a secondary endpoint of increased efficacy. We believe this study, ZUMA-19, may be the basis for registration of lenzilumab given the similar trial design to Yescarta's and Kymriah's registration trials.\nWe are also exploring the effectiveness of our GM-CSF neutralization technologies (either through the use of lenzilumab as a neutralizing antibody or through GM-CSF gene knockout) in combination with other CAR-T, T-cell engaging, and immunotherapy treatments to break the efficacy/toxicity linkage including the prevention and/or treatment of GvHD while preserving GvL benefits in patients undergoing allogeneic HSCT. In this context, GvHD is akin to CRS, or cytokine storm and we believe the mechanism to be driven by GM-CSF levels. The recent coronavirus pandemic which is due to the SARS-CoV-2 virus and leads to the condition referred to as COVID-19, is characterized in the later and sometimes fatal stages by lung dysfunction which is triggered by CRS, or cytokine storm. Recent publications point to GM-CSF being a key cytokine, with elevated levels especially in those patients who transition to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). We have established several partnerships with leading institutions to advance our innovative pipeline and are in active discussion with several government and commercial organizations.\nWe believe that we have a dominant intellectual property position in the area of GM-CSF neutralization through multiple approaches and mechanisms, as they pertain to COVID-19, CAR-T, GvHD and multiple other oncology/transplantation, inflammation, fibrosis and autoimmune conditions which may be driven by GM-CSF.\nDuring 2019, we have also advanced our preclinical next-generation cell and gene therapies for the treatment of cancers via our novel GM-CSF neutralization and gene-knockout platforms.\nAs a leader in GM-CSF pathway science, we believe that we have the ability to transform prevention of CRS in SARS-CoV-2 infection. The virus associated with the current COVID-19 pandemic, SARS-Cov-2, is one of a group of several betacoronaviruses, which includes the viruses responsible for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV). These viruses infect predominantly the lower lung and cause fatal pneumonia. Other coronaviruses infect the upper respiratory tract and cause some cases of the common cold. The clinical course of COVID-19 can be mistaken for influenza infection - patients in both cases often suffer from aches and pains throughout the body, fever, cough and general malaise. COVID-19 is not typically associated with a productive cough - rather it tends to be a dry cough - and sneezing is less common. A nasal or throat swab can be used to test for SARS-CoV-2 infection, and blood tests can be run to check for viral titers. Travel to areas where COVID-19 appears to have a large number of cases and exposure to people who are known to have suffered from the condition or carriers of SARS-CoV-2 also increases the clinical suspicion of possible infection. Data generated during the SARS and MERS outbreaks point to cytokine storm as a phase of the illness which is characterized by an immune hyperactive phase, which then can progress to lung dysfunction and death. The natural history of SARS infection shows viral load actually decreases as patients enter the second phase.\n 77 \nTable 371: <table><tr><td>Table of Contents </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nRecent data from China and the subject of a pre-publication titled Aberrant pathogenic GM-CSF+ T cells and inflammatory CD14+CD16+ monocytes in severe pulmonary syndrome patients of a new coronavirus\u201d, supports the hypothesis that cytokine storm-induced immune mechanisms have contributed to patient mortality with the current pandemic strain of coronavirus.\nThe severe clinical features associated with some COVID-19 infections result from an inflammation-induced lung injury requiring Intensive Care Unit (ICU) care and mechanical ventilation. This lung injury is a result of a cytokine storm resulting from a hyper-reactive immune response. The lung injury that leads to death is not directly related to the virus, but appears to be a result of a hyper-reactive immune response to the virus triggering a cytokine storm that can continue even after viral titers begin to fall.\nThe authors of the study assessed samples from patients with severe pneumonia resulting from COVID-19 infection to identify whether inflammatory factors such as GM-CSF, G-CSF, IL-6, MCP-1, MIP 1 alpha, IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha were implicated.\nThe authors noted that steroid treatment in such cases has been disappointing in terms of outcome, but suggested that a monoclonal antibody that targets GM-CSF may prevent or curb the hyper-active immune response caused by COVID-19 in this setting. Humanigen believes that the authors' findings are worthy of further investigation, suggesting that to reduce or eradicate ICU care and prevent deaths from COVID-19 infection, an intervention may be needed to prevent cytokine storm.\nSeparate publications confirm that cytokine storm is characterized by surge of high levels of circulating inflammatory cytokines, and is an overreaction of the immune system under the conditions, such as CAR-T therapy and patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. These recent studies revealed that high levels of GM-CSF, along with a few other cytokines, are critically associated with severe clinical complications in COVID-19 patients. High concentration of GM-CSF was found in the plasma of severe and critically ill patients, which account for approximately 20% of all patients, especially in those requiring intensive care.\nLenzilumab has been shown to prevent cytokine storm in animal models and this work has been published in peer reviewed journals. Patients are expected to be enrolled soon in a clinical study to determine lenzilumab's effect on cytokine storm associated with the hyper-active immune response associated with CAR-T therapy in collaboration with Kite Pharma.\nThe Company believes these new data suggest that GM-CSF may be a critical triggering cytokine in the increased mortality in the current coronavirus pandemic. A potential program in COVID-19 to prevent cytokine storm is complementary to the programs in CAR-T and GvHD, which are also focused on preventing or reducing cytokine storm in those disease states.\nAs a leader in GM-CSF pathway science, we believe that we have the ability to transform CAR-T therapy and a broad range of other T-cell engaging therapies, including both autologous and allogeneic cell transplantation. There is a direct correlation between the efficacy of CAR-T therapy and the incidence of life-threatening toxicities (referred to as the efficacy/toxicity linkage).We believe that our GM-CSF neutralization and gene-editing CAR-T platform technologies have the potential to reduce the inflammatory cascade associated with serious and potentially life-threatening CAR-T therapy-related side-effects while preserving and potentially improving the efficacy of the CAR-T therapy itself, thereby breaking the efficacy/toxicity linkage. Clinical correlative analysis and preclinical in vivo evidence points to GM-CSF as the key initiator of the inflammatory cascade resulting in CAR-T therapy's side-effects, including CRS and NT. GM-CSF has also been linked to the suppressive myeloid cell axis through recruitment of MDSCs that reduce CAR-T cell expansion and hamper CAR-T cell efficacy. Our strategy is to continue to pioneer the use of GM-CSF neutralization and GM-CSF gene knockout technologies to improve efficacy and prevent or significantly reduce the serious side-effects associated with CAR-T therapy.\nWe believe that our GM-CSF pathway science, assets and expertise create two technology platforms to assist in the development of next-generation CAR-T therapies. Lenzilumab has the potential to be used in combination with any FDA-approved or development stage T-cell therapy, including CAR-T therapy, as well as in combination with other cell therapies such as HSCT to make these treatments safer and more effective.\n 78 \nTable 373: <table><tr><td>Table of Contents </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe have utilized a precision medicine approach and personalized the development of lenzilumab based on specific genetic mutations or biomarkers at baseline. We recently reported on a Phase I study of lenzilumab as monotherapy in refractory chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) and are now planning a potential Phase II study of lenzilumab in combination with azacitidine (current standard therapy) in newly-diagnosed CMML patients with certain genetic mutations. We are also planning a potential Phase II/III study focused on early intervention with lenzilumab in patients at high risk for acute Graft versus Host Disease (GvHD) based on specific biomarkers. We have also reported on a Phase II study in severe asthma utilizing lenzilumab, which showed a statistically significant improvement in efficacy and favorable safety profile in patients with eosinophilic asthma, 21 of whom received lenzilumab vs. 20 patients who received placebo. In addition, our GM-CSF knockout gene-editing CAR-T platform has the potential to create next-generation CAR-T therapies that may inherently avoid any efficacy/toxicity linkage, thereby potentially preserving the benefits of the CAR-T therapy while reducing or altogether avoiding its serious and potentially life-threatening side-effects.\nOur immediate focus is combining FDA-approved and development stage CAR-T therapies with lenzilumab, our lead product candidate. A clinical collaboration with Kite was recently announced to evaluate the use of lenzilumab with Yescarta.\nWe are also creating next-generation combinatory gene-edited CAR-T therapies using strategies to improve efficacy while employing GM-CSF gene knockout technologies to control toxicity. This includes developing our own portfolio of proprietary first-in-class EphA3-CAR-Ts for various solid cancers and EMR1-CAR-Ts for various eosinophilic disorders.\nLenzilumab\nLenzilumab neutralizes human GM-CSF and has the potential to prevent or reduce certain serious side-effects associated with CAR-T therapy (CRS and neurotoxicity) and improve upon the efficacy of CAR-T therapy. This same mechanism we believe to be the causation of CRS/cytokine storm which precedes the decline in lung function seen with severe cases of COVID-19. Preclinical data generated in collaboration with the Mayo Clinic, which was published in \u2018blood\u00ae', a premier journal in hematology, indicates that the use of lenzilumab in combination with CAR-T therapy may also enhance the proliferation and improve the efficacy of CAR-T therapy. This may also result in durable, or longer term, responses in CAR-T therapies.\nThere are currently no products approved by the FDA for the prevention of CRS/cytokine storm associated with COVID-19. Also there are currently no products approved by the FDA for the prevention of CAR-T therapy-related side effects, nor are there any approved therapies for the treatment of CAR-T therapy related NT. We continue to advance the development of lenzilumab in combination with CAR-T therapy through a non-exclusive clinical collaboration with Kite, pursuant to which we are conducting a multi-center Phase Ib/II study (the Study\u201d) of lenzilumab with Kite's Yescarta in patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell lymphoma, including diffuse large B-cell lymphoma ( DLBCL\u201d). The Study has been designated the nomenclature \u2018ZUMA-19', consistent with the other Kite CAR-T studies, which also receive a \u2018ZUMA' designation. The primary objective of ZUMA-19 is to determine the effect of lenzilumab on the safety and efficacy of Yescarta. Kite's Yescarta is one of two CAR-T therapies that have been approved by the FDA and is the CAR-T therapy market leader, and our collaboration with Kite is currently the only clinical collaboration which is now enrolling patients with the potential to improve both the safety and efficacy of CAR-T therapy. We also plan to measure other potentially beneficial effects on efficacy and healthcare resource utilization. In addition, lenzilumab's success in preventing serious and potentially life-threatening side-effects could offer economic benefits to medical system payers by making the CAR-T therapy capable of being administered, and follow-up care subsequently monitored and managed, potentially on an out-patient basis in certain patients and circumstances. In turn, we believe that delivering such provider and payer benefits might accelerate the use of the CAR-T therapy itself, and thereby permit us to generate further revenues from sales of lenzilumab.\n 79 \nTable 375: <table><tr><td>Table of Contents </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn addition to COVID-19 and CAR-T therapy, we are committed to advancing our diverse platform for GM-CSF axis suppression for a broad range of other T-cell engaging therapies, including both autologous and allogeneic next generation CAR-T therapies, bi-specific antibody therapies, as well as other cell-based immunotherapies in development, including allogeneic HSCT, with our current and future partners.\nIn July 2019, we entered into the Zurich Agreement with UZH. Under the Zurich Agreement, we have in-licensed certain technologies that we believe may be used to prevent or treat GvHD, thereby expanding our development platform to include improving the safety and effectiveness of allogeneic HSCT, a potentially curative therapy for patients with hematological cancers. There are currently no FDA-approved agents for the prevention of GvHD, nor treatment of GvHD in patients identified as high risk by certain biomarkers. We believe that GM-CSF neutralization with lenzilumab has the potential to prevent or treat GvHD without compromising, and potentially improving, the beneficial GvL effect in patients undergoing allogeneic HSCT, thereby making allogeneic HSCT safer. Several recent papers have been published which support this approach, including in Science Translational Medicine in November 2018 and in \u2018blood advances' in October 2019.\nWe aim to position lenzilumab as a necessary companion product to any allogeneic HSCT and as a part of the standard pre-conditioning that all patients receiving allogeneic HSCT should receive or as an early treatment option in patients identified as high risk for GvHD.\nGiven our interest in developing lenzilumab to prevent CRS/cytokine storm in COVID-19 as well as in the treatment of rare cancers and other orphan conditions such as GvHD, we believe that we have the opportunity to benefit from various regulatory incentives, such as orphan drug exclusivity, breakthrough therapy designation, fast track designation, priority review and accelerated approval.\nGM-CSF Gene Knockout\nWe are advancing our GM-CSF knockout gene-editing CAR-T platform through the Mayo Agreement that we entered into in June 2019 with the Mayo Foundation. Under the Mayo Agreement, we have in-licensed certain technologies that we believe may be used to create CAR-T cells lacking GM-CSF expression through various gene-editing tools, including CRISPR-Cas9. We believe that our GM-CSF knockout gene-editing CAR-T platform has the potential to create next-generation CAR-T therapies that improve the efficacy and safety profile of CAR-T therapy. In addition, we have and continue to file intellectual property encompassing a broad range of gene-editing approaches related to GM-CSF knockout.\nPreclinical data indicates that GM-CSF gene knockout CAR-T cells show improved overall survival compared to wild-type CAR-T cells in addition to the expected benefits of reduced serious side-effects associated with CAR-T therapy. We are establishing a platform of next-generation combinatorial gene knockout CAR-T cells that have potential to be applied across both autologous and allogeneic approaches and we are also investigating multiple CAR-T cell designs using precise dual and triple gene editing to significantly enhance the anti-tumor activity while simultaneously preventing CAR-T therapy induced toxicities. Through targeted gene expression and modulating cytokine activation signaling, we may be able to increase the proportion of fitter T-cells produced during expansion, increase their proliferative potential, and inhibit activation-induced cell death, thereby improving the cancer killing activity of our engineered CAR-T cells thereby making them more effective and safer in the treatment of cancers. Initial data were published in an abstract that was presented at the December 2019 ASH meeting and also won an ASH Abstract Achievement award.\nWe plan to continue development of this technology in combination approaches that could add to the observed efficacy benefits of current generation CAR-T products. In addition, we anticipate that our GM-CSF knockout gene-editing CAR-T platform may be a future backbone for controlling the serious side-effects that hamper CAR-T therapy that lead to serious and sometimes fatal outcomes for patients as a result of the CAR-T therapy itself.\n 80 \nTable 377: <table><tr><td>Table of Contents </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nEphA3-CAR: Targeting Tumor Stroma and Tumor Vasculature\nWe have begun to generate our own pipeline of CAR-T therapies including an EphA3-CAR-T based on the ifabotuzumab v-region and backbone. Ifabotuzumab is a Humaneered anti-EphA3 monoclonal antibody. Ifabotuzumab has the potential to kill tumor cells by targeting tumor stroma that protects them and the vasculature that feeds them. This unique combination of activities as a backbone of a CAR-T therapy may provide the potential to generate durable responses in a range of solid tumors by targeting the tissues that surround, protect, and nourish a growing cancer.\nBy developing an EphA3-CAR-T using ifabotuzumab as the backbone, we may have the ability to target the tumor, tumor stroma, and tumor vasculature in a novel manner. We are collaborating with the Mayo Clinic and plan to move to clinical testing with an anti-EphA3 construct for a range of cancer types after completing IND-enabling work. We have published initial data from our Phase I study in an abstract that was accepted for the November 2019 SNO meeting, showing data in glioblastoma multiforme, a form of brain cancer.\nEMR1-CAR: Targeting Eosinophils\nOur EMR1-CAR-T product is based on the HGEN005 (anti-EMR1 Humaneered monoclonal antibody) backbone and targets EMR1. Our EMR1-CAR-T based on the HGEN005 backbone is another approach in our growing platform of CAR-T therapies. We believe that because of its high selectivity, EMR1-CAR-T has significant potential to treat serious eosinophil diseases.\nIn preclinical work, HGEN005's anti-EMR1 activity resulted in dramatically enhanced killing of eosinophils from normal and eosinophilic donors and also induced a rapid and sustained depletion of eosinophils in a non-human primate model without any clinically significant adverse events. We have engaged with NIH to discuss expanding the initial work they have conducted utilizing HGEN005 and discussions are underway with a leading center in the U.S. to perform the IND-enabling testing in eosinophilic leukemia, an orphan condition with significant unmet need, as well as with several other potential partners, although we cannot assure you that we will reach any agreements for these next steps.\nOperating Losses and Liquidity\nWe have incurred significant losses and had an accumulated deficit of $284.9 million as of December 31, 2019. We expect to continue to incur net losses for the foreseeable future as we develop our drug candidates, expand clinical trials for our drug candidates currently in clinical development, expand our development activities and seek regulatory approvals. Significant capital is required to continue to develop and to launch a product and many expenses are incurred before revenue is received, if any. We are unable to predict the extent of any future losses or when we will receive revenue or become profitable, if at all.\nWe will require substantial additional capital to continue as a going concern and to support our business efforts, including obtaining regulatory approvals for our product candidates, clinical trials and other studies, and, if approved, the commercialization of our product candidates. We anticipate that we will seek additional financing from a number of sources, including, but not limited to, the sale of equity or debt securities, strategic collaborations, and licensing of our product candidates. Additional funding may not be available to us on a timely basis or at acceptable terms, if at all. Our ability to access capital when needed is not assured and, if not achieved on a timely basis, would materially harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. If adequate funds are not available, we may be required to delay, reduce the scope of, or eliminate one or more of our development programs. We may also be required to sell or license to others our technologies, product candidates, or development programs that we would have preferred to develop and commercialize ourselves and on less than favorable terms, if at all. If in the best interests of our stockholders, we may also find it appropriate to enter into a strategic transaction that could result in, among other things, a sale, merger, consolidation or business combination.\n 81 \nTable 379: <table><tr><td>Table of Contents </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nIf management is unsuccessful in efforts to raise additional capital, based on our current levels of operating expenses, our current capital is not expected to be sufficient to fund our operations for the next twelve months. These conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. The Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm at the beginning of the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K includes an explanatory paragraph about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2019 were prepared on the basis of a going concern, which contemplates that we will be able to realize our assets and discharge liabilities in the normal course of business. Our ability to meet our liabilities and to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the availability of future funding. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if we are unable to continue as a going concern.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates\nOur management's discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S., or GAAP. The preparation of our financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts and disclosures reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates. Our management believes judgment is involved in determining revenue recognition, the fair value-based measurement of stock-based compensation and accruals. Our management evaluates estimates and assumptions as facts and circumstances dictate. As future events and their effects cannot be determined with precision, actual results could differ from these estimates and assumptions, and those differences could be material to the Consolidated Financial Statements. If our assumptions change, we may need to revise our estimates, or take other corrective actions, either of which may also have a material adverse effect on our statements of operations, liquidity and financial condition.\nUntil December 31, 2018, we qualified as an emerging growth company ( EGC\u201d) under the JOBS Act. Emerging growth companies can delay adopting new or revised accounting standards until such time as those standards apply to private companies. We elected to avail ourselves of this exemption from new or revised accounting standards and, therefore, we may not be subject to the same new or revised accounting standards as other public companies that are not emerging growth companies.\nA registrant with EGC status loses its eligibility as an EGC five years after its common equity initial public offering, December 31, 2018 for our company. Accordingly, we are required to adopt new accounting standards on the same timeline as other public companies effective January 1, 2018. See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of the impact of new accounting standards adopted in 2019.\nWhile our significant accounting policies are described in more detail in Note 3 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we believe the following accounting policies to be critical to the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements.\nAccrued Research and Development Expenses\nAs part of the process of preparing our Consolidated Financial Statements, we are required to estimate our accrued research and development expenses. This process involves reviewing contracts and purchase orders, reviewing the terms of our license agreements, communicating with our applicable personnel to identify services that have been performed on our behalf, and estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred for the service when we have not yet been invoiced or otherwise notified of actual cost. Some of our service providers invoice us monthly in arrears for services performed. We make estimates of our accrued expenses as of each balance sheet date based on facts and circumstances known to us at that time. Examples of estimated accrued research and development expenses include fees to:\n \u00b7 contract research organizations and other service providers in connection with clinical studies; \n \u00b7 contract manufacturers in connection with the production of clinical trial materials; and \n \u00b7 vendors in connection with preclinical development activities. \n 82 \nTable 384: <table><tr><td>Table of Contents </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe base our expenses related to clinical studies on our estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to contracts with multiple research institutions and contract research organizations that conduct and manage clinical studies on our behalf. The financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation, vary from contract to contract, and may result in uneven payment flows and expense recognition. Payments under some of these contracts depend on factors such as the successful enrollment of patients and the completion of clinical trial milestones. In accruing these costs, we estimate the time period over which services will be performed for which we have not been invoiced and the level of effort to be expended in each period. If the actual timing of the performance of services or the level of effort varies from our estimate, we adjust the accrual accordingly. Our understanding of the status and timing of services performed relative to the actual status and timing of services performed may vary and may result in our reporting changes in estimates in any particular period.\nStock-Based Compensation\nOur stock-based compensation expense for stock options is estimated at the grant date based on the award's fair value as calculated by the Black-Scholes option pricing model and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period. The Black-Scholes option pricing model requires various highly judgmental assumptions including expected volatility and expected term. The expected volatility is based on the historical stock volatilities of several of our publicly listed peers over a period equal to the expected terms of the options as we do not have a sufficient trading history to use the volatility of our own common stock. To estimate the expected term, we have opted to use the simplified method, which is the use of the midpoint of the vesting term and the contractual term. If any of the assumptions used in the Black-Scholes option pricing model changes significantly, stock-based compensation expense may differ materially in the future from that recorded in the current period. In addition, we are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and only recognize expense for those shares expected to vest. We estimate the forfeiture rate based on historical experience and our expectations regarding future pre-vesting termination behavior of employees. To the extent our actual forfeiture rate is different from our estimate, stock-based compensation expense is adjusted accordingly.\nRevenue Recognition\nOur revenue to date has been generated primarily through license agreements and research and development collaboration agreements. We had no revenues for the years ending December 31, 2018 and 2019. Commencing January 1, 2018, we recognize revenue in accordance with Accounting Standards Update ( ASU\u201d) 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)\u201d ( ASC 606\u201d). The core principle of ASC 606 is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods and/or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods and/or services. To determine the appropriate amount of revenue to be recognized for arrangements that we determine are within the scope of ASC 606, the Company performs the following steps: (i) identify the contract(s) with the customer, (ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract, (iii) determine the transaction price, (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract and (v) recognize revenue when (or as) each performance obligation is satisfied.\nRevenue under technology licenses and collaborative agreements typically consists of nonrefundable and/or guaranteed license fees, collaborative research funding, and various milestone and future product royalty or profit-sharing payments. These agreements are generally referred to as multiple element arrangements\u201d.\nWe apply the accounting standard on revenue recognition for multiple element arrangements. The fair value of deliverables under the arrangement may be derived using a best estimate of selling price if vendor specific objective evidence and third-party evidence is not available. Deliverables under the arrangement will be separate units of accounting if a delivered item has value to the customer on a standalone basis and if the arrangement includes a general right of return for the delivered item, delivery or performance of the undelivered item is considered probable and substantially in our control.\n 83 \nTable 386: <table><tr><td>Table of Contents </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe recognize upfront license payments as revenue upon delivery of the license only if the license has standalone value from any undelivered performance obligations and that value can be determined. The undelivered performance obligations typically include manufacturing or development services or research and/or steering committee services. If the fair value of the undelivered performance obligations can be determined, then these obligations would be accounted for separately. If the license is not considered to have standalone value, then the license and other undelivered performance obligations would be accounted for as a single unit of accounting. In this case, the license payments and payments for performance obligations are recognized as revenue over the estimated period of when the performance obligations are performed or deferred indefinitely until the undelivered performance obligation is determined.\nWhenever we determine that an arrangement should be accounted for as a single unit of accounting, we determine the period over which the performance obligations will be performed, and revenue will be recognized. Revenue is recognized using a proportional performance or straight-line method. The proportional performance method is used when the level of effort required to complete performance obligations under an arrangement can be reasonably estimated. The amount of revenue recognized under the proportional performance method is determined by multiplying the total payments under the contract, excluding royalties and payments contingent upon achievement of milestones, by the ratio of the level of effort performed to date to the estimated total level of effort required to complete performance obligations under the arrangement. If we cannot reasonably estimate the level of effort to complete performance obligations under an arrangement, we recognize revenue under the arrangement on a straight-line basis over the period we are expected to complete our performance obligations. Significant management judgment is required in determining the level of effort required under an arrangement and the period over which we are expected to complete our performance obligations under an arrangement.\nOur collaboration agreements typically entitle us to additional payments upon the achievement of development, regulatory and sales performance-based milestones. If the achievement of a milestone is considered probable at the inception of the collaboration, the related milestone payment is included with other collaboration consideration, such as upfront fees and research funding, in our revenue calculation. Typically, these milestones are not considered probable at the inception of the collaboration. As such, milestones will typically be recognized in one of two ways depending on the timing of when the milestone is achieved. If the milestone is achieved during the performance period, then we will only recognize revenue to the extent of the proportional performance achieved at that date, or the proportion of the straight-line basis achieved at that date, and the remainder will be recorded as deferred revenue to be amortized over the remaining performance period. If the milestone is achieved after the performance period has completed and all performance obligations have been delivered, then we will recognize the milestone payment as Revenue in its entirety in the period the milestone was achieved.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nFor a discussion of new accounting pronouncements, see Note 3, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nResults of Operations\nGeneral\nAt December 31, 2019, we had an accumulated deficit of $284.9 million, primarily as a result of research and development and general and administrative expenses as well as costs incurred in reorganization. While we may in the future generate revenue from a variety of sources, including license fees, milestone payments, and research and development payments in connection with strategic partnerships, our product candidates are at an early stage of development and may never be successfully developed or commercialized. Accordingly, we expect to continue to incur substantial losses from operations for the foreseeable future, and there can be no assurance that we will ever generate significant revenue or profits.\n 84 \nTable 388: <table><tr><td>Table of Contents </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nResearch and Development Expenses\n\tConducting research and development is central to our business model. We expense both internal and external research and development costs as incurred. We track external research and development costs incurred by project for each of our clinical programs. We have continued to refine our systems and our methodology in tracking external research and development costs. Our external research and development costs consist primarily of:\n \u00b7 expenses incurred under agreements with contract research organizations, investigative sites, and consultants that conduct our clinical trials and a substantial portion of our preclinical activities; \n \u00b7 the cost of acquiring and manufacturing clinical trial and other materials; and \n \u00b7 other costs associated with development activities, including additional studies. \nOther research and development costs consist primarily of internal research and development costs such as salaries and related fringe benefit costs for our employees (such as workers compensation and health insurance premiums), stock-based compensation charges, travel costs, lab supplies, overhead expenses such as rent and utilities, and external costs not allocated to one of our clinical programs. Internal research and development costs generally benefit multiple projects and are not separately tracked per project. The following table shows our total research and development expenses for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 ($000's):\nTable 392: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>(in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>External Costs </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Lenzilumab </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,046 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,662 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Ifabotuzumab </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>104 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>105 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Internal costs </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>466 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>452 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total research and development </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,616 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,219 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe expect to continue to incur substantial expenses related to our research and development activities for the foreseeable future as we continue product development including our development efforts for lenzilumab to reduce the serious and potentially life-threatening side-effects associated with CAR-T therapy and potentially improve efficacy. Depending on the results of our development efforts we expect to incur substantial costs to prepare for potential clinical trials and activities for lenzilumab.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses consist principally of personnel-related costs, professional fees for legal, consulting, audit and tax services, rent and other general operating expenses not otherwise included in research and development. For the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, general and administrative expenses were $6.3 million and $9.1 million, respectively.\n 85 \nTable 394: <table><tr><td>Table of Contents </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nComparison of Years Ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 ($000's)\nTable 395: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Increase/ (Decrease) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>(in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Amount </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Operating expenses: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Research and development </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,616 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,219 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>397 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>General and administrative </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,328 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9,112 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2,784 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(31 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Loss from operations </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(8,944 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(11,331 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2,387 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(21 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Interest expense </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,349 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(852 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>497 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>58 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Other income (expense), net </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>324 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>325 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Reorganization items, net </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(145 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(145 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(100 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net loss </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(10,294 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(12,004 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(1,710 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(14 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n</table>\nResearch and development expenses increased $0.4 million in 2019 from $2.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 to $2.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase is primarily due to the increase in spending in preparation for the phase Ib/II clinical trial of Lenzilumab with Kite's Yescarta in CAR-T therapy. We expect our research and development expenses will increase substantially in 2020 compared to 2019, due to the commencement of enrollment in the trial.\nGeneral and administrative expenses decreased $2.8 million in 2019 from $9.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 to $6.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease in general and administrative expenses is primarily attributable to a $2.7 million decrease in stock-based compensation expense related to the issuance of options to management, consultants and board members subsequent to the completion of the Restructuring Transactions in 2018 without such issuances in 2019. We expect our general and administrative expenses to increase somewhat in 2020 as compared to 2019 due to the expected addition of positions in the finance and accounting area with the objective of improving internal controls and eliminating the material weakness that exists as of December 31, 2019.\nInterest expense increased $0.5 million from $0.8 million recognized for the year ended December 31, 2018 to $1.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily consisted of $0.2 million for interest and amortization of debt discount related to the Advance Notes, entered into in June, July and August 2018, $0.8 million for interest and amortization of debt discount related to the 2018 Convertible Notes entered into in September 2018, $0.1 million in interest and amortization of debt discount related to the 2019 Convertible Notes entered into in April 2019, $0.1 million in interest related to the 2019 Bridge Notes entered into in June and November 2019 and $0.1 million in interest related to the Notes payable to vendors related to our 2016 bankruptcy filing. Interest expense of $0.9 million recognized for the year ended December 31, 2018 is comprised of $0.4 million for interest and loan issuance costs related to the Term Loans (as defined below), $0.2 million for interest and amortization of debt discount related to the Advance Notes, $0.2 million for interest and amortization of debt discount related to the 2018 Convertible Notes and $0.1 million for interest related to the Notes payable to vendors related to our 2016 bankruptcy filing.\nReorganization items, net for the year ended December 31, 2018 primarily consisted of legal fees. There were no Reorganization items, net incurred for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nOther income, net for the year ended December 31, 2018 primarily consisted of legal fees assumed by Madison Joint Venture LLC related to their positive election related to the assets related to benznidazole, our former drug candidate (see Note 9).\n 86 \nTable 397: <table><tr><td>Table of Contents </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nIncome Taxes\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $166.2 million to offset future federal income taxes which expire in the years 2021 through 2037, and approximately $172.1 million that may offset future state income taxes which expire in the years 2028 through 2039. We also have federal net operating loss carryforwards generated in 2018 and 2019 of $15.4 million that have no expiration date as a result of the tax law changes signed into law on December 22, 2017. Current federal and state tax laws include substantial restrictions on the utilization of net operating losses and tax credits in the event of an ownership change. Even if the carryforwards are available, they may be subject to annual limitations, lack of future taxable income, or future ownership changes that could result in the expiration of the carryforwards before they are utilized. At December 31, 2019, we recorded a 100% valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets of approximately $57.4 million, as at that time our management believed it was uncertain that they would be fully realized. If we determine in the future that we will be able to realize all or a portion of our deferred tax assets, an adjustment to our valuation allowance would increase net income in the period in which we make such a determination.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nSince our inception, we have financed our operations primarily through proceeds from the public offerings and private placements of our common stock, private placements of our preferred stock, debt financings, interest income earned on cash, and cash equivalents, and marketable securities, borrowings against lines of credit, and receipts from prior collaboration agreements. At December 31, 2019, we had cash and cash equivalents of $0.1 million. As of March 13, 2020, we had cash and cash equivalents of $268,000.\nThe following table sets forth the primary sources and uses of cash and cash equivalents for each of the periods presented below ($000's):\nTable 398: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Twelve Months Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>(In thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net cash (used in) provided by: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating activities </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(4,001 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(6,209 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Financing activities </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,330 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,256 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(671 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>47 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet cash used in operating activities was $4.0 million and $6.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Cash used in operating activities in 2018 primarily related to our net loss of $12.0 million, adjusted for non-cash items, such as $4.8 million in stock-based compensation, $0.8 million in non-cash interest expense and other non-cash items of $0.2 million. Cash used in operating activities in 2019 primarily related to our net loss of $10.3 million, adjusted for non-cash items, such as $2.0 million in stock-based compensation, $1.3 million in non-cash interest expense, changes in operating assets and liabilities of $2.8 million and other non-cash items of $0.2 million.\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $3.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This amount consists primarily of $2.0 million received from the issuance of the 2019 Bridge Notes (as defined below) entered into in June and November 2019, $1.3 million from the issuance of the 2019 Notes (as defined below) entered into in April 2019, $0.3 million received from the exercise of stock options, $0.2 million received from the issuance of common stock under the equity line of credit with Lincoln Park Capital Fund, LLC ( Lincoln Park\u201d), offset by $0.5 million in payments made against the Notes payable to vendors.\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $6.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This amount consists primarily of $1.5 million received from Cheval Holdings, Ltd. ( Cheval\u201d), an affiliate of Black Horse Capital, L.P., the Company's controlling stockholder ( BHC\u201d), related to the Restructuring Transactions (see Restructuring Transactions\u201d below), $1.1 million from the issuance of 2,445,557 shares of our common stock to accredited investors on March 12, 2018, $0.2 million received from the issuance of 400,000 shares of our common stock to an accredited investor on June 4, 2018, $0.9 million received from the issuance of the Advance Notes in June, July and August 2018 and $2.5 million received for the issuance of the Notes in September 2018.\n 87 \nTable 400: <table><tr><td>Table of Contents </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nRestructuring Transactions\nIn December 2016, we entered into a Credit and Security Agreement (as amended, the Term Loan Credit Agreement\u201d) providing for an original $3.0 million credit facility (the December 2016 Term Loan\u201d), net of certain fees and expenses. On March 21, 2017, we entered into an amendment to the Term Loan Credit Agreement to obtain an additional $5.5 million (the March 2017 Term Loan\u201d), net of certain fees and expenses, providing additional working capital. On July 8, 2017, we entered into a second amendment to the Term Loan Credit Agreement to obtain an additional $5.0 million (the July 2017 Term Loan\u201d), net of certain fees and expenses, providing additional working capital. As of the third quarter of 2017, we had received the entire amount available under the Term Loan Credit Agreement.\nOn December 21, 2017, we entered into a Securities Purchase and Loan Satisfaction Agreement (the Purchase Agreement\u201d) and a Forbearance and Loan Modification Agreement (the Forbearance Agreement\u201d and, together with the Purchase Agreement, the Restructuring Agreements\u201d), each with the Term Loan Lenders, in connection with a series of transactions providing for, among other things, the satisfaction and extinguishment of our outstanding obligations under the Term Loan Credit Agreement and the infusion of $3.0 million of new capital. The Restructuring Transactions were completed on February 27, 2018. For additional information regarding the Restructuring Transactions, see Restructuring Transactions\u201d in Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nLiquidity\nDespite completing the Restructuring Transactions, we will require substantial additional capital to continue as a going concern and to support our business efforts, including pursuing our collaboration with Kite and obtaining regulatory approvals for our product candidates, lenzilumab, ifabotuzumab and HGEN005, clinical trials and other studies, and, if approved, the commercialization of our product candidates. Under the Kite Agreement, the parties have agreed to conduct a multi-center Phase 1/2 study of lenzilumab with Kite's Yescarta in patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell lymphoma. We currently project we will be responsible for an aggregate of approximately $8 million in out-of-pocket costs assuming a total of 72 patients are enrolled in the Study, of which $2 million will be required to be paid to Kite thirty days prior to the initiation of the Study. The amount of capital we will require and the timing of our need for additional capital will depend on many factors, including:\n \u00b7 the type, number, timing, progress, costs, and results of the product candidate development programs that we are pursuing or may choose to pursue in the future; \n \u00b7 the scope, progress, expansion, costs, and results of our preclinical and clinical trials; \n \u00b7 the timing of and costs involved in obtaining regulatory approvals; \n \u00b7 the success, progress, timing and costs of our efforts to evaluate or consummate various strategic alternatives if in the best interests of our stockholders; \n \u00b7 our ability to re-list our common stock on a national securities exchange, whether through a new listing or by completing a strategic transaction; \n \u00b7 our ability to establish and maintain development partnering arrangements and any associated funding; \n \u00b7 the emergence of competing products or technologies and other adverse market developments; \n \u00b7 the costs of maintaining, expanding, and protecting our intellectual property portfolio, including potential litigation costs and liabilities; \n \u00b7 the resources we devote to marketing, and, if approved, commercializing our product candidates; \n \u00b7 the scope, progress, expansion and costs of manufacturing our product candidates; and \n \u00b7 the costs associated with being a public company. \n 88 \nTable 413: <table><tr><td>Table of Contents </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs of December 31, 2019, our current liabilities of approximately $13.6 million exceeded our current assets of approximately $0.5 million. Our cash position as of June 30, 2019 was insufficient for us to satisfy in full at maturity on June 30, 2019 all of the outstanding principal amount and accrued but unpaid interest on unsecured promissory notes we made to certain of our vendors upon our emergence from bankruptcy. We paid approximately $0.5 million to extinguish certain of these notes in July and August 2019. As of December 31, 2019, the aggregate principal amount and accrued but unpaid interest on these notes approximates $1.1 million. The outstanding principal amount and accrued but unpaid interest on these notes is currently payable to the respective holders without demand, notice or declaration, and the holders, without demand or notice of any kind, may exercise any and all other rights and remedies available to them under the notes, our bankruptcy plan, at law or in equity. We do not have sufficient funds to repay the principal and accrued but unpaid notes.\nAccordingly, we will need to seek additional financing from a number of sources, including, but not limited to, the sale of equity or debt securities, strategic collaborations, and licensing of our product candidates, to enable us to pursue the Kite collaboration and our other business initiatives. Since 2018, our capital-raising efforts have succeeded in raising a series of short-term bridge loans and convertible debt financings, including short-term bridge financings in June 2019 and November 2019 advanced, as applicable, by our two largest stockholders, which collectively control approximately 88% of our outstanding common stock as of December 31, 2019, and our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Dr. Durrant. In December 2019 we also effected an equity line of credit with LPC.\nAdditional funding may not be available to us on a timely basis or at acceptable terms, if at all. Our ability to access capital when needed is not assured and, if not achieved on a timely basis, would materially harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. If adequate funds are not available, we may be required to delay, reduce the scope of, or eliminate one or more of our development programs. We may also be required to sell or license to others our technologies, product candidates, or development programs that we would have preferred to develop and commercialize ourselves and on less than favorable terms, if at all. If in the best interests of our stockholders, we may also find it appropriate to enter into a strategic transaction that could result in, among other things, a sale, merger, consolidation or business combination.\nIf management is unsuccessful in efforts to raise additional capital, based on our current levels of operating expenses, our current capital will not be sufficient to fund our operations for the next twelve months. These conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nOur common stock currently trades on the OTCQB Venture Market under the ticker symbol HGEN\u201d. Although our common stock is listed for quotation on the OTCQB Venture Market, trading is limited and an active market for our common stock may never develop in the future, which could harm our ability to raise capital to continue to fund operations.\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nThe following table summarizes our contractual obligations at December 31, 2019 and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future years.

The lease commenced in April 2016. This lease expired on September 30, 2018. In May 2018, we entered into a month-to-month lease agreement for a new facility in Burlingame, California. We terminated the lease on November 1, 2019 and entered into a sub-lease agreement for space in the same building in Burlingame, California. The sub-lease initial term expires on March 31, 2020 and is renewable for additional terms by mutual agreement.\nNotes Payable to Vendors\nOn June 30, 2016, we issued promissory notes in an aggregate principal amount of approximately $1.2 million to certain claimants in accordance with the Plan. The notes are unsecured, bear interest at 10% per annum and became due and payable in full, including principal and accrued interest on June 30, 2019. In July and August, 2019, following the receipt of proceeds from the 2019 Bridge Notes, we used approximately $0.5 million of the proceeds to retire a portion of these notes, including accrued interest. After giving effect to these payments, the aggregate principal amount and accrued but unpaid interest on these notes approximates $1.1 million as of December 31, 2019. As of December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, we have accrued $0.3 million and $0.3 million in interest related to these promissory notes, respectively. The outstanding principal amount and accrued but unpaid interest on these notes is currently payable to the respective holders without demand, notice or declaration, and the holders, without demand or notice of any kind, may exercise any and all other rights and remedies available to them under the notes, the Plan, at law or in equity. Currently, we do not have sufficient funds to repay the principal and accrued but unpaid interest on these notes in their entirety.\nAdvance Notes\nIn June, July and August 2018, we received an aggregate of $0.9 million of proceeds from advances made to us (the Advance Notes\u201d) by four different lenders including Dr. Cameron Durrant, the Company's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Cheval, an affiliate of BHC, the Company's controlling stockholder; and Ronald Barliant, a director of the Company (collectively the Advance Note Lenders\u201d). The Advance Notes accrued interest at a rate of 7% per year, compounded annually.\nIn accordance with their terms, on May 30, 2019, in connection with our announcement of the Kite Agreement, the Advance Note Lenders converted the amounts due under the Advance Notes into common stock at the conversion price of $0.45 per share. We issued a total of 2,179,622 shares of common stock in connection with the conversion.\n2018 Convertible Notes\nCommencing September 19, 2018, we delivered a series of convertible promissory notes (the 2018 Notes\u201d) evidencing an aggregate of $2.5 million of loans made to us by six different lenders, including an affiliate of BHC, our controlling stockholder. The 2018 Notes bear interest at a rate of 7% per annum and will mature on the earliest of (i) twenty-four months from the date the 2018 Notes were signed, (ii) the occurrence of any customary event of default, or (iii) the certain liquidation events including any dissolution or winding up of our company or merger or sale by us of all or substantially all of our assets (in any case, a Liquidation Event\u201d). We used the proceeds from the 2018 Notes for working capital.\nThe 2018 Notes are convertible into our equity securities in three different scenarios:\nIf we sell our equity securities on or before the date of repayment of the 2018 Notes in any financing transaction that results in gross proceeds to us of at least $10 million (a Qualified Financing\u201d), the 2018 Notes will be converted into either (i) such equity securities as the noteholder would acquire if the principal and accrued but unpaid interest thereon (the Conversion Amount\u201d) were invested directly in the financing on the same terms and conditions as given to the financing investors in the Qualified Financing, or (ii) common stock at a conversion price equal to $0.45 per share (subject to ratable adjustment for any stock split, stock dividend, stock combination or other recapitalization occurring subsequent to the date of the Notes).\n 90 \nTable 418: <table><tr><td>Table of Contents </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nIf we sell our equity securities on or before the date of repayment of the 2018 Notes in any financing transaction that results in gross proceeds to us of less than $10 million (a Non-Qualified Financing\u201d),"}
