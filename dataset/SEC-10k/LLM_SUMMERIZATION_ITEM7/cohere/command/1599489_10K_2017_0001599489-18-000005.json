MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion of the Company's results of operations and financial condition should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto, included elsewhere in this report.\nExecutive Overview\nBusiness Overview\nVeritiv is a leading North American business-to-business distributor of packaging, facility solutions, print and publishing products and services. Additionally, Veritiv provides logistics and supply chain management solutions to its customers. On August 31, 2017, Veritiv completed its acquisition of 100% of the equity interest in various All American Containers entities (collectively, \"AAC\"), a family owned and operated distributor of rigid packaging, including plastic, glass and metal containers, caps, closures and plastic pouches. The Company operates from approximately 170 distribution centers primarily throughout the U.S., Canada and Mexico.\nVeritiv's business is organized under four reportable segments: Packaging, Facility Solutions, Print, and Publishing and Print Management (\"Publishing\"). This segment structure is consistent with the way the Chief Operating Decision Maker, who is Veritiv's Chief Executive Officer, makes operating decisions and manages the growth and profitability of the Company's business. The following summary describes the products and services offered in each of the segments:\nTable 64: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Packaging - The Packaging segment provides standard as well as custom and comprehensive packaging solutions for customers based in North America and in key global markets.

Distribution expenses increased $12.2 million from an increase in freight and logistics expenses, primarily due to increased third-party freight, transfer expenses and diesel fuel prices and $4.9 million related to the AAC acquisition. These increases were partially offset by (i) a $1.7 million decrease in facilities rent and other related expenses, (ii) a $1.5 million decrease in insurance expense and (iii) a $1.6 million decrease in personnel expenses as well as maintenance and material expense. The offsetting decreases were primarily driven by warehouse consolidations.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 74: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>2016 compared to 2015: Distribution expenses decreased by $16.7 million or 3.2%. The decline was primarily due to (i) a $6.3 million decrease in facilities expenses due primarily to warehouse consolidations, (ii) a $5.9 million decrease in personnel costs due primarily to reductions in temporary employee expense and (iii) a $5.3 million decrease in vehicle operating expenses primarily driven by reductions in third-party freight expense and fuel.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSelling and Administrative Expenses\nTable 75: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>2017 compared to 2016: Selling and administrative expenses increased by $46.4 million or 5.6%. The increase was primarily attributed to (i) an $18.8 million increase in personnel expenses, (ii) a $13.3 million increase in bad debt expense and (iii) a $9.3 million increase related to the AAC acquisition. The increase in personnel expenses was primarily driven by an increase in headcount to support the Company's growth strategy as well as lower commissions in 2016 due to the recovery of commission advances, discussed below. The increase in bad debt expense was primarily due to additional reserves related to certain customers with declining financial conditions during 2017 combined with favorable collections experience in 2016. Selling and administrative expenses also included $8.4 million of impairment charges related to the impairment of the logistics solutions business goodwill and customer relationship intangible asset.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 76: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>2016 compared to 2015: Selling and administrative expenses decreased by $27.7 million or 3.2%. The decrease was primarily attributed to (i) an $11.2 million decrease in commission expense due in part to lower net sales volume and (ii) a $13.6 million decrease in incentive compensation. In 2013, xpedx advanced funds to commissioned sales representatives to compensate them for a change in the timing of commission payments. During 2016, the Company recovered $6.0 million of those advances, which further reduced commission expense. These decreases were partially offset by $5.8 million of impairment charges attributable to the Print and Publishing segments' customer relationship intangible assets.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDepreciation and Amortization\nTable 77: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>2017 compared to 2016: Depreciation and amortization expense decreased $0.5 million.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 78: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>2016 compared to 2015: Depreciation and amortization expense decreased $2.2 million primarily due to $2.4 million of amortization for intangible assets acquired in the Merger that were fully amortized as of June 30, 2015.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Acquisition and Integration Expenses\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, Veritiv incurred costs and charges to integrate its combined businesses. Integration expenses include internally dedicated integration management resources, retention compensation, information technology conversion costs, rebranding, professional services and other costs to integrate its businesses. Veritiv incurred acquisition and integration expenses of $8.0 million in 2017 related to the acquisition of AAC.\nSee Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a breakdown of these costs.\nRestructuring Charges, Net\nRestructuring charges, net relates primarily to Veritiv's restructuring of its North American operations intended to integrate the legacy xpedx and Unisource operations, generate cost savings and capture synergies across the combined company. Restructuring charges, net includes net gains related to the sale or exit of certain facilities totaling $24.4 million and $2.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, and a $4.1 million net non-cash loss from asset impairments for the year ended December 31, 2015. See Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details. The Company may continue to record restructuring charges in the future as these activities progress, which may include gains or losses from the disposition of assets.\nInterest Expense, Net\nInterest expense, net in 2017 consisted of (i) $25.5 million of interest expense on the Company's asset-based lending facility (the ABL Facility\u201d), (ii) $2.6 million for amortization of deferred financing costs related to the ABL Facility and (iii) $3.1 million in miscellaneous interest expense. Interest expense, net in 2017 increased $ 3.7 million. Interest expense increased due to (i) an increased average balance on the ABL Facility and (ii) increased interest rates. See Note 5 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information related to the ABL Facility. The increased average balance and interest rates on the ABL Facility were primarily due to the acquisition of AAC on August 31, 2017. See Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details.\nInterest expense, net in 2016 consisted of (i) $18.6 million of interest expense on the ABL Facility, (ii) $5.6 million for amortization of deferred financing costs related to the ABL Facility and (iii) $3.3 million in miscellaneous interest expense. The increase in 2016 was due primarily to an additional $1.9 million of deferred financing cost amortization resulting from an amendment to the ABL Facility. This increase was offset by lower miscellaneous interest expense.\nInterest expense, net in 2015 consisted of (i) $18.7 million of interest expense on the ABL Facility, (ii) $4.4 million for amortization of deferred financing costs related to the ABL Facility and (iii) $3.9 million in miscellaneous interest expense.\nOther (Income) Expense, Net\nTable 79: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>2017 compared to 2016: Other (income) expense, net was income of $8.1 million in 2017 compared to expense of $7.6 million in 2016. The $15.7 million change is primarily the result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \"Tax Act\") which lowered the U.S. corporate federal tax rate, from 35% to 21%. The lower rate reduced the value of the Tax Receivable Agreement liability by $13.5 million which was recorded as other income in the fourth quarter of 2017. See Note 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details regarding the Tax Act.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 80: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>2016 compared to 2015: Other (income) expense, net increased $0.9 million compared to 2015. This increase was primarily driven by higher expenses associated with the Tax Receivable Agreement and a loss on debt extinguishment that were partially offset by lower expenses associated with foreign currency losses in 2016 compared to 2015.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Effective Tax Rate\nVeritiv's effective tax rates were (600.0)%, 48.5% and 40.5% for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 respectively. The Company's effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2017 is impacted by a near break-even pre-tax book loss in combination with the impact of the following discrete items:\nTable 81: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>A $30.2 million expense in connection with our provisional estimate of the impact of the Tax Act, including $23.0 million for the remeasurement of our deferred taxes and $7.2 million for the one-time transition tax. See Note 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details regarding the Tax Act.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 82: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>A $13.4 million benefit for the reversal of the valuation allowance on the deferred tax assets of the Company's Canadian subsidiary. The reversal reflects the Company's cumulative recent income and improved expectation of future taxable income.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 83: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>A $3.8 million tax rate benefit for the reduction in the fair value of the Tax Receivable Agreement, including the federal rate reduction.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 84: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>A $3.1 million benefit in conjunction with the third quarter 2017 filing of Veritiv's 2016 U.S. federal tax return and amended 2015 and 2014 U.S. federal tax returns for credits related to foreign taxes and research and experimentation activities.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 85: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>A tax rate effect of $2.1 million for the impact of impairing non-deductible goodwill.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> In addition to the above items, the difference between the Company's effective tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 and the U.S. statutory tax rate of 35% includes the impact of non-deductible expenses, state income taxes (net of federal income tax benefit), the Company's income (loss) by jurisdiction, the tax effect of Tax Receivable Agreement changes, and changes in the valuation allowance against deferred tax assets. The year ended December 31, 2015 also includes the tax impact of a foreign exchange loss and an impairment of non-deductible goodwill.\nThe Tax Act makes broad and complex changes to the U.S. tax code that affected our income taxes in 2017 as well as changes that will affect us beginning in 2018. The volatility of the Company's effective tax rate has been primarily due to both the level of pre-tax income as well as variations in the Company's income (loss) by jurisdiction. Additionally, uncertainty related to the future impact of the Tax Act may increase effective tax rate volatility. Pending further evaluation of the Tax Act, over time and with increasing pre-tax income, the Company estimates its effective tax rate will trend toward approximately 26%. However, the effective tax rate may vary significantly due to potential fluctuations in the amount and source, including both foreign and domestic, of pre-tax income and changes in amounts of non-deductible expenses and other items that could impact the effective tax rate. See Note 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details.\nSegment Results\nAdjusted EBITDA is the primary financial performance measure Veritiv uses to manage its businesses, to monitor its results of operations, to measure its performance against the ABL Facility and to incentivize its management. This common metric is intended to align shareholders, debt holders and management. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure and is not an alternative to net income, operating income or any other measure prescribed by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\"U.S. GAAP\").\nVeritiv uses Adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, restructuring charges, net, acquisition and integration expenses and other similar charges including any severance costs, costs associated with warehouse and office openings or closings, consolidation, and relocation and other business optimization expenses, stock-based compensation expense, changes in the LIFO reserve, non-restructuring asset impairment charges, non-restructuring severance\ncharges, non-restructuring pension charges, fair value adjustments related to contingent liabilities assumed in mergers and acquisitions and certain other adjustments) because Veritiv believes investors commonly use Adjusted EBITDA as a key financial metric for valuing companies. In addition, the credit agreement governing the ABL Facility permits the Company to exclude these and other charges in calculating Consolidated EBITDA, as defined in the ABL Facility.\nAdjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of Veritiv's results as reported under U.S. GAAP. For example, Adjusted EBITDA:\nTable 86: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Does not reflect the Company's income tax expenses or the cash requirements to pay its taxes; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 87: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Although depreciation and amortization charges are non-cash charges, it does not reflect that the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future, and the foregoing metrics do not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOther companies in the industry may calculate Adjusted EBITDA differently than Veritiv does, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure. Because of these limitations, Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as a measure of discretionary cash available to Veritiv to invest in the growth of its business. Veritiv compensates for these limitations by relying both on the Company's U.S. GAAP results and by using Adjusted EBITDA for supplemental purposes. Additionally, Adjusted EBITDA is not an alternative measure of financial performance under U.S. GAAP and therefore should be considered in conjunction with net income and other performance measures such as operating income or net cash provided by operating activities and not as an alternative to such U.S. GAAP measures.\nDue to the shared nature of the distribution network, distribution expenses are not a specific charge to each segment but are instead allocated to each segment based primarily on operational metrics that correlate with changes in volume. Accordingly, distribution expenses allocated to each segment are highly interdependent on the results of other segments. Lower volume in any segment that is not offset by a reduction in distribution expenses can result in the other segments absorbing a larger share of distribution expenses. Conversely, higher volume in any segment can result in the other segments absorbing a smaller share of distribution expenses. The impact of this at the segment level is that the changes in distribution expense trends may not correspond with volume trends within a particular segment.\nThe Company sells thousands of products. In the Packaging, Facility Solutions and Print segments, Veritiv is unable to compute the impact of changes in net sales volume based on changes in net sales of each individual product. Rather, the Company assumes that the margin stays constant and estimates the volume impact based on changes in cost of products sold as a proxy for the change in net sales volume. After any other significant net sales variances are identified, the remaining net sales variance is attributed to price/mix.\nThe Company approximates foreign currency effects by applying the foreign currency exchange rate for the prior period to the local currency results for the current period. We believe the elimination of the foreign currency translation impact provides better year-to-year comparability without the distortion of foreign currency fluctuations.\nThe Company believes that the decline in the demand for paper and related products is due to the widespread use of electronic media and permanent product substitution, more e-commerce, less print advertising, fewer catalogs and a reduced volume of direct mail, among other factors. This trend is expected to continue and will place continued pressure on the Company's revenues and profit margins and make it more difficult to maintain or grow Adjusted EBITDA within the Print and Publishing segments.\nIncluded in the following table are net sales and Adjusted EBITDA for each of the reportable segments and Corporate & Other:\nTable 88: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions)\n</td> <td>Packaging\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Facility Solutions\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Print\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Publishing\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Corporate & Other\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Year Ended December 31, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net sales\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,157.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,309.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,793.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>958.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>145.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted EBITDA\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>238.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>35.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>60.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>26.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(184.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted EBITDA as a % of net sales\n</td> <td>7.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>*\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Year Ended December 31, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net sales\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,854.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,271.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,047.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,033.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>119.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted EBITDA\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>221.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>47.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>76.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>23.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(176.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted EBITDA as a % of net sales\n</td> <td>7.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>*\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Year Ended December 31, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net sales\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,829.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,289.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,271.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,215.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>111.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted EBITDA\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>212.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>41.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>79.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>34.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(186.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted EBITDA as a % of net sales\n</td> <td>7.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>*\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n* -

The net sales increase was primarily attributable to an increase in net sales of corrugated products, films and tertiary packaging items due to increases in volume and market prices as well as $71.7 million of rigid packaging product net sales in 2017 relating to the AAC acquisition.\nAdjusted EBITDA increased $16.8 million, or 7.6%, compared to 2016 primarily due to increased net sales volume. The increase in net sales was partially offset by (i) cost of products sold increasing at a faster rate than net sales, (ii) a $25.0 million increase in distribution expenses and (iii) an $18.7 million increase in selling and administrative expenses. The increase in distribution expenses was primarily driven by increased utilization of the distribution network, which is reflected in (i) increased freight and logistics expenses driven primarily by increased third-party freight, transfer expenses and diesel fuel prices, (ii) increased personnel expenses and (iii) increased facilities rent and other related expenses. The increase in selling and administrative expenses was primarily driven by higher personnel expenses associated with increased headcount to support our growth strategy. The AAC acquisition resulted in a $4.9 million increase in distribution expenses and a $9.4 million increase in selling and administrative expenses.\nComparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015\nThe net sales increase was primarily attributable to an increase in net sales of corrugated products.\nThe Adjusted EBITDA increase was primarily due to increased net sales volume, and $3.4 million attributed to cost of products sold increasing at a slower rate than net sales.

The following table sets forth a summary of cash flows:\nTable 98: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions)\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by (used for):\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>36.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>140.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>113.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investing activities\n</td> <td>(126.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(34.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(44.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Financing activities\n</td> <td>99.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(89.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(70.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAnalysis of Cash Flows\nThe Company ended 2017 with $80.3 million in cash, an increase of $10.7 million during the year. Cash flow from operations was $36.6 million in 2017 compared with $140.2 million in 2016. The factors driving cash flow from operating activities in 2017 were: (i) a $48.3 million increase in accounts payable and related party payable, (ii) a $30.1 million decrease in inventories, (iii) a $13.6 million increase in other accrued liabilities and (iv) a $15.3 million increase from other operating activities. The increase in cash from operating activities was partially offset by: (i) a net loss, (ii) a $101.9 million increase in accounts receivable and related party receivable, (iii) an $11.3 million decrease in accrued payroll and benefits and (iv) an $8.4 million increase in other current assets. The Company also generated $167.3 million in cash flow from a net increase in revolving loan borrowings under the ABL Facility and $51.1 million related to proceeds from asset sales. The primary uses of cash during 2017 were: (i) $144.8 million for the acquisition of AAC, (ii) a $40.5 million decline in book overdrafts, (iii) $32.5 million for property and equipment additions, of which $16.1 million were integration-related capital expenditures and $16.4 million were ordinary capital expenditures, (iv) $16.4 million for payments under financing obligations including obligations to related party, (v) $8.5 million for the Tax Receivable Agreement payment and (vi) $2.7 million for payments under capital lease obligations.\nThe primary sources of cash during 2016 were: (i) a $69.9 million increase in accounts payable and related party payable, (ii) a $14.3 million increase in other operating activities and (iii) a $13.1 million reduction in inventories. The Company also generated $18.9 million in positive cash flow from an increase in book overdrafts and $6.6 million related to proceeds from asset sales. The primary uses of cash during 2016 were: (i) a $40.9 million decrease in accrued payroll and benefits, (ii) a $14.7 million increase in accounts receivable and related party receivable, (iii) an $11.4 million increase in other current assets, and (iv) a $3.6 million decrease in other accrued liabilities. Cash was also used by (i) $70.1 million of net repayments of revolving loan borrowings under the ABL Facility, (ii) $41.0 million of property and equipment additions, of which $25.5 million were integration-related capital expenditures and $15.5 million were ordinary capital expenditures, (iii) $19.9 million of payments under financing obligations to related party, (iv) $13.6 million used to repurchase 0.31 million shares of Veritiv outstanding common stock, (v) $3.2 million for payments under capital lease obligations and (vi) $2.0 million for financing fees incurred in connection with an amendment to the ABL Facility.\nThe primary sources of cash during 2015 were: (i) higher net income compared to 2014, (ii) a $53.4 million reduction in accounts receivable and related party receivable, (iii) $10.5 million from an increase in accrued payroll and benefits and (iv) $3.1 million from other operating activities. The primary uses of cash during 2015 were: (i) a $62.0 million increase in inventories, (ii) $47.0 million of net repayments of revolving loan borrowings under the ABL Facility, (iii) $44.4 million of property and equipment additions, of which $29.4 million were integration-related capital expenditures and $15.0 million were ordinary capital expenditures, (iv) $13.8 million of payments under financing obligations to related party, (v) an $8.4 million decrease in accounts\npayable and related party payable, (vi) a $7.1 million decrease in other accrued liabilities and (vii) $3.8 million in payments under capital lease obligations. Cash was also used for a $5.8 million decrease in book overdrafts.\nFunding and Liquidity Strategy\nVeritiv has a $1.4 billion asset-based lending facility (the \"ABL Facility\"). The ABL Facility is comprised of U.S. and Canadian sub-facilities of $1,250.0 million and $150.0 million, respectively. The ABL Facility is available to be drawn in U.S. dollars, in the case of the U.S. sub-facilities, and in U.S. dollars or Canadian dollars, in the case of the Canadian sub-facilities, or in other currencies that are mutually agreeable. The Company's accounts receivable and inventories in the U.S. and Canada are collateral under the ABL Facility.\nOn August 11, 2016, the Company amended the ABL Facility to, among other things, extend the maturity date to August 11, 2021. All other significant terms remained consistent. The ABL Facility provides for the right of the individual lenders to extend the maturity date of their respective commitments and loans upon the request of Veritiv and without the consent of any other lenders. The ABL Facility may be prepaid at Veritiv's option at any time without premium or penalty and is subject to mandatory prepayment if the amount outstanding under the ABL Facility exceeds either the aggregate commitments with respect thereto or the current borrowing base, in an amount equal to such excess. The Company incurred and deferred $2.0 million of new financing fees associated with the amendment, which are reflected in other non-current assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, and will be amortized to interest expense on a straight-line basis over the amended term of the ABL Facility.\nThe ABL Facility has a springing minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of at least 1.00 to 1.00 on a trailing four-quarter basis, which will be tested only when specified availability is less than limits outlined under the ABL Facility. At December 31, 2017 the above test was not applicable and is not expected to be applicable in the next 12 months.\nAvailability under the ABL Facility is determined based upon a monthly borrowing base calculation which includes eligible customer receivables and inventory, less outstanding borrowings, letters of credit and certain designated reserves. As of December 31, 2017, the available additional borrowing capacity under the ABL Facility was approximately $316.5 million.\nUnder the terms of the ABL Facility, interest rates are based upon LIBOR or the prime rate plus a margin rate, or in the case of Canada, a banker's acceptance rate or base rate plus a margin rate. For the years ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, the weighted-average borrowing interest rate was 3.3% and 2.5%, respectively.\nOn November 23, 2016, the UWWH Stockholder sold 1.76 million shares of Veritiv common stock in an underwritten public offering. Veritiv did not receive any of the proceeds. Concurrently with the closing of the offering, Veritiv repurchased 0.31 million of these offered shares from the underwriters at a price of $42.8625 per share, which is the price at which the underwriters purchased such shares from the selling stockholder, for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $13.4 million. In conjunction with these transactions, Veritiv incurred approximately $0.8 million in transaction-related fees, of which approximately $0.2 million was recorded as part of the cost to acquire the treasury stock and the remainder was included in selling and administrative expenses on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nVeritiv's ability to fund its capital needs will depend on its ongoing ability to generate cash from operations, borrowings under the ABL Facility and funds received from capital markets offerings. If Veritiv's cash flows from operating activities are lower than expected, the Company will need to borrow under the ABL Facility and may need to incur additional debt or issue additional equity. Although management believes that the arrangements currently in place will permit Veritiv to finance its operations on acceptable terms and conditions, the Company's access to, and the availability of, financing on acceptable terms and conditions in the future will be impacted by many factors, including the liquidity of the overall capital markets and the current state of the economy.\nVeritiv's management expects that the Company's primary future cash needs will be for working capital, capital expenditures, contractual commitments and strategic investments. Additionally, management expects that cash provided by operating activities and available capacity under the ABL Facility will provide sufficient funds to operate the business and meet other liquidity needs.\nThrough December 31, 2017, the Company incurred approximately $221 million in costs and charges associated with achieving anticipated cost savings and other synergies from the Merger, including approximately $82 million for capital expenditures and $25 million related to the complete or partial withdrawal from various multi-employer pension plans. The Company anticipates that it will incur additional costs and charges associated with the Merger. The Company is not able to\nquantify the total amount of these costs and charges or the period in which they will be incurred as the operating plans affecting these costs are evolving and charges relating to the withdrawal from multi-employer pension plans which have not yet been finalized, are uncertain. Excluding the multi-employer pension plan withdrawal charges, we currently anticipate that total costs associated with the Merger will be approximately $225 to $250 million through December 31, 2018, including approximately $90 million for capital expenditures, primarily consisting of information technology infrastructure, systems integration and planning. Ordinary capital expenditures for 2018 are expected to be in the range of $20 million to $30 million, with another $10 million to $20 million of integration-related capital expenditures during 2018.\nAll of the cash held by our non-U.S. subsidiaries is available for general corporate purposes. Veritiv considers the earnings of certain non-U.S. subsidiaries to be permanently invested outside the United States on the basis of estimates that future domestic cash generation will be sufficient to meet future domestic cash needs and management's specific plans for reinvestment of those subsidiary earnings.

The Company does not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on its financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.\nThe table below summarizes the Company's contractual and certain other long-term obligations as of December 31, 2017:\nTable 100: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Payment Due by Period\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions)\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019 - 2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2021 - 2022\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>After 2022\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Equipment capital lease obligations (1)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>18.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Financing obligations (including obligations to related party) (1,2)\n</td> <td>8.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>34.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other lease type obligations (3)\n</td> <td>94.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>150.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>103.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>135.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>483.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>ABL Facility (4)\n</td> <td>29.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>59.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>915.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,004.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Deferred compensation (5)\n</td> <td>2.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tax Receivable Agreement contingent liability (6)\n</td> <td>9.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>57.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>AAC contingent liability(7)\n</td> <td>17.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Multi-employer pension plan (\"MEPP\") withdrawal obligations (8)\n</td> <td>0.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Federal income tax liability (9)\n</td> <td>0.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>167.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>246.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,043.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>206.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,663.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) Equipment capital lease obligations and financing obligations include amounts classified as interest.\n(2) Financing obligations will not result in cash payments in excess of amounts reported above. At the end of the lease terms, the net remaining financing obligations of $155.2 million and $10.6 million will be settled by the return of the assets to the Purchaser/Landlord for the related party and non-related party obligations, respectively.\n(3) Amounts shown are presented net of contractual sublease rental income.\n(4) The ABL Facility will mature and the commitments thereunder will terminate after August 11, 2021. Interest payments included here were estimated using a simple interest method based on the year-end December 31, 2017 ABL Facility outstanding balance of $897.7 million and its corresponding year-end weighted-average interest rate of 3.3%. The 2021 payment amount shown above includes an estimated $897.7 million of principal balance.\n(5) The deferred compensation obligation relates to Unisource's legacy deferred compensation plans and reflects gross cash payment amounts due.\n(6) The Tax Receivable Agreement contingent liability reflects gross contingent obligation amounts excluding interest due to related party.\n(7) The AAC contingent liability reflects the fair value of the estimated amount to be paid.

Information related to the amounts of these future payments is described in Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The table above also excludes the liability for uncertain tax positions and for the Veritiv Deferred Compensation Savings Plan as the Company cannot predict with reasonable certainty the timing of future cash outflows associated with these liabilities. As a result of the Merger, International Paper has a potential earn-out payment of up to $100.0 million that would become due in 2020. The potential earn-out payment would be reflected by Veritiv as a reduction to equity at the time of payment. Due to the uncertainty of achievement, that potential payment is not included in the table above.\nSee Note 1, Note 2, Note 5, Note 7, Note 10 and Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to these obligations.\nThe Company has recorded undiscounted charges related to the complete or partial withdrawal from various multi-employer pension plans. Charges not related to the Company's restructuring efforts are recorded as distribution expense. Initial amounts are recorded as other non-current liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Final charges for these withdrawals will not be known until the plans issue their respective determinations. As a result, these estimates may increase or decrease depending upon the final determinations. Currently, the Company expects payments will occur over an approximately 20 year period. The Company expects to incur similar types of charges in future periods in connection with its ongoing restructuring activities. As of December 31, 2017, the Company has received determination letters from two plans. Of those, the liability for one was settled with a lump sum payment, while monthly payments for the other plan are expected to occur over an approximately 20 year period.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires the Company to establish accounting policies and utilize estimates that affect both the amounts and timing of the recording of assets, liabilities, net sales and expenses. Some of these estimates require judgment about matters that are inherently uncertain. Different amounts would be reported under different operating conditions or under alternative assumptions.\nThe Company has evaluated the accounting policies used in the preparation of the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes and believes those policies to be reasonable and appropriate. Management believes that the accounting estimates discussed below are the most critical accounting policies whose application may have a significant effect on the reported results of operations and financial position of the Company and can require judgments by management that affect their application.\nRevenue Recognition\nRevenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the price is fixed or determinable, collectability is reasonably assured and delivery has occurred. Revenue is recognized when the customer takes title and assumes the risks and rewards of ownership. When management cannot conclude collectability is reasonably assured for shipments to a particular customer, revenue associated with that customer is not recognized until cash is collected or management is otherwise able to establish that collectability is reasonably assured.\nSales transactions with customers are designated free on board (\"f.o.b.\") destination and revenue is recorded when the product is delivered to the customer's delivery site, when title and risk of loss are transferred. Effective January 1, 2016, the Company harmonized its shipping terms to be f.o.b. destination. Prior to that date, revenue was recorded at the time of shipment for certain xpedx customers whose terms were designated f.o.b. shipping point. Management determined that any shipments in transit at December 31, 2015 would honor the f.o.b. destination terms resulting in a reduction of $27.0 million and $1.8 million to net sales and operating income, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nCertain revenues are derived from shipments arranged by the Company made directly from a manufacturer to a customer. The Company is considered to be a principal to these transactions because, among other factors, it controls pricing to the customer and bears the credit risk of the customer defaulting on payment and is the primary obligor. Revenues from these sales are reported on a gross basis in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and amounted to $3.0 billion, $3.0 billion and $3.3 billion for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nThe Company adopted Accounting Standards Update 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), and its related interpretations on January 1, 2018 applying the modified retrospective method. The adoption did not materially impact the Company's financial statements and is not expected to have a material impact on future financial results as the adoption did not change the recognition pattern for the Company's existing revenue streams.\nAcquisition and Integration Expenses\nThe Company's Consolidated Statements of Operations include a line item titled, \"Acquisition and Integration Expenses\". Acquisition and Integration Expenses is not a defined term in U.S. GAAP, thus management must use judgment in determining whether a particular expense should be classified as an acquisition and integration expense. Management believes its accounting policy for acquisition and integration expenses is critical because these costs have been significant and will continue to be significant in 2018, will generally involve cash expenditures, are not defined in U.S. GAAP, are excluded in determining compliance with the ABL Facility and are excluded in determining management compensation.\nAcquisition and integration expenses include internally dedicated integration management resources, retention compensation, information technology conversion costs, rebranding, professional services and other costs to integrate its businesses. See Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a breakdown of these expenses.\nAcquisition and integration expenses are differentiated from restructuring charges as restructuring charges primarily relate to contract termination costs, involuntary termination benefits and other direct costs associated with consolidating facilities and reorganizing functions.\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts\nThe allowance for doubtful accounts reflects the best estimate of losses inherent in the Company's accounts receivable portfolio determined on the basis of historical experience, specific allowances for known troubled accounts and other available evidence. The allowances contain uncertainties because the calculation requires management to make assumptions and apply judgment regarding the customer's credit worthiness. Veritiv performs ongoing evaluations of its customers' financial condition and adjusts credit limits based upon payment history and the customer's current credit worthiness, as determined by its review of their current financial information. The Company continuously monitors collections from its customers and maintains a provision for estimated credit losses based upon the customers' financial condition, collection experience and any other relevant customer specific information. Veritiv's assessment of this and other information forms the basis of its allowances.\nIf the financial condition of Veritiv's customers deteriorates, resulting in an inability to make required payments to the Company, or if economic conditions deteriorate, additional allowances may be deemed appropriate or required. If the allowance for doubtful accounts changed by 0.1% of gross billed receivables, reflecting either an increase or decrease in expected future write-offs, the impact to consolidated pretax income would have been approximately $1.2 million.\nEmployee Benefit Plans\nVeritiv sponsors defined benefit plans and Supplemental Executive Retirement Plans (\"SERP\") in the U.S. and Canada. These plans were frozen prior to the Merger. See Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information about these plans.\nManagement is required to make certain critical estimates related to actuarial assumptions used to determine the Company's pension expense and related obligation. The Company believes the most critical assumptions are related to (i) the discount rate used to determine the present value of the liabilities and (ii) the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. All of the actuarial assumptions are reviewed annually. Changes in these assumptions could have a material impact on the measurement of pension expense and the related obligation.\nAt each measurement date, management determines the discount rate by reference to rates of high-quality, long-term corporate bonds that mature in a pattern similar to the future payments anticipated to be made under the plans. As of December 31, 2017, the weighted-average discount rates used to compute the benefit obligations were 3.33% and 3.40% for the U.S. and Canadian plans, respectively.\nThe expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is based upon the long-term outlook of the investment strategy as well as historical returns and volatilities for each asset class. Veritiv also reviews current levels of interest rates and inflation to assess the reasonableness of the long-term rates. The Company's pension plan investment objective is to ensure all of its plans have sufficient funds to meet their benefit obligations when they become due. As a result, the Company periodically revises asset allocations, where appropriate, to improve returns and manage risk. The weighted-average expected long-term rate of return used to calculate the pension expense for the year ended 2017 was 7.15% and 5.50% for the U.S. and Canadian plans, respectively.\nThe following illustrates the effects of a 1% change in the discount rate or return on plan assets on the 2017 net periodic pension cost and projected benefit obligation (in millions):\nTable 102: <table><tr><td>

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion of the Company's results of operations and financial condition should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto, included elsewhere in this report.\nExecutive Overview\nBusiness Overview\nVeritiv is a leading North American business-to-business distributor of packaging, facility solutions, print and publishing products and services. Additionally, Veritiv provides logistics and supply chain management solutions to its customers. On August 31, 2017, Veritiv completed its acquisition of 100% of the equity interest in various All American Containers entities (collectively, \"AAC\"), a family owned and operated distributor of rigid packaging, including plastic, glass and metal containers, caps, closures and plastic pouches. The Company operates from approximately 170 distribution centers primarily throughout the U.S., Canada and Mexico.\nVeritiv's business is organized under four reportable segments: Packaging, Facility Solutions, Print, and Publishing and Print Management (\"Publishing\"). This segment structure is consistent with the way the Chief Operating Decision Maker, who is Veritiv's Chief Executive Officer, makes operating decisions and manages the growth and profitability of the Company's business. The following summary describes the products and services offered in each of the segments:\n \u2022 Packaging - The Packaging segment provides standard as well as custom and comprehensive packaging solutions for customers based in North America and in key global markets. The business is strategically focused on higher growth industries including light industrial/general manufacturing, food production, fulfillment and internet retail, as well as niche verticals based on geographical and functional expertise. Veritiv's packaging professionals create customer value through supply chain solutions, structural and graphic packaging design and engineering, automation, workflow and equipment services and kitting and fulfillment. \n \u2022 Facility Solutions - The Facility Solutions segment sources and sells cleaning, break-room and other supplies such as towels, tissues, wipers and dispensers, can liners, commercial cleaning chemicals, soaps and sanitizers, sanitary maintenance supplies and equipment, safety and hazard supplies, and shampoos and amenities primarily in the U.S., Canada and Mexico. Veritiv is a leading distributor in the Facility Solutions segment. Through this segment we manage a world class network of leading suppliers in most facilities solutions categories. Additionally, we offer total cost of ownership solutions with re-merchandising, budgeting and compliance reporting, inventory management, and a sales-force trained to bring leading vertical expertise to the major North American geographies. \n \u2022 Print - The Print segment sells and distributes commercial printing, writing, copying, digital, wide format and specialty paper products, graphics consumables and graphics equipment primarily in the U.S., Canada and Mexico. This segment also includes customized paper conversion services of commercial printing paper for distribution to document centers and form printers. The Company's broad geographic platform of operations coupled with the breadth of paper and graphics products, including its exclusive private brand offerings, provides a foundation to service national, regional and local customers across North America. \n \u2022 Publishing - The Publishing segment sells and distributes coated and uncoated commercial printing papers to publishers, retailers, converters, printers and specialty businesses for use in magazines, catalogs, books, directories, gaming, couponing, retail inserts and direct mail. This segment also provides print management, procurement and supply chain management solutions to simplify paper and print procurement processes for its customers. \nThe Company also has a Corporate & Other category which includes certain assets and costs not primarily attributable to any of the reportable segments, as well as its Veritiv logistics solutions business which provides transportation and warehousing solutions.\nResults of Operations, Including Business Segments\nThe following discussion compares the consolidated operating results of Veritiv for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015.\nComparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 \nNet Sales\n \u2022 2017 compared to 2016: Net sales increased by $38.1 million, or 0.5%, primarily due to the incremental net sales of $71.7 million resulting from the AAC acquisition. Increases in net sales in the Packaging and Facility Solutions segments as well as Veritiv's logistics solutions business were offset by declines in the Print and Publishing segments. See the Segment Results\u201d section for additional discussion. \n \u2022 2016 compared to 2015: Net sales declined by $391.1 million, or 4.5%, primarily due to declines in the Print and Publishing segments. See the Segment Results\u201d section for additional discussion.  Cost of Products Sold (exclusive of depreciation and amortization shown separately below)\n \u2022 2017 compared to 2016: Cost of products sold increased by $20.2 million, or 0.3%, due to the growth in net sales as previously discussed. See the Segment Results\u201d section for additional discussion. \n \u2022 2016 compared to 2015: Cost of products sold decreased by $333.9 million, or 4.7%, primarily due to the decline in net sales as previously discussed. See the Segment Results\u201d section for additional discussion.  Distribution Expenses\n \u2022 2017 compared to 2016: Distribution expenses increased by $11.8 million or 2.3%. Distribution expenses increased $12.2 million from an increase in freight and logistics expenses, primarily due to increased third-party freight, transfer expenses and diesel fuel prices and $4.9 million related to the AAC acquisition. These increases were partially offset by (i) a $1.7 million decrease in facilities rent and other related expenses, (ii) a $1.5 million decrease in insurance expense and (iii) a $1.6 million decrease in personnel expenses as well as maintenance and material expense. The offsetting decreases were primarily driven by warehouse consolidations. \n \u2022 2016 compared to 2015: Distribution expenses decreased by $16.7 million or 3.2%. The decline was primarily due to (i) a $6.3 million decrease in facilities expenses due primarily to warehouse consolidations, (ii) a $5.9 million decrease in personnel costs due primarily to reductions in temporary employee expense and (iii) a $5.3 million decrease in vehicle operating expenses primarily driven by reductions in third-party freight expense and fuel. \nSelling and Administrative Expenses\n \u2022 2017 compared to 2016: Selling and administrative expenses increased by $46.4 million or 5.6%. The increase was primarily attributed to (i) an $18.8 million increase in personnel expenses, (ii) a $13.3 million increase in bad debt expense and (iii) a $9.3 million increase related to the AAC acquisition. The increase in personnel expenses was primarily driven by an increase in headcount to support the Company's growth strategy as well as lower commissions in 2016 due to the recovery of commission advances, discussed below. The increase in bad debt expense was primarily due to additional reserves related to certain customers with declining financial conditions during 2017 combined with favorable collections experience in 2016. Selling and administrative expenses also included $8.4 million of impairment charges related to the impairment of the logistics solutions business goodwill and customer relationship intangible asset. \n \u2022 2016 compared to 2015: Selling and administrative expenses decreased by $27.7 million or 3.2%. The decrease was primarily attributed to (i) an $11.2 million decrease in commission expense due in part to lower net sales volume and (ii) a $13.6 million decrease in incentive compensation. In 2013, xpedx advanced funds to commissioned sales representatives to compensate them for a change in the timing of commission payments. During 2016, the Company recovered $6.0 million of those advances, which further reduced commission expense. These decreases were partially offset by $5.8 million of impairment charges attributable to the Print and Publishing segments' customer relationship intangible assets. \nDepreciation and Amortization\n \u2022 2017 compared to 2016: Depreciation and amortization expense decreased $0.5 million. \n \u2022 2016 compared to 2015: Depreciation and amortization expense decreased $2.2 million primarily due to $2.4 million of amortization for intangible assets acquired in the Merger that were fully amortized as of June 30, 2015.  Acquisition and Integration Expenses\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, Veritiv incurred costs and charges to integrate its combined businesses. Integration expenses include internally dedicated integration management resources, retention compensation, information technology conversion costs, rebranding, professional services and other costs to integrate its businesses. Veritiv incurred acquisition and integration expenses of $8.0 million in 2017 related to the acquisition of AAC.\nSee Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a breakdown of these costs.\nRestructuring Charges, Net\nRestructuring charges, net relates primarily to Veritiv's restructuring of its North American operations intended to integrate the legacy xpedx and Unisource operations, generate cost savings and capture synergies across the combined company. Restructuring charges, net includes net gains related to the sale or exit of certain facilities totaling $24.4 million and $2.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, and a $4.1 million net non-cash loss from asset impairments for the year ended December 31, 2015. See Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details. The Company may continue to record restructuring charges in the future as these activities progress, which may include gains or losses from the disposition of assets.\nInterest Expense, Net\nInterest expense, net in 2017 consisted of (i) $25.5 million of interest expense on the Company's asset-based lending facility (the ABL Facility\u201d), (ii) $2.6 million for amortization of deferred financing costs related to the ABL Facility and (iii) $3.1 million in miscellaneous interest expense. Interest expense, net in 2017 increased $ 3.7 million. Interest expense increased due to (i) an increased average balance on the ABL Facility and (ii) increased interest rates. See Note 5 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information related to the ABL Facility. The increased average balance and interest rates on the ABL Facility were primarily due to the acquisition of AAC on August 31, 2017. See Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details.\nInterest expense, net in 2016 consisted of (i) $18.6 million of interest expense on the ABL Facility, (ii) $5.6 million for amortization of deferred financing costs related to the ABL Facility and (iii) $3.3 million in miscellaneous interest expense. The increase in 2016 was due primarily to an additional $1.9 million of deferred financing cost amortization resulting from an amendment to the ABL Facility. This increase was offset by lower miscellaneous interest expense.\nInterest expense, net in 2015 consisted of (i) $18.7 million of interest expense on the ABL Facility, (ii) $4.4 million for amortization of deferred financing costs related to the ABL Facility and (iii) $3.9 million in miscellaneous interest expense.\nOther (Income) Expense, Net\n \u2022 2017 compared to 2016: Other (income) expense, net was income of $8.1 million in 2017 compared to expense of $7.6 million in 2016. The $15.7 million change is primarily the result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \"Tax Act\") which lowered the U.S. corporate federal tax rate, from 35% to 21%. The lower rate reduced the value of the Tax Receivable Agreement liability by $13.5 million which was recorded as other income in the fourth quarter of 2017. See Note 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details regarding the Tax Act. \n \u2022 2016 compared to 2015: Other (income) expense, net increased $0.9 million compared to 2015. This increase was primarily driven by higher expenses associated with the Tax Receivable Agreement and a loss on debt extinguishment that were partially offset by lower expenses associated with foreign currency losses in 2016 compared to 2015.  Effective Tax Rate\nVeritiv's effective tax rates were (600.0)%, 48.5% and 40.5% for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 respectively. The Company's effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2017 is impacted by a near break-even pre-tax book loss in combination with the impact of the following discrete items:\n \u2022 A $30.2 million expense in connection with our provisional estimate of the impact of the Tax Act, including $23.0 million for the remeasurement of our deferred taxes and $7.2 million for the one-time transition tax. See Note 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details regarding the Tax Act. \n \u2022 A $13.4 million benefit for the reversal of the valuation allowance on the deferred tax assets of the Company's Canadian subsidiary. The reversal reflects the Company's cumulative recent income and improved expectation of future taxable income. \n \u2022 A $3.8 million tax rate benefit for the reduction in the fair value of the Tax Receivable Agreement, including the federal rate reduction. \n \u2022 A $3.1 million benefit in conjunction with the third quarter 2017 filing of Veritiv's 2016 U.S. federal tax return and amended 2015 and 2014 U.S. federal tax returns for credits related to foreign taxes and research and experimentation activities. \n \u2022 A tax rate effect of $2.1 million for the impact of impairing non-deductible goodwill.  In addition to the above items, the difference between the Company's effective tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 and the U.S. statutory tax rate of 35% includes the impact of non-deductible expenses, state income taxes (net of federal income tax benefit), the Company's income (loss) by jurisdiction, the tax effect of Tax Receivable Agreement changes, and changes in the valuation allowance against deferred tax assets. The year ended December 31, 2015 also includes the tax impact of a foreign exchange loss and an impairment of non-deductible goodwill.\nThe Tax Act makes broad and complex changes to the U.S. tax code that affected our income taxes in 2017 as well as changes that will affect us beginning in 2018. The volatility of the Company's effective tax rate has been primarily due to both the level of pre-tax income as well as variations in the Company's income (loss) by jurisdiction. Additionally, uncertainty related to the future impact of the Tax Act may increase effective tax rate volatility. Pending further evaluation of the Tax Act, over time and with increasing pre-tax income, the Company estimates its effective tax rate will trend toward approximately 26%. However, the effective tax rate may vary significantly due to potential fluctuations in the amount and source, including both foreign and domestic, of pre-tax income and changes in amounts of non-deductible expenses and other items that could impact the effective tax rate. See Note 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details.\nSegment Results\nAdjusted EBITDA is the primary financial performance measure Veritiv uses to manage its businesses, to monitor its results of operations, to measure its performance against the ABL Facility and to incentivize its management. This common metric is intended to align shareholders, debt holders and management. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure and is not an alternative to net income, operating income or any other measure prescribed by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\"U.S. GAAP\").\nVeritiv uses Adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, restructuring charges, net, acquisition and integration expenses and other similar charges including any severance costs, costs associated with warehouse and office openings or closings, consolidation, and relocation and other business optimization expenses, stock-based compensation expense, changes in the LIFO reserve, non-restructuring asset impairment charges, non-restructuring severance\ncharges, non-restructuring pension charges, fair value adjustments related to contingent liabilities assumed in mergers and acquisitions and certain other adjustments) because Veritiv believes investors commonly use Adjusted EBITDA as a key financial metric for valuing companies. In addition, the credit agreement governing the ABL Facility permits the Company to exclude these and other charges in calculating Consolidated EBITDA, as defined in the ABL Facility.\nAdjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of Veritiv's results as reported under U.S. GAAP. For example, Adjusted EBITDA:\n \u2022 Does not reflect the Company's income tax expenses or the cash requirements to pay its taxes; and \n \u2022 Although depreciation and amortization charges are non-cash charges, it does not reflect that the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future, and the foregoing metrics do not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements. \nOther companies in the industry may calculate Adjusted EBITDA differently than Veritiv does, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure. Because of these limitations, Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as a measure of discretionary cash available to Veritiv to invest in the growth of its business. Veritiv compensates for these limitations by relying both on the Company's U.S. GAAP results and by using Adjusted EBITDA for supplemental purposes. Additionally, Adjusted EBITDA is not an alternative measure of financial performance under U.S. GAAP and therefore should be considered in conjunction with net income and other performance measures such as operating income or net cash provided by operating activities and not as an alternative to such U.S. GAAP measures.\nDue to the shared nature of the distribution network, distribution expenses are not a specific charge to each segment but are instead allocated to each segment based primarily on operational metrics that correlate with changes in volume. Accordingly, distribution expenses allocated to each segment are highly interdependent on the results of other segments. Lower volume in any segment that is not offset by a reduction in distribution expenses can result in the other segments absorbing a larger share of distribution expenses. Conversely, higher volume in any segment can result in the other segments absorbing a smaller share of distribution expenses. The impact of this at the segment level is that the changes in distribution expense trends may not correspond with volume trends within a particular segment.\nThe Company sells thousands of products. In the Packaging, Facility Solutions and Print segments, Veritiv is unable to compute the impact of changes in net sales volume based on changes in net sales of each individual product. Rather, the Company assumes that the margin stays constant and estimates the volume impact based on changes in cost of products sold as a proxy for the change in net sales volume. After any other significant net sales variances are identified, the remaining net sales variance is attributed to price/mix.\nThe Company approximates foreign currency effects by applying the foreign currency exchange rate for the prior period to the local currency results for the current period. We believe the elimination of the foreign currency translation impact provides better year-to-year comparability without the distortion of foreign currency fluctuations.\nThe Company believes that the decline in the demand for paper and related products is due to the widespread use of electronic media and permanent product substitution, more e-commerce, less print advertising, fewer catalogs and a reduced volume of direct mail, among other factors. This trend is expected to continue and will place continued pressure on the Company's revenues and profit margins and make it more difficult to maintain or grow Adjusted EBITDA within the Print and Publishing segments.\nIncluded in the following table are net sales and Adjusted EBITDA for each of the reportable segments and Corporate & Other:\n\n* - not meaningful\nSee Note 17, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to Adjusted EBITDA, including a reconciliation of income (loss) before income taxes as reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Operations to Adjusted EBITDA for reportable segments.\nPackaging\nThe table below presents selected data with respect to the Packaging segment: \nThe table below presents the components of the net sales change compared to the prior year:\n\nComparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016\nNet sales increased $303.6 million, or 10.6%, compared to 2016. The net sales increase was primarily attributable to an increase in net sales of corrugated products, films and tertiary packaging items due to increases in volume and market prices as well as $71.7 million of rigid packaging product net sales in 2017 relating to the AAC acquisition.\nAdjusted EBITDA increased $16.8 million, or 7.6%, compared to 2016 primarily due to increased net sales volume. The increase in net sales was partially offset by (i) cost of products sold increasing at a faster rate than net sales, (ii) a $25.0 million increase in distribution expenses and (iii) an $18.7 million increase in selling and administrative expenses. The increase in distribution expenses was primarily driven by increased utilization of the distribution network, which is reflected in (i) increased freight and logistics expenses driven primarily by increased third-party freight, transfer expenses and diesel fuel prices, (ii) increased personnel expenses and (iii) increased facilities rent and other related expenses. The increase in selling and administrative expenses was primarily driven by higher personnel expenses associated with increased headcount to support our growth strategy. The AAC acquisition resulted in a $4.9 million increase in distribution expenses and a $9.4 million increase in selling and administrative expenses.\nComparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015\nThe net sales increase was primarily attributable to an increase in net sales of corrugated products.\nThe Adjusted EBITDA increase was primarily due to increased net sales volume, and $3.4 million attributed to cost of products sold increasing at a slower rate than net sales. These improvements were partially offset by a $1.1 million increase in selling, general, and administrative personnel costs primarily attributable to the addition of new sales representatives.\nFacility Solutions\nThe table below presents selected data with respect to the Facility Solutions segment: \nThe table below presents the components of the net sales change compared to the prior year: \nComparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016\nNet sales increased $38.1 million, or 3.0%, compared to 2016. The net sales increase was primarily attributable to increased net sales of food service products, safety supplies, chemicals, towels and tissues.\nAdjusted EBITDA decreased $11.5 million, or 24.5%, compared to 2016. The decrease in Adjusted EBITDA was primarily driven by (i) cost of products sold increasing at a faster rate than net sales, (ii) a $6.9 million increase in distribution expenses and (iii) a $5.6 million increase in selling and administrative costs, partially offset by an increase in net sales. The increase in distribution expenses was primarily driven by increased utilization of the distribution network and is evidenced in (i) increased freight and logistics expenses driven primarily by increased third-party freight, transfer expenses and diesel fuel prices and (ii) increased personnel expenses. The increase in selling and administrative expenses was primarily driven by (i) an increase in personnel expenses primarily due to increased headcount to support our growth strategy and (ii) an increase in bad debt expense.\nComparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015\nThe net sales decrease was primarily attributable to (i) foreign currency effects, (ii) strategic decisions to exit certain unprofitable customer relationships in 2015 and (iii) pricing pressure.\nThe Adjusted EBITDA improvement was primarily due to (i) cost of products sold decreasing at a faster rate than net sales and (ii) a $3.5 million decrease in selling and administrative costs. The decrease in selling and administrative expenses was primarily driven by (i) a decrease in commissions due to lower net sales volume, (ii) a decrease in bad debt expense due to favorable collections experience and (iii) a reduction in personnel costs.\nPrint\nThe table below presents selected data with respect to the Print segment: \nThe table below presents the components of the net sales change compared to the prior year:\n\nComparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016\nNet sales decreased $253.7 million, or 8.3%, compared to 2016. The net sales decrease was primarily attributable to the continued secular decline in the paper industry.\nAdjusted EBITDA decreased $16.0 million, or 20.8%, compared to 2016. The Adjusted EBITDA decrease was largely attributable to the decline in net sales. The decline in net sales was partially offset by (i) a $16.0 million decrease in distribution expenses and (ii) a $5.2 million decrease in selling and administrative expenses. The decrease in distribution expenses was primarily driven by decreased utilization of the distribution network, which is reflected in (i) a decrease in facilities rent and other related expenses and (ii) a decrease in personnel expense. The decrease in selling and administrative expenses was primarily driven by a decrease in personnel expenses and professional fees, partially offset by an increase in bad debt expense.\nComparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015\nThe net sales decrease was primarily attributable to the continued erosion in net sales volume from the secular decline in the paper industry as well as strategic decisions to exit certain unprofitable customer relationships.\nThe decline in Adjusted EBITDA was primarily due to lower net sales volume and was partially offset by a $5.4 million reduction in selling and general administrative expenses resulting from a decrease in personnel costs.\nPublishing\nThe table below presents selected data with respect to the Publishing segment: \nThe table below presents the components of the net sales change compared to the prior year:\n\nComparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016\nNet sales decreased $75.6 million, or 7.3%, compared to 2016. The net sales decrease was primarily attributable to a decline in volume, reflecting the continued secular decline in the paper industry.\nAdjusted EBITDA increased $2.8 million, or 11.9%, compared to 2016. The Adjusted EBITDA increase was primarily attributable to the cost of products sold decreasing at a faster rate than net sales and a $1.9 million decrease in selling and administrative expenses partially offset by a decrease in net sales. The decrease in selling and administrative expenses was primarily driven by a decrease in personnel expenses.\nComparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015\nThe net sales decrease was primarily attributable to the continued erosion in net sales volume from the continued secular decline in the paper industry.\nThe decline in Adjusted EBITDA was primarily due to lower net sales volume and a $2.9 million decrease attributed to cost of products sold decreasing at a slower rate than net sales. These declines were partially offset by a $3.6 million decrease in selling and administrative expenses due to lower commission expense.\nCorporate & Other\n\nComparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016\nNet sales increased $25.7 million, or 21.5%, compared to 2016. The net sales increase was primarily attributable to an increase in freight brokerage services.\nAdjusted EBITDA decreased $7.9 million, or 4.5% compared to 2016. The Adjusted EBITDA decrease was primarily\ndriven by (i) cost of products sold increasing at a faster rate than net sales, (ii) a $9.1 million increase in selling and administrative costs partially offset by an increase in net sales and (iii) a $3.3 million decrease in distribution expenses. The\nincrease in selling and administrative costs was driven primarily by (i) an increase in personnel expenses primarily driven by increased headcount to support the Company's growth strategy and (ii) lower commission expense in 2016 due to the recovery of commission advances, as discussed above.\nComparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015\nNet sales increased $8.6 million, or 7.7%, due to continued growth in freight brokerage services.\nThe Adjusted EBITDA improvement was primarily due to (i) the recovery of commission advances and (ii) a decrease in corporate personnel costs mainly attributable to a reduction in incentive compensation.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nThe cash requirements of the Company are provided by cash flows from operations and borrowings under the ABL Facility. The following table sets forth a summary of cash flows:\n\nAnalysis of Cash Flows\nThe Company ended 2017 with $80.3 million in cash, an increase of $10.7 million during the year. Cash flow from operations was $36.6 million in 2017 compared with $140.2 million in 2016. The factors driving cash flow from operating activities in 2017 were: (i) a $48.3 million increase in accounts payable and related party payable, (ii) a $30.1 million decrease in inventories, (iii) a $13.6 million increase in other accrued liabilities and (iv) a $15.3 million increase from other operating activities. The increase in cash from operating activities was partially offset by: (i) a net loss, (ii) a $101.9 million increase in accounts receivable and related party receivable, (iii) an $11.3 million decrease in accrued payroll and benefits and (iv) an $8.4 million increase in other current assets. The Company also generated $167.3 million in cash flow from a net increase in revolving loan borrowings under the ABL Facility and $51.1 million related to proceeds from asset sales. The primary uses of cash during 2017 were: (i) $144.8 million for the acquisition of AAC, (ii) a $40.5 million decline in book overdrafts, (iii) $32.5 million for property and equipment additions, of which $16.1 million were integration-related capital expenditures and $16.4 million were ordinary capital expenditures, (iv) $16.4 million for payments under financing obligations including obligations to related party, (v) $8.5 million for the Tax Receivable Agreement payment and (vi) $2.7 million for payments under capital lease obligations.\nThe primary sources of cash during 2016 were: (i) a $69.9 million increase in accounts payable and related party payable, (ii) a $14.3 million increase in other operating activities and (iii) a $13.1 million reduction in inventories. The Company also generated $18.9 million in positive cash flow from an increase in book overdrafts and $6.6 million related to proceeds from asset sales. The primary uses of cash during 2016 were: (i) a $40.9 million decrease in accrued payroll and benefits, (ii) a $14.7 million increase in accounts receivable and related party receivable, (iii) an $11.4 million increase in other current assets, and (iv) a $3.6 million decrease in other accrued liabilities. Cash was also used by (i) $70.1 million of net repayments of revolving loan borrowings under the ABL Facility, (ii) $41.0 million of property and equipment additions, of which $25.5 million were integration-related capital expenditures and $15.5 million were ordinary capital expenditures, (iii) $19.9 million of payments under financing obligations to related party, (iv) $13.6 million used to repurchase 0.31 million shares of Veritiv outstanding common stock, (v) $3.2 million for payments under capital lease obligations and (vi) $2.0 million for financing fees incurred in connection with an amendment to the ABL Facility.\nThe primary sources of cash during 2015 were: (i) higher net income compared to 2014, (ii) a $53.4 million reduction in accounts receivable and related party receivable, (iii) $10.5 million from an increase in accrued payroll and benefits and (iv) $3.1 million from other operating activities. The primary uses of cash during 2015 were: (i) a $62.0 million increase in inventories, (ii) $47.0 million of net repayments of revolving loan borrowings under the ABL Facility, (iii) $44.4 million of property and equipment additions, of which $29.4 million were integration-related capital expenditures and $15.0 million were ordinary capital expenditures, (iv) $13.8 million of payments under financing obligations to related party, (v) an $8.4 million decrease in accounts\npayable and related party payable, (vi) a $7.1 million decrease in other accrued liabilities and (vii) $3.8 million in payments under capital lease obligations. Cash was also used for a $5.8 million decrease in book overdrafts.\nFunding and Liquidity Strategy\nVeritiv has a $1.4 billion asset-based lending facility (the \"ABL Facility\"). The ABL Facility is comprised of U.S. and Canadian sub-facilities of $1,250.0 million and $150.0 million, respectively. The ABL Facility is available to be drawn in U.S. dollars, in the case of the U.S. sub-facilities, and in U.S. dollars or Canadian dollars, in the case of the Canadian sub-facilities, or in other currencies that are mutually agreeable. The Company's accounts receivable and inventories in the U.S. and Canada are collateral under the ABL Facility.\nOn August 11, 2016, the Company amended the ABL Facility to, among other things, extend the maturity date to August 11, 2021. All other significant terms remained consistent. The ABL Facility provides for the right of the individual lenders to extend the maturity date of their respective commitments and loans upon the request of Veritiv and without the consent of any other lenders. The ABL Facility may be prepaid at Veritiv's option at any time without premium or penalty and is subject to mandatory prepayment if the amount outstanding under the ABL Facility exceeds either the aggregate commitments with respect thereto or the current borrowing base, in an amount equal to such excess. The Company incurred and deferred $2.0 million of new financing fees associated with the amendment, which are reflected in other non-current assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, and will be amortized to interest expense on a straight-line basis over the amended term of the ABL Facility.\nThe ABL Facility has a springing minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of at least 1.00 to 1.00 on a trailing four-quarter basis, which will be tested only when specified availability is less than limits outlined under the ABL Facility. At December 31, 2017 the above test was not applicable and is not expected to be applicable in the next 12 months.\nAvailability under the ABL Facility is determined based upon a monthly borrowing base calculation which includes eligible customer receivables and inventory, less outstanding borrowings, letters of credit and certain designated reserves. As of December 31, 2017, the available additional borrowing capacity under the ABL Facility was approximately $316.5 million.\nUnder the terms of the ABL Facility, interest rates are based upon LIBOR or the prime rate plus a margin rate, or in the case of Canada, a banker's acceptance rate or base rate plus a margin rate. For the years ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, the weighted-average borrowing interest rate was 3.3% and 2.5%, respectively.\nOn November 23, 2016, the UWWH Stockholder sold 1.76 million shares of Veritiv common stock in an underwritten public offering. Veritiv did not receive any of the proceeds. Concurrently with the closing of the offering, Veritiv repurchased 0.31 million of these offered shares from the underwriters at a price of $42.8625 per share, which is the price at which the underwriters purchased such shares from the selling stockholder, for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $13.4 million. In conjunction with these transactions, Veritiv incurred approximately $0.8 million in transaction-related fees, of which approximately $0.2 million was recorded as part of the cost to acquire the treasury stock and the remainder was included in selling and administrative expenses on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nVeritiv's ability to fund its capital needs will depend on its ongoing ability to generate cash from operations, borrowings under the ABL Facility and funds received from capital markets offerings. If Veritiv's cash flows from operating activities are lower than expected, the Company will need to borrow under the ABL Facility and may need to incur additional debt or issue additional equity. Although management believes that the arrangements currently in place will permit Veritiv to finance its operations on acceptable terms and conditions, the Company's access to, and the availability of, financing on acceptable terms and conditions in the future will be impacted by many factors, including the liquidity of the overall capital markets and the current state of the economy.\nVeritiv's management expects that the Company's primary future cash needs will be for working capital, capital expenditures, contractual commitments and strategic investments. Additionally, management expects that cash provided by operating activities and available capacity under the ABL Facility will provide sufficient funds to operate the business and meet other liquidity needs.\nThrough December 31, 2017, the Company incurred approximately $221 million in costs and charges associated with achieving anticipated cost savings and other synergies from the Merger, including approximately $82 million for capital expenditures and $25 million related to the complete or partial withdrawal from various multi-employer pension plans. The Company anticipates that it will incur additional costs and charges associated with the Merger. The Company is not able to\nquantify the total amount of these costs and charges or the period in which they will be incurred as the operating plans affecting these costs are evolving and charges relating to the withdrawal from multi-employer pension plans which have not yet been finalized, are uncertain. Excluding the multi-employer pension plan withdrawal charges, we currently anticipate that total costs associated with the Merger will be approximately $225 to $250 million through December 31, 2018, including approximately $90 million for capital expenditures, primarily consisting of information technology infrastructure, systems integration and planning. Ordinary capital expenditures for 2018 are expected to be in the range of $20 million to $30 million, with another $10 million to $20 million of integration-related capital expenditures during 2018.\nAll of the cash held by our non-U.S. subsidiaries is available for general corporate purposes. Veritiv considers the earnings of certain non-U.S. subsidiaries to be permanently invested outside the United States on the basis of estimates that future domestic cash generation will be sufficient to meet future domestic cash needs and management's specific plans for reinvestment of those subsidiary earnings. The table below summarizes the Company's cash positions as of December 31, 2017 and 2016:\n\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nVeritiv does not have any off-balance sheet arrangements as of December 31, 2017, other than the Other lease type obligations included in the contractual obligations table below and the letters of credit under the ABL Facility. The Company does not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on its financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.\nThe table below summarizes the Company's contractual and certain other long-term obligations as of December 31, 2017:\n\n(1) Equipment capital lease obligations and financing obligations include amounts classified as interest.\n(2) Financing obligations will not result in cash payments in excess of amounts reported above. At the end of the lease terms, the net remaining financing obligations of $155.2 million and $10.6 million will be settled by the return of the assets to the Purchaser/Landlord for the related party and non-related party obligations, respectively.\n(3) Amounts shown are presented net of contractual sublease rental income.\n(4) The ABL Facility will mature and the commitments thereunder will terminate after August 11, 2021. Interest payments included here were estimated using a simple interest method based on the year-end December 31, 2017 ABL Facility outstanding balance of $897.7 million and its corresponding year-end weighted-average interest rate of 3.3%. The 2021 payment amount shown above includes an estimated $897.7 million of principal balance.\n(5) The deferred compensation obligation relates to Unisource's legacy deferred compensation plans and reflects gross cash payment amounts due.\n(6) The Tax Receivable Agreement contingent liability reflects gross contingent obligation amounts excluding interest due to related party.\n(7) The AAC contingent liability reflects the fair value of the estimated amount to be paid. The maximum amount payable is $50.0 million, payable in up to $25.0 million increments at the first and second anniversaries of the acquisition of AAC on August 31, 2017.\n(8) The MEPP withdrawal obligations include final gross unpaid charges for one plan where a determination has been issued.\n(9) The federal income tax liability reflects amounts payable over eight years resulting from the transition tax implemented in the Tax Act.\nThe table above does not include future expected Company contributions to its pension plans nor does it include future expected payments related to the complete or partial withdrawals from various multi-employer pension plans where final determinations have not been made. Information related to the amounts of these future payments is described in Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The table above also excludes the liability for uncertain tax positions and for the Veritiv Deferred Compensation Savings Plan as the Company cannot predict with reasonable certainty the timing of future cash outflows associated with these liabilities. As a result of the Merger, International Paper has a potential earn-out payment of up to $100.0 million that would become due in 2020. The potential earn-out payment would be reflected by Veritiv as a reduction to equity at the time of payment. Due to the uncertainty of achievement, that potential payment is not included in the table above.\nSee Note 1, Note 2, Note 5, Note 7, Note 10 and Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to these obligations.\nThe Company has recorded undiscounted charges related to the complete or partial withdrawal from various multi-employer pension plans. Charges not related to the Company's restructuring efforts are recorded as distribution expense. Initial amounts are recorded as other non-current liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. See the table below for a summary of the net charges and the year-end balance sheet liability positions for the respective years ended December 31:\n\nSee Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding these restructuring efforts. Final charges for these withdrawals will not be known until the plans issue their respective determinations. As a result, these estimates may increase or decrease depending upon the final determinations. Currently, the Company expects payments will occur over an approximately 20 year period. The Company expects to incur similar types of charges in future periods in connection with its ongoing restructuring activities. As of December 31, 2017, the Company has received determination letters from two plans. Of those, the liability for one was settled with a lump sum payment, while monthly payments for the other plan are expected to occur over an approximately 20 year period.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires the Company to establish accounting policies and utilize estimates that affect both the amounts and timing of the recording of assets, liabilities, net sales and expenses. Some of these estimates require judgment about matters that are inherently uncertain. Different amounts would be reported under different operating conditions or under alternative assumptions.\nThe Company has evaluated the accounting policies used in the preparation of the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes and believes those policies to be reasonable and appropriate. Management believes that the accounting estimates discussed below are the most critical accounting policies whose application may have a significant effect on the reported results of operations and financial position of the Company and can require judgments by management that affect their application.\nRevenue Recognition\nRevenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the price is fixed or determinable, collectability is reasonably assured and delivery has occurred. Revenue is recognized when the customer takes title and assumes the risks and rewards of ownership. When management cannot conclude collectability is reasonably assured for shipments to a particular customer, revenue associated with that customer is not recognized until cash is collected or management is otherwise able to establish that collectability is reasonably assured.\nSales transactions with customers are designated free on board (\"f.o.b.\") destination and revenue is recorded when the product is delivered to the customer's delivery site, when title and risk of loss are transferred. Effective January 1, 2016, the Company harmonized its shipping terms to be f.o.b. destination. Prior to that date, revenue was recorded at the time of shipment for certain xpedx customers whose terms were designated f.o.b. shipping point. Management determined that any shipments in transit at December 31, 2015 would honor the f.o.b. destination terms resulting in a reduction of $27.0 million and $1.8 million to net sales and operating income, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nCertain revenues are derived from shipments arranged by the Company made directly from a manufacturer to a customer. The Company is considered to be a principal to these transactions because, among other factors, it controls pricing to the customer and bears the credit risk of the customer defaulting on payment and is the primary obligor. Revenues from these sales are reported on a gross basis in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and amounted to $3.0 billion, $3.0 billion and $3.3 billion for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nThe Company adopted Accounting Standards Update 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), and its related interpretations on January 1, 2018 applying the modified retrospective method. The adoption did not materially impact the Company's financial statements and is not expected to have a material impact on future financial results as the adoption did not change the recognition pattern for the Company's existing revenue streams.\nAcquisition and Integration Expenses\nThe Company's Consolidated Statements of Operations include a line item titled, \"Acquisition and Integration Expenses\". Acquisition and Integration Expenses is not a defined term in U.S. GAAP, thus management must use judgment in determining whether a particular expense should be classified as an acquisition and integration expense. Management believes its accounting policy for acquisition and integration expenses is critical because these costs have been significant and will continue to be significant in 2018, will generally involve cash expenditures, are not defined in U.S. GAAP, are excluded in determining compliance with the ABL Facility and are excluded in determining management compensation.\nAcquisition and integration expenses include internally dedicated integration management resources, retention compensation, information technology conversion costs, rebranding, professional services and other costs to integrate its businesses. See Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a breakdown of these expenses.\nAcquisition and integration expenses are differentiated from restructuring charges as restructuring charges primarily relate to contract termination costs, involuntary termination benefits and other direct costs associated with consolidating facilities and reorganizing functions.\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts\nThe allowance for doubtful accounts reflects the best estimate of losses inherent in the Company's accounts receivable portfolio determined on the basis of historical experience, specific allowances for known troubled accounts and other available evidence. The allowances contain uncertainties because the calculation requires management to make assumptions and apply judgment regarding the customer's credit worthiness. Veritiv performs ongoing evaluations of its customers' financial condition and adjusts credit limits based upon payment history and the customer's current credit worthiness, as determined by its review of their current financial information. The Company continuously monitors collections from its customers and maintains a provision for estimated credit losses based upon the customers' financial condition, collection experience and any other relevant customer specific information. Veritiv's assessment of this and other information forms the basis of its allowances.\nIf the financial condition of Veritiv's customers deteriorates, resulting in an inability to make required payments to the Company, or if economic conditions deteriorate, additional allowances may be deemed appropriate or required. If the allowance for doubtful accounts changed by 0.1% of gross billed receivables, reflecting either an increase or decrease in expected future write-offs, the impact to consolidated pretax income would have been approximately $1.2 million.\nEmployee Benefit Plans\nVeritiv sponsors defined benefit plans and Supplemental Executive Retirement Plans (\"SERP\") in the U.S. and Canada. These plans were frozen prior to the Merger. See Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information about these plans.\nManagement is required to make certain critical estimates related to actuarial assumptions used to determine the Company's pension expense and related obligation. The Company believes the most critical assumptions are related to (i) the discount rate used to determine the present value of the liabilities and (ii) the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. All of the actuarial assumptions are reviewed annually. Changes in these assumptions could have a material impact on the measurement of pension expense and the related obligation.\nAt each measurement date, management determines the discount rate by reference to rates of high-quality, long-term corporate bonds that mature in a pattern similar to the future payments anticipated to be made under the plans. As of December 31, 2017, the weighted-average discount rates used to compute the benefit obligations were 3.33% and 3.40% for the U.S. and Canadian plans, respectively.\nThe expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is based upon the long-term outlook of the investment strategy as well as historical returns and volatilities for each asset class. Veritiv also reviews current levels of interest rates and inflation to assess the reasonableness of the long-term rates. The Company's pension plan investment objective is to ensure all of its plans have sufficient funds to meet their benefit obligations when they become due. As a result, the Company periodically revises asset allocations, where appropriate, to improve returns and manage risk. The weighted-average expected long-term rate of return used to calculate", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion of the Company's results of operations and financial condition should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto, included elsewhere in this report.\nExecutive Overview\nBusiness Overview\nVeritiv is a leading North American business-to-business distributor of packaging, facility solutions, print and publishing products and services. Additionally, Veritiv provides logistics and supply chain management solutions to its customers. On August 31, 2017, Veritiv completed its acquisition of 100% of the equity interest in various All American Containers entities (collectively, \"AAC\"), a family owned and operated distributor of rigid packaging, including plastic, glass and metal containers, caps, closures and plastic pouches. The Company operates from approximately 170 distribution centers primarily throughout the U.S., Canada and Mexico.\nVeritiv's business is organized under four reportable segments: Packaging, Facility Solutions, Print, and Publishing and Print Management (\"Publishing\"). This segment structure is consistent with the way the Chief Operating Decision Maker, who is Veritiv's Chief Executive Officer, makes operating decisions and manages the growth and profitability of the Company's business. The following summary describes the products and services offered in each of the segments:\n \u2022 Packaging - The Packaging segment provides standard as well as custom and comprehensive packaging solutions for customers based in North America and in key global markets. The business is strategically focused on higher growth industries including light industrial/general manufacturing, food production, fulfillment and internet retail, as well as niche verticals based on geographical and functional expertise.

Increases in net sales in the Packaging and Facility Solutions segments as well as Veritiv's logistics solutions business were offset by declines in the Print and Publishing segments. See the Segment Results\u201d section for additional discussion. \n \u2022 2016 compared to 2015: Net sales declined by $391.1 million, or 4.5%, primarily due to declines in the Print and Publishing segments. See the Segment Results\u201d section for additional discussion.  Cost of Products Sold (exclusive of depreciation and amortization shown separately below)\n \u2022 2017 compared to 2016: Cost of products sold increased by $20.2 million, or 0.3%, due to the growth in net sales as previously discussed. See the Segment Results\u201d section for additional discussion. \n \u2022 2016 compared to 2015: Cost of products sold decreased by $333.9 million, or 4.7%, primarily due to the decline in net sales as previously discussed. See the Segment Results\u201d section for additional discussion.  Distribution Expenses\n \u2022 2017 compared to 2016: Distribution expenses increased by $11.8 million or 2.3%. Distribution expenses increased $12.2 million from an increase in freight and logistics expenses, primarily due to increased third-party freight, transfer expenses and diesel fuel prices and $4.9 million related to the AAC acquisition. These increases were partially offset by (i) a $1.7 million decrease in facilities rent and other related expenses, (ii) a $1.5 million decrease in insurance expense and (iii) a $1.6 million decrease in personnel expenses as well as maintenance and material expense. The offsetting decreases were primarily driven by warehouse consolidations. \n \u2022 2016 compared to 2015: Distribution expenses decreased by $16.7 million or 3.2%. The decline was primarily due to (i) a $6.3 million decrease in facilities expenses due primarily to warehouse consolidations, (ii) a $5.9 million decrease in personnel costs due primarily to reductions in temporary employee expense and (iii) a $5.3 million decrease in vehicle operating expenses primarily driven by reductions in third-party freight expense and fuel. \nSelling and Administrative Expenses\n \u2022 2017 compared to 2016: Selling and administrative expenses increased by $46.4 million or 5.6%. The increase was primarily attributed to (i) an $18.8 million increase in personnel expenses, (ii) a $13.3 million increase in bad debt expense and (iii) a $9.3 million increase related to the AAC acquisition. The increase in personnel expenses was primarily driven by an increase in headcount to support the Company's growth strategy as well as lower commissions in 2016 due to the recovery of commission advances, discussed below. The increase in bad debt expense was primarily due to additional reserves related to certain customers with declining financial conditions during 2017 combined with favorable collections experience in 2016. Selling and administrative expenses also included $8.4 million of impairment charges related to the impairment of the logistics solutions business goodwill and customer relationship intangible asset. \n \u2022 2016 compared to 2015: Selling and administrative expenses decreased by $27.7 million or 3.2%. The decrease was primarily attributed to (i) an $11.2 million decrease in commission expense due in part to lower net sales volume and (ii) a $13.6 million decrease in incentive compensation. In 2013, xpedx advanced funds to commissioned sales representatives to compensate them for a change in the timing of commission payments. During 2016, the Company recovered $6.0 million of those advances, which further reduced commission expense. These decreases were partially offset by $5.8 million of impairment charges attributable to the Print and Publishing segments' customer relationship intangible assets. \nDepreciation and Amortization\n \u2022 2017 compared to 2016: Depreciation and amortization expense decreased $0.5 million. \n \u2022 2016 compared to 2015: Depreciation and amortization expense decreased $2.2 million primarily due to $2.4 million of amortization for intangible assets acquired in the Merger that were fully amortized as of June 30, 2015.  Acquisition and Integration Expenses\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, Veritiv incurred costs and charges to integrate its combined businesses. Integration expenses include internally dedicated integration management resources, retention compensation, information technology conversion costs, rebranding, professional services and other costs to integrate its businesses. Veritiv incurred acquisition and integration expenses of $8.0 million in 2017 related to the acquisition of AAC.\nSee Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a breakdown of these costs.\nRestructuring Charges, Net\nRestructuring charges, net relates primarily to Veritiv's restructuring of its North American operations intended to integrate the legacy xpedx and Unisource operations, generate cost savings and capture synergies across the combined company. Restructuring charges, net includes net gains related to the sale or exit of certain facilities totaling $24.4 million and $2.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, and a $4.1 million net non-cash loss from asset impairments for the year ended December 31, 2015. See Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details. The Company may continue to record restructuring charges in the future as these activities progress, which may include gains or losses from the disposition of assets.\nInterest Expense, Net\nInterest expense, net in 2017 consisted of (i) $25.5 million of interest expense on the Company's asset-based lending facility (the ABL Facility\u201d), (ii) $2.6 million for amortization of deferred financing costs related to the ABL Facility and (iii) $3.1 million in miscellaneous interest expense. Interest expense, net in 2017 increased $ 3.7 million. Interest expense increased due to (i) an increased average balance on the ABL Facility and (ii) increased interest rates. See Note 5 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information related to the ABL Facility. The increased average balance and interest rates on the ABL Facility were primarily due to the acquisition of AAC on August 31, 2017. See Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details.\nInterest expense, net in 2016 consisted of (i) $18.6 million of interest expense on the ABL Facility, (ii) $5.6 million for amortization of deferred financing costs related to the ABL Facility and (iii) $3.3 million in miscellaneous interest expense. The increase in 2016 was due primarily to an additional $1.9 million of deferred financing cost amortization resulting from an amendment to the ABL Facility. This increase was offset by lower miscellaneous interest expense.\nInterest expense, net in 2015 consisted of (i) $18.7 million of interest expense on the ABL Facility, (ii) $4.4 million for amortization of deferred financing costs related to the ABL Facility and (iii) $3.9 million in miscellaneous interest expense.\nOther (Income) Expense, Net\n \u2022 2017 compared to 2016: Other (income) expense, net was income of $8.1 million in 2017 compared to expense of $7.6 million in 2016. The $15.7 million change is primarily the result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \"Tax Act\") which lowered the U.S. corporate federal tax rate, from 35% to 21%. The lower rate reduced the value of the Tax Receivable Agreement liability by $13.5 million which was recorded as other income in the fourth quarter of 2017. See Note 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details regarding the Tax Act. \n \u2022 2016 compared to 2015: Other (income) expense, net increased $0.9 million compared to 2015. This increase was primarily driven by higher expenses associated with the Tax Receivable Agreement and a loss on debt extinguishment that were partially offset by lower expenses associated with foreign currency losses in 2016 compared to 2015.  Effective Tax Rate\nVeritiv's effective tax rates were (600.0)%, 48.5% and 40.5% for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 respectively. The Company's effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2017 is impacted by a near break-even pre-tax book loss in combination with the impact of the following discrete items:\n \u2022 A $30.2 million expense in connection with our provisional estimate of the impact of the Tax Act, including $23.0 million for the remeasurement of our deferred taxes and $7.2 million for the one-time transition tax. See Note 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details regarding the Tax Act. \n \u2022 A $13.4 million benefit for the reversal of the valuation allowance on the deferred tax assets of the Company's Canadian subsidiary. The reversal reflects the Company's cumulative recent income and improved expectation of future taxable income. \n \u2022 A $3.8 million tax rate benefit for the reduction in the fair value of the Tax Receivable Agreement, including the federal rate reduction. \n \u2022 A $3.1 million benefit in conjunction with the third quarter 2017 filing of Veritiv's 2016 U.S. federal tax return and amended 2015 and 2014 U.S. federal tax returns for credits related to foreign taxes and research and experimentation activities. \n \u2022 A tax rate effect of $2.1 million for the impact of impairing non-deductible goodwill.  In addition to the above items, the difference between the Company's effective tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 and the U.S. statutory tax rate of 35% includes the impact of non-deductible expenses, state income taxes (net of federal income tax benefit), the Company's income (loss) by jurisdiction, the tax effect of Tax Receivable Agreement changes, and changes in the valuation allowance against deferred tax assets. The year ended December 31, 2015 also includes the tax impact of a foreign exchange loss and an impairment of non-deductible goodwill.\nThe Tax Act makes broad and complex changes to the U.S. tax code that affected our income taxes in 2017 as well as changes that will affect us beginning in 2018. The volatility of the Company's effective tax rate has been primarily due to both the level of pre-tax income as well as variations in the Company's income (loss) by jurisdiction. Additionally, uncertainty related to the future impact of the Tax Act may increase effective tax rate volatility. Pending further evaluation of the Tax Act, over time and with increasing pre-tax income, the Company estimates its effective tax rate will trend toward approximately 26%. However, the effective tax rate may vary significantly due to potential fluctuations in the amount and source, including both foreign and domestic, of pre-tax income and changes in amounts of non-deductible expenses and other items that could impact the effective tax rate. See Note 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details.\nSegment Results\nAdjusted EBITDA is the primary financial performance measure Veritiv uses to manage its businesses, to monitor its results of operations, to measure its performance against the ABL Facility and to incentivize its management. This common metric is intended to align shareholders, debt holders and management. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure and is not an alternative to net income, operating income or any other measure prescribed by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\"U.S. GAAP\").\nVeritiv uses Adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, restructuring charges, net, acquisition and integration expenses and other similar charges including any severance costs, costs associated with warehouse and office openings or closings, consolidation, and relocation and other business optimization expenses, stock-based compensation expense, changes in the LIFO reserve, non-restructuring asset impairment charges, non-restructuring severance\ncharges, non-restructuring pension charges, fair value adjustments related to contingent liabilities assumed in mergers and acquisitions and certain other adjustments) because Veritiv believes investors commonly use Adjusted EBITDA as a key financial metric for valuing companies. In addition, the credit agreement governing the ABL Facility permits the Company to exclude these and other charges in calculating Consolidated EBITDA, as defined in the ABL Facility.\nAdjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of Veritiv's results as reported under U.S. GAAP. For example, Adjusted EBITDA:\n \u2022 Does not reflect the Company's income tax expenses or the cash requirements to pay its taxes; and \n \u2022 Although depreciation and amortization charges are non-cash charges, it does not reflect that the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future, and the foregoing metrics do not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements. \nOther companies in the industry may calculate Adjusted EBITDA differently than Veritiv does, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure. Because of these limitations, Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as a measure of discretionary cash available to Veritiv to invest in the growth of its business. Veritiv compensates for these limitations by relying both on the Company's U.S. GAAP results and by using Adjusted EBITDA for supplemental purposes. Additionally, Adjusted EBITDA is not an alternative measure of financial performance under U.S. GAAP and therefore should be considered in conjunction with net income and other performance measures such as operating income or net cash provided by operating activities and not as an alternative to such U.S. GAAP measures.\nDue to the shared nature of the distribution network, distribution expenses are not a specific charge to each segment but are instead allocated to each segment based primarily on operational metrics that correlate with changes in volume. Accordingly, distribution expenses allocated to each segment are highly interdependent on the results of other segments. Lower volume in any segment that is not offset by a reduction in distribution expenses can result in the other segments absorbing a larger share of distribution expenses. Conversely, higher volume in any segment can result in the other segments absorbing a smaller share of distribution expenses. The impact of this at the segment level is that the changes in distribution expense trends may not correspond with volume trends within a particular segment.\nThe Company sells thousands of products. In the Packaging, Facility Solutions and Print segments, Veritiv is unable to compute the impact of changes in net sales volume based on changes in net sales of each individual product. Rather, the Company assumes that the margin stays constant and estimates the volume impact based on changes in cost of products sold as a proxy for the change in net sales volume. After any other significant net sales variances are identified, the remaining net sales variance is attributed to price/mix.\nThe Company approximates foreign currency effects by applying the foreign currency exchange rate for the prior period to the local currency results for the current period. We believe the elimination of the foreign currency translation impact provides better year-to-year comparability without the distortion of foreign currency fluctuations.\nThe Company believes that the decline in the demand for paper and related products is due to the widespread use of electronic media and permanent product substitution, more e-commerce, less print advertising, fewer catalogs and a reduced volume of direct mail, among other factors. This trend is expected to continue and will place continued pressure on the Company's revenues and profit margins and make it more difficult to maintain or grow Adjusted EBITDA within the Print and Publishing segments.\nIncluded in the following table are net sales and Adjusted EBITDA for each of the reportable segments and Corporate & Other:\nTable 88: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions)\n</td> <td>Packaging\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Facility Solutions\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Print\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Publishing\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Corporate & Other\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Year Ended December 31, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net sales\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,157.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,309.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,793.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>958.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>145.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted EBITDA\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>238.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>35.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>60.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>26.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(184.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted EBITDA as a % of net sales\n</td> <td>7.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>*\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Year Ended December 31, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net sales\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,854.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,271.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,047.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,033.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>119.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted EBITDA\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>221.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>47.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>76.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>23.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(176.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted EBITDA as a % of net sales\n</td> <td>7.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>*\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Year Ended December 31, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net sales\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,829.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,289.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,271.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,215.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>111.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted EBITDA\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>212.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>41.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>79.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>34.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(186.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted EBITDA as a % of net sales\n</td> <td>7.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.9\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>*\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n* -

The net sales increase was primarily attributable to an increase in net sales of corrugated products, films and tertiary packaging items due to increases in volume and market prices as well as $71.7 million of rigid packaging product net sales in 2017 relating to the AAC acquisition.\nAdjusted EBITDA increased $16.8 million, or 7.6%, compared to 2016 primarily due to increased net sales volume. The increase in net sales was partially offset by (i) cost of products sold increasing at a faster rate than net sales, (ii) a $25.0 million increase in distribution expenses and (iii) an $18.7 million increase in selling and administrative expenses. The increase in distribution expenses was primarily driven by increased utilization of the distribution network, which is reflected in (i) increased freight and logistics expenses driven primarily by increased third-party freight, transfer expenses and diesel fuel prices, (ii) increased personnel expenses and (iii) increased facilities rent and other related expenses. The increase in selling and administrative expenses was primarily driven by higher personnel expenses associated with increased headcount to support our growth strategy. The AAC acquisition resulted in a $4.9 million increase in distribution expenses and a $9.4 million increase in selling and administrative expenses.\nComparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015\nThe net sales increase was primarily attributable to an increase in net sales of corrugated products.\nThe Adjusted EBITDA increase was primarily due to increased net sales volume, and $3.4 million attributed to cost of products sold increasing at a slower rate than net sales.

The following table sets forth a summary of cash flows:\nTable 98: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions)\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by (used for):\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>36.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>140.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>113.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investing activities\n</td> <td>(126.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(34.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(44.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Financing activities\n</td> <td>99.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(89.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(70.4\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAnalysis of Cash Flows\nThe Company ended 2017 with $80.3 million in cash, an increase of $10.7 million during the year. Cash flow from operations was $36.6 million in 2017 compared with $140.2 million in 2016. The factors driving cash flow from operating activities in 2017 were: (i) a $48.3 million increase in accounts payable and related party payable, (ii) a $30.1 million decrease in inventories, (iii) a $13.6 million increase in other accrued liabilities and (iv) a $15.3 million increase from other operating activities. The increase in cash from operating activities was partially offset by: (i) a net loss, (ii) a $101.9 million increase in accounts receivable and related party receivable, (iii) an $11.3 million decrease in accrued payroll and benefits and (iv) an $8.4 million increase in other current assets. The Company also generated $167.3 million in cash flow from a net increase in revolving loan borrowings under the ABL Facility and $51.1 million related to proceeds from asset sales. The primary uses of cash during 2017 were: (i) $144.8 million for the acquisition of AAC, (ii) a $40.5 million decline in book overdrafts, (iii) $32.5 million for property and equipment additions, of which $16.1 million were integration-related capital expenditures and $16.4 million were ordinary capital expenditures, (iv) $16.4 million for payments under financing obligations including obligations to related party, (v) $8.5 million for the Tax Receivable Agreement payment and (vi) $2.7 million for payments under capital lease obligations.\nThe primary sources of cash during 2016 were: (i) a $69.9 million increase in accounts payable and related party payable, (ii) a $14.3 million increase in other operating activities and (iii) a $13.1 million reduction in inventories. The Company also generated $18.9 million in positive cash flow from an increase in book overdrafts and $6.6 million related to proceeds from asset sales. The primary uses of cash during 2016 were: (i) a $40.9 million decrease in accrued payroll and benefits, (ii) a $14.7 million increase in accounts receivable and related party receivable, (iii) an $11.4 million increase in other current assets, and (iv) a $3.6 million decrease in other accrued liabilities. Cash was also used by (i) $70.1 million of net repayments of revolving loan borrowings under the ABL Facility, (ii) $41.0 million of property and equipment additions, of which $25.5 million were integration-related capital expenditures and $15.5 million were ordinary capital expenditures, (iii) $19.9 million of payments under financing obligations to related party, (iv) $13.6 million used to repurchase 0.31 million shares of Veritiv outstanding common stock, (v) $3.2 million for payments under capital lease obligations and (vi) $2.0 million for financing fees incurred in connection with an amendment to the ABL Facility.\nThe primary sources of cash during 2015 were: (i) higher net income compared to 2014, (ii) a $53.4 million reduction in accounts receivable and related party receivable, (iii) $10.5 million from an increase in accrued payroll and benefits and (iv) $3.1 million from other operating activities. The primary uses of cash during 2015 were: (i) a $62.0 million increase in inventories, (ii) $47.0 million of net repayments of revolving loan borrowings under the ABL Facility, (iii) $44.4 million of property and equipment additions, of which $29.4 million were integration-related capital expenditures and $15.0 million were ordinary capital expenditures, (iv) $13.8 million of payments under financing obligations to related party, (v) an $8.4 million decrease in accounts\npayable and related party payable, (vi) a $7.1 million decrease in other accrued liabilities and (vii) $3.8 million in payments under capital lease obligations. Cash was also used for a $5.8 million decrease in book overdrafts.\nFunding and Liquidity Strategy\nVeritiv has a $1.4 billion asset-based lending facility (the \"ABL Facility\"). The ABL Facility is comprised of U.S. and Canadian sub-facilities of $1,250.0 million and $150.0 million, respectively. The ABL Facility is available to be drawn in U.S. dollars, in the case of the U.S. sub-facilities, and in U.S. dollars or Canadian dollars, in the case of the Canadian sub-facilities, or in other currencies that are mutually agreeable. The Company's accounts receivable and inventories in the U.S. and Canada are collateral under the ABL Facility.\nOn August 11, 2016, the Company amended the ABL Facility to, among other things, extend the maturity date to August 11, 2021. All other significant terms remained consistent. The ABL Facility provides for the right of the individual lenders to extend the maturity date of their respective commitments and loans upon the request of Veritiv and without the consent of any other lenders. The ABL Facility may be prepaid at Veritiv's option at any time without premium or penalty and is subject to mandatory prepayment if the amount outstanding under the ABL Facility exceeds either the aggregate commitments with respect thereto or the current borrowing base, in an amount equal to such excess. The Company incurred and deferred $2.0 million of new financing fees associated with the amendment, which are reflected in other non-current assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, and will be amortized to interest expense on a straight-line basis over the amended term of the ABL Facility.\nThe ABL Facility has a springing minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of at least 1.00 to 1.00 on a trailing four-quarter basis, which will be tested only when specified availability is less than limits outlined under the ABL Facility. At December 31, 2017 the above test was not applicable and is not expected to be applicable in the next 12 months.\nAvailability under the ABL Facility is determined based upon a monthly borrowing base calculation which includes eligible customer receivables and inventory, less outstanding borrowings, letters of credit and certain designated reserves. As of December 31, 2017, the available additional borrowing capacity under the ABL Facility was approximately $316.5 million.\nUnder the terms of the ABL Facility, interest rates are based upon LIBOR or the prime rate plus a margin rate, or in the case of Canada, a banker's acceptance rate or base rate plus a margin rate. For the years ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, the weighted-average borrowing interest rate was 3.3% and 2.5%, respectively.\nOn November 23, 2016, the UWWH Stockholder sold 1.76 million shares of Veritiv common stock in an underwritten public offering. Veritiv did not receive any of the proceeds. Concurrently with the closing of the offering, Veritiv repurchased 0.31 million of these offered shares from the underwriters at a price of $42.8625 per share, which is the price at which the underwriters purchased such shares from the selling stockholder, for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $13.4 million. In conjunction with these transactions, Veritiv incurred approximately $0.8 million in transaction-related fees, of which approximately $0.2 million was recorded as part of the cost to acquire the treasury stock and the remainder was included in selling and administrative expenses on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nVeritiv's ability to fund its capital needs will depend on its ongoing ability to generate cash from operations, borrowings under the ABL Facility and funds received from capital markets offerings. If Veritiv's cash flows from operating activities are lower than expected, the Company will need to borrow under the ABL Facility and may need to incur additional debt or issue additional equity. Although management believes that the arrangements currently in place will permit Veritiv to finance its operations on acceptable terms and conditions, the Company's access to, and the availability of, financing on acceptable terms and conditions in the future will be impacted by many factors, including the liquidity of the overall capital markets and the current state of the economy.\nVeritiv's management expects that the Company's primary future cash needs will be for working capital, capital expenditures, contractual commitments and strategic investments. Additionally, management expects that cash provided by operating activities and available capacity under the ABL Facility will provide sufficient funds to operate the business and meet other liquidity needs.\nThrough December 31, 2017, the Company incurred approximately $221 million in costs and charges associated with achieving anticipated cost savings and other synergies from the Merger, including approximately $82 million for capital expenditures and $25 million related to the complete or partial withdrawal from various multi-employer pension plans. The Company anticipates that it will incur additional costs and charges associated with the Merger. The Company is not able to\nquantify the total amount of these costs and charges or the period in which they will be incurred as the operating plans affecting these costs are evolving and charges relating to the withdrawal from multi-employer pension plans which have not yet been finalized, are uncertain. Excluding the multi-employer pension plan withdrawal charges, we currently anticipate that total costs associated with the Merger will be approximately $225 to $250 million through December 31, 2018, including approximately $90 million for capital expenditures, primarily consisting of information technology infrastructure, systems integration and planning. Ordinary capital expenditures for 2018 are expected to be in the range of $20 million to $30 million, with another $10 million to $20 million of integration-related capital expenditures during 2018.\nAll of the cash held by our non-U.S. subsidiaries is available for general corporate purposes. Veritiv considers the earnings of certain non-U.S. subsidiaries to be permanently invested outside the United States on the basis of estimates that future domestic cash generation will be sufficient to meet future domestic cash needs and management's specific plans for reinvestment of those subsidiary earnings.

The Company does not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on its financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.\nThe table below summarizes the Company's contractual and certain other long-term obligations as of December 31, 2017:\nTable 100: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Payment Due by Period\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in millions)\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019 - 2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2021 - 2022\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>After 2022\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Equipment capital lease obligations (1)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>18.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Financing obligations (including obligations to related party) (1,2)\n</td> <td>8.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>34.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other lease type obligations (3)\n</td> <td>94.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>150.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>103.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>135.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>483.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>ABL Facility (4)\n</td> <td>29.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>59.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>915.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,004.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Deferred compensation (5)\n</td> <td>2.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tax Receivable Agreement contingent liability (6)\n</td> <td>9.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>57.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>AAC contingent liability(7)\n</td> <td>17.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Multi-employer pension plan (\"MEPP\") withdrawal obligations (8)\n</td> <td>0.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Federal income tax liability (9)\n</td> <td>0.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>167.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>246.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,043.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>206.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,663.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) Equipment capital lease obligations and financing obligations include amounts classified as interest.\n(2) Financing obligations will not result in cash payments in excess of amounts reported above. At the end of the lease terms, the net remaining financing obligations of $155.2 million and $10.6 million will be settled by the return of the assets to the Purchaser/Landlord for the related party and non-related party obligations, respectively.\n(3) Amounts shown are presented net of contractual sublease rental income.\n(4) The ABL Facility will mature and the commitments thereunder will terminate after August 11, 2021. Interest payments included here were estimated using a simple interest method based on the year-end December 31, 2017 ABL Facility outstanding balance of $897.7 million and its corresponding year-end weighted-average interest rate of 3.3%. The 2021 payment amount shown above includes an estimated $897.7 million of principal balance.\n(5) The deferred compensation obligation relates to Unisource's legacy deferred compensation plans and reflects gross cash payment amounts due.\n(6) The Tax Receivable Agreement contingent liability reflects gross contingent obligation amounts excluding interest due to related party.\n(7) The AAC contingent liability reflects the fair value of the estimated amount to be paid.

Information related to the amounts of these future payments is described in Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The table above also excludes the liability for uncertain tax positions and for the Veritiv Deferred Compensation Savings Plan as the Company cannot predict with reasonable certainty the timing of future cash outflows associated with these liabilities. As a result of the Merger, International Paper has a potential earn-out payment of up to $100.0 million that would become due in 2020. The potential earn-out payment would be reflected by Veritiv as a reduction to equity at the time of payment. Due to the uncertainty of achievement, that potential payment is not included in the table above.\nSee Note 1, Note 2, Note 5, Note 7, Note 10 and Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to these obligations.\nThe Company has recorded undiscounted charges related to the complete or partial withdrawal from various multi-employer pension plans. Charges not related to the Company's restructuring efforts are recorded as distribution expense. Initial amounts are recorded as other non-current liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Final charges for these withdrawals will not be known until the plans issue their respective determinations. As a result, these estimates may increase or decrease depending upon the final determinations. Currently, the Company expects payments will occur over an approximately 20 year period. The Company expects to incur similar types of charges in future periods in connection with its ongoing restructuring activities. As of December 31, 2017, the Company has received determination letters from two plans. Of those, the liability for one was settled with a lump sum payment, while monthly payments for the other plan are expected to occur over an approximately 20 year period.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires the Company to establish accounting policies and utilize estimates that affect both the amounts and timing of the recording of assets, liabilities, net sales and expenses. Some of these estimates require judgment about matters that are inherently uncertain. Different amounts would be reported under different operating conditions or under alternative assumptions.\nThe Company has evaluated the accounting policies used in the preparation of the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes and believes those policies to be reasonable and appropriate. Management believes that the accounting estimates discussed below are the most critical accounting policies whose application may have a significant effect on the reported results of operations and financial position of the Company and can require judgments by management that affect their application.\nRevenue Recognition\nRevenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the price is fixed or determinable, collectability is reasonably assured and delivery has occurred. Revenue is recognized when the customer takes title and assumes the risks and rewards of ownership. When management cannot conclude collectability is reasonably assured for shipments to a particular customer, revenue associated with that customer is not recognized until cash is collected or management is otherwise able to establish that collectability is reasonably assured.\nSales transactions with customers are designated free on board (\"f.o.b.\") destination and revenue is recorded when the product is delivered to the customer's delivery site, when title and risk of loss are transferred. Effective January 1, 2016, the Company harmonized its shipping terms to be f.o.b. destination. Prior to that date, revenue was recorded at the time of shipment for certain xpedx customers whose terms were designated f.o.b. shipping point. Management determined that any shipments in transit at December 31, 2015 would honor the f.o.b. destination terms resulting in a reduction of $27.0 million and $1.8 million to net sales and operating income, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nCertain revenues are derived from shipments arranged by the Company made directly from a manufacturer to a customer. The Company is considered to be a principal to these transactions because, among other factors, it controls pricing to the customer and bears the credit risk of the customer defaulting on payment and is the primary obligor. Revenues from these sales are reported on a gross basis in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and amounted to $3.0 billion, $3.0 billion and $3.3 billion for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nThe Company adopted Accounting Standards Update 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), and its related interpretations on January 1, 2018 applying the modified retrospective method. The adoption did not materially impact the Company's financial statements and is not expected to have a material impact on future financial results as the adoption did not change the recognition pattern for the Company's existing revenue streams.\nAcquisition and Integration Expenses\nThe Company's Consolidated Statements of Operations include a line item titled, \"Acquisition and Integration Expenses\". Acquisition and Integration Expenses is not a defined term in U.S. GAAP, thus management must use judgment in determining whether a particular expense should be classified as an acquisition and integration expense. Management believes its accounting policy for acquisition and integration expenses is critical because these costs have been significant and will continue to be significant in 2018, will generally involve cash expenditures, are not defined in U.S. GAAP, are excluded in determining compliance with the ABL Facility and are excluded in determining management compensation.\nAcquisition and integration expenses include internally dedicated integration management resources, retention compensation, information technology conversion costs, rebranding, professional services and other costs to integrate its businesses. See Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a breakdown of these expenses.\nAcquisition and integration expenses are differentiated from restructuring charges as restructuring charges primarily relate to contract termination costs, involuntary termination benefits and other direct costs associated with consolidating facilities and reorganizing functions.\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts\nThe allowance for doubtful accounts reflects the best estimate of losses inherent in the Company's accounts receivable portfolio determined on the basis of historical experience, specific allowances for known troubled accounts and other available evidence. The allowances contain uncertainties because the calculation requires management to make assumptions and apply judgment regarding the customer's credit worthiness. Veritiv performs ongoing evaluations of its customers' financial condition and adjusts credit limits based upon payment history and the customer's current credit worthiness, as determined by its review of their current financial information. The Company continuously monitors collections from its customers and maintains a provision for estimated credit losses based upon the customers' financial condition, collection experience and any other relevant customer specific information. Veritiv's assessment of this and other information forms the basis of its allowances.\nIf the financial condition of Veritiv's customers deteriorates, resulting in an inability to make required payments to the Company, or if economic conditions deteriorate, additional allowances may be deemed appropriate or required. If the allowance for doubtful accounts changed by 0.1% of gross billed receivables, reflecting either an increase or decrease in expected future write-offs, the impact to consolidated pretax income would have been approximately $1.2 million.\nEmployee Benefit Plans\nVeritiv sponsors defined benefit plans and Supplemental Executive Retirement Plans (\"SERP\") in the U.S. and Canada. These plans were frozen prior to the Merger. See Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information about these plans.\nManagement is required to make certain critical estimates related to actuarial assumptions used to determine the Company's pension expense and related obligation. The Company believes the most critical assumptions are related to (i) the discount rate used to determine the present value of the liabilities and (ii) the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. All of the actuarial assumptions are reviewed annually. Changes in these assumptions could have a material impact on the measurement of pension expense and the related obligation.\nAt each measurement date, management determines the discount rate by reference to rates of high-quality, long-term corporate bonds that mature in a pattern similar to the future payments anticipated to be made under the plans. As of December 31, 2017, the weighted-average discount rates used to compute the benefit obligations were 3.33% and 3.40% for the U.S. and Canadian plans, respectively.\nThe expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is based upon the long-term outlook of the investment strategy as well as historical returns and volatilities for each asset class. Veritiv also reviews current levels of interest rates and inflation to assess the reasonableness of the long-term rates. The Company's pension plan investment objective is to ensure all of its plans have sufficient funds to meet their benefit obligations when they become due. As a result, the Company periodically revises asset allocations, where appropriate, to improve returns and manage risk. The weighted-average expected long-term rate of return used to calculate"}
