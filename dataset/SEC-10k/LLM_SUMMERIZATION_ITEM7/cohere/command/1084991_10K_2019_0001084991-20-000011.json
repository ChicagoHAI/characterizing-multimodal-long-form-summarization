MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion is intended to assist you in understanding our financial position and results of operations for each of the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017. You should read the following discussion and analysis in conjunction with our audited financial statements and the related notes.\nThe following discussion contains forward-looking statements. For a description of limitations inherent in forward-looking statements, see Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d on page ii.\nOverview\nWe fabricate, manufacture, rent and sell natural gas compressors and related equipment. Our primary focus is on the rental of natural gas compressors. Our rental contracts generally provide for initial terms of six to 60 months, with our larger horsepower units having longer initial terms. After the initial term of our rental contracts, most of our customers have continued to rent our compressors on a month-to-month basis. Rental amounts are billed monthly in advance and include maintenance of the rented compressors. As of December 31, 2019, we had 1,419 natural gas compressors totaling 299,836 horsepower rented to 95 customers, compared to 1,361 natural gas compressors totaling 230,089 horsepower rented to 94 customers at December 31, 2018. Of the 1,419 compressors rented at December 31, 2019, 953 were rented on a month-to-month basis.\nWe also fabricate natural gas compressors for sale to our customers, designing compressors to meet unique specifications dictated by well pressures, production characteristics and particular applications for which compression is sought. Fabrication of compressors involves our purchase of engines, compressors, coolers and other components, and our assembling of these components on skids for delivery to customer locations. These major components of our compressors are acquired through periodic purchase orders placed with third-party suppliers on an as needed\u201d basis, which presently requires a two to three month lead time with delivery dates scheduled to coincide with our estimated production schedules. Although we do not have formal continuing supply contracts with any major supplier, we believe we have adequate alternative sources available. In the past, we have not experienced any sudden and dramatic increases in the prices of the major components for our compressors; however, the occurrence of such an event could have a material adverse effect on the results of our operations and financial condition, particularly if we were unable to increase our rental rates and sales prices proportionate to any such component price increases.\nWe also manufacture a line of compressor frames, cylinders and parts, known as our CiP (Cylinder-in-Plane) product line. We use finished CiP component products in the fabrication of compressor units for sale or rental by us or sell the finished component products to other compressor fabricators. We also design, fabricate, sell, install and service flare stacks and related ignition and control devices for onshore and offshore incineration of gas compounds such as hydrogen sulfide, carbon dioxide, natural gas and liquefied petroleum gases. To provide customer support for our compressor and flare sales businesses, we stock\nvarying levels of replacement parts at our Midland, Texas facility and at field service locations. We also provide an exchange and rebuild program for screw compressors and maintain an inventory of new and used compressors to facilitate this business.\nWe provide service and maintenance to our non-rental customers under written maintenance contracts or on an as-required basis in the absence of a service contract. Maintenance agreements typically have terms of six months to one year and require payment of a monthly fee.\nThe following table sets forth our revenues from each of our three operating categories for the periods presented:\nTable 10: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Rental </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>56,701 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>47,766 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>46,046 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Sales </td> <td> </td> <td>19,763 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16,269 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>20,208 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Service and maintenance </td> <td> </td> <td>1,980 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,443 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,439 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>78,444 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>65,478 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>67,693 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur strategy for growth is focused on our compressor rental business. Margins, exclusive of depreciation and amortization, for our rental business historically run in the mid-50% to low-60% range, while margins for the compressor sales business tend to be in the mid-20% range. If our rental business grows and contributes a larger percentage of our total revenues, we expect our overall company-wide margins, exclusive of depreciation and amortization, to improve over time.\nThe oil and natural gas equipment rental and services industry is cyclical in nature. The most critical factor in assessing the outlook for the industry is the worldwide supply and demand for oil and natural gas and the corresponding changes in commodity prices. As demand and prices increase, oil and natural gas producers typically increase their capital expenditures for drilling, development and production activities, although recent equity capital constraints and demands from institutional investors to keep spending within operating cash flow have meaningfully restrained capital expenditure budgets of domestic exploration and production companies. Generally, increased capital expenditures ultimately result in greater revenues and profits for service and equipment companies.\nIn general, we expect our overall business activity and revenues to track the level of activity in the oil and natural gas industry, with changes in crude oil and condensate production and consumption levels and prices affecting our business more than changes in domestic natural gas production and consumption levels and prices. In recent years we have increased our rental and sales in unconventional oil shale plays, which are more dependent on crude oil prices. With this shift towards oil production the demand for overall compression services and products is driven by two general factors; an increased focus by producers on artificial lift applications, e.g., production enhancement with compression assisted gas lift; and declining reservoir pressure in maturing natural gas producing fields, especially non-conventional production. These types of applications have historically been serviced by wellhead size compressors, and continue to be, but there has also been an economic move by our customers towards centralized drilling and production facilities, which have increased the market need for larger horsepower compressor packages. We recognized this need over the past two to three years and have shifted our cash and fabrication resources towards designing, fabricating and renting gas compressor packages that range from 400 horsepower up to 1,380 horsepower. While this is a response to market conditions and trends, it also provides us with the opportunity to compete as a full-line compression provider.\nWe typically experience a decline in demand during periods of low crude oil and natural gas prices. Low crude oil and natural gas prices experienced throughout 2016 continued into mid-2017. In the latter half of 2017, we saw an increase in oil prices and activity that continued during most of 2018. During 2019, we witnessed a moderation of crude oil prices as well as drilling and completion activity levels. During the first quarter of 2020, we saw a substantial decline in the prices for oil and natural gas. Activity levels of exploration and production companies have been and will be dependent not only on commodity prices, but also on their ability to generate sufficient operational cash flow to fund their activities. Generally, though, we feel that production activities (in which we are involved) will fare better than drilling activity. .\nFor fiscal year 2020, our forecasted capital expenditures will be directly dependent upon our customers' compression requirements and are not anticipated to exceed our internally generated cash flows. Any required capital will be for additions to our compressor rental fleet and/or addition or replacement of service vehicles. We believe that cash on hand and cash flows from operations will be sufficient to satisfy our capital and liquidity requirements through 2020. If we require additional capital to fund any significant unanticipated expenditures, including any material acquisitions of other businesses, joint ventures or\nother opportunities, this additional capital could exceed our current resources, might not be available to us when we need it, or might not be on acceptable terms.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Practices\nWe have identified the policies below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations. In the ordinary course of business, we have made a number of estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting of results of operations and financial condition in the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates under different assumptions and conditions. We believe that the following discussion addresses our most critical accounting policies, which are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require our most difficult, subjective, and complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. We describe our significant accounting policies more fully in Note 2 (\"Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\") to our consolidated financial statements.\nOur critical accounting policies are as follows:\n\u2022revenue recognition;\n\u2022estimating the allowance for doubtful accounts receivable;\n\u2022accounting for operating leases;\n\u2022accounting for income taxes;\n\u2022accounting for long-lived assets, intangible assets and goodwill; and\n\u2022accounting for inventory.\nRevenue Recognition Policy\nThe Company adopted ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (\"ASC 606\") on January, 1, 2018. As a result, the Company has changed its accounting policy for revenue recognition as detailed below.\nRevenue is measured based on a consideration specified in a customer's contract, excluding any sale incentives and taxes collected on behalf of third parties (i.e. sales and property taxes). We recognize revenue once a performance obligation has been satisfied and control over a product or service has transferred to the customer. Shipping and handling costs incurred are accounted for as fulfillment costs and are included in cost of revenues in our Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nNature of Goods and Services\nRental Revenue. The Company generates revenue from renting compressors and flare systems to our customers. These contracts may also include a fee for servicing the compressor or flare during the rental contract. Our rental contracts typically range from six to 60 months, with our larger horsepower compressors having longer minimum contract terms. Our rental revenue is recognized over time, with equal monthly payments over the term of the contract. After the terms of the contract have expired, a customer may renew their contract or continue renting on a monthly basis thereafter.\nSales Revenue. The Company generates revenue by the sale of custom/fabricated compressors, flare systems and parts, as well as, exchange/rebuilding customer owned compressors and sale of used rental equipment. The Company designs and fabricates compressors and flares based on the customer's specifications outlined in their contract. Though the equipment being built is customized by the customer, control under these contracts does not pass to the customer until the compressor or flare package is completed and shipped, or, in accordance with a bill and hold arrangements, the customer accepts title and assumes the risk and rewards of ownership. We request some of our customers to make progressive payments as the product is being built; these payments are recorded as a contract liability on the Deferred Income line on the consolidated balance sheet until control has been transferred. These contracts also may include an assurance warranty clause to guarantee the product is free from defects in material and workmanship for a set duration of time; this is a standard industry practice and is not considered a performance obligation.\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts Receivable\nWe perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and adjust credit limits based on management's assessment of the customer's financial condition and payment history, as well as industry conditions and general economic conditions. We continuously monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain a provision for estimated credit losses based upon our historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that we have identified. While such credit losses have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established, we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that we have in the past. Management believes that its allowance for doubtful accounts is adequate; however, actual write-offs may exceed the recorded allowance.\nAccounting for Income Taxes\nAs part of the process of preparing our financial statements, we are required to estimate our federal income taxes as well as income taxes in each of the states in which we operate. This process involves us estimating our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes. These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are included in our consolidated balance sheet. We must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and, to the extent we believe that recovery is not probable, we must establish a valuation allowance. To the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a period, we must include an expense in the tax provision in the statement of income.\nSignificant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes, our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets. We currently have no valuation allowance and fully expect to utilize all of our deferred tax assets.\nASC 740 also prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. In order to record any financial statement benefit, we are required to determine, based on technical merits of the position, whether it is more likely than not (a likelihood of more than 50 percent) that a tax position will be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes. If that step is satisfied, then we must measure the tax position to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements. The tax position is measured at the largest amount of the benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Our policy regarding income tax interest and penalties is to expense those items as other expense.\nLong-Lived Assets, Intangible Assets and Goodwill\nRental Equipment, Property and Equipment (Including Retirement of Rental Equipment)\nRental equipment and property and equipment are recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation, except for work-in-progress on new rental equipment which is recorded at cost until it's complete and added to the fleet. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Our rental equipment has an estimated useful life between 15 and 25 years, while our property and equipment has an estimate useful lives which range from 3 to 39 years. The majority of our property and equipment, including rental equipment, is a direct cost to generating revenue.\nIn January 2019, the Company reviewed the estimated useful lives of its rental equipment. This review indicated that the actual lives of its larger horsepower rental equipment were longer than the estimated useful lives used for depreciation purposes in the Company's financial statements. These units incorporate newer technology and heavier, more robust castings and forging, which allows for complete overhauls at longer cycles when compared to its older, lower horsepower units.\nWe assess the impairment of rental equipment and property and equipment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the net recorded amount may not be recoverable. The following factors could trigger an impairment review: significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future cash flows; significant adverse changes in the extent or manner in which asset (or asset group) is being used or its condition, including a meaningful drop in fleet utilization over the prior four quarters; significant negative industry or company-specific trends or actions, including meaningful capital expenditure budget reductions by our major customers or other sizable exploration and production or midstream companies, as well as significant declines in oil and natural gas prices; legislative changes prohibiting us from leasing our units or flares; or poor general economic conditions. An impairment loss is recognized if the future undiscounted cash flows associated with the asset (or asset group) and the estimated fair value of the asset are less than the asset's carrying value.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has caused a significant economic decline during the first quarter of 2020. In addition, the pandemic and recent actions by Saudi Arabia and Russia have resulted in a significant decline in oil prices during the same time period. If economic and industry conditions do not improve, an impairment review during 2020 could be triggered.\nGoodwill (Including Impairment During 2019)\nGoodwill represents the cost in excess of fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired. Goodwill is tested annually for impairment or as needed upon the occurrence of certain events or substantive changes in circumstances that indicate goodwill is more likely than not impaired. During the third quarter of 2019, the Company examined various qualitative factors to determine if a quantitative goodwill impairment test was needed. As a result of our qualitative assessment, we proceeded to perform our quantitative goodwill impairment analysis, where we used an independent valuation specialist to assist us in determining the fair value of our net assets. In this impairment analysis, the estimated fair value of our net assets was determined utilizing market and income-based approaches. Determining fair value in this analysis required significant judgment, including judgments about appropriate comparable companies, appropriate discount rates and our estimated future cash flows, which are subject to change. As a result of our quantitative evaluation, we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $10.0 million in 2019.\nIntangibles\nAt December 31, 2019 and 2018, NGS had intangible assets, which relate to developed technology and a trade name which was acquired in our acquisition of Screw Compression Systems in January 2005. This asset is not being amortized as it has been deemed to have an indefinite life.\nOur policy is to review intangibles that are being amortized for impairment when indicators of impairment are present. In addition, it is our policy to review indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually or when indicators of impairment are present. We review intangibles through an assessment of the estimated future cash flows related to such assets. In the event that assets are found to be carried at amounts in excess of estimated undiscounted future cash flows, then the assets will be adjusted for impairment to a level commensurate with a discounted cash flow analysis of the underlying assets. Based upon our analysis, we experienced no impairment of intangible assets (excluding goodwill) during the years ended December 31, 2019 or 2018.\nIn addition, in conjunction with our quantitative assessment of goodwill, we used the services of an independent valuation specialist to assist us in determining the fair value of our trade name during the third quarter of 2019. In this impairment analysis, the estimated fair value of our trade name was determined utilizing an income-based approach that required significant judgment, including those about an appropriate royalty rate and discount rate. This analysis indicated no impairment of our trade name.\nInventories\nWe value our total inventory (current and long-term) at the lower of the actual cost and net realizable value of the inventory. We regularly review inventory quantities on hand and record a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based primarily on current and anticipated customer demand and production requirements. The Company accesses anticipated customer demand based on current and upcoming capital expenditure budgets of its major customers as well as other significant companies in the industry, along with oil and natural gas price forecasts and other factors affecting the industry. Given its concerns about the industry backdrop, Company management determined during 2019 that an increase of its inventory allowance was necessary. Due to the slow moving nature or obsolescence of a portion of the Company's long-term inventory and inventory related to the retirement of rental equipment, management recorded an increase of $3.4 million in the inventory allowance reserve for costs that may not be recoverable in the future. Management later identified another $408,000 of slow moving or obsolete inventory, which was written off. For the year ended December 31, 2019, inventory allowance and write-off totaled $3.8 million. We ended 2019 with an inventory allowance balance of $24,000.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has caused a significant economic decline during the first quarter of 2020. In addition, the pandemic and recent actions by Saudi Arabia and Russia have resulted in a significant decline in oil prices during the same time period. If economic and industry conditions do not improve, an additional review of our inventory for excess and obsolete items during 2020 could be necessary.\nOur Performance Trends and Outlook\nOn January 30, 2020, the World Health Organization ( WHO\u201d) announced a global health emergency because of a new strain of coronavirus known as COVID-19 due to the risks it imposes on the international community as the virus spreads globally. In March 2020, the WHO classified the COVID-19 outbreak as a pandemic, based on the rapid increase in exposure globally. During this time, the market began to experience a decline in oil prices in response to oil demand concerns due to the\nglobal economic impacts of COVID-19. In addition, recent events concerning OPEC and Russia resulted in Saudi Arabia significantly discounting the price of its crude oil, as well as Saudi Arabia and Russia significantly increasing their oil supply. These actions have led to significant weakness in oil prices and ensuing reductions of exploration and production company capital and operating budgets.\nAs of March 31, 2020, the full impact of the COVID-19 outbreak continues to evolve daily. With the significant decline in oil prices as well as the general economic decline caused by the impacts of COVID-19, we expect utilization to decline among our smaller horsepower and medium horsepower units during the remainder of 2020 after a minimal decline during the first quarter of 2020. In terms of sales, we expect minimal compressor sales for the year due to much lower capital expenditure budgets throughout the industry, including those of our major customers. Finally, we have recently experienced and expect to continue to experience pricing pressure from our customers and competitors until industry and economic conditions improve. We are currently experiencing no issues with potential workforce and supply chain disruptions. In addition, our relationship with our major customer continues to be strong, and they have continued to pay our invoices in a timely, consistent manner. Nevertheless, if any of these circumstances change, our business could be adversely affected.\nWhile management anticipates that the industry and economic impact of the pandemic and OPEC's actions will have a negative effect on its results of operations in 2020 and perhaps beyond, the degree to which these factors will impact our business remains uncertain. Please read Item 1A, Risk Factors, in this report.\nResults of Operations\nYear Ended December 31, 2019 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2018\nThe table below shows our revenues and percentage of total revenues for each of our product lines for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018.\nTable 11: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Revenue </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(dollars in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Rental </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>56,701 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>72.3 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>47,766 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>73.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Sales </td> <td> </td> <td>19,763 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>25.2 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>16,269 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>24.8 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Service & Maintenance </td> <td> </td> <td>1,980 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.5 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>1,443 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.2 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>78,444 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>65,478 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTotal revenue increased to $78.4 million from $65.5 million, or 19.8%, for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to 2018. This increase was mainly a result of higher rental revenue (18.7% increase) primarily due to a greater number of large horsepower units being rented as well as higher sales revenue (21.5% increase) primarily due to increased compressor sales.\nRental revenue increased to $56.7 million from $47.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to 2018. As of December 31, 2019, we had 2,304 natural gas compressors in our rental fleet, down from 2,567 units at year end 2018 due the retirement of 327 units (with 39,758 horsepower) during the third quarter of 2019. Despite this decrease due to unit retirement, the Company's total unit horsepower increased by 7.7% to 429,650 at December 31, 2019 compared to 398,765 horsepower year end 2018, which reflects the addition of 54 high horsepower compressors with 70,020 horsepower to the Company's fleet during 2019. As of December 31, 2019, we had 1,419 natural gas compressors totaling 299,836 horsepower rented to 95 customers, compared to 1,361 natural gas compressors totaling 230,089 horsepower rented to 94 customers as of December 31, 2018. The rental fleet had a unit utilization as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, of 61.6% and 53.0% while our horsepower utilization for the same periods, respectively, was 69.8% and 57.7%. The rise in both utilizations was mainly the result of the rise in demand for our higher horsepower units as well as unit retirements during the third quarter of 2019.\nSales revenue increased to $19.8 million from $16.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to 2018. This increase in largely attributable to an increase in compressor sales partially offset by a decrease in flare sales. Sales are subject to fluctuations in timing of industry activity related to capital projects and, as such, can vary substantially between periods.\nDuring the third quarter of 2019, the Company examined various qualitative factors to determine if a quantitative goodwill impairment test was needed. After examining various qualitative factors, the Company performed a goodwill impairment analysis as of September 30, 2019. The analysis showed our carrying value of net assets exceeded its fair value, indicating that goodwill was fully impaired. Accordingly, the Company recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $10.0 million during the third quarter of 2019.\nGiven its concerns about the industry backdrop, Company management determined during 2019 that an increase of its inventory allowance was necessary. Due to the slow moving nature or obsolescence of a portion of the Company's long-term inventory and inventory related to the retirement of rental equipment, management recorded an increase of $3.4 million in the inventory allowance reserve for costs that may not be recoverable in the future. Management later identified another $408,000 of slow moving or obsolete inventory, which was written off. For the year ended December 31, 2019, inventory allowance and write-off totaled $3.8 million. We ended 2019 with an inventory allowance balance of $24,000.\nGiven its concerns about the current industry backdrop, Company management determined during the third quarter of 2019 which units were not of the type, configuration, make or model that our customers are demanding or that were not cost efficient to refurbish, maintain and/or operate. As a result of this review, we determined 327 units should be retired from our rental fleet. Accordingly, we recorded a $1.5 million loss on retirement of rental equipment during the year ended December 31, 2019.\nOperating loss increased to $15.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to an operating loss of $0.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase in operating loss was mainly due to the inventory allowance and write-off, loss on the retirement of rental units, and a goodwill impairment charge that totaled $15.3 million, partially offset by higher rental revenues and compressor sales.\nSelling, general, and administrative expenses increased to $10.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to $9.1 million for 2018. This 17.7% increase was primarily the result of increases in officer bonuses ($0.5 million), deferred compensation ($0.4 million, most of which was non-cash), professional services ($0.3 million), and stock compensation ($0.2 million).\nDepreciation and amortization expense increased to $23.3 million from $22.1 million, or 5.4%, for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to 2018. The increase is the result of larger horsepower units being added to the fleet. We added 82 units (approximately 74,000 horsepower) to our fleet over the past twelve months. Fifty-four of those units were 400 horsepower or larger (including 49 at 1,380 horsepower), representing approximately 95% of the horsepower added.\nIncome tax benefit increased to $0.7 million from a $72,000 expense for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to 2018. As shown in Note 9 to these financial statements, our effective tax rate for both years differs from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21%. Our income tax benefit in 2019 was largely due to our net loss of $13.7 million but was largely offset by a difference in goodwill impairment for tax purposes as well as an adjustment to our state tax rates that increased our deferred income tax expense by approximately $0.8 million. The Company's 2018 income tax expense was impacted by the Company discovering a potentially uncertain tax position attributable deductibility of certain executive compensation expense for federal income tax purposes totaling approximately $168,000, $149,000 and $230,000 for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. As a result, in accordance with ASC Topic 740, during the fourth quarter of 2018, the Company recorded a tax adjustment of $547,000 and accrued penalty and interest expense of $55,000 attributable to the uncertain tax position. The Company filed amended tax returns during 2019 for the years ended 2015, 2016 and 2017 and has recognized certain offsetting deductions, thus removing the large majority of its uncertain tax position reserve as of December 31, 2019.\nYear Ended December 31, 2018 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2017\nThe table below shows our revenue and percentage of total revenues for each of our product lines for the years ended December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017.\nTable 12: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Revenue </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(dollars in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Rental </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>47,766 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>73.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>46,046 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>68.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Sales </td> <td> </td> <td>16,269 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>24.8 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>20,208 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>29.9 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Service & Maintenance </td> <td> </td> <td>1,443 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.2 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>1,439 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.1 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>65,478 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>. </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>67,693 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTotal revenue decreased to $65.5 million from $67.7 million, or 3.3%, for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to 2017. This was the result of a 19.5% decrease in sales revenue, which was offset by a 3.7% increase in rental revenue and a 0.3% increase in service and maintenance revenue.\nRental revenue increased to $47.8 million from $46.0 million, or 3.7%, for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to 2017. This increase is due to an increase in the average oil and natural prices for the year ended December 31, 2018, resulting in units being deployed, as well as a rise in the demand for our higher horsepower units. As of December 31, 2018, we had 2,572 natural gas compressors in our rental fleet totaling 398,765 horsepower, as compared to 2,546 natural gas compressors totaling 369,961 horsepower as of December 31, 2017. As of December 31, 2018, we had 1,361 natural gas compressors totaling 230,089 horsepower rented to 94 customers, compared to 1,259 natural gas compressors totaling 184,382 horsepower rented to 87 customers as of December 31, 2017. The rental fleet had a utilization of 53.0% as of December 31, 2018 as compared to 49.5% at December 31, 2017.\nSales revenue decreased to $16.3 million from $20.2 million, or 19.5%, for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to 2017. Our sales activity can fluctuate depending on the demand from our customers' investments in non-conventional shale plays which require compression for producing natural gas and scheduling of projects in our fabrication facility. Due to economic uncertainty and continued tight credit markets, the energy industry continued to encounter reduced capital spending. While our strategy is to maintain our rental revenues so that they are a larger component of total revenue, we will continue to build and sell custom fabricated equipment. In support of this, we intend to cultivate new sales oriented customers and are actively pursuing small, medium and large reciprocating compressor fabrication projects, as well as, building rotary screw-type equipment of any size. Sales include: (1) compressor unit sales, (2) flare sales, (3) parts sales and (4) compressor rebuilds.\nOperating income of $1.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 decreased to a $0.5 million loss for the year ended December 31, 2018. This decrease is attributed to a 6.4% drop in our rental margins, due to costs incurred in deploying units.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2018, management performed a review of our rental compressor units and determined there were 13 units fully depreciated in our rental fleet which needed to be retired, representing total horsepower of 1,360.\nSelling, general, and administrative expenses decreased to $9.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to $10.1 million for 2017. This 9.8% decrease is primarily a result in a decrease in stock compensation of $1.7 million.\nDepreciation and amortization expense increased to $22.1 million from $21.3 million, or 3.6%, for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to 2017. The increase is the result of larger horsepower units being added to the fleet. We added 31 units (approximately 29,508 horsepower) to our fleet over the past twelve months. Twenty-seven of these were 400 horsepower or larger, representing 99% of the horsepower added.\nIncome tax expense decreased to $72,000 from a $18.3 million benefit for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 2017. As discussed in Note 9 to these financial statements, during the fourth quarter of 2018, the Company discovered a potentially uncertain tax position attributable deductibility of certain executive compensation expense for federal income tax purposes aggregating approximately $168,000, $149,000, $230,000 for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. As a result, in accordance with ASC Topic 740, during the fourth quarter of 2018, the Company recorded a tax adjustment of $547,000 and accrued penalty and interest expense of $55,000 attributable to the uncertain tax position. In 2017, the $18.3 million tax benefit was the result of the $18.4 million income tax benefit recorded in connection with the 2017 Tax Act, due to the remeasurement of our deferred tax assets and liabilities at the new federal statutory rate.\nAdjusted Gross Margin Year Ended December 31, 2019 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2018\nThe table below shows our adjusted gross margin and related percentages for each of our product lines for the years ended December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018.

Our drop in gross margins is mainly due to a 2.8% drop in rental revenue margins, which decreased to 51.4% for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to 54.2% during 2018. This decrease was due to an increased bad debt allowance as well as increased maintenance and repair costs, particularly \"make-ready\" jobs on units being placed back into service. Sales margin decreased to 18.5% in 2019 from 22.8% in 2018 due to higher payroll and lower labor and overhead efficiency in our fabrication facilities. Third party service and maintenance margins decreased to 68.2% from 73.3% for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to 2018. Service and maintenance only represents 2.5% of our revenue in 2019, providing minimal impact on our overall adjusted gross margin.\nAdjusted Gross Margin Year Ended December 31, 2018 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2017\nThe table below shows our adjusted gross margin and related percentages for each of our product lines for the years ended December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017.

Our drop in gross margins is mainly due to the drop in rental revenue margins due to costs incurred in deploying units. Rental margins decreased to 54.2% for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 60.6% during 2017 . Sales margin increased to 22.8% from 20.7% for the year ended 2018 compared to 2017. Third party service and maintenance margins decreased to 73.3% for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 74.3% in 2017.

During the year, the Company added $63.7 million in new equipment to our rental fleet, $3.8 million in payments related to the construction of our new corporate office, and $2.4 million in vehicles, office furniture and equipment. Our investment in property and equipment includes any changes to work-in-progress related to our rental fleet jobs at the beginning of the year compared to the end of the year. Our rental work-in-progress decreased by $2.7 million during 2019. We financed our investment in rental equipment, property and other equipment with cash on hand during 2019.\nCash flows\nAt December 31, 2019, we had cash and cash equivalents of $11.6 million compared to $52.6 million at year end 2018. Our cash flow from operations of $29.4 million was offset by capital expenditures of $69.9 million during 2019. We also had working capital of $36.9 million at December 31, 2019 compared to $84.0 million at December 31, 2018. On December 31, 2019 and 2018, we had outstanding debt of $417,000, which is all related to our line of credit. We had net cash flow from operating activities of $29.4 million during 2019 compared $23.7 million during 2018. Our cash flow from operating activities of $29.4 million was primarily the result adding back non-cash items of depreciation of $23.3 million, a goodwill impairment charge of $10.0 million, an increased inventory allowance and write-off of $3.8 million, stock-based compensation of $2.6 million, a loss on retirement of rental equipment of $1.5 million, a bad debt allowance of $0.7 million, and a net positive change in working capital and various other items of $2.1 million. These positive impacts were partially offset by a net loss of $13.9 million and a decrease in cash flows related to a reduction in deferred income taxes of $0.7 million.\nAt December 31, 2018, we had cash and cash equivalents of $52.6 million, working capital of $84.0 million and total debt of $417,000, under our credit agreement which is due in 2020. Our cash and cash equivalents decreased from 2017, due to an increase on our capital program for contracted new large horsepower compressor builds and the construction of our new corporate office. We had positive net cash flow from operating activities of approximately $23.7 million during 2018. This was primarily from a net loss of $0.5 million and non-cash items of depreciation and amortization of $22.1 million, $2.6 million related to stock-based compensation, a decrease in deferred income taxes of $0.3 million and a decrease in cash flows related to working capital and other items of $0.2 million.\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nWe have contractual obligations and commitments that affect our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.

Construction of a new office began in late 2017 and was completed in 2019.\nSenior Bank Borrowings\nWe have a senior secured revolving credit agreement the (\"Amended Credit Agreement\") with JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A (the \"Lender\") with an aggregate commitment of $30 million, subject to collateral availability. We also have a right to request from the Lender, on an uncommitted basis, an increase of up to $20 million on the aggregate commitment (which could potentially increase the commitment amount to $50 million).\nBorrowing Base. At any time before the maturity of the Amended Credit Agreement, we may draw, repay and re-borrow amounts available under the borrowing base up to the maximum aggregate availability discussed above. Generally, the borrowing base equals the sum of (a) 80% of our eligible accounts receivable plus (b) 50% of the book value of our eligible general inventory (not to exceed 50% of the commitment amount at the time) plus (c) 75% of the book value of our eligible equipment inventory. JPMorgan Chase Bank (the Lender\u201d) may adjust the borrowing base components if material deviations in the collateral are discovered in future audits of the collateral.\nInterest and Fees. Under the terms of the Amended Credit Agreement, we have the option of selecting the applicable variable rate for each revolving loan, or portion thereof, of either (a) LIBOR multiplied by the Statutory Reserve Rate (as defined in the Amended Credit Agreement), with respect to this rate, for Eurocurrency funding, plus the Applicable Margin ( LIBOR-based\u201d), or (b) CB Floating Rate, which is the Lender's Prime Rate less the Applicable Margin; provided, however, that no more than three LIBOR-based borrowings under the agreement may be outstanding at any one time. For purposes of the LIBOR-based interest rate, the Applicable Margin is 1.50%. For purposes of the CB Floating Rate, the Applicable Margin is 1.25%. Accrued interest is payable monthly on outstanding principal amounts, provided that accrued interest on LIBOR-based loans is payable at the end of each interest period, but in no event less frequently than quarterly. In addition, fees and expenses are payable in connection with our requests for letters of credit (generally equal to the Applicable Margin for LIBOR-related borrowings multiplied by the face amount of the requested letter of credit) and administrative and legal costs.\nMaturity. The maturity date of the Amended Credit Agreement is December 31, 2020, at which time all amounts borrowed under the agreement will be due and outstanding letters of credit must be cash collateralized. The agreement may be terminated early upon our request or the occurrence of an event of default.\nSecurity. The obligations under the Amended Credit Agreement are secured by a first priority lien on all of our inventory and accounts and leases receivables, along with a first priority lien on a variable number of our leased compressor equipment the book value of must be maintained at a minimum of 2.00 to 1.00 commitment coverage ratio (such ratio being equal to (i) the amount of the borrowing base as of such date to (ii) the amount of the commitment as of such date.)\nCovenants. The Amended Credit Agreement contains customary representations and warranties, as well as covenants which, among other things, limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness and liens; enter into transactions with affiliates; make acquisitions in excess of certain amounts; pay dividends; redeem or repurchase capital stock or senior notes; make investments or loans; make negative pledges; consolidate, merge or effect asset sales; or change the nature of our business. In addition, we also have certain financial covenants that require us to maintain a leverage ratio less than or equal to 2.50 to 1.00 as of the last day of each fiscal quarter.\nEvents of Default and Acceleration. The Amended Credit Agreement contains customary events of default for credit facilities of this size and type, and includes, without limitation, payment defaults; defaults in performance of covenants or other agreements contained in the transaction documents; inaccuracies in representations and warranties; certain defaults, termination events or\nsimilar events; certain defaults with respect to any other Company indebtedness in excess of $50,000; certain bankruptcy or insolvency events; the rendering of certain judgments in excess of $150,000; certain ERISA events; certain change in control events and the defectiveness of any liens under the secured revolving credit agreement. Obligations under the Amended Credit Agreement may be accelerated upon the occurrence of an event of default.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we were in compliance with all covenants in our Amended Credit Agreement. A default under our Amended Credit Agreement could trigger the acceleration of our bank debt so that it is immediately due and payable. Such default would have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, financial position and operations if we were to borrow a significant amount under our facility.\nComponents of Our Principal Capital Expenditures\nCapital expenditures for the three years ended December 31:\nTable 17: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Expenditure Category </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Rental equipment and property and equipment </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>69,938 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>40,065 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>13,536 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe level of our expenditures will vary in future periods depending on energy market conditions and other related economic factors. Based upon existing economic and market conditions, we believe that our cash on hand, operating cash flow and available line of credit are adequate to fully fund our net capital expenditures requirements for 2020. We also believe we have flexibility with respect to our financing alternatives and adjustments to our capital expenditure plans if circumstances warrant. We do not have any material continuing commitments related to our current operations that cannot be met with our cash on hand and our line of credit. However, our financing capacity could be negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Please see Note 19 of our Consolidated Financial Statements and Item 1A, Risk Factors, of this report.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nFrom time-to-time, we enter into off-balance sheet arrangements and transactions that can give rise to off-balance sheet obligations. As of December 31, 2019, we have an off-balance sheet arrangement and transaction. We do not believe that this arrangement is reasonably likely to materially affect our liquidity or availability of, or requirements for, capital resources.\nWe entered into a purchase agreement with a vendor in July 2008 pursuant to which we agreed to purchase up to $4.8 million of our paint and coating requirements exclusively from the vendor. In connection with the execution of the agreement, the vendor paid us a $300,000 fee which is considered to be a discount toward future purchases from the vendor. As of December 31, 2019, we had met $4.1 million of this obligation. The $300,000 payment we received is recorded as a long-term liability and will decrease as the purchase commitment is fulfilled. The long-term liability remaining as of December 31, 2019 was $41,000.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements on page.\nEnvironmental Regulations\nVarious federal, state and local laws and regulations covering the discharge of materials into the environment, or otherwise relating to protection of human safety and health and the environment, affect our operations and costs. Compliance with these laws and regulations could cause us to incur remediation or other corrective action costs or result in the assessment of administrative, civil and criminal penalties and the issuance of injunctions delaying or prohibiting operations. In addition, we have acquired certain properties and plant facilities from third parties whose actions with respect to the management and disposal or release of hydrocarbons or other wastes were not under our control. Under environmental laws and regulations, we could be required to remove or remediate wastes disposed of or released by prior owners. In addition, we could be responsible under environmental laws and regulations for properties and plant facilities we lease, but do not own. Compliance with such laws and regulations increases our overall cost of business, but has not had a material adverse effect on our operations or financial condition. It is not anticipated, based on current laws and regulations, that we will be required in the near future to expend amounts that are material in relation to our total expenditure budget in order to comply with environmental laws and regulations but such laws and regulations are frequently changed and we are unable to predict the ultimate cost of\ncompliance. We also could incur costs related to the cleanup of sites to which we send equipment and for damages to natural resources or other claims related to releases of regulated substances at such sites.",

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion is intended to assist you in understanding our financial position and results of operations for each of the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017. You should read the following discussion and analysis in conjunction with our audited financial statements and the related notes.\nThe following discussion contains forward-looking statements. For a description of limitations inherent in forward-looking statements, see Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d on page ii.\nOverview\nWe fabricate, manufacture, rent and sell natural gas compressors and related equipment. Our primary focus is on the rental of natural gas compressors. Our rental contracts generally provide for initial terms of six to 60 months, with our larger horsepower units having longer initial terms. After the initial term of our rental contracts, most of our customers have continued to rent our compressors on a month-to-month basis. Rental amounts are billed monthly in advance and include maintenance of the rented compressors. As of December 31, 2019, we had 1,419 natural gas compressors totaling 299,836 horsepower rented to 95 customers, compared to 1,361 natural gas compressors totaling 230,089 horsepower rented to 94 customers at December 31, 2018. Of the 1,419 compressors rented at December 31, 2019, 953 were rented on a month-to-month basis.\nWe also fabricate natural gas compressors for sale to our customers, designing compressors to meet unique specifications dictated by well pressures, production characteristics and particular applications for which compression is sought. Fabrication of compressors involves our purchase of engines, compressors, coolers and other components, and our assembling of these components on skids for delivery to customer locations. These major components of our compressors are acquired through periodic purchase orders placed with third-party suppliers on an as needed\u201d basis, which presently requires a two to three month lead time with delivery dates scheduled to coincide with our estimated production schedules. Although we do not have formal continuing supply contracts with any major supplier, we believe we have adequate alternative sources available. In the past, we have not experienced any sudden and dramatic increases in the prices of the major components for our compressors; however, the occurrence of such an event could have a material adverse effect on the results of our operations and financial condition, particularly if we were unable to increase our rental rates and sales prices proportionate to any such component price increases.\nWe also manufacture a line of compressor frames, cylinders and parts, known as our CiP (Cylinder-in-Plane) product line. We use finished CiP component products in the fabrication of compressor units for sale or rental by us or sell the finished component products to other compressor fabricators. We also design, fabricate, sell, install and service flare stacks and related ignition and control devices for onshore and offshore incineration of gas compounds such as hydrogen sulfide, carbon dioxide, natural gas and liquefied petroleum gases. To provide customer support for our compressor and flare sales businesses, we stock\nvarying levels of replacement parts at our Midland, Texas facility and at field service locations. We also provide an exchange and rebuild program for screw compressors and maintain an inventory of new and used compressors to facilitate this business.\nWe provide service and maintenance to our non-rental customers under written maintenance contracts or on an as-required basis in the absence of a service contract. Maintenance agreements typically have terms of six months to one year and require payment of a monthly fee.\nThe following table sets forth our revenues from each of our three operating categories for the periods presented:\n\nOur strategy for growth is focused on our compressor rental business. Margins, exclusive of depreciation and amortization, for our rental business historically run in the mid-50% to low-60% range, while margins for the compressor sales business tend to be in the mid-20% range. If our rental business grows and contributes a larger percentage of our total revenues, we expect our overall company-wide margins, exclusive of depreciation and amortization, to improve over time.\nThe oil and natural gas equipment rental and services industry is cyclical in nature. The most critical factor in assessing the outlook for the industry is the worldwide supply and demand for oil and natural gas and the corresponding changes in commodity prices. As demand and prices increase, oil and natural gas producers typically increase their capital expenditures for drilling, development and production activities, although recent equity capital constraints and demands from institutional investors to keep spending within operating cash flow have meaningfully restrained capital expenditure budgets of domestic exploration and production companies. Generally, increased capital expenditures ultimately result in greater revenues and profits for service and equipment companies.\nIn general, we expect our overall business activity and revenues to track the level of activity in the oil and natural gas industry, with changes in crude oil and condensate production and consumption levels and prices affecting our business more than changes in domestic natural gas production and consumption levels and prices. In recent years we have increased our rental and sales in unconventional oil shale plays, which are more dependent on crude oil prices. With this shift towards oil production the demand for overall compression services and products is driven by two general factors; an increased focus by producers on artificial lift applications, e.g., production enhancement with compression assisted gas lift; and declining reservoir pressure in maturing natural gas producing fields, especially non-conventional production. These types of applications have historically been serviced by wellhead size compressors, and continue to be, but there has also been an economic move by our customers towards centralized drilling and production facilities, which have increased the market need for larger horsepower compressor packages. We recognized this need over the past two to three years and have shifted our cash and fabrication resources towards designing, fabricating and renting gas compressor packages that range from 400 horsepower up to 1,380 horsepower. While this is a response to market conditions and trends, it also provides us with the opportunity to compete as a full-line compression provider.\nWe typically experience a decline in demand during periods of low crude oil and natural gas prices. Low crude oil and natural gas prices experienced throughout 2016 continued into mid-2017. In the latter half of 2017, we saw an increase in oil prices and activity that continued during most of 2018. During 2019, we witnessed a moderation of crude oil prices as well as drilling and completion activity levels. During the first quarter of 2020, we saw a substantial decline in the prices for oil and natural gas. Activity levels of exploration and production companies have been and will be dependent not only on commodity prices, but also on their ability to generate sufficient operational cash flow to fund their activities. Generally, though, we feel that production activities (in which we are involved) will fare better than drilling activity. .\nFor fiscal year 2020, our forecasted capital expenditures will be directly dependent upon our customers' compression requirements and are not anticipated to exceed our internally generated cash flows. Any required capital will be for additions to our compressor rental fleet and/or addition or replacement of service vehicles. We believe that cash on hand and cash flows from operations will be sufficient to satisfy our capital and liquidity requirements through 2020. If we require additional capital to fund any significant unanticipated expenditures, including any material acquisitions of other businesses, joint ventures or\nother opportunities, this additional capital could exceed our current resources, might not be available to us when we need it, or might not be on acceptable terms.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Practices\nWe have identified the policies below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations. In the ordinary course of business, we have made a number of estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting of results of operations and financial condition in the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates under different assumptions and conditions. We believe that the following discussion addresses our most critical accounting policies, which are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require our most difficult, subjective, and complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. We describe our significant accounting policies more fully in Note 2 (\"Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\") to our consolidated financial statements.\nOur critical accounting policies are as follows:\n\u2022revenue recognition;\n\u2022estimating the allowance for doubtful accounts receivable;\n\u2022accounting for operating leases;\n\u2022accounting for income taxes;\n\u2022accounting for long-lived assets, intangible assets and goodwill; and\n\u2022accounting for inventory.\nRevenue Recognition Policy\nThe Company adopted ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (\"ASC 606\") on January, 1, 2018. As a result, the Company has changed its accounting policy for revenue recognition as detailed below.\nRevenue is measured based on a consideration specified in a customer's contract, excluding any sale incentives and taxes collected on behalf of third parties (i.e. sales and property taxes). We recognize revenue once a performance obligation has been satisfied and control over a product or service has transferred to the customer. Shipping and handling costs incurred are accounted for as fulfillment costs and are included in cost of revenues in our Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nNature of Goods and Services\nRental Revenue. The Company generates revenue from renting compressors and flare systems to our customers. These contracts may also include a fee for servicing the compressor or flare during the rental contract. Our rental contracts typically range from six to 60 months, with our larger horsepower compressors having longer minimum contract terms. Our rental revenue is recognized over time, with equal monthly payments over the term of the contract. After the terms of the contract have expired, a customer may renew their contract or continue renting on a monthly basis thereafter.\nSales Revenue. The Company generates revenue by the sale of custom/fabricated compressors, flare systems and parts, as well as, exchange/rebuilding customer owned compressors and sale of used rental equipment. The Company designs and fabricates compressors and flares based on the customer's specifications outlined in their contract. Though the equipment being built is customized by the customer, control under these contracts does not pass to the customer until the compressor or flare package is completed and shipped, or, in accordance with a bill and hold arrangements, the customer accepts title and assumes the risk and rewards of ownership. We request some of our customers to make progressive payments as the product is being built; these payments are recorded as a contract liability on the Deferred Income line on the consolidated balance sheet until control has been transferred. These contracts also may include an assurance warranty clause to guarantee the product is free from defects in material and workmanship for a set duration of time; this is a standard industry practice and is not considered a performance obligation.\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts Receivable\nWe perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and adjust credit limits based on management's assessment of the customer's financial condition and payment history, as well as industry conditions and general economic conditions. We continuously monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain a provision for estimated credit losses based upon our historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that we have identified. While such credit losses have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established, we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that we have in the past. Management believes that its allowance for doubtful accounts is adequate; however, actual write-offs may exceed the recorded allowance.\nAccounting for Income Taxes\nAs part of the process of preparing our financial statements, we are required to estimate our federal income taxes as well as income taxes in each of the states in which we operate. This process involves us estimating our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes. These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are included in our consolidated balance sheet. We must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and, to the extent we believe that recovery is not probable, we must establish a valuation allowance. To the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a period, we must include an expense in the tax provision in the statement of income.\nSignificant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes, our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets. We currently have no valuation allowance and fully expect to utilize all of our deferred tax assets.\nASC 740 also prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. In order to record any financial statement benefit, we are required to determine, based on technical merits of the position, whether it is more likely than not (a likelihood of more than 50 percent) that a tax position will be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes. If that step is satisfied, then we must measure the tax position to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements. The tax position is measured at the largest amount of the benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Our policy regarding income tax interest and penalties is to expense those items as other expense.\nLong-Lived Assets, Intangible Assets and Goodwill\nRental Equipment, Property and Equipment (Including Retirement of Rental Equipment)\nRental equipment and property and equipment are recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation, except for work-in-progress on new rental equipment which is recorded at cost until it's complete and added to the fleet. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Our rental equipment has an estimated useful life between 15 and 25 years, while our property and equipment has an estimate useful lives which range from 3 to 39 years. The majority of our property and equipment, including rental equipment, is a direct cost to generating revenue.\nIn January 2019, the Company reviewed the estimated useful lives of its rental equipment. This review indicated that the actual lives of its larger horsepower rental equipment were longer than the estimated useful lives used for depreciation purposes in the Company's financial statements. These units incorporate newer technology and heavier, more robust castings and forging, which allows for complete overhauls at longer cycles when compared to its older, lower horsepower units.\nWe assess the impairment of rental equipment and property and equipment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the net recorded amount may not be recoverable. The following factors could trigger an impairment review: significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future cash flows; significant adverse changes in the extent or manner in which asset (or asset group) is being used or its condition, including a meaningful drop in fleet utilization over the prior four quarters; significant negative industry or company-specific trends or actions, including meaningful capital expenditure budget reductions by our major customers or other sizable exploration and production or midstream companies, as well as significant declines in oil and natural gas prices; legislative changes prohibiting us from leasing our units or flares; or poor general economic conditions. An impairment loss is recognized if the future undiscounted cash flows associated with the asset (or asset group) and the estimated fair value of the asset are less than the asset's carrying value.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has caused a significant economic decline during the first quarter of 2020. In addition, the pandemic and recent actions by Saudi Arabia and Russia have resulted in a significant decline in oil prices during the same time period. If economic and industry conditions do not improve, an impairment review during 2020 could be triggered.\nGoodwill (Including Impairment During 2019)\nGoodwill represents the cost in excess of fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired. Goodwill is tested annually for impairment or as needed upon the occurrence of certain events or substantive changes in circumstances that indicate goodwill is more likely than not impaired. During the third quarter of 2019, the Company examined various qualitative factors to determine if a quantitative goodwill impairment test was needed. As a result of our qualitative assessment, we proceeded to perform our quantitative goodwill impairment analysis, where we used an independent valuation specialist to assist us in determining the fair value of our net assets. In this impairment analysis, the estimated fair value of our net assets was determined utilizing market and income-based approaches. Determining fair value in this analysis required significant judgment, including judgments about appropriate comparable companies, appropriate discount rates and our estimated future cash flows, which are subject to change. As a result of our quantitative evaluation, we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $10.0 million in 2019.\nIntangibles\nAt December 31, 2019 and 2018, NGS had intangible assets, which relate to developed technology and a trade name which was acquired in our acquisition of Screw Compression Systems in January 2005. This asset is not being amortized as it has been deemed to have an indefinite life.\nOur policy is to review intangibles that are being amortized for impairment when indicators of impairment are present. In addition, it is our policy to review indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually or when indicators of impairment are present. We review intangibles through an assessment of the estimated future cash flows related to such assets. In the event that assets are found to be carried at amounts in excess of estimated undiscounted future cash flows, then the assets will be adjusted for impairment to a level commensurate with a discounted cash flow analysis of the underlying assets. Based upon our analysis, we experienced no impairment of intangible assets (excluding goodwill) during the years ended December 31, 2019 or 2018.\nIn addition, in conjunction with our quantitative assessment of goodwill, we used the services of an independent valuation specialist to assist us in determining the fair value of our trade name during the third quarter of 2019. In this impairment analysis, the estimated fair value of our trade name was determined utilizing an income-based approach that required significant judgment, including those about an appropriate royalty rate and discount rate. This analysis indicated no impairment of our trade name.\nInventories\nWe value our total inventory (current and long-term) at the lower of the actual cost and net realizable value of the inventory. We regularly review inventory quantities on hand and record a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based primarily on current and anticipated customer demand and production requirements. The Company accesses anticipated customer demand based on current and upcoming capital expenditure budgets of its major customers as well as other significant companies in the industry, along with oil and natural gas price forecasts and other factors affecting the industry. Given its concerns about the industry backdrop, Company management determined during 2019 that an increase of its inventory allowance was necessary. Due to the slow moving nature or obsolescence of a portion of the Company's long-term inventory and inventory related to the retirement of rental equipment, management recorded an increase of $3.4 million in the inventory allowance reserve for costs that may not be recoverable in the future. Management later identified another $408,000 of slow moving or obsolete inventory, which was written off. For the year ended December 31, 2019, inventory allowance and write-off totaled $3.8 million. We ended 2019 with an inventory allowance balance of $24,000.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has caused a significant economic decline during the first quarter of 2020. In addition, the pandemic and recent actions by Saudi Arabia and Russia have resulted in a significant decline in oil prices during the same time period. If economic and industry conditions do not improve, an additional review of our inventory for excess and obsolete items during 2020 could be necessary.\nOur Performance Trends and Outlook\nOn January 30, 2020, the World Health Organization ( WHO\u201d) announced a global health emergency because of a new strain of coronavirus known as COVID-19 due to the risks it imposes on the international community as the virus spreads globally. In March 2020, the WHO classified the COVID-19 outbreak as a pandemic, based on the rapid increase in exposure globally. During this time, the market began to experience a decline in oil prices in response to oil demand concerns due to the\nglobal economic impacts of COVID-19. In addition, recent events concerning OPEC and Russia resulted in Saudi Arabia significantly discounting the price of its crude oil, as well as Saudi Arabia and Russia significantly increasing their oil supply. These actions have led to significant weakness in oil prices and ensuing reductions of exploration and production company capital and operating budgets.\nAs of March 31, 2020, the full impact of the COVID-19 outbreak continues to evolve daily. With the significant decline in oil prices as well as the general economic decline caused by the impacts of COVID-19, we expect utilization to decline among our smaller horsepower and medium horsepower units during the remainder of 2020 after a minimal decline during the first quarter of 2020. In terms of sales, we expect minimal compressor sales for the year due to much lower capital expenditure budgets throughout the industry, including those of our major customers. Finally, we have recently experienced and expect to continue to experience pricing pressure from our customers and competitors until industry and economic conditions improve. We are currently experiencing no issues with potential workforce and supply chain disruptions. In addition, our relationship with our major customer continues to be strong, and they have continued to pay our invoices in a timely, consistent manner. Nevertheless, if any of these circumstances change, our business could be adversely affected.\nWhile management anticipates that the industry and economic impact of the pandemic and OPEC's actions will have a negative effect on its results of operations in 2020 and perhaps beyond, the degree to which these factors will impact our business remains uncertain. Please read Item 1A, Risk Factors, in this report.\nResults of Operations\nYear Ended December 31, 2019 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2018\nThe table below shows our revenues and percentage of total revenues for each of our product lines for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018.\n\nTotal revenue increased to $78.4 million from $65.5 million, or 19.8%, for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to 2018. This increase was mainly a result of higher rental revenue (18.7% increase) primarily due to a greater number of large horsepower units being rented as well as higher sales revenue (21.5% increase) primarily due to increased compressor sales.\nRental revenue increased to $56.7 million from $47.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to 2018. As of December 31, 2019, we had 2,304 natural gas compressors in our rental fleet, down from 2,567 units at year end 2018 due the retirement of 327 units (with 39,758 horsepower) during the third quarter of 2019. Despite this decrease due to unit retirement, the Company's total unit horsepower increased by 7.7% to 429,650 at December 31, 2019 compared to 398,765 horsepower year end 2018, which reflects the addition of 54 high horsepower compressors with 70,020 horsepower to the Company's fleet during 2019. As of December 31, 2019, we had 1,419 natural gas compressors totaling 299,836 horsepower rented to 95 customers, compared to 1,361 natural gas compressors totaling 230,089 horsepower rented to 94 customers as of December 31, 2018. The rental fleet had a unit utilization as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, of 61.6% and 53.0% while our horsepower utilization for the same periods, respectively, was 69.8% and 57.7%. The rise in both utilizations was mainly the result of the rise in demand for our higher horsepower units as well as unit retirements during the third quarter of 2019.\nSales revenue increased to $19.8 million from $16.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to 2018. This increase in largely attributable to an increase in compressor sales partially offset by a decrease in flare sales. Sales are subject to fluctuations in timing of industry activity related to capital projects and, as such, can vary substantially between periods.\nDuring the third quarter of 2019, the Company examined various qualitative factors to determine if a quantitative goodwill impairment test was needed. After examining various qualitative factors, the Company performed a goodwill impairment analysis as of September 30, 2019. The analysis showed our carrying value of net assets exceeded its fair value, indicating that goodwill was fully impaired. Accordingly, the Company recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $10.0 million during the third quarter of 2019.\nGiven its concerns about the industry backdrop, Company management determined during 2019 that an increase of its inventory allowance was necessary. Due to the slow moving nature or obsolescence of a portion of the Company's long-term inventory and inventory related to the retirement of rental equipment, management recorded an increase of $3.4 million in the inventory allowance reserve for costs that may not be recoverable in the future. Management later identified another $408,000 of slow moving or obsolete inventory, which was written off. For the year ended December 31, 2019, inventory allowance and write-off totaled $3.8 million. We ended 2019 with an inventory allowance balance of $24,000.\nGiven its concerns about the current industry backdrop, Company management determined during the third quarter of 2019 which units were not of the type, configuration, make or model that our customers are demanding or that were not cost efficient to refurbish, maintain and/or operate. As a result of this review, we determined 327 units should be retired from our rental fleet. Accordingly, we recorded a $1.5 million loss on retirement of rental equipment during the year ended December 31, 2019.\nOperating loss increased to $15.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to an operating loss of $0.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase in operating loss was mainly due to the inventory allowance and write-off, loss on the retirement of rental units, and a goodwill impairment charge that totaled $15.3 million, partially offset by higher rental revenues and compressor sales.\nSelling, general, and administrative expenses increased to $10.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to $9.1 million for 2018. This 17.7% increase was primarily the result of increases in officer bonuses ($0.5 million), deferred compensation ($0.4 million, most of which was non-cash), professional services ($0.3 million), and stock compensation ($0.2 million).\nDepreciation and amortization expense increased to $23.3 million from $22.1 million, or 5.4%, for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to 2018. The increase is the result of larger horsepower units being added to the fleet. We added 82 units (approximately 74,000 horsepower) to our fleet over the past twelve months. Fifty-four of those units were 400 horsepower or larger (including 49 at 1,380 horsepower), representing approximately 95% of the horsepower added.\nIncome tax benefit increased to $0.7 million from a $72,000 expense for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to 2018. As shown in Note 9 to these financial statements, our effective tax rate for both years differs from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21%. Our income tax benefit in 2019 was largely due to our net loss of $13.7 million but was largely offset by a difference in goodwill impairment for tax purposes as well as an adjustment to our state tax rates that increased our deferred income tax expense by approximately $0.8 million. The Company's 2018 income tax expense was impacted by the Company discovering a potentially uncertain tax position attributable deductibility of certain executive compensation expense for federal income tax purposes totaling approximately $168,000, $149,000 and $230,000 for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. As a result, in accordance with ASC Topic 740, during the fourth quarter of 2018, the Company recorded a tax adjustment of $547,000 and accrued penalty and interest expense of $55,000 attributable to the uncertain tax position. The Company filed amended tax returns during 2019 for the years ended 2015, 2016 and 2017 and has recognized certain offsetting deductions, thus removing the large majority of its uncertain tax position reserve as of December 31, 2019.\nYear Ended December 31, 2018 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2017\nThe table below shows our revenue and percentage of total revenues for each of our product lines for the years ended December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017.\n\nTotal revenue decreased to $65.5 million from $67.7 million, or 3.3%, for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to 2017. This was the result of a 19.5% decrease in sales revenue, which was offset by a 3.7% increase in rental revenue and a 0.3% increase in service and maintenance revenue.\nRental revenue increased to $47.8 million from $46.0 million, or 3.7%, for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to 2017. This increase is due to an increase in the average oil and natural prices for the year ended December 31, 2018, resulting in units being deployed, as well as a rise in the demand for our higher horsepower units. As of December 31, 2018, we had 2,572 natural gas compressors in our rental fleet totaling 398,765 horsepower, as compared to 2,546 natural gas compressors totaling 369,961 horsepower as of December 31, 2017. As of December 31, 2018, we had 1,361 natural gas compressors totaling 230,089 horsepower rented to 94 customers, compared to 1,259 natural gas compressors totaling 184,382 horsepower rented to 87 customers as of December 31, 2017. The rental fleet had a utilization of 53.0% as of December 31, 2018 as compared to 49.5% at December 31, 2017.\nSales revenue decreased to $16.3 million from $20.2 million, or 19.5%, for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to 2017. Our sales activity can fluctuate depending on the demand from our customers' investments in non-conventional shale plays which require compression for producing natural gas and scheduling of projects in our fabrication facility. Due to economic uncertainty and continued tight credit markets, the energy industry continued to encounter reduced capital spending. While our strategy is to maintain our rental revenues so that they are a larger component of total revenue, we will continue to build and sell custom fabricated equipment. In support of this, we intend to cultivate new sales oriented customers and are actively pursuing small, medium and large reciprocating compressor fabrication projects, as well as, building rotary screw-type equipment of any size. Sales include: (1) compressor unit sales, (2) flare sales, (3) parts sales and (4) compressor rebuilds.\nOperating income of $1.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 decreased to a $0.5 million loss for the year ended December 31, 2018. This decrease is attributed to a 6.4% drop in our rental margins, due to costs incurred in deploying units.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2018, management performed a review of our rental compressor units and determined there were 13 units fully depreciated in our rental fleet which needed to be retired, representing total horsepower of 1,360.\nSelling, general, and administrative expenses decreased to $9.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to $10.1 million for 2017. This 9.8% decrease is primarily a result in a decrease in stock compensation of $1.7 million.\nDepreciation and amortization expense increased to $22.1 million from $21.3 million, or 3.6%, for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to 2017. The increase is the result of larger horsepower units being added to the fleet. We added 31 units (approximately 29,508 horsepower) to our fleet over the past twelve months. Twenty-seven of these were 400 horsepower or larger, representing 99% of the horsepower added.\nIncome tax expense decreased to $72,000 from a $18.3 million benefit for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 2017. As discussed in Note 9 to these financial statements, during the fourth quarter of 2018, the Company discovered a potentially uncertain tax position attributable deductibility of certain executive compensation expense for federal income tax purposes aggregating approximately $168,000, $149,000, $230,000 for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. As a result, in accordance with ASC Topic 740, during the fourth quarter of 2018, the Company recorded a tax adjustment of $547,000 and accrued penalty and interest expense of $55,000 attributable to the uncertain tax position. In 2017, the $18.3 million tax benefit was the result of the $18.4 million income tax benefit recorded in connection with the 2017 Tax Act, due to the remeasurement of our deferred tax assets and liabilities at the new federal statutory rate.\nAdjusted Gross Margin Year Ended December 31, 2019 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2018\nThe table below shows our adjusted gross margin and related percentages for each of our product lines for the years ended December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018. Adjusted gross margin is the difference between revenue and cost of revenues, exclusive of depreciation and amortization expense.\n\n(1) For a reconciliation of adjusted gross margin to its most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, please read \"Item 6. Selected Financial Data - Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" in this Report.\nOur overall adjusted gross margin percentage dropped to 43.5% for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to 46.8% for the year ended December 31, 2018, exclusive of depreciation and amortization. Our drop in gross margins is mainly due to a 2.8% drop in rental revenue margins, which decreased to 51.4% for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to 54.2% during 2018. This decrease was due to an increased bad debt allowance as well as increased maintenance and repair costs, particularly \"make-ready\" jobs on units being placed back into service. Sales margin decreased to 18.5% in 2019 from 22.8% in 2018 due to higher payroll and lower labor and overhead efficiency in our fabrication facilities. Third party service and maintenance margins decreased to 68.2% from 73.3% for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to 2018. Service and maintenance only represents 2.5% of our revenue in 2019, providing minimal impact on our overall adjusted gross margin.\nAdjusted Gross Margin Year Ended December 31, 2018 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2017\nThe table below shows our adjusted gross margin and related percentages for each of our product lines for the years ended December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017. Adjusted gross margin is the difference between revenue and cost of revenues, exclusive of depreciation and amortization expense.\n\n(1) For a reconciliation of adjusted gross margin to its most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, please read \"Item 6. Selected Financial Data - Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" in this Report.\nThe overall adjusted gross margin percentage dropped to 46.8% for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 49.0% for the year ended December 31, 2017, exclusive of depreciation and amortization. Our drop in gross margins is mainly due to the drop in rental revenue margins due to costs incurred in deploying units. Rental margins decreased to 54.2% for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 60.6% during 2017 . Sales margin increased to 22.8% from 20.7% for the year ended 2018 compared to 2017. Third party service and maintenance margins decreased to 73.3% for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 74.3% in 2017. Service and maintenance represents 2.2% of our revenue in 2018, providing minimal impact on our overall adjusted gross margin.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur working capital positions as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 are set forth below.\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, we invested approximately $69.9 million in rental equipment, property and other equipment. During the year, the Company added $63.7 million in new equipment to our rental fleet, $3.8 million in payments related to the construction of our new corporate office, and $2.4 million in vehicles, office furniture and equipment. Our investment in property and equipment includes any changes to work-in-progress related to our rental fleet jobs at the beginning of the year compared to the end of the year. Our rental work-in-progress decreased by $2.7 million during 2019. We financed our investment in rental equipment, property and other equipment with cash on hand during 2019.\nCash flows\nAt December 31, 2019, we had cash and cash equivalents of $11.6 million compared to $52.6 million at year end 2018. Our cash flow from operations of $29.4 million was offset by capital expenditures of $69.9 million during 2019. We also had working capital of $36.9 million at December 31, 2019 compared to $84.0 million at December 31, 2018. On December 31, 2019 and 2018, we had outstanding debt of $417,000, which is all related to our line of credit. We had net cash flow from operating activities of $29.4 million during 2019 compared $23.7 million during 2018. Our cash flow from operating activities of $29.4 million was primarily the result adding back non-cash items of depreciation of $23.3 million, a goodwill impairment charge of $10.0 million, an increased inventory allowance and write-off of $3.8 million, stock-based compensation of $2.6 million, a loss on retirement of rental equipment of $1.5 million, a bad debt allowance of $0.7 million, and a net positive change in working capital and various other items of $2.1 million. These positive impacts were partially offset by a net loss of $13.9 million and a decrease in cash flows related to a reduction in deferred income taxes of $0.7 million.\nAt December 31, 2018, we had cash and cash equivalents of $52.6 million, working capital of $84.0 million and total debt of $417,000, under our credit agreement which is due in 2020. Our cash and cash equivalents decreased from 2017, due to an increase on our capital program for contracted new large horsepower compressor builds and the construction of our new corporate office. We had positive net cash flow from operating activities of approximately $23.7 million during 2018. This was primarily from a net loss of $0.5 million and non-cash items of depreciation and amortization of $22.1 million, $2.6 million related to stock-based compensation, a decrease in deferred income taxes of $0.3 million and a decrease in cash flows related to working capital and other items of $0.2 million.\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nWe have contractual obligations and commitments that affect our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. The following table is a summary of our significant cash contractual obligations (in thousands):\n\nThe Company also has a remaining contractual obligation related to the construction of a new corporate office of approximately $375,000, which we intend to finance with cash on hand. Construction of a new office began in late 2017 and was completed in 2019.\nSenior Bank Borrowings\nWe have a senior secured revolving credit agreement the (\"Amended Credit Agreement\") with JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A (the \"Lender\") with an aggregate commitment of $30 million, subject to collateral availability. We also have a right to request from the Lender, on an uncommitted basis, an increase of up to $20 million on the aggregate commitment (which could potentially increase the commitment amount to $50 million).\nBorrowing Base. At any time before the maturity of the Amended Credit Agreement, we may draw, repay and re-borrow amounts available under the borrowing base up to the maximum aggregate availability discussed above. Generally, the borrowing base equals the sum of (a) 80% of our eligible accounts receivable plus (b) 50% of the book value of our eligible general inventory (not to exceed 50% of the commitment amount at the time) plus (c) 75% of the book value of our eligible equipment inventory. JPMorgan Chase Bank (the Lender\u201d) may adjust the borrowing base components if material deviations in the collateral are discovered in future audits of the collateral.\nInterest and Fees. Under the terms of the Amended Credit Agreement, we have the option of selecting the applicable variable rate for each revolving loan, or portion thereof, of either (a) LIBOR multiplied by the Statutory Reserve Rate (as defined in the Amended Credit Agreement), with respect to this rate, for Eurocurrency funding, plus the Applicable Margin ( LIBOR-based\u201d), or (b) CB Floating Rate, which is the Lender's Prime Rate less the Applicable Margin; provided, however, that no more than three LIBOR-based borrowings under the agreement may be outstanding at any one time. For purposes of the LIBOR-based interest rate, the Applicable Margin is 1.50%. For purposes of the CB Floating Rate, the Applicable Margin is 1.25%. Accrued interest is payable monthly on outstanding principal amounts, provided that accrued interest on LIBOR-based loans is payable at the end of each interest period, but in no event less frequently than quarterly. In addition, fees and expenses are payable in connection with our requests for letters of credit (generally equal to the Applicable Margin for LIBOR-related borrowings multiplied by the face amount of the requested letter of credit) and administrative and legal costs.\nMaturity. The maturity date of the Amended Credit Agreement is December 31, 2020, at which time all amounts borrowed under the agreement will be due and outstanding letters of credit must be cash collateralized. The agreement may be terminated early upon our request or the occurrence of an event of default.\nSecurity. The obligations under the Amended Credit Agreement are secured by a first priority lien on all of our inventory and accounts and leases receivables, along with a first priority lien on a variable number of our leased compressor equipment the book value of must be maintained at a minimum of 2.00 to 1.00 commitment coverage ratio (such ratio being equal to (i) the amount of the borrowing base as of such date to (ii) the amount of the commitment as of such date.)\nCovenants. The Amended Credit Agreement contains customary representations and warranties, as well as covenants which, among other things, limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness and liens; enter into transactions with affiliates; make acquisitions in excess of certain amounts; pay dividends; redeem or repurchase capital stock or senior notes; make investments or loans; make negative pledges; consolidate, merge or effect asset sales; or change the nature of our business. In addition, we also have certain financial covenants that require us to maintain a leverage ratio less than or equal to 2.50 to 1.00 as of the last day of each fiscal quarter.\nEvents of Default and Acceleration. The Amended Credit Agreement contains customary events of default for credit facilities of this size and type, and includes, without limitation, payment defaults; defaults in performance of covenants or other agreements contained in the transaction documents; inaccuracies in representations and warranties; certain defaults, termination events or\nsimilar events; certain defaults with respect to any other Company indebtedness in excess of $50,000; certain bankruptcy or insolvency events; the rendering of certain judgments in excess of $150,000; certain ERISA events; certain change in control events and the defectiveness of any liens under the secured revolving credit agreement. Obligations under the Amended Credit Agreement may be accelerated upon the occurrence of an event of default.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we were in compliance with all covenants in our Amended Credit Agreement. A default under our Amended Credit Agreement could trigger the acceleration of our bank debt so that it is immediately due and payable. Such default would have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, financial position and operations if we were to borrow a significant amount under our facility.\nComponents of Our Principal Capital Expenditures\nCapital expenditures for the three years ended December 31:\n\nThe level of our expenditures will vary in future periods depending on energy market conditions and other related economic factors. Based upon existing economic and market conditions, we believe that our cash on hand, operating cash flow and available line of credit are adequate to fully fund our net capital expenditures requirements for 2020. We also believe we have flexibility with respect to our financing alternatives and adjustments to our capital expenditure plans if circumstances warrant. We do not have any material continuing commitments related to our current operations that cannot be met with our cash on hand and our line of credit. However, our financing capacity could be negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Please see Note 19 of our Consolidated Financial Statements and Item 1A, Risk Factors, of this report.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nFrom time-to-time, we enter into off-balance sheet arrangements and transactions that can give rise to off-balance sheet obligations. As of December 31, 2019, we have an off-balance sheet arrangement and transaction. We do not believe that this arrangement is reasonably likely to materially affect our liquidity or availability of, or requirements for, capital resources.\nWe entered into a purchase agreement with a vendor in July 2008 pursuant to which we agreed to purchase up to $4.8 million of our paint and coating requirements exclusively from the vendor. In connection with the execution of the agreement, the vendor paid us a $300,000 fee which is considered to be a discount toward future purchases from the vendor. As of December 31, 2019, we had met $4.1 million of this obligation. The $300,000 payment we received is recorded as a long-term liability and will decrease as the purchase commitment is fulfilled. The long-term liability remaining as of December 31, 2019 was $41,000.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements on page.\nEnvironmental Regulations\nVarious federal, state and local laws and regulations covering the discharge of materials into the environment, or otherwise relating to protection of human safety and health and the environment, affect our operations and costs. Compliance with these laws and regulations could cause us to incur remediation or other corrective action costs or result in the assessment of administrative, civil and criminal penalties and the issuance of injunctions delaying or prohibiting operations. In addition, we have acquired certain properties and plant facilities from third parties whose actions with respect to the management and disposal or release of hydrocarbons or other wastes were not under our control. Under environmental laws and regulations, we could be required to remove or remediate wastes disposed of or released by prior owners. In addition, we could be responsible under environmental laws and regulations for properties and plant facilities we lease, but do not own. Compliance with such laws and regulations increases our overall cost of business, but has not had a material adverse effect on our operations or financial condition. It is not anticipated, based on current laws and regulations, that we will be required in the near future to expend amounts that are material in relation to our total expenditure budget in order to comply with environmental laws and regulations but such laws and regulations are frequently changed and we are unable to predict the ultimate cost of\ncompliance. We also could incur costs related to the cleanup of sites to which we send equipment and for damages to natural resources or other claims related to releases of regulated substances at such sites.", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion is intended to assist you in understanding our financial position and results of operations for each of the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017. You should read the following discussion and analysis in conjunction with our audited financial statements and the related notes.\nThe following discussion contains forward-looking statements. For a description of limitations inherent in forward-looking statements, see Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d on page ii.\nOverview\nWe fabricate, manufacture, rent and sell natural gas compressors and related equipment. Our primary focus is on the rental of natural gas compressors. Our rental contracts generally provide for initial terms of six to 60 months, with our larger horsepower units having longer initial terms. After the initial term of our rental contracts, most of our customers have continued to rent our compressors on a month-to-month basis. Rental amounts are billed monthly in advance and include maintenance of the rented compressors. As of December 31, 2019, we had 1,419 natural gas compressors totaling 299,836 horsepower rented to 95 customers, compared to 1,361 natural gas compressors totaling 230,089 horsepower rented to 94 customers at December 31, 2018. Of the 1,419 compressors rented at December 31, 2019, 953 were rented on a month-to-month basis.\nWe also fabricate natural gas compressors for sale to our customers, designing compressors to meet unique specifications dictated by well pressures, production characteristics and particular applications for which compression is sought. Fabrication of compressors involves our purchase of engines, compressors, coolers and other components, and our assembling of these components on skids for delivery to customer locations. These major components of our compressors are acquired through periodic purchase orders placed with third-party suppliers on an as needed\u201d basis, which presently requires a two to three month lead time with delivery dates scheduled to coincide with our estimated production schedules. Although we do not have formal continuing supply contracts with any major supplier, we believe we have adequate alternative sources available. In the past, we have not experienced any sudden and dramatic increases in the prices of the major components for our compressors; however, the occurrence of such an event could have a material adverse effect on the results of our operations and financial condition, particularly if we were unable to increase our rental rates and sales prices proportionate to any such component price increases.\nWe also manufacture a line of compressor frames, cylinders and parts, known as our CiP (Cylinder-in-Plane) product line. We use finished CiP component products in the fabrication of compressor units for sale or rental by us or sell the finished component products to other compressor fabricators. We also design, fabricate, sell, install and service flare stacks and related ignition and control devices for onshore and offshore incineration of gas compounds such as hydrogen sulfide, carbon dioxide, natural gas and liquefied petroleum gases. To provide customer support for our compressor and flare sales businesses, we stock\nvarying levels of replacement parts at our Midland, Texas facility and at field service locations. We also provide an exchange and rebuild program for screw compressors and maintain an inventory of new and used compressors to facilitate this business.\nWe provide service and maintenance to our non-rental customers under written maintenance contracts or on an as-required basis in the absence of a service contract. Maintenance agreements typically have terms of six months to one year and require payment of a monthly fee.\nThe following table sets forth our revenues from each of our three operating categories for the periods presented:\nTable 10: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Rental </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>56,701 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>47,766 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>46,046 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Sales </td> <td> </td> <td>19,763 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16,269 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>20,208 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Service and maintenance </td> <td> </td> <td>1,980 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,443 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,439 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>78,444 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>65,478 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>67,693 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur strategy for growth is focused on our compressor rental business. Margins, exclusive of depreciation and amortization, for our rental business historically run in the mid-50% to low-60% range, while margins for the compressor sales business tend to be in the mid-20% range. If our rental business grows and contributes a larger percentage of our total revenues, we expect our overall company-wide margins, exclusive of depreciation and amortization, to improve over time.\nThe oil and natural gas equipment rental and services industry is cyclical in nature. The most critical factor in assessing the outlook for the industry is the worldwide supply and demand for oil and natural gas and the corresponding changes in commodity prices. As demand and prices increase, oil and natural gas producers typically increase their capital expenditures for drilling, development and production activities, although recent equity capital constraints and demands from institutional investors to keep spending within operating cash flow have meaningfully restrained capital expenditure budgets of domestic exploration and production companies. Generally, increased capital expenditures ultimately result in greater revenues and profits for service and equipment companies.\nIn general, we expect our overall business activity and revenues to track the level of activity in the oil and natural gas industry, with changes in crude oil and condensate production and consumption levels and prices affecting our business more than changes in domestic natural gas production and consumption levels and prices. In recent years we have increased our rental and sales in unconventional oil shale plays, which are more dependent on crude oil prices. With this shift towards oil production the demand for overall compression services and products is driven by two general factors; an increased focus by producers on artificial lift applications, e.g., production enhancement with compression assisted gas lift; and declining reservoir pressure in maturing natural gas producing fields, especially non-conventional production. These types of applications have historically been serviced by wellhead size compressors, and continue to be, but there has also been an economic move by our customers towards centralized drilling and production facilities, which have increased the market need for larger horsepower compressor packages. We recognized this need over the past two to three years and have shifted our cash and fabrication resources towards designing, fabricating and renting gas compressor packages that range from 400 horsepower up to 1,380 horsepower. While this is a response to market conditions and trends, it also provides us with the opportunity to compete as a full-line compression provider.\nWe typically experience a decline in demand during periods of low crude oil and natural gas prices. Low crude oil and natural gas prices experienced throughout 2016 continued into mid-2017. In the latter half of 2017, we saw an increase in oil prices and activity that continued during most of 2018. During 2019, we witnessed a moderation of crude oil prices as well as drilling and completion activity levels. During the first quarter of 2020, we saw a substantial decline in the prices for oil and natural gas. Activity levels of exploration and production companies have been and will be dependent not only on commodity prices, but also on their ability to generate sufficient operational cash flow to fund their activities. Generally, though, we feel that production activities (in which we are involved) will fare better than drilling activity. .\nFor fiscal year 2020, our forecasted capital expenditures will be directly dependent upon our customers' compression requirements and are not anticipated to exceed our internally generated cash flows. Any required capital will be for additions to our compressor rental fleet and/or addition or replacement of service vehicles. We believe that cash on hand and cash flows from operations will be sufficient to satisfy our capital and liquidity requirements through 2020. If we require additional capital to fund any significant unanticipated expenditures, including any material acquisitions of other businesses, joint ventures or\nother opportunities, this additional capital could exceed our current resources, might not be available to us when we need it, or might not be on acceptable terms.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Practices\nWe have identified the policies below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations. In the ordinary course of business, we have made a number of estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting of results of operations and financial condition in the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates under different assumptions and conditions. We believe that the following discussion addresses our most critical accounting policies, which are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require our most difficult, subjective, and complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. We describe our significant accounting policies more fully in Note 2 (\"Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\") to our consolidated financial statements.\nOur critical accounting policies are as follows:\n\u2022revenue recognition;\n\u2022estimating the allowance for doubtful accounts receivable;\n\u2022accounting for operating leases;\n\u2022accounting for income taxes;\n\u2022accounting for long-lived assets, intangible assets and goodwill; and\n\u2022accounting for inventory.\nRevenue Recognition Policy\nThe Company adopted ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (\"ASC 606\") on January, 1, 2018. As a result, the Company has changed its accounting policy for revenue recognition as detailed below.\nRevenue is measured based on a consideration specified in a customer's contract, excluding any sale incentives and taxes collected on behalf of third parties (i.e. sales and property taxes). We recognize revenue once a performance obligation has been satisfied and control over a product or service has transferred to the customer. Shipping and handling costs incurred are accounted for as fulfillment costs and are included in cost of revenues in our Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nNature of Goods and Services\nRental Revenue. The Company generates revenue from renting compressors and flare systems to our customers. These contracts may also include a fee for servicing the compressor or flare during the rental contract. Our rental contracts typically range from six to 60 months, with our larger horsepower compressors having longer minimum contract terms. Our rental revenue is recognized over time, with equal monthly payments over the term of the contract. After the terms of the contract have expired, a customer may renew their contract or continue renting on a monthly basis thereafter.\nSales Revenue. The Company generates revenue by the sale of custom/fabricated compressors, flare systems and parts, as well as, exchange/rebuilding customer owned compressors and sale of used rental equipment. The Company designs and fabricates compressors and flares based on the customer's specifications outlined in their contract. Though the equipment being built is customized by the customer, control under these contracts does not pass to the customer until the compressor or flare package is completed and shipped, or, in accordance with a bill and hold arrangements, the customer accepts title and assumes the risk and rewards of ownership. We request some of our customers to make progressive payments as the product is being built; these payments are recorded as a contract liability on the Deferred Income line on the consolidated balance sheet until control has been transferred. These contracts also may include an assurance warranty clause to guarantee the product is free from defects in material and workmanship for a set duration of time; this is a standard industry practice and is not considered a performance obligation.\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts Receivable\nWe perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and adjust credit limits based on management's assessment of the customer's financial condition and payment history, as well as industry conditions and general economic conditions. We continuously monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain a provision for estimated credit losses based upon our historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that we have identified. While such credit losses have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established, we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that we have in the past. Management believes that its allowance for doubtful accounts is adequate; however, actual write-offs may exceed the recorded allowance.\nAccounting for Income Taxes\nAs part of the process of preparing our financial statements, we are required to estimate our federal income taxes as well as income taxes in each of the states in which we operate. This process involves us estimating our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes. These differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities, which are included in our consolidated balance sheet. We must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and, to the extent we believe that recovery is not probable, we must establish a valuation allowance. To the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a period, we must include an expense in the tax provision in the statement of income.\nSignificant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes, our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets. We currently have no valuation allowance and fully expect to utilize all of our deferred tax assets.\nASC 740 also prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. In order to record any financial statement benefit, we are required to determine, based on technical merits of the position, whether it is more likely than not (a likelihood of more than 50 percent) that a tax position will be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes. If that step is satisfied, then we must measure the tax position to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements. The tax position is measured at the largest amount of the benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Our policy regarding income tax interest and penalties is to expense those items as other expense.\nLong-Lived Assets, Intangible Assets and Goodwill\nRental Equipment, Property and Equipment (Including Retirement of Rental Equipment)\nRental equipment and property and equipment are recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation, except for work-in-progress on new rental equipment which is recorded at cost until it's complete and added to the fleet. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Our rental equipment has an estimated useful life between 15 and 25 years, while our property and equipment has an estimate useful lives which range from 3 to 39 years. The majority of our property and equipment, including rental equipment, is a direct cost to generating revenue.\nIn January 2019, the Company reviewed the estimated useful lives of its rental equipment. This review indicated that the actual lives of its larger horsepower rental equipment were longer than the estimated useful lives used for depreciation purposes in the Company's financial statements. These units incorporate newer technology and heavier, more robust castings and forging, which allows for complete overhauls at longer cycles when compared to its older, lower horsepower units.\nWe assess the impairment of rental equipment and property and equipment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the net recorded amount may not be recoverable. The following factors could trigger an impairment review: significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future cash flows; significant adverse changes in the extent or manner in which asset (or asset group) is being used or its condition, including a meaningful drop in fleet utilization over the prior four quarters; significant negative industry or company-specific trends or actions, including meaningful capital expenditure budget reductions by our major customers or other sizable exploration and production or midstream companies, as well as significant declines in oil and natural gas prices; legislative changes prohibiting us from leasing our units or flares; or poor general economic conditions. An impairment loss is recognized if the future undiscounted cash flows associated with the asset (or asset group) and the estimated fair value of the asset are less than the asset's carrying value.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has caused a significant economic decline during the first quarter of 2020. In addition, the pandemic and recent actions by Saudi Arabia and Russia have resulted in a significant decline in oil prices during the same time period. If economic and industry conditions do not improve, an impairment review during 2020 could be triggered.\nGoodwill (Including Impairment During 2019)\nGoodwill represents the cost in excess of fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired. Goodwill is tested annually for impairment or as needed upon the occurrence of certain events or substantive changes in circumstances that indicate goodwill is more likely than not impaired. During the third quarter of 2019, the Company examined various qualitative factors to determine if a quantitative goodwill impairment test was needed. As a result of our qualitative assessment, we proceeded to perform our quantitative goodwill impairment analysis, where we used an independent valuation specialist to assist us in determining the fair value of our net assets. In this impairment analysis, the estimated fair value of our net assets was determined utilizing market and income-based approaches. Determining fair value in this analysis required significant judgment, including judgments about appropriate comparable companies, appropriate discount rates and our estimated future cash flows, which are subject to change. As a result of our quantitative evaluation, we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $10.0 million in 2019.\nIntangibles\nAt December 31, 2019 and 2018, NGS had intangible assets, which relate to developed technology and a trade name which was acquired in our acquisition of Screw Compression Systems in January 2005. This asset is not being amortized as it has been deemed to have an indefinite life.\nOur policy is to review intangibles that are being amortized for impairment when indicators of impairment are present. In addition, it is our policy to review indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually or when indicators of impairment are present. We review intangibles through an assessment of the estimated future cash flows related to such assets. In the event that assets are found to be carried at amounts in excess of estimated undiscounted future cash flows, then the assets will be adjusted for impairment to a level commensurate with a discounted cash flow analysis of the underlying assets. Based upon our analysis, we experienced no impairment of intangible assets (excluding goodwill) during the years ended December 31, 2019 or 2018.\nIn addition, in conjunction with our quantitative assessment of goodwill, we used the services of an independent valuation specialist to assist us in determining the fair value of our trade name during the third quarter of 2019. In this impairment analysis, the estimated fair value of our trade name was determined utilizing an income-based approach that required significant judgment, including those about an appropriate royalty rate and discount rate. This analysis indicated no impairment of our trade name.\nInventories\nWe value our total inventory (current and long-term) at the lower of the actual cost and net realizable value of the inventory. We regularly review inventory quantities on hand and record a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based primarily on current and anticipated customer demand and production requirements. The Company accesses anticipated customer demand based on current and upcoming capital expenditure budgets of its major customers as well as other significant companies in the industry, along with oil and natural gas price forecasts and other factors affecting the industry. Given its concerns about the industry backdrop, Company management determined during 2019 that an increase of its inventory allowance was necessary. Due to the slow moving nature or obsolescence of a portion of the Company's long-term inventory and inventory related to the retirement of rental equipment, management recorded an increase of $3.4 million in the inventory allowance reserve for costs that may not be recoverable in the future. Management later identified another $408,000 of slow moving or obsolete inventory, which was written off. For the year ended December 31, 2019, inventory allowance and write-off totaled $3.8 million. We ended 2019 with an inventory allowance balance of $24,000.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has caused a significant economic decline during the first quarter of 2020. In addition, the pandemic and recent actions by Saudi Arabia and Russia have resulted in a significant decline in oil prices during the same time period. If economic and industry conditions do not improve, an additional review of our inventory for excess and obsolete items during 2020 could be necessary.\nOur Performance Trends and Outlook\nOn January 30, 2020, the World Health Organization ( WHO\u201d) announced a global health emergency because of a new strain of coronavirus known as COVID-19 due to the risks it imposes on the international community as the virus spreads globally. In March 2020, the WHO classified the COVID-19 outbreak as a pandemic, based on the rapid increase in exposure globally. During this time, the market began to experience a decline in oil prices in response to oil demand concerns due to the\nglobal economic impacts of COVID-19. In addition, recent events concerning OPEC and Russia resulted in Saudi Arabia significantly discounting the price of its crude oil, as well as Saudi Arabia and Russia significantly increasing their oil supply. These actions have led to significant weakness in oil prices and ensuing reductions of exploration and production company capital and operating budgets.\nAs of March 31, 2020, the full impact of the COVID-19 outbreak continues to evolve daily. With the significant decline in oil prices as well as the general economic decline caused by the impacts of COVID-19, we expect utilization to decline among our smaller horsepower and medium horsepower units during the remainder of 2020 after a minimal decline during the first quarter of 2020. In terms of sales, we expect minimal compressor sales for the year due to much lower capital expenditure budgets throughout the industry, including those of our major customers. Finally, we have recently experienced and expect to continue to experience pricing pressure from our customers and competitors until industry and economic conditions improve. We are currently experiencing no issues with potential workforce and supply chain disruptions. In addition, our relationship with our major customer continues to be strong, and they have continued to pay our invoices in a timely, consistent manner. Nevertheless, if any of these circumstances change, our business could be adversely affected.\nWhile management anticipates that the industry and economic impact of the pandemic and OPEC's actions will have a negative effect on its results of operations in 2020 and perhaps beyond, the degree to which these factors will impact our business remains uncertain. Please read Item 1A, Risk Factors, in this report.\nResults of Operations\nYear Ended December 31, 2019 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2018\nThe table below shows our revenues and percentage of total revenues for each of our product lines for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018.\nTable 11: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Revenue </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(dollars in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Rental </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>56,701 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>72.3 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>47,766 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>73.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Sales </td> <td> </td> <td>19,763 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>25.2 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>16,269 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>24.8 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Service & Maintenance </td> <td> </td> <td>1,980 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.5 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>1,443 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.2 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>78,444 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>65,478 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTotal revenue increased to $78.4 million from $65.5 million, or 19.8%, for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to 2018. This increase was mainly a result of higher rental revenue (18.7% increase) primarily due to a greater number of large horsepower units being rented as well as higher sales revenue (21.5% increase) primarily due to increased compressor sales.\nRental revenue increased to $56.7 million from $47.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to 2018. As of December 31, 2019, we had 2,304 natural gas compressors in our rental fleet, down from 2,567 units at year end 2018 due the retirement of 327 units (with 39,758 horsepower) during the third quarter of 2019. Despite this decrease due to unit retirement, the Company's total unit horsepower increased by 7.7% to 429,650 at December 31, 2019 compared to 398,765 horsepower year end 2018, which reflects the addition of 54 high horsepower compressors with 70,020 horsepower to the Company's fleet during 2019. As of December 31, 2019, we had 1,419 natural gas compressors totaling 299,836 horsepower rented to 95 customers, compared to 1,361 natural gas compressors totaling 230,089 horsepower rented to 94 customers as of December 31, 2018. The rental fleet had a unit utilization as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, of 61.6% and 53.0% while our horsepower utilization for the same periods, respectively, was 69.8% and 57.7%. The rise in both utilizations was mainly the result of the rise in demand for our higher horsepower units as well as unit retirements during the third quarter of 2019.\nSales revenue increased to $19.8 million from $16.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to 2018. This increase in largely attributable to an increase in compressor sales partially offset by a decrease in flare sales. Sales are subject to fluctuations in timing of industry activity related to capital projects and, as such, can vary substantially between periods.\nDuring the third quarter of 2019, the Company examined various qualitative factors to determine if a quantitative goodwill impairment test was needed. After examining various qualitative factors, the Company performed a goodwill impairment analysis as of September 30, 2019. The analysis showed our carrying value of net assets exceeded its fair value, indicating that goodwill was fully impaired. Accordingly, the Company recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $10.0 million during the third quarter of 2019.\nGiven its concerns about the industry backdrop, Company management determined during 2019 that an increase of its inventory allowance was necessary. Due to the slow moving nature or obsolescence of a portion of the Company's long-term inventory and inventory related to the retirement of rental equipment, management recorded an increase of $3.4 million in the inventory allowance reserve for costs that may not be recoverable in the future. Management later identified another $408,000 of slow moving or obsolete inventory, which was written off. For the year ended December 31, 2019, inventory allowance and write-off totaled $3.8 million. We ended 2019 with an inventory allowance balance of $24,000.\nGiven its concerns about the current industry backdrop, Company management determined during the third quarter of 2019 which units were not of the type, configuration, make or model that our customers are demanding or that were not cost efficient to refurbish, maintain and/or operate. As a result of this review, we determined 327 units should be retired from our rental fleet. Accordingly, we recorded a $1.5 million loss on retirement of rental equipment during the year ended December 31, 2019.\nOperating loss increased to $15.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to an operating loss of $0.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase in operating loss was mainly due to the inventory allowance and write-off, loss on the retirement of rental units, and a goodwill impairment charge that totaled $15.3 million, partially offset by higher rental revenues and compressor sales.\nSelling, general, and administrative expenses increased to $10.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to $9.1 million for 2018. This 17.7% increase was primarily the result of increases in officer bonuses ($0.5 million), deferred compensation ($0.4 million, most of which was non-cash), professional services ($0.3 million), and stock compensation ($0.2 million).\nDepreciation and amortization expense increased to $23.3 million from $22.1 million, or 5.4%, for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to 2018. The increase is the result of larger horsepower units being added to the fleet. We added 82 units (approximately 74,000 horsepower) to our fleet over the past twelve months. Fifty-four of those units were 400 horsepower or larger (including 49 at 1,380 horsepower), representing approximately 95% of the horsepower added.\nIncome tax benefit increased to $0.7 million from a $72,000 expense for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to 2018. As shown in Note 9 to these financial statements, our effective tax rate for both years differs from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21%. Our income tax benefit in 2019 was largely due to our net loss of $13.7 million but was largely offset by a difference in goodwill impairment for tax purposes as well as an adjustment to our state tax rates that increased our deferred income tax expense by approximately $0.8 million. The Company's 2018 income tax expense was impacted by the Company discovering a potentially uncertain tax position attributable deductibility of certain executive compensation expense for federal income tax purposes totaling approximately $168,000, $149,000 and $230,000 for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. As a result, in accordance with ASC Topic 740, during the fourth quarter of 2018, the Company recorded a tax adjustment of $547,000 and accrued penalty and interest expense of $55,000 attributable to the uncertain tax position. The Company filed amended tax returns during 2019 for the years ended 2015, 2016 and 2017 and has recognized certain offsetting deductions, thus removing the large majority of its uncertain tax position reserve as of December 31, 2019.\nYear Ended December 31, 2018 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2017\nThe table below shows our revenue and percentage of total revenues for each of our product lines for the years ended December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017.\nTable 12: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Revenue </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(dollars in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Rental </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>47,766 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>73.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>46,046 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>68.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Sales </td> <td> </td> <td>16,269 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>24.8 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>20,208 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>29.9 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Service & Maintenance </td> <td> </td> <td>1,443 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.2 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>1,439 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.1 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>65,478 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>. </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>67,693 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTotal revenue decreased to $65.5 million from $67.7 million, or 3.3%, for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to 2017. This was the result of a 19.5% decrease in sales revenue, which was offset by a 3.7% increase in rental revenue and a 0.3% increase in service and maintenance revenue.\nRental revenue increased to $47.8 million from $46.0 million, or 3.7%, for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to 2017. This increase is due to an increase in the average oil and natural prices for the year ended December 31, 2018, resulting in units being deployed, as well as a rise in the demand for our higher horsepower units. As of December 31, 2018, we had 2,572 natural gas compressors in our rental fleet totaling 398,765 horsepower, as compared to 2,546 natural gas compressors totaling 369,961 horsepower as of December 31, 2017. As of December 31, 2018, we had 1,361 natural gas compressors totaling 230,089 horsepower rented to 94 customers, compared to 1,259 natural gas compressors totaling 184,382 horsepower rented to 87 customers as of December 31, 2017. The rental fleet had a utilization of 53.0% as of December 31, 2018 as compared to 49.5% at December 31, 2017.\nSales revenue decreased to $16.3 million from $20.2 million, or 19.5%, for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to 2017. Our sales activity can fluctuate depending on the demand from our customers' investments in non-conventional shale plays which require compression for producing natural gas and scheduling of projects in our fabrication facility. Due to economic uncertainty and continued tight credit markets, the energy industry continued to encounter reduced capital spending. While our strategy is to maintain our rental revenues so that they are a larger component of total revenue, we will continue to build and sell custom fabricated equipment. In support of this, we intend to cultivate new sales oriented customers and are actively pursuing small, medium and large reciprocating compressor fabrication projects, as well as, building rotary screw-type equipment of any size. Sales include: (1) compressor unit sales, (2) flare sales, (3) parts sales and (4) compressor rebuilds.\nOperating income of $1.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 decreased to a $0.5 million loss for the year ended December 31, 2018. This decrease is attributed to a 6.4% drop in our rental margins, due to costs incurred in deploying units.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2018, management performed a review of our rental compressor units and determined there were 13 units fully depreciated in our rental fleet which needed to be retired, representing total horsepower of 1,360.\nSelling, general, and administrative expenses decreased to $9.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to $10.1 million for 2017. This 9.8% decrease is primarily a result in a decrease in stock compensation of $1.7 million.\nDepreciation and amortization expense increased to $22.1 million from $21.3 million, or 3.6%, for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to 2017. The increase is the result of larger horsepower units being added to the fleet. We added 31 units (approximately 29,508 horsepower) to our fleet over the past twelve months. Twenty-seven of these were 400 horsepower or larger, representing 99% of the horsepower added.\nIncome tax expense decreased to $72,000 from a $18.3 million benefit for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 2017. As discussed in Note 9 to these financial statements, during the fourth quarter of 2018, the Company discovered a potentially uncertain tax position attributable deductibility of certain executive compensation expense for federal income tax purposes aggregating approximately $168,000, $149,000, $230,000 for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. As a result, in accordance with ASC Topic 740, during the fourth quarter of 2018, the Company recorded a tax adjustment of $547,000 and accrued penalty and interest expense of $55,000 attributable to the uncertain tax position. In 2017, the $18.3 million tax benefit was the result of the $18.4 million income tax benefit recorded in connection with the 2017 Tax Act, due to the remeasurement of our deferred tax assets and liabilities at the new federal statutory rate.\nAdjusted Gross Margin Year Ended December 31, 2019 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2018\nThe table below shows our adjusted gross margin and related percentages for each of our product lines for the years ended December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018.

Our drop in gross margins is mainly due to a 2.8% drop in rental revenue margins, which decreased to 51.4% for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to 54.2% during 2018. This decrease was due to an increased bad debt allowance as well as increased maintenance and repair costs, particularly \"make-ready\" jobs on units being placed back into service. Sales margin decreased to 18.5% in 2019 from 22.8% in 2018 due to higher payroll and lower labor and overhead efficiency in our fabrication facilities. Third party service and maintenance margins decreased to 68.2% from 73.3% for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to 2018. Service and maintenance only represents 2.5% of our revenue in 2019, providing minimal impact on our overall adjusted gross margin.\nAdjusted Gross Margin Year Ended December 31, 2018 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2017\nThe table below shows our adjusted gross margin and related percentages for each of our product lines for the years ended December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017.

Our drop in gross margins is mainly due to the drop in rental revenue margins due to costs incurred in deploying units. Rental margins decreased to 54.2% for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 60.6% during 2017 . Sales margin increased to 22.8% from 20.7% for the year ended 2018 compared to 2017.

During the year, the Company added $63.7 million in new equipment to our rental fleet, $3.8 million in payments related to the construction of our new corporate office, and $2.4 million in vehicles, office furniture and equipment. Our investment in property and equipment includes any changes to work-in-progress related to our rental fleet jobs at the beginning of the year compared to the end of the year. Our rental work-in-progress decreased by $2.7 million during 2019. We financed our investment in rental equipment, property and other equipment with cash on hand during 2019.\nCash flows\nAt December 31, 2019, we had cash and cash equivalents of $11.6 million compared to $52.6 million at year end 2018. Our cash flow from operations of $29.4 million was offset by capital expenditures of $69.9 million during 2019. We also had working capital of $36.9 million at December 31, 2019 compared to $84.0 million at December 31, 2018. On December 31, 2019 and 2018, we had outstanding debt of $417,000, which is all related to our line of credit. We had net cash flow from operating activities of $29.4 million during 2019 compared $23.7 million during 2018. Our cash flow from operating activities of $29.4 million was primarily the result adding back non-cash items of depreciation of $23.3 million, a goodwill impairment charge of $10.0 million, an increased inventory allowance and write-off of $3.8 million, stock-based compensation of $2.6 million, a loss on retirement of rental equipment of $1.5 million, a bad debt allowance of $0.7 million, and a net positive change in working capital and various other items of $2.1 million. These positive impacts were partially offset by a net loss of $13.9 million and a decrease in cash flows related to a reduction in deferred income taxes of $0.7 million.\nAt December 31, 2018, we had cash and cash equivalents of $52.6 million, working capital of $84.0 million and total debt of $417,000, under our credit agreement which is due in 2020. Our cash and cash equivalents decreased from 2017, due to an increase on our capital program for contracted new large horsepower compressor builds and the construction of our new corporate office. We had positive net cash flow from operating activities of approximately $23.7 million during 2018. This was primarily from a net loss of $0.5 million and non-cash items of depreciation and amortization of $22.1 million, $2.6 million related to stock-based compensation, a decrease in deferred income taxes of $0.3 million and a decrease in cash flows related to working capital and other items of $0.2 million.\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nWe have contractual obligations and commitments that affect our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. The following table is a summary of our significant cash contractual obligations (in thousands):\nTable 16: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash Contractual Obligations </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>2023 </td> <td> </td> <td>2024 </td> <td> </td> <td>Thereafter </td> <td> </td> <td>Total </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Line of credit </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>417 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>417 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest on line of credit </td> <td> </td> <td>17 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchase obligations </td> <td> </td> <td>250 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>250 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>160 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>660 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Lease liabilities (including interest) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>208 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>172 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>46 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>38 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>38 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>168 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>670 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other long term liabilities </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>41 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>41 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>892 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>422 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>247 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>38 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>38 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>168 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,805 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Company also has a remaining contractual obligation related to the construction of a new corporate office of approximately $375,000, which we intend to finance with cash on hand. Construction of a new office began in late 2017 and was completed in 2019.\nSenior Bank Borrowings\nWe have a senior secured revolving credit agreement the (\"Amended Credit Agreement\") with JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A (the \"Lender\") with an aggregate commitment of $30 million, subject to collateral availability. We also have a right to request from the Lender, on an uncommitted basis, an increase of up to $20 million on the aggregate commitment (which could potentially increase the commitment amount to $50 million).\nBorrowing Base. At any time before the maturity of the Amended Credit Agreement, we may draw, repay and re-borrow amounts available under the borrowing base up to the maximum aggregate availability discussed above. Generally, the borrowing base equals the sum of (a) 80% of our eligible accounts receivable plus (b) 50% of the book value of our eligible general inventory (not to exceed 50% of the commitment amount at the time) plus (c) 75% of the book value of our eligible equipment inventory. JPMorgan Chase Bank (the Lender\u201d) may adjust the borrowing base components if material deviations in the collateral are discovered in future audits of the collateral.\nInterest and Fees. Under the terms of the Amended Credit Agreement, we have the option of selecting the applicable variable rate for each revolving loan, or portion thereof, of either (a) LIBOR multiplied by the Statutory Reserve Rate (as defined in the Amended Credit Agreement), with respect to this rate, for Eurocurrency funding, plus the Applicable Margin ( LIBOR-based\u201d), or (b) CB Floating Rate, which is the Lender's Prime Rate less the Applicable Margin; provided, however, that no more than three LIBOR-based borrowings under the agreement may be outstanding at any one time. For purposes of the LIBOR-based interest rate, the Applicable Margin is 1.50%. For purposes of the CB Floating Rate, the Applicable Margin is 1.25%. Accrued interest is payable monthly on outstanding principal amounts, provided that accrued interest on LIBOR-based loans is payable at the end of each interest period, but in no event less frequently than quarterly. In addition, fees and expenses are payable in connection with our requests for letters of credit (generally equal to the Applicable Margin for LIBOR-related borrowings multiplied by the face amount of the requested letter of credit) and administrative and legal costs.\nMaturity. The maturity date of the Amended Credit Agreement is December 31, 2020, at which time all amounts borrowed under the agreement will be due and outstanding letters of credit must be cash collateralized. The agreement may be terminated early upon our request or the occurrence of an event of default.\nSecurity. The obligations under the Amended Credit Agreement are secured by a first priority lien on all of our inventory and accounts and leases receivables, along with a first priority lien on a variable number of our leased compressor equipment the book value of must be maintained at a minimum of 2.00 to 1.00 commitment coverage ratio (such ratio being equal to (i) the amount of the borrowing base as of such date to (ii) the amount of the commitment as of such date.)\nCovenants. The Amended Credit Agreement contains customary representations and warranties, as well as covenants which, among other things, limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness and liens; enter into transactions with affiliates; make acquisitions in excess of certain amounts; pay dividends; redeem or repurchase capital stock or senior notes; make investments or loans; make negative pledges; consolidate, merge or effect asset sales; or change the nature of our business. In addition, we also have certain financial covenants that require us to maintain a leverage ratio less than or equal to 2.50 to 1.00 as of the last day of each fiscal quarter.\nEvents of Default and Acceleration. The Amended Credit Agreement contains customary events of default for credit facilities of this size and type, and includes, without limitation, payment defaults; defaults in performance of covenants or other agreements contained in the transaction documents; inaccuracies in representations and warranties; certain defaults, termination events or\nsimilar events; certain defaults with respect to any other Company indebtedness in excess of $50,000; certain bankruptcy or insolvency events; the rendering of certain judgments in excess of $150,000; certain ERISA events; certain change in control events and the defectiveness of any liens under the secured revolving credit agreement. Obligations under the Amended Credit Agreement may be accelerated upon the occurrence of an event of default.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we were in compliance with all covenants in our Amended Credit Agreement. A default under our Amended Credit Agreement could trigger the acceleration of our bank debt so that it is immediately due and payable. Such default would have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, financial position and operations if we were to borrow a significant amount under our facility.\nComponents of Our Principal Capital Expenditures\nCapital expenditures for the three years ended December 31:\nTable 17: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Expenditure Category </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Rental equipment and property and equipment </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>69,938 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>40,065 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>13,536 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe level of our expenditures will vary in future periods depending on energy market conditions and other related economic factors. Based upon existing economic and market conditions, we believe that our cash on hand, operating cash flow and available line of credit are adequate to fully fund our net capital expenditures requirements for 2020. We also believe we have flexibility with respect to our financing alternatives and adjustments to our capital expenditure plans if circumstances warrant. We do not have any material continuing commitments related to our current operations that cannot be met with our cash on hand and our line of credit. However, our financing capacity could be negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Please see Note 19 of our Consolidated Financial Statements and Item 1A, Risk Factors, of this report.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nFrom time-to-time, we enter into off-balance sheet arrangements and transactions that can give rise to off-balance sheet obligations. As of December 31, 2019, we have an off-balance sheet arrangement and transaction. We do not believe that this arrangement is reasonably likely to materially affect our liquidity or availability of, or requirements for, capital resources.\nWe entered into a purchase agreement with a vendor in July 2008 pursuant to which we agreed to purchase up to $4.8 million of our paint and coating requirements exclusively from the vendor. In connection with the execution of the agreement, the vendor paid us a $300,000 fee which is considered to be a discount toward future purchases from the vendor. As of December 31, 2019, we had met $4.1 million of this obligation. The $300,000 payment we received is recorded as a long-term liability and will decrease as the purchase commitment is fulfilled. The long-term liability remaining as of December 31, 2019 was $41,000.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements on page.\nEnvironmental Regulations\nVarious federal, state and local laws and regulations covering the discharge of materials into the environment, or otherwise relating to protection of human safety and health and the environment, affect our operations and costs. Compliance with these laws and regulations could cause us to incur remediation or other corrective action costs or result in the assessment of administrative, civil and criminal penalties and the issuance of injunctions delaying or prohibiting operations. In addition, we have acquired certain properties and plant facilities from third parties whose actions with respect to the management and disposal or release of hydrocarbons or other wastes were not under our control. Under environmental laws and regulations, we could be required to remove or remediate wastes disposed of or released by prior owners. In addition, we could be responsible under environmental laws and regulations for properties and plant facilities we lease, but do not own. Compliance with such laws and regulations increases our overall cost of business, but has not had a material adverse effect on our operations or financial condition. It is not anticipated, based on current laws and regulations, that we will be required in the near future to expend amounts that are material in relation to our total expenditure budget in order to comply with environmental laws and regulations but such laws and regulations are frequently changed and we are unable to predict the ultimate cost of\ncompliance. We also could incur costs related to the cleanup of sites to which we send equipment and for damages to natural resources or other claims related to releases of regulated substances at such sites."}
