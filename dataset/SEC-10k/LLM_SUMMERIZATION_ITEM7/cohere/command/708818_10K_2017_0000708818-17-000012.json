MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nExcept for the historical information contained herein, the matters discussed in this management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( MD&A\u201d), including discussions of our product development plans, business strategies and market factors influencing our results, may include forward-looking statements that involve certain risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ from those anticipated by us as a result of various factors, both foreseen and unforeseen, including, but not limited to, our ability to continue to develop new products and increase systems sales in markets characterized by rapid technological evolution, consolidation and competition from larger, better-capitalized competitors. Many other economic, competitive, governmental and technological factors could affect our ability to achieve our goals and interested persons are urged to review any risks that may be described in Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d as set forth herein, as well as in our other public disclosures and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\").\nThis MD&A is provided as a supplement to the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K (\"Report\") in order to enhance your understanding of our results of operations and financial condition and should be read in conjunction with, and is qualified in its entirety by, the consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included elsewhere in this Report. Historical results of operations, percentage margin fluctuations and any trends that may be inferred from the discussion below are not necessarily indicative of the operating results for any future period.\nCompany Overview\nQuality Systems, Inc., known to our clients as NextGen Healthcare, provides software, services and analytics solutions to the ambulatory care market. We are a healthcare information technology and services company that delivers the foundational capabilities to organizations that want to promote healthy communities. Our technology provides a customizable platform that empowers physician practice success, enriches the patient care experience and lowers the cost of healthcare.\nWe primarily derive revenue by developing and marketing software and services that automate certain aspects of practice management ( PM\u201d) and electronic health records ( EHR\u201d) for ambulatory care practices. In addition, our software and services facilitate interoperability. Our software can be licensed and delivered on-premise or in the cloud as software-as-a-service ( SaaS\u201d). Our services include maintenance and support, professional services, and complementary services such as managed cloud services, revenue cycle management ( RCM\u201d) and electronic data interchange ( EDI\u201d). We market and sell our solutions through a dedicated sales force and to a much lesser extent, through resellers. Our clients span the entire ambulatory market from large multi-specialty to small single specialty practices and include networks of practices such as physician hospital organizations ( PHOs\u201d), management service organizations ( MSOs\u201d), accountable care organizations ( ACOs\u201d), ambulatory care centers and community health centers.\nWe have a history of enhancing our solutions through both organic and inorganic activities. Over the last few years, we have entered into strategic transactions to complement and enhance our product portfolio in the ambulatory care market. In October 2015, we divested our former Hospital Solutions division. In January 2016, we acquired HealthFusion Holdings, Inc. (\"HealthFusion\") and in April 2017, we acquired Entrada, Inc. (\"Entrada\").\nQuality Systems, Inc. was incorporated in California in 1974. Our principal offices are located at 18111 Von Karman Ave., Suite 800, Irvine, California, 92612. Our websites are located at www.nextgen.com and www.qsii.com. We operate on a fiscal year ending on March 31.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe discussion and analysis of our consolidated financial statements and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\"GAAP\"). The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect our reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosures. We base our assumptions, estimates and judgments on historical experience, current trends, and other factors we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, and we evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis. On a regular basis, we review the accounting policies and update our assumptions, estimates, and judgments, as needed, to ensure that our consolidated financial statements are presented fairly and in accordance with GAAP. Actual results could differ materially from our estimates under different assumptions or conditions. To the extent that there are material differences between our estimates and actual results, our financial condition or results of operations will be affected.\nOur significant accounting policies, as described in Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d of our notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Report, should be read in conjunction with management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations. We believe that the following accounting policies are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results because application of such policies require significant judgment regarding the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain and that affect our consolidated financial statements.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe generate revenue from sales of licensing rights and subscriptions to our software products, hardware and third party software products, support and maintenance services, revenue cycle management and related services (\"RCM\"), electronic data interchange and data services ( EDI\u201d), and professional services, such as implementation, training, and consulting performed for clients who use our products.\nWe generally recognize revenue provided that persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, fees are considered fixed or determinable, delivery of the product or service has occurred, and collection is considered probable. Revenue from the delivered elements (generally software licenses) are generally recognized upon physical or electronic delivery. In certain transactions where collection is not considered probable, the revenue is deferred until collection occurs. If the fee is not fixed or determinable, then the revenue recognized in each period (subject to application of other revenue recognition criteria) will be the lesser of the aggregate amounts due and payable or the amount of the arrangement fee that would have been recognized if the fees were being recognized using the residual method. We assess whether fees are considered fixed or determinable at the inception of the arrangement and negotiated fees generally are based on a specific volume of products to be delivered and not subject to change based on variable pricing mechanisms, such as the number of units copied or distributed or the expected number of users.\nA typical system sale may contain multiple elements, but most often includes software licenses, maintenance and support, implementation and training. Revenue on arrangements involving multiple elements is generally allocated to each element using the residual method when evidence of fair value only exists for the undelivered elements. The fair value of an element is based on vendor-specific objective evidence ( VSOE\u201d), which is based on the price charged when the same element is sold separately. We generally establish VSOE for the related undelivered elements based on the bell-shaped curve method. VSOE is established on maintenance for certain clients based on stated renewal rates only if the rate is determined to be substantive and falls within our customary pricing practices. VSOE calculations are updated and reviewed on a quarterly or annual basis, depending on the nature of the product or service.\nUnder the residual method, we defer revenue related to the undelivered elements based on VSOE of fair value of each undelivered element and allocate the remainder of the contract price, net of all discounts, to the delivered elements. If VSOE of fair value of any undelivered element does not exist, all revenue is deferred until VSOE of fair value of the undelivered element is established or the element has been delivered.\nRevenue related to arrangements that include hosting services is recognized in accordance to the revenue recognition criteria described above only if the client has the contractual right to take possession of the software at any time without incurring a significant penalty, and it is feasible for the client to either host the software on its own equipment or through another third party. Otherwise, the arrangement is accounted for as a service contract in which the entire arrangement is deferred and recognized over the period that the hosting services are being provided.\nFrom time to time, we offer future purchase discounts on our products and services as part of our arrangements. Such discounts that are incremental to the range of discounts reflected in the pricing of the other elements of the arrangement, that are incremental to the range of discounts typically given in comparable transactions, and that are significant, are assessed as an additional element of the arrangement. Revenue deferred related to future purchase options are not recognized until either the client exercises the discount offer or the offer expires.\nRevenue from professional services, including implementation, training, and consulting services, are generally recognized as the corresponding services are performed. Revenue from software related subscription services and support and maintenance revenue are recognized ratably over the contractual service period. Revenue from EDI and data services and other transaction processing services are recognized at the time the services are provided to clients. Revenue from RCM and related services is derived from services fees for ongoing billing, collections, and other related services, and are generally calculated as a percentage of total client collections. We recognize RCM and related services revenue at the time collections are made by the client as the services fees are not fixed or determinable until such time.\nWe record revenue net of sales tax obligation in the consolidated statements of net income and comprehensive income.\nThe amount and timing of revenue recognized in a given period is affected by our judgment as to whether an arrangement includes multiple elements and if so, the allocation of revenue to each element. We generally apply the residual method for the revenue recognition of our multiple element arrangements and estimate the fair value of the undelivered elements based on VSOE. Establishing VSOE on our undelivered elements requires judgment. We establish VSOE for each undelivered element as the price charged when the same element is sold separately and generally evidenced when a substantial majority of historical standalone transactions fall within a reasonably narrow range using the bell-shaped curve method. In our determination of VSOE, we also consider service type, client type, and other variables. Our revenue recognition is based on our ability to maintain VSOE. Although not currently expected, certain events may occur, such as modification to or lack of consistency in our selling and pricing practices that could result in changes to our determination of VSOE. VSOE calculations are updated and reviewed on a quarterly or annual basis, depending on the nature of the product or service.\nWe also must apply judgment in determining the appropriate timing and recognition of certain revenue deferrals. In certain transactions where collection risk is high, the revenue is deferred until collection occurs. If the fee is not fixed or determinable, then\nthe revenue recognized in each period (subject to application of other revenue recognition criteria) will be the lesser of the aggregate amounts due and payable or the amount of the arrangement fee that would have been recognized if the fees were being recognized using the residual method. We assess whether fees are considered fixed or determinable at the inception of the arrangement and negotiated fees generally are based on a specific volume of products to be delivered and not subject to change based on variable pricing mechanisms, such as the number of units copied or distributed or the expected number of users.\nAlthough we currently believe that our approach to estimates and judgments as described herein is reasonable, actual results could differ and we may be exposed to increases or decreases in revenue that could be material.\nReserves on Accounts Receivable\nWe maintain reserves for potential sales returns and uncollectible accounts receivable. In aggregate, such reserves reduce our gross accounts receivable to its estimated net realizable value.\nOur standard contracts generally do not contain provisions for clients to return products or services. However, we historically have accepted sales returns under certain circumstances. Accordingly, we estimate sales return reserves, including reserves for returns and other credits, based upon the rate of historical returns by revenue type in relation to the corresponding gross revenues and recognize revenue, net of an allowance for sales returns. If we are unable to estimate the returns, revenue recognition may be delayed until the rights of return period lapses, provided also, that all other criteria for revenue recognition have been met. If we experience changes in practices related to sales returns or changes in actual return rates that deviate from the historical data on which our reserves had been established, our revenues may be adversely affected.\nAllowances for doubtful accounts and other uncollectible accounts receivable related to estimated losses resulting from our clients' inability to make required payments are established based on our historical experience of bad debt expense and the aging of our accounts receivable balances, net of deferred revenue and specifically reserved accounts. Specific reserves are based on our estimate of the probability of collection for certain troubled accounts. Accounts are written off as uncollectible only after we have expended extensive collection efforts.\nOur allowances for doubtful accounts are based on our assessment of the collectibility of client accounts. We regularly review the adequacy of these allowances by considering internal factors such as historical experience, credit quality and age of the client receivable balances as well as external factors such as economic conditions that may affect a client's ability to pay and review of major third-party credit-rating agencies, as needed. If a major client's creditworthiness or financial condition were to deteriorate, if actual defaults are higher than our historical experience, or if other circumstances arise, our estimates of the recoverability of amounts due to us could be overstated, and additional allowances could be required, which could have an adverse impact on our operating results.\nAlthough we currently believe that our approach to estimates and judgments as described herein is reasonable, actual results could differ and we may be exposed to increases or decreases in required reserves that could be material.\nSoftware Development Costs\nSoftware development costs, consisting primarily of employee salaries and benefits, incurred in the research and development of new software products and enhancements to existing software products for external sale are expensed as incurred, and reported as net research and development costs in the consolidated statements of net income and comprehensive income, until technological feasibility has been established. After technological feasibility is established, any additional external software development costs are capitalized. Amortization of capitalized software is recorded using the greater of the ratio of current revenues to the total of current and expected revenues of the related product or the straight-line method over the estimated economic life of the related product, which is typically three years. The total of capitalized software costs incurred in the development of products for external sale are reported as capitalized software costs within our consolidated balance sheets.\nWe also incur costs to develop software applications for our internal-use and costs for the development of Software as a Service (\"SaaS\") based products sold to our clients. The development costs of our SaaS-based products are considered internal-use for accounting purposes. Our internal-use capitalized costs are stated at cost and amortized using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which is typically three to seven years. Application development stage costs generally include costs associated with internal-use software configuration, coding, installation and testing. Costs related to the preliminary\nproject stage and post-implementation activities are expensed as incurred. Costs of significant upgrades and enhancements that result in additional functionality are also capitalized, whereas costs incurred for maintenance and minor upgrades and enhancements are expensed as incurred. Capitalized software costs for developing SaaS-based products are reported as capitalized software costs within our consolidated balance sheets and capitalized software costs for developing our internal-use software applications are reported as equipment and improvements within our consolidated balance sheets.\nWe periodically reassess the estimated economic life and the recoverability of our capitalized software costs. If a determination is made that capitalized amounts are not recoverable based on the estimated net cash flows to be generated from sales of the applicable software product, the amount by which the unamortized capitalized costs of a software product exceed the net realizable value is written off as a charge to earnings. The net realizable value is the estimated future gross revenues from that product\nreduced by the estimated future costs of completing and disposing of that product, including the costs of performing maintenance and client support required to satisfy our responsibility at the time of sale.\nDuring the year ended March 31, 2016, we recorded a $32.2 million non-cash impairment charge after making a determination that the previously capitalized software costs related to the NextGen Now development project was not recoverable. Refer to the \"Impairment of Assets\" section below for additional information.\nAlthough we currently believe that our approach to estimates and judgments as described herein is reasonable, actual results could differ and we may be exposed to increases or decreases in revenue that could be material.\nBusiness Combinations\nWe completed our acquisition of HealthFusion during the year ended March 31, 2017, which was accounted for as a purchase business combination using the acquisition method of accounting.\nIn accordance with the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations, we allocate the purchase price of acquired businesses to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on estimated fair values. Our purchase price allocation methodology contains uncertainties because it requires us to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities, including, but not limited to, intangible assets, goodwill, and contingent consideration liabilities. We estimate the fair value of assets and liabilities based upon quoted market prices, the carrying value of the acquired assets and widely accepted valuation techniques, including discounted cash flows and market multiple analyses depending on the nature of the assets being sold. We estimate the fair value of the contingent consideration liabilities based on the probability of achieving certain business milestones and/or management's forecast of expected results. The process for estimating fair values in many cases requires the use of significant estimates, assumptions and judgments, including determining the timing and estimates of future cash flows and developing appropriate discount rates. Unanticipated events or circumstances may occur which could affect the accuracy of our fair value estimates, including assumptions regarding industry economic factors and business strategies. Any adjustments to fair value subsequent to the measurement period are reflected in the consolidated statements of net income and comprehensive income.\nWe currently do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to complete the purchase price allocation and estimate the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities. However, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions, we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material\nGoodwill\nGoodwill acquired in a business combination is measured as the excess of the purchase price, or consideration transferred, over the net acquisition date fair values of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. Goodwill is not amortized as it has been determined to have an indefinite useful life.\nWe test goodwill for impairment annually during our first fiscal quarter, referred to as the annual test date. We will also test for impairment between annual test dates if an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate the carrying amount may be impaired. Impairment testing for goodwill is performed at a reporting-unit level, which is defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment (referred to as a component). A component of an operating segment is a reporting unit if the component constitutes a business for which discrete financial information is available and segment management regularly reviews the operating results of that component.\nAs part of our annual goodwill impairment test, we first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If we conclude that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, we conduct a two-step quantitative goodwill impairment test. The first step of the impairment test involves comparing the fair values of the applicable reporting units with their carrying values. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds the reporting unit's fair value, we perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test. The second step of the goodwill impairment test involves comparing the implied fair value of the affected reporting unit's goodwill with the carrying value of that goodwill. The amount by which the carrying value of the goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, if any, is recognized as an impairment loss.\nApplication of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units, assignment of goodwill to reporting units, and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit. The fair value of each reporting unit is estimated primarily through the use of a discounted cash flow methodology. This analysis requires significant judgments, including estimation of future cash flows, which is dependent on internal forecasts, estimation of the long-term rate of growth for our business, estimation of the useful life over which cash flows will occur, and determination of our weighted average cost of capital.\nThe estimates used to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit change from year to year based on operating results, market conditions, and other factors. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and goodwill impairment for each reporting unit.\nWe currently do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to test for impairment losses on goodwill. However, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions, we may be exposed to future impairment charges that could be material.\nIntangible Assets\nIntangible assets consist of trade names and contracts, customer relationships, and software technology, all of which arose in connection with our acquisitions.\nThese intangible assets are recorded at fair value and are stated net of accumulated amortization. We currently amortize intangible assets using a method that reflects the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible asset are consumed.\nAlthough currently we believe that our approach to estimates and judgments as described herein is reasonable, actual results could differ and we may be exposed to decreases in the fair value of our intangible assets, resulting in impairment charges that could be material. We test intangible assets for impairment if we believe indicators of impairment exist.\nShare-Based Compensation\nWe record share-based compensation related to our employee stock options plans, employee share purchase plans, restricted stock awards, and restricted performance stock awards and shares. See Note 13, Share-Based Awards,\u201d of our notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Report for a complete discussion of our stock-based compensation plans.\nShare-based compensation expense associated with the stock options under our equity incentive plans is based on the number of options expected to vest. We estimate the fair value of stock options on the date of grant using the Black Scholes option-pricing model based on required inputs, including expected term, volatility, risk-free rate, and expected dividend yield. Expected term is estimated based upon the historical exercise behavior and represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding and therefore the proportion of awards that is expected to vest. Volatility is estimated by using the weighted-average historical volatility of our common stock, which approximates expected volatility. The risk-free rate is the implied yield available on the U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with remaining terms equal to the expected term. The expected dividend yield is the average dividend rate during a period equal to the expected term of the option. The fair value vest is recognized ratably as expense over the requisite service period in our consolidated statements of net income and comprehensive income.\nShare-based compensation expense associated with restricted stock awards is estimated using the market price of the common stock on the date of grant. Share-based compensation expense associated with the restricted performance stock awards and shares is based on the grant date fair value measured at the underlying closing share price on the date of grant using a Monte Carlo-based valuation model.\nWe currently do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to determine share-based compensation expense. However, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions, we may be exposed to changes in share-based compensation expense that could be material.\nTrends and Events in Our Business\nWe believe that the following trends and events as described below have contributed to our consolidated results of operations and may continue to impact our future results.\nWe believe healthcare is more heavily influenced by regulatory and national health projects than by the cycles of our economy. The healthcare industry has been significantly impacted by the Obama Administration's broad healthcare reform efforts, including the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health portion of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (\"HITECH Act\") and the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (\"ACA\") that provided significant incentives to health care organizations for \"Meaningful Use\" adoption and interoperable electronic health record solutions.\nWe also believe that healthcare reform, including the repeal of the sustainable growth rate (SGR) formula as part of the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015 (\"MACRA\"), and a movement towards a value-based, pay-for-performance model and quality initiative efforts will stimulate demand for robust electronic health record solutions as well as new health information technology solutions from bundled billing capabilities to patient engagement and population health management. We believe MACRA may be the most important of the three regulations for our market because it permanently changes how ambulatory healthcare providers are reimbursed by Medicare. It offers certainty and a timeline for the market's move away from volume-based, fee-for-service models to value-based payment models that reward the delivery of lower cost, high quality care.\nWhile we expect to benefit from the increasing demands for greater efficiency as well as government support for increased adoption of electronic health records, the market for physician based electronic health records software is becoming increasingly saturated while physician group practices are rapidly being consolidated by hospitals, insurance payers and other entities. Hospital software providers are leveraging their position with their hospital clients to gain market share with hospital owned physician practices. Insurance providers and large physician groups are also consolidating physician offices creating additional opportunity for ambulatory software providers like us. Our strategy is to focus on addressing the growing needs of accountable care organizations around interoperability, patient engagements, population health, and data analytics.\nWe believe that our core strength lies in the central role our software products and services play in the delivery of healthcare by the primary physician in an ambulatory setting. We intend to remain at the forefront of upcoming new regulatory requirements and meaningful use requirements for stimulus payments. We intend to continue the development and enhancement of our software solutions to support healthcare reform, such as the recently enacted MACRA, which promotes the transition from fee-for-service to value-based, pay-for-performance and patient-centric and quality initiatives such as accountable care organizations. Key elements of our future software development will be to expand our interoperability capabilities enhancing the competitiveness of our software offerings, make our products more intuitive and easy to use, and to enhance the capability of our MediTouch\u00ae Platform to allow us to deliver our software over the cloud to larger ambulatory care practices.\nWe have a history of enhancing our solutions through both organic and inorganic activities. Over the last few years, we have entered into strategic transactions to complement and enhance our product portfolio in the ambulatory care market. In October 2015, we divested our former Hospital Solutions division. In January 2016, we acquired HealthFusion Holdings, Inc. (\"HealthFusion\") and in April 2017, we acquired Entrada, Inc. (\"Entrada\").\nWe continue to evaluate the organizational structure of our company with the objective of achieving greater synergies and further integration of our products and services, in support of our business strategies. In fiscal year 2016, we initiated a three-phase plan intended to better position our organization for future success. In the first phase, we redesigned the organization to more effectively support the execution of our strategy. This phase included implementing a series of actions with the objective of enabling a more efficient, integrated and client-centered delivery of the holistic solutions that we believe is required by our ambulatory care clients. During this phase, we transformed our management team with the appointment of a new Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Technology Officer, Chief Operating Officer, and Chief Strategy Officer. Under phase two of our reorganization, we have continued to build our infrastructure and enhance our healthcare information technology capabilities to drive future revenue growth. The phase includes a multi-year initiative, called NextGen 2.0, to merge our business units into a more streamlined, functional-based organization structure and to realign our organizational structure by consolidating the sales, marketing, information services, and software development responsibilities into single, company-wide roles to achieve greater efficiency. The third phase of the plan will consist of developing and marketing the services and solutions that we believe will accelerate revenue growth. The first phase was completed in April 2016, when we announced a corporate restructuring plan, which was approved by our Board of Directors.\nThe overall plan also includes a multi-year initiative, called NextGen 2.0, to merge our business units into a more streamlined, functional-based organization structure and to realign our organizational structure by consolidating the sales, marketing, information services, and software development responsibilities into single, company-wide roles to achieve greater efficiency.\nUnder our reorganization plan, we incurred approximately $7,078 of reorganization-related charges in the year ended March 31, 2017, consisting principally of severance, other one-time termination benefits, and facilities-related costs.\nWe have and intend to continue investments in our infrastructure, including but not limited to maintaining and expanding sales, marketing and product development activities to improve patient care and reduce healthcare costs, providing industry-leading, integrated clinical and administrative healthcare data systems, services, and expertise to clinical, medical, technology, and healthcare business professionals while continuing our strong commitment of service in support of our client satisfaction programs. These investments in our infrastructure will continue while maintaining reasonable expense discipline. We strive to add new clients and expand our relationship with existing clients through delivery of add-on and complementary products and\nservices and believe that our client base that is using our software on a daily basis is a strategic asset. We intend to leverage this strategic asset by expanding our product and service offerings towards this client base.\nLed by our vision and mission, we are resetting our strategy and structure to deliver value to our clients. To achieve a lower-cost, increased capability structure, our new management team is building what we believe is an aligned, client-focused organization, supported by a recurring revenue stream and a large and diverse existing client base.\nWe strive to be the trusted partner for clients of all sizes, integrating services and software into a consolidated solution that enables an efficient and effective caregiver and patient experience while driving positive financial outcomes. As a healthcare information technology and services company, we plan to continue investing in our current capabilities as well as building and/or acquiring new capabilities as we guide our clients through an evolving healthcare marketplace that is transitioning from fee-for-service to fee-for-value reimbursement models. With approximately 90,000 providers using our solutions, we are enabling care and believe we can truly transform the delivery of care through the following strategic priorities, including focus on the ambulatory client segment, platform as a service, and population health software and services. Refer to Item 1. Business\u201d included elsewhere in this Report for additional information on each of our strategic priorities.\nAs a healthcare information technology and services company, we plan to continue investing in our current capabilities as well as building and/or acquiring new capabilities as we guide our clients from fee-for-service to fee-for-value payer reimbursement models. With approximately 90,000 providers using our solutions, we are enabling care and believe we can truly transform the delivery of care.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table sets forth the

services, revenue cycle management and related services (\"RCM\"), electronic data interchange and data services ( EDI\u201d), and professional services, such as implementation, training, and consulting performed for clients who use our products.\nConsolidated revenue for the year ended March 31, 2017 increased $17.1 million compared to the prior year due mostly to a $31.6 million increase in software related subscription services and $6.6 million increase in EDI, partially offset by a $9.3 million decrease in professional services, $6.4 million decrease in support and maintenance, $5.0 million decrease in software license and hardware, and $0.5 million decrease in RCM. The increase in software related subscription services was primarily driven by a full year of sales related to the MediTouch\u00ae cloud-based solution acquired from HealthFusion in January 2016, combined with growth in subscriptions related to our interoperability, patient portal, and QSIDental Web product offerings as we continue to expand our client base. The increase in EDI is partially attributed to the acquisition of HealthFusion and growth in EDI transaction volume due to addition of new clients and further penetration of our existing client base. The decline in software license and hardware revenue was mostly caused by a shift in market dynamics toward cloud-based solutions and away from perpetual license arrangements, which has also resulted in lower demand for our professional services, including implementation, training, and consulting services. The decline in support and maintenance is due primarily to the disposition of the former Hospital Solutions division in October 2015, which accounted for $5.3 million of the decrease, and net attrition in products sold with accompanying maintenance. The lower RCM revenue is due to customer attrition and a decline in new bookings.\nConsolidated revenue for the year ended March 31, 2016 increased $2.3 million compared to the year ended March 31, 2015 due to higher software related subscription services, RCM, and EDI revenue, partially offset by lower software license and hardware, professional services, and support and maintenance revenue. The $11.1 million decline in software license and hardware revenue compared to the year ended March 31, 2015 reflects the increasingly saturated end-market for electronic health records software and the disposition of the former Hospital Solutions division, which contributed to $1.9 million of the total decrease in software license and hardware revenue. Software related subscription services revenue increased $10.8 million compared to the year ended March 31, 2015 primarily due to additional revenues from the acquisition of HealthFusion, combined with growth in subscriptions related to our interoperability, patient portal, and QSIDental Web product offerings, offset by a $1.9 million decrease primarily related to the disposition of the former Hospital Solutions division. Support and maintenance revenue decreased $4.0 million, which consists of a $4.9 million decrease related to the former Hospital Solutions division, partially offset by growth in support and maintenance related to our interoperability solutions and other ambulatory software products. RCM and EDI revenue grew by $8.8 million and $6.0 million, respectively, compared to the year ended March 31, 2015, due to addition of new clients and further penetration of our existing client base. The acquisition of HealthFusion also partially contributed to the increase in EDI revenues. Professional services revenue decreased $8.2 million compared to the year ended March 31, 2015, due to the recent decline in system sales, resulting in lower client demand for our core software products and related implementation, training, and consulting services. The disposition of the former Hospital Solutions division also contributed to $1.7 million of the decrease in professional services revenue compared to the year ended March 31, 2015.\nConsolidated bookings reflect the estimated annual value of our executed contracts and are adjusted to include the effect of pre-acquisition bookings for HealthFusion and exclude the historical impact of the former Hospital Solutions division. For the year ended March 31, 2017, consolidated bookings were $125.5 million, which decreased compared to $141.7 million in the prior year primarily due to lower sales of perpetual license arrangements associated with a shift in market dynamics and a decline in new RCM bookings, as described above. Consolidated bookings decreased in the year ended March 31, 2016 compared to $175.4 million in the year ended March 31, 2015, which was primarily driven by lower sales of perpetual license arrangements.\nRecurring service revenue, consisting of software related subscription services, support and maintenance, RCM, and EDI, represented 82%, 78%, and 74% of total revenue for the years ended March 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively.\nWe expect to benefit from the growth of a replacement market driven by an expected consolidation of electronic health records vendors. We also anticipate the creation of new opportunities in connection with the evolution of healthcare from a fee-for-services reimbursement model to a pay-for-performance model around the management of patient populations. Through our acquisition of HealthFusion in January 2016, we obtained a highly scalable, pure cloud-based and mobile-enabled platform with capabilities that we intend to expand to serve the requirements of larger ambulatory practices. When combined with our Mirth-branded products, we can offer our clients a full suite of cloud-based solutions that better enable our clients to focus on care delivery. While it remains difficult to assess the relative impact or the timing of positive and negative trends affecting the aforementioned market opportunities, we believe we are well positioned to remain a leader in serving the evolving market needs for healthcare information technology.\nGross Profit\nThe following table presents our consolidated cost of revenue and gross profit for the years ended March 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015 (in thousands): Table 70: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal Year Ended March 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total cost of revenue\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>223,134\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>225,615\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>223,164\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross profit\n</td> <td>286,490\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>266,862\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>267,061\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross margin %\n</td> <td>56.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>54.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>54.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCost of revenue consists primarily of compensation expense, including share-based compensation, for personnel that deliver our products and services. Cost of revenue also includes amortization of capitalized software costs and acquired technology, third party consultant and outsourcing costs, costs associated with our EDI business partners and clearinghouses, hosting service costs, third party software costs and royalties, and other costs directly associated with delivering our products and services. Refer to Note 7, \"Intangible Assets\" and Note 8, \"Capitalized Software Costs\" of our notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Report for additional information on current period amortization of capitalized software costs and acquired technology and an estimate of future expected amortization.\nShare-based compensation expense included in cost of revenue was $0.5 million, $0.4 million, and $0.4 million for the years ended March 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively, and is included in the amounts in the table above.\nGross profit for the year ended March 31, 2017 increased $19.6 million compared to the prior year due primarily to the higher revenues as discussed above, combined with a $2.5 million decrease in cost of revenue. Cost of revenue decreased due to lower payroll costs associated with delivering support and maintenance and professional services and lower amortization of previously capitalized software development costs that became fully amortized during the year, partially offset by higher amortization of the software technology intangible asset acquired from HealthFusion. The increase in the gross margin percentage to 56.2% for the year ended March 31, 2017 compared to 54.2% in the prior year period primarily reflects higher profitability related to sales of the MediTouch\u00ae cloud-based solution acquired from HealthFusion in January 2016, offset by lower profitability of professional services as the demand for such services have declined at a quicker pace than the associated payroll costs.\nGross profit decreased $0.2 million for the year ended March 31, 2016 compared to the year ended March 31, 2015 due primarily to a decline in high-margin software license sales associated with the market saturation noted above and a decline in gross profit associated with the disposition of the former Hospital Solutions division, offset by increases in gross profit associated with higher software and related subscription services, RCM, and EDI revenues and contributions to gross profit from the acquisition of HealthFusion.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expense\nThe following table presents our consolidated selling, general and administrative expense for the years ended March 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015 (in thousands):\nTable 71: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal Year Ended March 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling, general and administrative\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>163,623\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>156,234\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>158,172\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling, general and administrative, as a percentage of revenue\n</td> <td>32.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>31.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>32.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSelling, general and administrative expense consist of compensation expense, including share-based compensation, for management and administrative personnel, selling and marketing expense, facilities costs, depreciation, professional service fees, including legal and accounting services, acquisition and transaction-related costs, and other general corporate and administrative expenses.\nShare-based compensation expense included in selling, general and administrative expenses was $6.1 million, $2.6 million, and $2.7 million for the years ended March 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively, and is included in the amounts in the table above. The increase in share-based compensation expense for the year ended March 31, 2017 compared to the prior year is due to higher issuances of equity awards to officers and employees as incentive compensation. Refer to Note 13, \"Share-Based Awards\" of our notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Report for additional information on equity award grants.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses increased $7.4 million for the year ended March 31, 2017 compared to the prior year primarily due to higher incremental costs associated with HealthFusion acquired in January 2016, higher legal expense related to shareholder litigation, partially offset by lower payroll costs associated with our reorganization efforts and lower acquisition costs.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended March 31, 2016 decreased $1.9 million compared to the year ended March 31, 2015 primarily due to a $6.3 million decrease in legal expenses associated mostly with shareholder litigation defense costs (net of insurance recoveries), a $2.1 million decrease in sales commissions related to a decline in new system sales, a $1.5 million decrease in equipment and software maintenance expense, and a $0.7 million decrease in facilities and utilities expense, offset by a $2.7 million increase in bad debt expense, a $2.7 million increase in salaries and benefits, $2.3 million higher transaction costs associated mostly with the acquisition of HealthFusion and a $1.8 million loss on the disposition of the former Hospital Solutions division (including related incremental direct costs).\nResearch and Development Costs, net\nThe following table presents our consolidated net research and development costs, capitalized software costs, and gross expenditures prior to capitalization, for the years ended March 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015 (in thousands): Table 72: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal Year Ended March 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross expenditures\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>86,590\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>80,336\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>83,841\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capitalized software costs\n</td> <td>(8,249\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(14,675\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(14,601\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Research and development costs, net\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>78,341\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>65,661\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>69,240\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Research and development costs, net, as a percentage of revenue\n</td> <td>15.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capitalized software costs as a percentage of gross expenditures\n</td> <td>9.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nGross research and development expenditures, including costs expensed and costs capitalized, consist of compensation expense, including share-based compensation for research and development personnel, certain third-party consultant fees, software maintenance costs, and other costs related to new product development and enhancement to our existing products. We intend to continue to invest heavily in research and development expenses as we continue to bring additional functionality and features to the medical community and develop a new integrated inpatient and outpatient, web-based software platform.\nThe capitalization of software development costs results in a reduction to our reported net research and development costs. Our software capitalization rate, or capitalized software costs as a percentage of gross expenditures, has varied historically and may continue to vary based on the nature and status of specific projects and initiatives in progress. Although changes in software capitalization rates have no impact on our overall cash flows, it results in fluctuations in the amount of software development costs being expensed up front and the amount of net research and development costs reported in our consolidated statement of net income and comprehensive income.\nShare-based compensation expense included in research and development costs was $1.0 million, $0.3 million, and $0.4 million for the years ended March 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively, and is included in the amounts in the table above.\nNet research and development costs for the year ended March 31, 2017 increased $12.7 million compared to the prior year due to a $6.3 million increase in our gross expenditures, combined with a $6.4 million decrease in capitalized software costs. The increase in gross expenditures is primarily the result of incremental costs from HealthFusion and higher costs related to development of the next versions of our software products, partially offset by lower gross expenditures from the discontinuation of the former NextGen Now development project during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 and lower personnel costs associated with our reorganization efforts. The reduction in capitalized software costs and rate of software capitalization is primarily due to the discontinuation of the former NextGen Now development project and the recent releases of the next major version of our core software products. Our software capitalization rate fluctuates due to differences in the nature and status of our projects and initiatives during a given year, which affects the amount of development costs that may be capitalized.\nNet research and development costs for the year ended March 31, 2016 decreased $3.6 million compared to the year ended March 31, 2015 primarily due to lower gross expenditures related to the former NextGen Now development project, which was discontinued during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. Refer to the \"Impairment of Assets\" section below for additional information.\nAmortization of Acquired Intangible Assets\nThe following table presents our amortization of acquired intangible assets for the years ended March 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015 (in thousands): Table 73: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal Year Ended March 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of acquired intangible assets\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>10,435\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,367\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,693\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAmortization of acquired intangible assets included in operating expense consist of the amortization related to our customer relationships, trade name, and contracts intangible assets acquired as part of our business combinations. Refer to Note 7, \"Intangible Assets\" of our notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Report for an estimate of future expected amortization.\nAmortization of acquired intangible assets for the year ended March 31, 2017 increased $5.1 million, compared to the prior year period due to additional amortization of the customer relationships and trade name intangible assets related to the acquisition of HealthFusion. Amortization of acquired intangible assets for the year ended March 31, 2016 increased $1.7 million compared to the prior year due to additional amortization of the customer relationships and trade name intangible assets related to the acquisition of HealthFusion.\nImpairment of Assets\nDuring the year ended March 31, 2016, we recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $32.2 million that is reflected within the impairment of assets caption in our consolidated statements of net income and comprehensive income. The impairment relates to the previously capitalized investment in the former NextGen Now development project, which we had deemed to have zero net realizable value. The impairment charge did not result in any cash expenditures. The impairment charge followed our assessment of the NextGen Now development project and the MediTouch platform that we obtained through our acquisition of HealthFusion. We had determined that the MediTouch platform offered the most efficient path to providing a high-quality, robust, cloud-based solution for ambulatory care and decided to cease further investment in NextGen Now and immediately discontinued all efforts to use or repurpose the NextGen Now platform.\nRestructuring Costs\nDuring the year ended March 31, 2017, we recorded $7.1 million of restructuring costs within operating expenses in our consolidated statements of net income and comprehensive income. The restructuring costs resulted from a restructuring plan that we announced in April 2016, and such costs consist primarily of payroll-related costs, such as severance, outplacement costs, and continuing healthcare coverage, associated with the involuntary separation of employees pursuant to a one-time benefit arrangement. Also included in restructuring costs was $1.7 million of facilities-related costs associated with accruals for the remaining lease obligations at certain locations, including Solana Beach, Costa Mesa, and a portion of Horsham with contractual lease terms ending between January 2018 and September 2023. We have vacated each of the locations or portions thereof and are actively marketing the locations for sublease. As of March 31, 2017, the remaining restructuring liability associated with payroll-related costs was $0.6 million, which we expect to settle in the first quarter of fiscal 2018, and the remaining lease obligation, net of estimated projected sublease rentals, was $2.3 million. Refer to Note 14, \"Commitments, Guarantees, and Contingencies,\" of our notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Report for estimated timing of payments related to remaining lease obligations. The restructuring plan was substantially complete by the end of fiscal 2017.\nThe restructuring is part of a three-phase plan initiated in fiscal year 2016 that was intended to better position our organization for future success. In the first phase, we redesigned the organization to more effectively support the execution of our strategy. This phase included implementing a series of actions with the objective of enabling a more efficient, integrated and client-centered delivery of the holistic solutions that we believe is required by our ambulatory care clients. During this phase, we transformed our management team with the appointment of a new Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Technology Officer, Chief Operating Officer, and Chief Strategy Officer. Under phase two of our reorganization, we have continued to build our infrastructure and enhance our healthcare information technology capabilities to drive future revenue growth. The third phase of the plan will consist of developing and marketing the services and solutions that we believe will accelerate revenue growth.\nThe overall plan also includes a multi-year initiative, called NextGen 2.0, to merge our business units into a more streamlined, functional-based organization structure and to realign our organizational structure by consolidating the sales, marketing, information services, and software development responsibilities into single, company-wide roles to achieve greater efficiency. As a result, our reportable segments have changed and may change again due to such changes in the organization of our business.\nRefer to Note 15, \"Restructuring Plan\" of our notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Report for additional information.\nInterest and Other Income and Expense\nThe following table presents our interest expense for the for the years ended March 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015 (in thousands):\nTable 74: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal Year Ended March 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>14\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>428\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>111\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense\n</td> <td>(3,156\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,304\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(341\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other expense, net\n</td> <td>(262\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(166\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(62\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nInterest income relates primarily to our marketable securities. Interest expense relates to our revolving credit agreement that was entered into in January 2016 and the related amortization of deferred debt issuance costs. Refer to Note 9, Line of Credit\u201d of our notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Report for additional information. Other expense and income relates primarily to net realized gains and losses on our marketable securities.\nInterest expense for the year ended March 31, 2017 increased $1.9 million compared to the prior year, and interest expense for the year ended March 31, 2016 increased $1.0 million compared to the year ended March 31, 2015. The increases in interest expense is associated with our revolving credit agreement entered into in January 2016 and the related amortization of deferred debt issuance costs. As of March 31, 2017, we had $15.0 million in outstanding loans under the revolving credit agreement.\nAll other fluctuations in interest and other income and expense are not deemed significant.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nThe following table presents our provision for income taxes for the years ended March 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015 (in thousands): Table 75: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal Year Ended March 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Provision for income taxes\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,368\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>663\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8,332\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effective tax rate\n</td> <td>22.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe effective tax rate for the year ended March 31, 2017 increased compared to the prior year primarily because the lower income before taxes in the prior year caused the rate reconciling items to have a more significant impact to the effective tax rate.\nThe effective tax rate for the year ended March 31, 2016 decreased compared to the year ended March 31, 2015 primarily as a result of favorable tax benefits from the federal research and development tax credit and other permanent items having a more significant effective tax rate impact due to lower income before taxes for the year ended March 31, 2016. The Internal Revenue Service statute related to research and development credits expired on December 31, 2014 and was retroactively reinstated and made permanent in December 2015. The research and development credits claimed for the year ended March 31, 2016 represent credits for the twelve-month period.\nRefer to Note 11, Income Tax\u201d of our notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Report for a reconciliation of the federal statutory income tax rate to our effective tax rate.\nNet Income\nThe following table presents our net income (in thousands) and net income per share and for the years ended March 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015: Table 76: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal Year Ended March 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>18,241\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,657\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>27,332\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income per share:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Basic\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.30\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.09\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.45\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Diluted\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.29\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.09\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.45\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs a result of the foregoing changes in revenue and expense, net income for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017 increased $12.6 million compared to the prior year period.\nAs a result of the foregoing changes in revenue and expense, net income for the year ended March 31, 2016 decreased $21.7 million compared to the year ended March 31, 2015. The significant decrease is primarily due to the $32.2 million impairment of previously capitalized software costs related to the former NextGen Now development project, offset by a decrease in provision for income taxes as a result of lower pre-tax net income.\nOperating Segment Information\nEffective July 1, 2016, we revised our reportable operating segments. As part of our ongoing reorganization efforts, we refined the measurement of our segment data to better reflect our current internal organizational structure whereby certain functions that formerly existed within each individual operating segment have changed. Our operating segments consist of the Software and Related Solutions segment and the RCM and Related Services segment, which is consistent with the disaggregated financial information used and evaluated by our chief operating decision maker (consisting of our Chief Executive Officer) to assess performance and make decisions about the allocation of resources. Revenue and gross profit are the key measures of segment profitability used by our chief operating decision maker to measure segment operating performance and to make key business decisions. The revenues and gross profit of each segment are derived from distinct product and services within each segment. The Software and Related Solutions segment aggregates the revenues and gross profit of our software-related products and services, including software license and hardware, software-related subscription services, support and maintenance, EDI and data services, and certain professional services, such as implementation, training, and consulting. The RCM and Related Services segment aggregates the revenues and gross profit of our RCM services and certain related ancillary service offerings.\nOperating segment data for the years ended March 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015 is summarized in the table below. Prior period data has been retroactively reclassified to present all segment information on a comparable basis. The change in reportable segments has no impact to consolidated revenues and consolidated cost of revenue, nor does it affect our presentation of revenue and cost of revenue on the consolidated statements of net income and comprehensive income.\nTable 77: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal Year Ended March 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenue:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Software and Related Solutions\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>423,593\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>398,449\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>395,259\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>RCM and Related Services\n</td> <td>86,031\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>86,559\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>76,962\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Hospital Solutions (1)\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,469\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18,004\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consolidated revenue\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>509,624\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>492,477\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>490,225\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross profit:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Software and Related Solutions\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>278,121\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>252,136\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>256,922\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>RCM and Related Services\n</td> <td>28,274\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>27,694\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21,514\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Hospital Solutions (1)\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,568\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,876\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unallocated cost of revenue (2)\n</td> <td>(19,905\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(15,536\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(16,251\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consolidated gross profit\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>286,490\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>266,862\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>267,061\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n___________________________________\n(1) The former Hospital Solutions division was divested in October 2015 and therefore, does not represent a distinct operating segment. Historical amounts for Hospital Solutions have not been revised.\n(2) Consists of amortization of acquired software technology and amortization of capitalized software costs not allocated to the operating segments for the purposes of measuring performance.\nSoftware and Related Solutions\nSoftware and Related Solutions revenue for the year ended March 31, 2017 increased $25.1 million and gross profit increased $26.0 million compared to the prior year. The increase in revenues was driven by an increase in our software related subscription services and EDI revenue, partially offset by lower professional services, support and maintenance, and software license and hardware revenue, as described above in further details in the \"Revenues\" section. The increase in gross profit is due primarily to the increases in revenue combined with a decrease in cost of revenue, as described above in further detail in the \"Gross Profit\" section.\nSoftware and Related Solutions revenue for the year ended March 31, 2016 increased $3.2 million while gross profit decreased $4.8 million compared to the year ended March 31, 2015. The increase in revenues was driven by higher software related subscription services and EDI revenue, partially offset by lower software license and hardware, professional services, and support and maintenance revenue. The decrease in gross profit is due primarily to a decline in high-margin software license sales that reflects the increasingly saturated end-market for electronic health records software, partially offset by increases in gross profit related to higher software related subscription services revenue.\nOur goals for Software and Related Solutions include further enhancement of our existing products, including expansion of our software and service offerings that support pay-for-performance initiatives around accountable care organizations, bringing greater ease of use and intuitiveness to our software products, enhancing our managed cloud and hosting services to lower our clients' total cost of ownership, expanding our interoperability and enterprise analytics capabilities, and further development and enhancements of our portfolio of specialty focused templates within our electronic health records software. We intend to remain at the forefront of upcoming new regulatory requirements, including meaningful use requirements for stimulus payments and\nrecent healthcare reform that is driving the transition towards pay-for-performance, value-based reimbursement models. We believe that the expanded requirements for continued eligibility for incentive payments under meaningful use rules will result in an expanded replacement market for electronic health records software. We also intend to continue selling additional software and services to existing clients, expanding penetration of connectivity and other services to new and existing clients, and capitalizing on growth and cross selling opportunities within RCM and Related Services. Our acquisitions of Entrada and HealthFusion will allow us expand our client base and cloud-based solution capabilities in the ambulatory market and meet the needs of practices of increasing size and complexity. Our acquisitions of Mirth and Gennius improve our competitiveness in the markets and provide new clients and expanded markets for Software and Related Solutions and also support our strategy to focus on accountable care organizations around interoperability, patient engagements, population health and collaborative care management, and enterprise analytics. We believe we are well-positioned within the evolving healthcare market to deliver products and services that address the growing importance of quality collaborative care and shift from fee-for-service to value-based, pay-for-performance care.\nWe believe that our operating results are attributed to a strong brand name and reputation within the marketplace for healthcare information technology software and services and investments in sales and marketing activities, including new marketing campaigns, Internet advertising investments, tradeshow attendance and other expanded advertising and marketing expenditures.\nRCM and Related Services\nRCM and Related Services revenue for the year ended March 31, 2017 decreased $0.5 million and gross profit increased $0.6 million compared to the prior year. The lower RCM revenue is due to customer attrition and a decline in new bookings. The increase in gross profit is due to a reduction in employee-related costs, partially offset by the lower revenues.\nRCM and Related Services revenue for the year ended March 31, 2016 increased $9.6 million and gross profit increased $6.2 million compared to the year ended March 31, 2015. The increase in RCM revenue was driven by the addition of new clients during the year and organic growth achieved through cross selling and ramping up of RCM services provided to our existing clients, which also resulted in higher gross profit.\nWe believe that a significant opportunity exists to continue cross selling RCM services to our existing clients. The portion of existing NextGen clients who are using RCM services is approximately 10%. We are actively pursuing efforts to achieve faster growth from expanded efforts to leverage our existing sales force towards selling RCM services. We also believe that ongoing increases in the complexity of medical billing and collections processes, including the migration to value-based reimbursement models, will create additional opportunities for RCM and Related Services.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nThe following table presents selected financial statistics and information for the years ended March 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015 (in thousands):\nTable 78: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal Year Ended March 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>37,673\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>36,473\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>130.585\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unused portion of revolving credit agreement (1)\n</td> <td>235,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>145,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total liquidity\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>272,673\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>181,473\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>130,585\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>18,241\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,657\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>27,332\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>110,592\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>40,796\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>82,758\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n_________________________\n(1) As of March 31, 2017, we had our outstanding loans of $15.0 million under our $250.0 million revolving credit agreement.\nOur principal sources of liquidity are our cash generated from operations, driven mostly by our net income and working capital management, our cash and cash equivalents, and our revolving credit agreement. In April 2017, we acquired Entrada for total cash consideration of approximately $34.0 million, subject to certain adjustments in accordance with the terms of the Agreement and Plan of Merger, which was primarily funded by a draw down of our revolving credit agreement. In May 2017, we paid $18.8 million to settle the contingent consideration liability related to the acquisition of HealthFusion.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nAs of March 31, 2017, our cash and cash equivalents balance of $37.7 million compares to $36.5 million of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities as of March 31, 2016. Our outstanding loans under our revolving credit agreement was $15.0 million as of March 31, 2017.\nWe may continue to use a portion of our funds as well as available financing from our revolving credit agreement for future acquisitions or other similar business activities, although the specific timing and amount of funds to be used is not currently determinable. We intend to expend some of our available funds for the development of products complementary to our existing product line as well as new versions of certain of our products. These developments are intended to take advantage of more powerful technologies and to increase the integration of our products.\nOur investment policy is determined by our Board of Directors. Excess cash, if any, may be invested in very liquid short term assets including tax exempt and taxable money market funds, certificates of deposit and short term municipal bonds with average maturities of 365 days or less at the time of purchase. Our Board of Directors continues to review alternate uses for our cash including an expansion of our investment policy and other items. Any or all of these programs could significantly impact our investment income in future periods.\nWe believe that our cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities on hand at March 31, 2017, together with our cash flows from operations and liquidity provided by our revolving credit agreement, will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure requirements for the next twelve months.\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\nThe following table summarizes our consolidated statements of cash flows for the years ended March 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015 (in thousands):\nTable 79: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal Year Ended March 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>18,241\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,657\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>27,332\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-cash expenses\n</td> <td>62,147\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>81,013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23,546\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash from net income, as adjusted\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>80,388\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>86,670\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>50,878\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Change in deferred revenue\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(5,493\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(8,390\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(5,610\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Change in accounts receivable\n</td> <td>5,535\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,929\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,744\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Change in other assets and liabilities\n</td> <td>30,162\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(47,413\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>32,746\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by operating activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>110,592\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>40,796\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>82,758\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor the year ended March 31, 2017, cash provided by operating activities increased $69.8 million compared to the prior year period. The increase in cash flows was primarily due to $77.6 million changes other assets and liabilities, as noted in the table above, of which $75.2 million was associated with changes in income taxes receivable and payable. Net cash provided from net income, as adjusted for non-cash expenses, decreased $6.3 million because the increase of $12.6 million in net income was offset by $18.9 million lower non-cash expenses. The decrease in non-cash expenses was due to a non-cash impairment charge of $32.2 million related to the discontinuation of the former NGNow development project recorded in the prior year, partially offset by higher amortization of intangibles associated with the acquisition of HealthFusion. Refer to the \"Net Income\" section above for additional details regarding the fluctuations in net income. Cash provided by operating activities increased $5.5 million due to an overall decline in accounts receivable from prior year as a result of higher current year collections and aggressive working capital management, which was offset by a $5.5 million associated with a decline in deferred revenue caused by lower system sales and a shift in market dynamics toward cloud-based solutions.\nFor the year ended March 31, 2016, cash provided by operating activities declined $42.0 million compared to the year ended March 31, 2015, which was caused by a $77.8 million decline attributed to changes in assets and liabilities, partially offset by an increase of $35.8 million in cash flows due to higher net income, excluding non-cash expenses. The reduction in cash flows due to changes in assets and liabilities is mostly attributed to payments of income taxes during the period and payments of accrued bonuses in the current fiscal year related to the fiscal 2015 incentive compensation plans.\nCash Flows from Investing Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities for the years ended March 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015 was $11.4 million, $190.4 million, and $24.5 million, respectively. The $179.0 million net decrease in cash used in investing activities for the year ended March 31, 2017 compared to the prior year is primarily due to $163.8 million of cash paid (net of cash acquired) for the acquisition of HealthFusion in January 2016, $7.1 million higher net proceeds from sales of marketable securities used to make principal payments on our revolving line of credit, $6.4 million decrease in additions to capitalized software associated with the discontinuation of the former NextGen Now development project, and $1.8 million decrease in additions to equipment and improvements.\nThe $165.9 million net increase in cash used in investing activities for the year ended March 31, 2016 compared to the year ended March 31, 2015 is primarily due to the $163.8 million of cash paid (net of cash acquired) for the acquisition of HealthFusion, $7.5 million increase in additions to equipment and improvements, $0.1 million increase in additions to capitalized\nsoftware, offset by a $3.2 million net proceeds from sales of marketable securities, and $2.3 million in cash paid for the acquisition of Gennius in the year ended March 31, 2015.\nCash Flows from Financing Activities\nNet cash used in financing activities for the year ended March 31, 2017 was $88.7 million compared to net cash provided by financing activities of $57.8 million in the prior year. The $146.5 million net increase in cash used in financing activities is due to $90.0 million in principal repayments on our revolving line of credit in the current year, compared to net proceeds of $105.0 million related to our revolving credit agreement in the prior year, partially offset by $42.9 million in dividends paid to shareholders and payments of $5.4 million in debt issuance and other related fees in the prior year.\nNet cash provided by financing activities for the year ended March 31, 2016 was $57.8 million, and cash used in financing activities for the year ended March 31, 2015 was $42.4 million. The increase in cash flows from financing activities during the year ended March 31, 2016 compared to the year ended March 31, 2015 is primarily related to our revolving credit agreement, in which we received proceeds of $173.5 million, made principal payments of $68.5 million, and paid $5.4 million in debt issuance and other related fees.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations at March 31, 2017 and the effect that such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash in future periods (in thousands):\nTable 80: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>For the year ended March 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Contractual Obligations\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> <td>2021\n</td> <td>2,022\n</td> <td>2023 and beyond\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating lease obligations\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>60,109\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8,136\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8,350\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8,067\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8,037\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,713\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>19,806\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Remaining lease obligations for vacated properties (1)\n</td> <td>6,599\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,487\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,413\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>794\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>816\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>551\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>538\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Line of credit obligations (Note 9)\n</td> <td>15,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Contingent consideration liabilities\n</td> <td>18,817\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18,817\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchase commitments (2)\n</td> <td>3,800\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,250\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,250\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,300\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>104,325\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>30,690\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>11,013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>10,161\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>23,853\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8,264\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>20,344\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n_______________________\n(1) Remaining lease obligations for vacated properties relates to remaining lease obligations at certain locations, including Austin, Solana Beach, Costa Mesa, and a portion of Horsham, that we have vacated and are actively marketing the locations for sublease as part of our reorganization efforts.

Our technology provides a customizable platform that empowers physician practice success, enriches the patient care experience and lowers the cost of healthcare.\nWe primarily derive revenue by developing and marketing software and services that automate certain aspects of practice management ( PM\u201d) and electronic health records ( EHR\u201d) for ambulatory care practices. In addition, our software and services facilitate interoperability. Our software can be licensed and delivered on-premise or in the cloud as software-as-a-service ( SaaS\u201d). Our services include maintenance and support, professional services, and complementary services such as managed cloud services, revenue cycle management ( RCM\u201d) and electronic data interchange ( EDI\u201d). We market and sell our solutions through a dedicated sales force and to a much lesser extent, through resellers. Our clients span the entire ambulatory market from large multi-specialty to small single specialty practices and include networks of practices such as physician hospital organizations ( PHOs\u201d), management service organizations ( MSOs\u201d), accountable care organizations ( ACOs\u201d), ambulatory care centers and community health centers.\nWe have a history of enhancing our solutions through both organic and inorganic activities. Over the last few years, we have entered into strategic transactions to complement and enhance our product portfolio in the ambulatory care market. In October 2015, we divested our former Hospital Solutions division. In January 2016, we acquired HealthFusion Holdings, Inc. (\"HealthFusion\") and in April 2017, we acquired Entrada, Inc. (\"Entrada\").\nQuality Systems, Inc. was incorporated in California in 1974. Our principal offices are located at 18111 Von Karman Ave., Suite 800, Irvine, California, 92612. Our websites are located at www.nextgen.com and www.qsii.com. We operate on a fiscal year ending on March 31.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe discussion and analysis of our consolidated financial statements and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\"GAAP\"). The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect our reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosures. We base our assumptions, estimates and judgments on historical experience, current trends, and other factors we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, and we evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis. On a regular basis, we review the accounting policies and update our assumptions, estimates, and judgments, as needed, to ensure that our consolidated financial statements are presented fairly and in accordance with GAAP. Actual results could differ materially from our estimates under different assumptions or conditions. To the extent that there are material differences between our estimates and actual results, our financial condition or results of operations will be affected.\nOur significant accounting policies, as described in Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d of our notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Report, should be read in conjunction with management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations. We believe that the following accounting policies are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results because application of such policies require significant judgment regarding the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain and that affect our consolidated financial statements.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe generate revenue from sales of licensing rights and subscriptions to our software products, hardware and third party software products, support and maintenance services, revenue cycle management and related services (\"RCM\"), electronic data interchange and data services ( EDI\u201d), and professional services, such as implementation, training, and consulting performed for clients who use our products.\nWe generally recognize revenue provided that persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, fees are considered fixed or determinable, delivery of the product or service has occurred, and collection is considered probable. Revenue from the delivered elements (generally software licenses) are generally recognized upon physical or electronic delivery. In certain transactions where collection is not considered probable, the revenue is deferred until collection occurs. If the fee is not fixed or determinable, then the revenue recognized in each period (subject to application of other revenue recognition criteria) will be the lesser of the aggregate amounts due and payable or the amount of the arrangement fee that would have been recognized if the fees were being recognized using the residual method. We assess whether fees are considered fixed or determinable at the inception of the arrangement and negotiated fees generally are based on a specific volume of products to be delivered and not subject to change based on variable pricing mechanisms, such as the number of units copied or distributed or the expected number of users.\nA typical system sale may contain multiple elements, but most often includes software licenses, maintenance and support, implementation and training. Revenue on arrangements involving multiple elements is generally allocated to each element using the residual method when evidence of fair value only exists for the undelivered elements. The fair value of an element is based on vendor-specific objective evidence ( VSOE\u201d), which is based on the price charged when the same element is sold separately. We generally establish VSOE for the related undelivered elements based on the bell-shaped curve method. VSOE is established on maintenance for certain clients based on stated renewal rates only if the rate is determined to be substantive and falls within our customary pricing practices. VSOE calculations are updated and reviewed on a quarterly or annual basis, depending on the nature of the product or service.\nUnder the residual method, we defer revenue related to the undelivered elements based on VSOE of fair value of each undelivered element and allocate the remainder of the contract price, net of all discounts, to the delivered elements. If VSOE of fair value of any undelivered element does not exist, all revenue is deferred until VSOE of fair value of the undelivered element is established or the element has been delivered.\nRevenue related to arrangements that include hosting services is recognized in accordance to the revenue recognition criteria described above only if the client has the contractual right to take possession of the software at any time without incurring a significant penalty, and it is feasible for the client to either host the software on its own equipment or through another third party. Otherwise, the arrangement is accounted for as a service contract in which the entire arrangement is deferred and recognized over the period that the hosting services are being provided.\nFrom time to time, we offer future purchase discounts on our products and services as part of our arrangements. Such discounts that are incremental to the range of discounts reflected in the pricing of the other elements of the arrangement, that are incremental to the range of discounts typically given in comparable transactions, and that are significant, are assessed as an additional element of the arrangement. Revenue deferred related to future purchase options are not recognized until either the client exercises the discount offer or the offer expires.\nRevenue from professional services, including implementation, training, and consulting services, are generally recognized as the corresponding services are performed. Revenue from software related subscription services and support and maintenance revenue are recognized ratably over the contractual service period. Revenue from EDI and data services and other transaction processing services are recognized at the time the services are provided to clients. Revenue from RCM and related services is derived from services fees for ongoing billing, collections, and other related services, and are generally calculated as a percentage of total client collections. We recognize RCM and related services revenue at the time collections are made by the client as the services fees are not fixed or determinable until such time.\nWe record revenue net of sales tax obligation in the consolidated statements of net income and comprehensive income.\nThe amount and timing of revenue recognized in a given period is affected by our judgment as to whether an arrangement includes multiple elements and if so, the allocation of revenue to each element. We generally apply the residual method for the revenue recognition of our multiple element arrangements and estimate the fair value of the undelivered elements based on VSOE. Establishing VSOE on our undelivered elements requires judgment. We establish VSOE for each undelivered element as the price charged when the same element is sold separately and generally evidenced when a substantial majority of historical standalone transactions fall within a reasonably narrow range using the bell-shaped curve method. In our determination of VSOE, we also consider service type, client type, and other variables. Our revenue recognition is based on our ability to maintain VSOE. Although not currently expected, certain events may occur, such as modification to or lack of consistency in our selling and pricing practices that could result in changes to our determination of VSOE. VSOE calculations are updated and reviewed on a quarterly or annual basis, depending on the nature of the product or service.\nWe also must apply judgment in determining the appropriate timing and recognition of certain revenue deferrals. In certain transactions where collection risk is high, the revenue is deferred until collection occurs. If the fee is not fixed or determinable, then\nthe revenue recognized in each period (subject to application of other revenue recognition criteria) will be the lesser of the aggregate amounts due and payable or the amount of the arrangement fee that would have been recognized if the fees were being recognized using the residual method. We assess whether fees are considered fixed or determinable at the inception of the arrangement and negotiated fees generally are based on a specific volume of products to be delivered and not subject to change based on variable pricing mechanisms, such as the number of units copied or distributed or the expected number of users.\nAlthough we currently believe that our approach to estimates and judgments as described herein is reasonable, actual results could differ and we may be exposed to increases or decreases in revenue that could be material.\nReserves on Accounts Receivable\nWe maintain reserves for potential sales returns and uncollectible accounts receivable. In aggregate, such reserves reduce our gross accounts receivable to its estimated net realizable value.\nOur standard contracts generally do not contain provisions for clients to return products or services. However, we historically have accepted sales returns under certain circumstances. Accordingly, we estimate sales return reserves, including reserves for returns and other credits, based upon the rate of historical returns by revenue type in relation to the corresponding gross revenues and recognize revenue, net of an allowance for sales returns. If we are unable to estimate the returns, revenue recognition may be delayed until the rights of return period lapses, provided also, that all other criteria for revenue recognition have been met. If we experience changes in practices related to sales returns or changes in actual return rates that deviate from the historical data on which our reserves had been established, our revenues may be adversely affected.\nAllowances for doubtful accounts and other uncollectible accounts receivable related to estimated losses resulting from our clients' inability to make required payments are established based on our historical experience of bad debt expense and the aging of our accounts receivable balances, net of deferred revenue and specifically reserved accounts. Specific reserves are based on our estimate of the probability of collection for certain troubled accounts. Accounts are written off as uncollectible only after we have expended extensive collection efforts.\nOur allowances for doubtful accounts are based on our assessment of the collectibility of client accounts. We regularly review the adequacy of these allowances by considering internal factors such as historical experience, credit quality and age of the client receivable balances as well as external factors such as economic conditions that may affect a client's ability to pay and review of major third-party credit-rating agencies, as needed. If a major client's creditworthiness or financial condition were to deteriorate, if actual defaults are higher than our historical experience, or if other circumstances arise, our estimates of the recoverability of amounts due to us could be overstated, and additional allowances could be required, which could have an adverse impact on our operating results.\nAlthough we currently believe that our approach to estimates and judgments as described herein is reasonable, actual results could differ and we may be exposed to increases or decreases in required reserves that could be material.\nSoftware Development Costs\nSoftware development costs, consisting primarily of employee salaries and benefits, incurred in the research and development of new software products and enhancements to existing software products for external sale are expensed as incurred, and reported as net research and development costs in the consolidated statements of net income and comprehensive income, until technological feasibility has been established. After technological feasibility is established, any additional external software development costs are capitalized. Amortization of capitalized software is recorded using the greater of the ratio of current revenues to the total of current and expected revenues of the related product or the straight-line method over the estimated economic life of the related product, which is typically three years. The total of capitalized software costs incurred in the development of products for external sale are reported as capitalized software costs within our consolidated balance sheets.\nWe also incur costs to develop software applications for our internal-use and costs for the development of Software as a Service (\"SaaS\") based products sold to our clients. The development costs of our SaaS-based products are considered internal-use for accounting purposes. Our internal-use capitalized costs are stated at cost and amortized using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which is typically three to seven years. Application development stage costs generally include costs associated with internal-use software configuration, coding, installation and testing. Costs related to the preliminary\nproject stage and post-implementation activities are expensed as incurred. Costs of significant upgrades and enhancements that result in additional functionality are also capitalized, whereas costs incurred for maintenance and minor upgrades and enhancements are expensed as incurred. Capitalized software costs for developing SaaS-based products are reported as capitalized software costs within our consolidated balance sheets and capitalized software costs for developing our internal-use software applications are reported as equipment and improvements within our consolidated balance sheets.\nWe periodically reassess the estimated economic life and the recoverability of our capitalized software costs. If a determination is made that capitalized amounts are not recoverable based on the estimated net cash flows to be generated from sales of the applicable software product, the amount by which the unamortized capitalized costs of a software product exceed the net realizable value is written off as a charge to earnings. The net realizable value is the estimated future gross revenues from that product\nreduced by the estimated future costs of completing and disposing of that product, including the costs of performing maintenance and client support required to satisfy our responsibility at the time of sale.\nDuring the year ended March 31, 2016, we recorded a $32.2 million non-cash impairment charge after making a determination that the previously capitalized software costs related to the NextGen Now development project was not recoverable. Refer to the \"Impairment of Assets\" section below for additional information.\nAlthough we currently believe that our approach to estimates and judgments as described herein is reasonable, actual results could differ and we may be exposed to increases or decreases in revenue that could be material.\nBusiness Combinations\nWe completed our acquisition of HealthFusion during the year ended March 31, 2017, which was accounted for as a purchase business combination using the acquisition method of accounting.\nIn accordance with the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations, we allocate the purchase price of acquired businesses to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on estimated fair values. Our purchase price allocation methodology contains uncertainties because it requires us to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities, including, but not limited to, intangible assets, goodwill, and contingent consideration liabilities. We estimate the fair value of assets and liabilities based upon quoted market prices, the carrying value of the acquired assets and widely accepted valuation techniques, including discounted cash flows and market multiple analyses depending on the nature of the assets being sold. We estimate the fair value of the contingent consideration liabilities based on the probability of achieving certain business milestones and/or management's forecast of expected results. The process for estimating fair values in many cases requires the use of significant estimates, assumptions and judgments, including determining the timing and estimates of future cash flows and developing appropriate discount rates. Unanticipated events or circumstances may occur which could affect the accuracy of our fair value estimates, including assumptions regarding industry economic factors and business strategies. Any adjustments to fair value subsequent to the measurement period are reflected in the consolidated statements of net income and comprehensive income.\nWe currently do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to complete the purchase price allocation and estimate the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities. However, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions, we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material\nGoodwill\nGoodwill acquired in a business combination is measured as the excess of the purchase price, or consideration transferred, over the net acquisition date fair values of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. Goodwill is not amortized as it has been determined to have an indefinite useful life.\nWe test goodwill for impairment annually during our first fiscal quarter, referred to as the annual test date. We will also test for impairment between annual test dates if an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate the carrying amount may be impaired. Impairment testing for goodwill is performed at a reporting-unit level, which is defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment (referred to as a component). A component of an operating segment is a reporting unit if the component constitutes a business for which discrete financial information is available and segment management regularly reviews the operating results of that component.\nAs part of our annual goodwill impairment test, we first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If we conclude that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, we conduct a two-step quantitative goodwill impairment test. The first step of the impairment test involves comparing the fair values of the applicable reporting units with their carrying values. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds the reporting unit's fair value, we perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test. The second step of the goodwill impairment test involves comparing the implied fair value of the affected reporting unit's goodwill with the carrying value of that goodwill. The amount by which the carrying value of the goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, if any, is recognized as an impairment loss.\nApplication of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units, assignment of goodwill to reporting units, and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit. The fair value of each reporting unit is estimated primarily through the use of a discounted cash flow methodology. This analysis requires significant judgments, including estimation of future cash flows, which is dependent on internal forecasts, estimation of the long-term rate of growth for our business, estimation of the useful life over which cash flows will occur, and determination of our weighted average cost of capital.\nThe estimates used to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit change from year to year based on operating results, market conditions, and other factors. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and goodwill impairment for each reporting unit.\nWe currently do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to test for impairment losses on goodwill. However, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions, we may be exposed to future impairment charges that could be material.\nIntangible Assets\nIntangible assets consist of trade names and contracts, customer relationships, and software technology, all of which arose in connection with our acquisitions.\nThese intangible assets are recorded at fair value and are stated net of accumulated amortization. We currently amortize intangible assets using a method that reflects the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible asset are consumed.\nAlthough currently we believe that our approach to estimates and judgments as described herein is reasonable, actual results could differ and we may be exposed to decreases in the fair value of our intangible assets, resulting in impairment charges that could be material. We test intangible assets for impairment if we believe indicators of impairment exist.\nShare-Based Compensation\nWe record share-based compensation related to our employee stock options plans, employee share purchase plans, restricted stock awards, and restricted performance stock awards and shares. See Note 13, Share-Based Awards,\u201d of our notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Report for a complete discussion of our stock-based compensation plans.\nShare-based compensation expense associated with the stock options under our equity incentive plans is based on the number of options expected to vest. We estimate the fair value of stock options on the date of grant using the Black Scholes option-pricing model based on required inputs, including expected term, volatility, risk-free rate, and expected dividend yield. Expected term is estimated based upon the historical exercise behavior and represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding and therefore the proportion of awards that is expected to vest. Volatility is estimated by using the weighted-average historical volatility of our common stock, which approximates expected volatility. The risk-free rate is the implied yield available on the U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with remaining terms equal to the expected term. The expected dividend yield is the average dividend rate during a period equal to the expected term of the option. The fair value vest is recognized ratably as expense over the requisite service period in our consolidated statements of net income and comprehensive income.\nShare-based compensation expense associated with restricted stock awards is estimated using the market price of the common stock on the date of grant. Share-based compensation expense associated with the restricted performance stock awards and shares is based on the grant date fair value measured at the underlying closing share price on the date of grant using a Monte Carlo-based valuation model.\nWe currently do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to determine share-based compensation expense. However, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions, we may be exposed to changes in share-based compensation expense that could be material.\nTrends and Events in Our Business\nWe believe that the following trends and events as described below have contributed to our consolidated results of operations and may continue to impact our future results.\nWe believe healthcare is more heavily influenced by regulatory and national health projects than by the cycles of our economy. The healthcare industry has been significantly impacted by the Obama Administration's broad healthcare reform efforts, including the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health portion of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (\"HITECH Act\") and the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (\"ACA\") that provided significant incentives to health care organizations for \"Meaningful Use\" adoption and interoperable electronic health record solutions.\nWe also believe that healthcare reform, including the repeal of the sustainable growth rate (SGR) formula as part of the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015 (\"MACRA\"), and a movement towards a value-based, pay-for-performance model and quality initiative efforts will stimulate demand for robust electronic health record solutions as well as new health information technology solutions from bundled billing capabilities to patient engagement and population health management. We believe MACRA may be the most important of the three regulations for our market because it permanently changes how ambulatory healthcare providers are reimbursed by Medicare. It offers certainty and a timeline for the market's move away from volume-based, fee-for-service models to value-based payment models that reward the delivery of lower cost, high quality care.\nWhile we expect to benefit from the increasing demands for greater efficiency as well as government support for increased adoption of electronic health records, the market for physician based electronic health records software is becoming increasingly saturated while physician group practices are rapidly being consolidated by hospitals, insurance payers and other entities. Hospital software providers are leveraging their position with their hospital clients to gain market share with hospital owned physician practices. Insurance providers and large physician groups are also consolidating physician offices creating additional opportunity for ambulatory software providers like us. Our strategy is to focus on addressing the growing needs of accountable care organizations around interoperability, patient engagements, population health, and data analytics.\nWe believe that our core strength lies in the central role our software products and services play in the delivery of healthcare by the primary physician in an ambulatory setting. We intend to remain at the forefront of upcoming new regulatory requirements and meaningful use requirements for stimulus payments. We intend to continue the development and enhancement of our software solutions to support healthcare reform, such as the recently enacted MACRA, which promotes the transition from fee-for-service to value-based, pay-for-performance and patient-centric and quality initiatives such as accountable care organizations. Key elements of our future software development will be to expand our interoperability capabilities enhancing the competitiveness of our software offerings, make our products more intuitive and easy to use, and to enhance the capability of our MediTouch\u00ae Platform to allow us to deliver our software over the cloud to larger ambulatory care practices.\nWe have a history of enhancing our solutions through both organic and inorganic activities. Over the last few years, we have entered into strategic transactions to complement and enhance our product portfolio in the ambulatory care market. In October 2015, we divested our former Hospital Solutions division. In January 2016, we acquired HealthFusion Holdings, Inc. (\"HealthFusion\") and in April 2017, we acquired Entrada, Inc. (\"Entrada\").\nWe continue to evaluate the organizational structure of our company with the objective of achieving greater synergies and further integration of our products and services, in support of our business strategies. In fiscal year 2016, we initiated a three-phase plan intended to better position our organization for future success. In the first phase, we redesigned the organization to more effectively support the execution of our strategy. This phase included implementing a series of actions with the objective of enabling a more efficient, integrated and client-centered delivery of the holistic solutions that we believe is required by our ambulatory care clients. During this phase, we transformed our management team with the appointment of a new Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Technology Officer, Chief Operating Officer, and Chief Strategy Officer. Under phase two of our reorganization, we have continued to build our infrastructure and enhance our healthcare information technology capabilities to drive future revenue growth. The phase includes a multi-year initiative, called NextGen 2.0, to merge our business units into a more streamlined, functional-based organization structure and to realign our organizational structure by consolidating the sales, marketing, information services, and software development responsibilities into single, company-wide roles to achieve greater efficiency. The third phase of the plan will consist of developing and marketing the services and solutions that we believe will accelerate revenue growth. The first phase was completed in April 2016, when we announced a corporate restructuring plan, which was approved by our Board of Directors.\nThe overall plan also includes a multi-year initiative, called NextGen 2.0, to merge our business units into a more streamlined, functional-based organization structure and to realign our organizational structure by consolidating the sales, marketing, information services, and software development responsibilities into single, company-wide roles to achieve greater efficiency.\nUnder our reorganization plan, we incurred approximately $7,078 of reorganization-related charges in the year ended March 31, 2017, consisting principally of severance, other one-time termination benefits, and facilities-related costs.\nWe have and intend to continue investments in our infrastructure, including but not limited to maintaining and expanding sales, marketing and product development activities to improve patient care and reduce healthcare costs, providing industry-leading, integrated clinical and administrative healthcare data systems, services, and expertise to clinical, medical, technology, and healthcare business professionals while continuing our strong commitment of service in support of our client satisfaction programs. These investments in our infrastructure will continue while maintaining reasonable expense discipline. We strive to add new clients and expand our relationship with existing clients through delivery of add-on and complementary products and\nservices and believe that our client base that is using our software on a daily basis is a strategic asset. We intend to leverage this strategic asset by expanding our product and service offerings towards this client base.\nLed by our vision and mission, we are resetting our strategy and structure to deliver value to our clients. To achieve a lower-cost, increased capability structure, our new management team is building what we believe is an aligned, client-focused organization, supported by a recurring revenue stream and a large and diverse existing client base.\nWe strive to be the trusted partner for clients of all sizes, integrating services and software into a consolidated solution that enables an efficient and effective caregiver and patient experience while driving positive financial outcomes. As a healthcare information technology and services company, we plan to continue investing in our current capabilities as well as building and/or acquiring new capabilities as we guide our clients through an evolving healthcare marketplace that is transitioning from fee-for-service to fee-for-value reimbursement models. With approximately 90,000 providers using our solutions, we are enabling care and believe we can truly transform the delivery of care through the following strategic priorities, including focus on the ambulatory client segment, platform as a service, and population health software and services. Refer to Item 1. Business\u201d included elsewhere in this Report for additional information on each of our strategic priorities.\nAs a healthcare information technology and services company, we plan to continue investing in our current capabilities as well as building and/or acquiring new capabilities as we guide our clients from fee-for-service to fee-for-value payer reimbursement models. With approximately 90,000 providers using our solutions, we are enabling care and believe we can truly transform the delivery of care.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table sets forth the percentage of revenue represented by each item in our consolidated statements of net income and comprehensive income for the years ended March 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015 (certain percentages below may not sum due to rounding): \nRevenues\nThe following table presents our consolidated revenues for the years ended March 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015 (in thousands): \nWe generate revenue from sales of licensing rights and subscriptions to our software products, hardware and third party software products, support and maintenance services, revenue cycle management and related services (\"RCM\"), electronic data interchange and data services ( EDI\u201d), and professional services, such as implementation, training, and consulting performed for clients who use our products.\nConsolidated revenue for the year ended March 31, 2017 increased $17.1 million compared to the prior year due mostly to a $31.6 million increase in software related subscription services and $6.6 million increase in EDI, partially offset by a $9.3 million decrease in professional services, $6.4 million decrease in support and maintenance, $5.0 million decrease in software license and hardware, and $0.5 million decrease in RCM. The increase in software related subscription services was primarily driven by a full year of sales related to the MediTouch\u00ae cloud-based solution acquired from HealthFusion in January 2016, combined with growth in subscriptions related to our interoperability, patient portal, and QSIDental Web product offerings as we continue to expand our client base. The increase in EDI is partially attributed to the acquisition of HealthFusion and growth in EDI transaction volume due to addition of new clients and further penetration of our existing client base. The decline in software license and hardware revenue was mostly caused by a shift in market dynamics toward cloud-based solutions and away from perpetual license arrangements, which has also resulted in lower demand for our professional services, including implementation, training, and consulting services. The decline in support and maintenance is due primarily to the disposition of the former Hospital Solutions division in October 2015, which accounted for $5.3 million of the decrease, and net attrition in products sold with accompanying maintenance. The lower RCM revenue is due to customer attrition and a decline in new bookings.\nConsolidated revenue for the year ended March 31, 2016 increased $2.3 million compared to the year ended March 31, 2015 due to higher software related subscription services, RCM, and EDI revenue, partially offset by lower software license and hardware, professional services, and support and maintenance revenue. The $11.1 million decline in software license and hardware revenue compared to the year ended March 31, 2015 reflects the increasingly saturated end-market for electronic health records software and the disposition of the former Hospital Solutions division, which contributed to $1.9 million of the total decrease in software license and hardware revenue. Software related subscription services revenue increased $10.8 million compared to the year ended March 31, 2015 primarily due to additional revenues from the acquisition of HealthFusion, combined with growth in subscriptions related to our interoperability, patient portal, and QSIDental Web product offerings, offset by a $1.9 million decrease primarily related to the disposition of the former Hospital Solutions division. Support and maintenance revenue decreased $4.0 million, which consists of a $4.9 million decrease related to the former Hospital Solutions division, partially offset by growth in support and maintenance related to our interoperability solutions and other ambulatory software products. RCM and EDI revenue grew by $8.8 million and $6.0 million, respectively, compared to the year ended March 31, 2015, due to addition of new clients and further penetration of our existing client base. The acquisition of HealthFusion also partially contributed to the increase in EDI revenues. Professional services revenue decreased $8.2 million compared to the year ended March 31, 2015, due to the recent decline in system sales, resulting in lower client demand for our core software products and related implementation, training, and consulting services. The disposition of the former Hospital Solutions division also contributed to $1.7 million of the decrease in professional services revenue compared to the year ended March 31, 2015.\nConsolidated bookings reflect the estimated annual value of our executed contracts and are adjusted to include the effect of pre-acquisition bookings for HealthFusion and exclude the historical impact of the former Hospital Solutions division. For the year ended March 31, 2017, consolidated bookings were $125.5 million, which decreased compared to $141.7 million in the prior year primarily due to lower sales of perpetual license arrangements associated with a shift in market dynamics and a decline in new RCM bookings, as described above. Consolidated bookings decreased in the year ended March 31, 2016 compared to $175.4 million in the year ended March 31, 2015, which was primarily driven by lower sales of perpetual license arrangements.\nRecurring service revenue, consisting of software related subscription services, support and maintenance, RCM, and EDI, represented 82%, 78%, and 74% of total revenue for the years ended March 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively.\nWe expect to benefit from the growth of a replacement market driven by an expected consolidation of electronic health records vendors. We also anticipate the creation of new opportunities in connection with the evolution of healthcare from a fee-for-services reimbursement model to a pay-for-performance model around the management of patient populations. Through our acquisition of HealthFusion in January 2016, we obtained a highly scalable, pure cloud-based and mobile-enabled platform with capabilities that we intend to expand to serve the requirements of larger ambulatory practices. When combined with our Mirth-branded products, we can offer our clients a full suite of cloud-based solutions that better enable our clients to focus on care delivery. While it remains difficult to assess the relative impact or the timing of positive and negative trends affecting the aforementioned market opportunities, we believe we are well positioned to remain a leader in serving the evolving market needs for healthcare information technology.\nGross Profit\nThe following table presents our consolidated cost of revenue and gross profit for the years ended March 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015 (in thousands): \nCost of revenue consists primarily of compensation expense, including share-based compensation, for personnel that deliver our products and services. Cost of revenue also includes amortization of capitalized software costs and acquired technology, third party consultant and outsourcing costs, costs associated with our EDI business partners and clearinghouses, hosting service costs, third party software costs and royalties, and other costs directly associated with delivering our products and services. Refer to Note 7, \"Intangible Assets\" and Note 8, \"Capitalized Software Costs\" of our notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Report for additional information on current period amortization of capitalized software costs and acquired technology and an estimate of future expected amortization.\nShare-based compensation expense included in cost of revenue was $0.5 million, $0.4 million, and $0.4 million for the years ended March 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively, and is included in the amounts in the table above.\nGross profit for the year ended March 31, 2017 increased $19.6 million compared to the prior year due primarily to the higher revenues as discussed above, combined with a $2.5 million decrease in cost of revenue. Cost of revenue decreased due to lower payroll costs associated with delivering support and maintenance and professional services and lower amortization of previously capitalized software development costs that became fully amortized during the year, partially offset by higher amortization of the software technology intangible asset acquired from HealthFusion. The increase in the gross margin percentage to 56.2% for the year ended March 31, 2017 compared to 54.2% in the prior year period primarily reflects higher profitability related to sales of the MediTouch\u00ae cloud-based solution acquired from HealthFusion in January 2016, offset by lower profitability of professional services as the demand for such services have declined at a quicker pace than the associated payroll costs.\nGross profit decreased $0.2 million for the year ended March 31, 2016 compared to the year ended March 31, 2015 due primarily to a decline in high-margin software license sales associated with the market saturation noted above and a decline in gross profit associated with the disposition of the former Hospital Solutions division, offset by increases in gross profit associated with higher software and related subscription services, RCM, and EDI revenues and contributions to gross profit from the acquisition of HealthFusion.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expense\nThe following table presents our consolidated selling, general and administrative expense for the years ended March 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015 (in thousands):\n\nSelling, general and administrative expense consist of compensation expense, including share-based compensation, for management and administrative personnel, selling and marketing expense, facilities costs, depreciation, professional service fees, including legal and accounting services, acquisition and transaction-related costs, and other general corporate and administrative expenses.\nShare-based compensation expense included in selling, general and administrative expenses was $6.1 million, $2.6 million, and $2.7 million for the years ended March 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively, and is included in the amounts in the table above. The increase in share-based compensation expense for the year ended March 31, 2017 compared to the prior year is due to higher issuances of equity awards to officers and employees as incentive compensation. Refer to Note 13, \"Share-Based Awards\" of our notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Report for additional information on equity award grants.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses increased $7.4 million for the year ended March 31, 2017 compared to the prior year primarily due to higher incremental costs associated with HealthFusion acquired in January 2016, higher legal expense related to shareholder litigation, partially offset by lower payroll costs associated with our reorganization efforts and lower acquisition costs.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended March 31, 2016 decreased $1.9 million compared to the year ended March 31, 2015 primarily due to a $6.3 million decrease in legal expenses associated mostly with shareholder litigation defense costs (net of insurance recoveries), a $2.1 million decrease in sales commissions related to a decline in new system sales, a $1.5 million decrease in equipment and software maintenance expense, and a $0.7 million decrease in facilities and utilities expense, offset by a $2.7 million increase in bad debt expense, a $2.7 million increase in salaries and benefits, $2.3 million higher transaction costs associated mostly with the acquisition of HealthFusion and a $1.8 million loss on the disposition of the former Hospital Solutions division (including related incremental direct costs).\nResearch and Development Costs, net\nThe following table presents our consolidated net research and development costs, capitalized software costs, and gross expenditures prior to capitalization, for the years ended March 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015 (in thousands): \nGross research and development expenditures, including costs expensed and costs capitalized, consist of compensation expense, including share-based compensation for research and development personnel, certain third-party consultant fees, software maintenance costs, and other costs related to new product development and enhancement to our existing products. We intend to continue to invest heavily in research and development expenses as we continue to bring additional functionality and features to the medical community and develop a new integrated inpatient and outpatient, web-based software platform.\nThe capitalization of software development costs results in a reduction to our reported net research and development costs. Our software capitalization rate, or capitalized software costs as a percentage of gross expenditures, has varied historically and may continue to vary based on the nature and status of specific projects and initiatives in progress. Although changes in software capitalization rates have no impact on our overall cash flows, it results in fluctuations in the amount of software development costs being expensed up front and the amount of net research and development costs reported in our consolidated statement of net income and comprehensive income.\nShare-based compensation expense included in research and development costs was $1.0 million, $0.3 million, and $0.4 million for the years ended March 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively, and is included in the amounts in the table above.\nNet research and development costs for the year ended March 31, 2017 increased $12.7 million compared to the prior year due to a $6.3 million increase in our gross expenditures, combined with a $6.4 million decrease in capitalized software costs. The increase in gross expenditures is primarily the result of incremental costs from HealthFusion and higher costs related to development of the next versions of our software products, partially offset by lower gross expenditures from the discontinuation of the former NextGen Now development project during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 and lower personnel costs associated with our reorganization efforts. The reduction in capitalized software costs and rate of software capitalization is primarily due to the discontinuation of the former NextGen Now development project and the recent releases of the next major version of our core software products. Our software capitalization rate fluctuates due to differences in the nature and status of our projects and initiatives during a given year, which affects the amount of development costs that may be capitalized.\nNet research and development costs for the year ended March 31, 2016 decreased $3.6 million compared to the year ended March 31, 2015 primarily due to lower gross expenditures related to the former NextGen Now development project, which was discontinued during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. Refer to the \"Impairment of Assets\" section below for additional information.\nAmortization of Acquired Intangible Assets\nThe following table presents our amortization of acquired intangible assets for the years ended March 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015 (in thousands): \nAmortization of acquired intangible assets included in operating expense consist of the amortization related to our customer relationships, trade name, and contracts intangible assets acquired as part of our business combinations. Refer to Note 7, \"Intangible Assets\" of our notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Report for an estimate of future expected amortization.\nAmortization of acquired intangible assets for the year ended March 31, 2017 increased $5.1 million, compared to the prior year period due to additional amortization of the customer relationships and trade name intangible assets related to the acquisition of HealthFusion. Amortization of acquired intangible assets for the year ended March 31, 2016 increased $1.7 million compared to the prior year due to additional amortization of the customer relationships and trade name intangible assets related to the acquisition of HealthFusion.\nImpairment of Assets\nDuring the year ended March 31, 2016, we recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $32.2 million that is reflected within the impairment of assets caption in our consolidated statements of net income and comprehensive income. The impairment relates to the previously capitalized investment in the former NextGen Now development project, which we had deemed to have zero net realizable value. The impairment charge did not result in any cash expenditures. The impairment charge followed our assessment of the NextGen Now development project and the MediTouch platform that we obtained through our acquisition of HealthFusion. We had determined that the MediTouch platform offered the most efficient path to providing a high-quality, robust, cloud-based solution for ambulatory care and decided to cease further investment in NextGen Now and immediately discontinued all efforts to use or repurpose the NextGen Now platform.\nRestructuring Costs\nDuring the year ended March 31, 2017, we recorded $7.1 million of restructuring costs within operating expenses in our consolidated statements of net income and comprehensive income. The restructuring costs resulted from a restructuring plan that we announced in April 2016, and such costs consist primarily of payroll-related costs, such as severance, outplacement costs, and continuing healthcare coverage, associated with the involuntary separation of employees pursuant to a one-time benefit arrangement. Also included in restructuring costs was $1.7 million of facilities-related costs associated with accruals for the remaining lease obligations at certain locations, including Solana Beach, Costa Mesa, and a portion of Horsham with contractual lease terms ending between January 2018 and September 2023. We have vacated each of the locations or portions thereof and are actively marketing the locations for sublease. As of March 31, 2017, the remaining restructuring liability associated with payroll-related costs was $0.6 million, which we expect to settle in the first quarter of fiscal 2018, and the remaining lease obligation, net of estimated projected sublease rentals, was $2.3 million. Refer to Note 14, \"Commitments, Guarantees, and Contingencies,\" of our notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Report for estimated timing of payments related to remaining lease obligations. The restructuring plan was substantially complete by the end of fiscal 2017.\nThe restructuring is part of a three-phase plan initiated in fiscal year 2016 that was intended to better position our organization for future success. In the first phase, we redesigned the organization to more effectively support the execution of our strategy. This phase included implementing a series of actions with the objective of enabling a more efficient, integrated and client-centered delivery of the holistic solutions that we believe is required by our ambulatory care clients. During this phase, we transformed our management team with the appointment of a new Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Technology Officer, Chief Operating Officer, and Chief Strategy Officer. Under phase two of our reorganization, we have continued to build our infrastructure and enhance our healthcare information technology capabilities to drive future revenue growth. The third phase of the plan will consist of developing and marketing the services and solutions that we believe will accelerate revenue growth.\nThe overall plan also includes a multi-year initiative, called NextGen 2.0, to merge our business units into a more streamlined, functional-based organization structure and to realign our organizational structure by consolidating the sales, marketing, information services, and software development responsibilities into single, company-wide roles to achieve greater efficiency. As a result, our reportable segments have changed and may change again due to such changes in the organization of our business.\nRefer to Note 15, \"Restructuring Plan\" of our notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Report for additional information.\nInterest and Other Income and Expense\nThe following table presents our interest expense for the for the years ended March 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015 (in thousands):\n\nInterest income relates primarily to our marketable securities. Interest expense relates to our revolving credit agreement that was entered into in January 2016 and the related amortization of deferred debt issuance costs. Refer to Note 9, Line of Credit\u201d of our notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Report for additional information. Other expense and income relates primarily to net realized gains and losses on our marketable securities.\nInterest expense for the year ended March 31, 2017 increased $1.9 million compared to the prior year, and interest expense for the year ended March 31, 2016 increased $1.0 million compared to the year ended March 31, 2015. The increases in interest expense is associated with our revolving credit agreement entered into in January 2016 and the related amortization of deferred debt issuance costs. As of March 31, 2017, we had $15.0 million in outstanding loans under the revolving credit agreement.\nAll other fluctuations in interest and other income and expense are not deemed significant.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nThe following table presents our provision for income taxes for the years ended March 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015 (in thousands): \nThe effective tax rate for the year ended March 31, 2017 increased compared to the prior year primarily because the lower income before taxes in the prior year caused the rate reconciling items to have a more significant impact to the effective tax rate.\nThe effective tax rate for the year ended March 31, 2016 decreased compared to the year ended March 31, 2015 primarily as a result of favorable tax benefits from the federal research and development tax credit and other permanent items having a more significant effective tax rate impact due to lower income before taxes for the year ended March 31, 2016. The Internal Revenue Service statute related to research and development credits expired on December 31, 2014 and was retroactively reinstated and made permanent in December 2015. The research and development credits claimed for the year ended March 31, 2016 represent credits for the twelve-month period.\nRefer to Note 11, Income Tax\u201d of our notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Report for a reconciliation of the federal statutory income tax rate to our effective tax rate.\nNet Income\nThe following table presents our net income (in thousands) and net income per share and for the years ended March 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015: \nAs a result of the foregoing changes in revenue and expense, net income for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017 increased $12.6 million compared to the prior year period.\nAs a result of the foregoing changes in revenue and expense, net income for the year ended March 31, 2016 decreased $21.7 million compared to the year ended March 31, 2015. The significant decrease is primarily due to the $32.2 million impairment of previously capitalized software costs related to the former NextGen Now development project, offset by a decrease in provision for income taxes as a result of lower pre-tax net income.\nOperating Segment Information\nEffective July 1, 2016, we revised our reportable operating segments. As part of our ongoing reorganization efforts, we refined the measurement of our segment data to better reflect our current internal organizational structure whereby certain functions that formerly existed", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nExcept for the historical information contained herein, the matters discussed in this management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ( MD&A\u201d), including discussions of our product development plans, business strategies and market factors influencing our results, may include forward-looking statements that involve certain risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ from those anticipated by us as a result of various factors, both foreseen and unforeseen, including, but not limited to, our ability to continue to develop new products and increase systems sales in markets characterized by rapid technological evolution, consolidation and competition from larger, better-capitalized competitors. Many other economic, competitive, governmental and technological factors could affect our ability to achieve our goals and interested persons are urged to review any risks that may be described in Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d as set forth herein, as well as in our other public disclosures and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\").\nThis MD&A is provided as a supplement to the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K (\"Report\") in order to enhance your understanding of our results of operations and financial condition and should be read in conjunction with, and is qualified in its entirety by, the consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included elsewhere in this Report. Historical results of operations, percentage margin fluctuations and any trends that may be inferred from the discussion below are not necessarily indicative of the operating results for any future period.\nCompany Overview\nQuality Systems, Inc., known to our clients as NextGen Healthcare, provides software, services and analytics solutions to the ambulatory care market. We are a healthcare information technology and services company that delivers the foundational capabilities to organizations that want to promote healthy communities. Our technology provides a customizable platform that empowers physician practice success, enriches the patient care experience and lowers the cost of healthcare.\nWe primarily derive revenue by developing and marketing software and services that automate certain aspects of practice management ( PM\u201d) and electronic health records ( EHR\u201d) for ambulatory care practices. In addition, our software and services facilitate interoperability. Our software can be licensed and delivered on-premise or in the cloud as software-as-a-service ( SaaS\u201d). Our services include maintenance and support, professional services, and complementary services such as managed cloud services, revenue cycle management ( RCM\u201d) and electronic data interchange ( EDI\u201d). We market and sell our solutions through a dedicated sales force and to a much lesser extent, through resellers. Our clients span the entire ambulatory market from large multi-specialty to small single specialty practices and include networks of practices such as physician hospital organizations ( PHOs\u201d), management service organizations ( MSOs\u201d), accountable care organizations ( ACOs\u201d), ambulatory care centers and community health centers.\nWe have a history of enhancing our solutions through both organic and inorganic activities. Over the last few years, we have entered into strategic transactions to complement and enhance our product portfolio in the ambulatory care market. In October 2015, we divested our former Hospital Solutions division. In January 2016, we acquired HealthFusion Holdings, Inc. (\"HealthFusion\") and in April 2017, we acquired Entrada, Inc. (\"Entrada\").\nQuality Systems, Inc. was incorporated in California in 1974. Our principal offices are located at 18111 Von Karman Ave., Suite 800, Irvine, California, 92612. Our websites are located at www.nextgen.com and www.qsii.com. We operate on a fiscal year ending on March 31.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe discussion and analysis of our consolidated financial statements and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\"GAAP\"). The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect our reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosures. We base our assumptions, estimates and judgments on historical experience, current trends, and other factors we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, and we evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis. On a regular basis, we review the accounting policies and update our assumptions, estimates, and judgments, as needed, to ensure that our consolidated financial statements are presented fairly and in accordance with GAAP. Actual results could differ materially from our estimates under different assumptions or conditions. To the extent that there are material differences between our estimates and actual results, our financial condition or results of operations will be affected.\nOur significant accounting policies, as described in Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d of our notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Report, should be read in conjunction with management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations. We believe that the following accounting policies are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results because application of such policies require significant judgment regarding the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain and that affect our consolidated financial statements.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe generate revenue from sales of licensing rights and subscriptions to our software products, hardware and third party software products, support and maintenance services, revenue cycle management and related services (\"RCM\"), electronic data interchange and data services ( EDI\u201d), and professional services, such as implementation, training, and consulting performed for clients who use our products.\nWe generally recognize revenue provided that persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, fees are considered fixed or determinable, delivery of the product or service has occurred, and collection is considered probable. Revenue from the delivered elements (generally software licenses) are generally recognized upon physical or electronic delivery. In certain transactions where collection is not considered probable, the revenue is deferred until collection occurs. If the fee is not fixed or determinable, then the revenue recognized in each period (subject to application of other revenue recognition criteria) will be the lesser of the aggregate amounts due and payable or the amount of the arrangement fee that would have been recognized if the fees were being recognized using the residual method. We assess whether fees are considered fixed or determinable at the inception of the arrangement and negotiated fees generally are based on a specific volume of products to be delivered and not subject to change based on variable pricing mechanisms, such as the number of units copied or distributed or the expected number of users.\nA typical system sale may contain multiple elements, but most often includes software licenses, maintenance and support, implementation and training. Revenue on arrangements involving multiple elements is generally allocated to each element using the residual method when evidence of fair value only exists for the undelivered elements. The fair value of an element is based on vendor-specific objective evidence ( VSOE\u201d), which is based on the price charged when the same element is sold separately. We generally establish VSOE for the related undelivered elements based on the bell-shaped curve method. VSOE is established on maintenance for certain clients based on stated renewal rates only if the rate is determined to be substantive and falls within our customary pricing practices. VSOE calculations are updated and reviewed on a quarterly or annual basis, depending on the nature of the product or service.\nUnder the residual method, we defer revenue related to the undelivered elements based on VSOE of fair value of each undelivered element and allocate the remainder of the contract price, net of all discounts, to the delivered elements. If VSOE of fair value of any undelivered element does not exist, all revenue is deferred until VSOE of fair value of the undelivered element is established or the element has been delivered.\nRevenue related to arrangements that include hosting services is recognized in accordance to the revenue recognition criteria described above only if the client has the contractual right to take possession of the software at any time without incurring a significant penalty, and it is feasible for the client to either host the software on its own equipment or through another third party. Otherwise, the arrangement is accounted for as a service contract in which the entire arrangement is deferred and recognized over the period that the hosting services are being provided.\nFrom time to time, we offer future purchase discounts on our products and services as part of our arrangements. Such discounts that are incremental to the range of discounts reflected in the pricing of the other elements of the arrangement, that are incremental to the range of discounts typically given in comparable transactions, and that are significant, are assessed as an additional element of the arrangement. Revenue deferred related to future purchase options are not recognized until either the client exercises the discount offer or the offer expires.\nRevenue from professional services, including implementation, training, and consulting services, are generally recognized as the corresponding services are performed. Revenue from software related subscription services and support and maintenance revenue are recognized ratably over the contractual service period. Revenue from EDI and data services and other transaction processing services are recognized at the time the services are provided to clients. Revenue from RCM and related services is derived from services fees for ongoing billing, collections, and other related services, and are generally calculated as a percentage of total client collections. We recognize RCM and related services revenue at the time collections are made by the client as the services fees are not fixed or determinable until such time.\nWe record revenue net of sales tax obligation in the consolidated statements of net income and comprehensive income.\nThe amount and timing of revenue recognized in a given period is affected by our judgment as to whether an arrangement includes multiple elements and if so, the allocation of revenue to each element. We generally apply the residual method for the revenue recognition of our multiple element arrangements and estimate the fair value of the undelivered elements based on VSOE. Establishing VSOE on our undelivered elements requires judgment. We establish VSOE for each undelivered element as the price charged when the same element is sold separately and generally evidenced when a substantial majority of historical standalone transactions fall within a reasonably narrow range using the bell-shaped curve method. In our determination of VSOE, we also consider service type, client type, and other variables. Our revenue recognition is based on our ability to maintain VSOE. Although not currently expected, certain events may occur, such as modification to or lack of consistency in our selling and pricing practices that could result in changes to our determination of VSOE. VSOE calculations are updated and reviewed on a quarterly or annual basis, depending on the nature of the product or service.\nWe also must apply judgment in determining the appropriate timing and recognition of certain revenue deferrals. In certain transactions where collection risk is high, the revenue is deferred until collection occurs. If the fee is not fixed or determinable, then\nthe revenue recognized in each period (subject to application of other revenue recognition criteria) will be the lesser of the aggregate amounts due and payable or the amount of the arrangement fee that would have been recognized if the fees were being recognized using the residual method. We assess whether fees are considered fixed or determinable at the inception of the arrangement and negotiated fees generally are based on a specific volume of products to be delivered and not subject to change based on variable pricing mechanisms, such as the number of units copied or distributed or the expected number of users.\nAlthough we currently believe that our approach to estimates and judgments as described herein is reasonable, actual results could differ and we may be exposed to increases or decreases in revenue that could be material.\nReserves on Accounts Receivable\nWe maintain reserves for potential sales returns and uncollectible accounts receivable. In aggregate, such reserves reduce our gross accounts receivable to its estimated net realizable value.\nOur standard contracts generally do not contain provisions for clients to return products or services. However, we historically have accepted sales returns under certain circumstances. Accordingly, we estimate sales return reserves, including reserves for returns and other credits, based upon the rate of historical returns by revenue type in relation to the corresponding gross revenues and recognize revenue, net of an allowance for sales returns. If we are unable to estimate the returns, revenue recognition may be delayed until the rights of return period lapses, provided also, that all other criteria for revenue recognition have been met. If we experience changes in practices related to sales returns or changes in actual return rates that deviate from the historical data on which our reserves had been established, our revenues may be adversely affected.\nAllowances for doubtful accounts and other uncollectible accounts receivable related to estimated losses resulting from our clients' inability to make required payments are established based on our historical experience of bad debt expense and the aging of our accounts receivable balances, net of deferred revenue and specifically reserved accounts. Specific reserves are based on our estimate of the probability of collection for certain troubled accounts. Accounts are written off as uncollectible only after we have expended extensive collection efforts.\nOur allowances for doubtful accounts are based on our assessment of the collectibility of client accounts. We regularly review the adequacy of these allowances by considering internal factors such as historical experience, credit quality and age of the client receivable balances as well as external factors such as economic conditions that may affect a client's ability to pay and review of major third-party credit-rating agencies, as needed. If a major client's creditworthiness or financial condition were to deteriorate, if actual defaults are higher than our historical experience, or if other circumstances arise, our estimates of the recoverability of amounts due to us could be overstated, and additional allowances could be required, which could have an adverse impact on our operating results.\nAlthough we currently believe that our approach to estimates and judgments as described herein is reasonable, actual results could differ and we may be exposed to increases or decreases in required reserves that could be material.\nSoftware Development Costs\nSoftware development costs, consisting primarily of employee salaries and benefits, incurred in the research and development of new software products and enhancements to existing software products for external sale are expensed as incurred, and reported as net research and development costs in the consolidated statements of net income and comprehensive income, until technological feasibility has been established. After technological feasibility is established, any additional external software development costs are capitalized. Amortization of capitalized software is recorded using the greater of the ratio of current revenues to the total of current and expected revenues of the related product or the straight-line method over the estimated economic life of the related product, which is typically three years. The total of capitalized software costs incurred in the development of products for external sale are reported as capitalized software costs within our consolidated balance sheets.\nWe also incur costs to develop software applications for our internal-use and costs for the development of Software as a Service (\"SaaS\") based products sold to our clients. The development costs of our SaaS-based products are considered internal-use for accounting purposes. Our internal-use capitalized costs are stated at cost and amortized using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which is typically three to seven years. Application development stage costs generally include costs associated with internal-use software configuration, coding, installation and testing. Costs related to the preliminary\nproject stage and post-implementation activities are expensed as incurred. Costs of significant upgrades and enhancements that result in additional functionality are also capitalized, whereas costs incurred for maintenance and minor upgrades and enhancements are expensed as incurred. Capitalized software costs for developing SaaS-based products are reported as capitalized software costs within our consolidated balance sheets and capitalized software costs for developing our internal-use software applications are reported as equipment and improvements within our consolidated balance sheets.\nWe periodically reassess the estimated economic life and the recoverability of our capitalized software costs. If a determination is made that capitalized amounts are not recoverable based on the estimated net cash flows to be generated from sales of the applicable software product, the amount by which the unamortized capitalized costs of a software product exceed the net realizable value is written off as a charge to earnings. The net realizable value is the estimated future gross revenues from that product\nreduced by the estimated future costs of completing and disposing of that product, including the costs of performing maintenance and client support required to satisfy our responsibility at the time of sale.\nDuring the year ended March 31, 2016, we recorded a $32.2 million non-cash impairment charge after making a determination that the previously capitalized software costs related to the NextGen Now development project was not recoverable. Refer to the \"Impairment of Assets\" section below for additional information.\nAlthough we currently believe that our approach to estimates and judgments as described herein is reasonable, actual results could differ and we may be exposed to increases or decreases in revenue that could be material.\nBusiness Combinations\nWe completed our acquisition of HealthFusion during the year ended March 31, 2017, which was accounted for as a purchase business combination using the acquisition method of accounting.\nIn accordance with the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations, we allocate the purchase price of acquired businesses to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on estimated fair values. Our purchase price allocation methodology contains uncertainties because it requires us to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities, including, but not limited to, intangible assets, goodwill, and contingent consideration liabilities. We estimate the fair value of assets and liabilities based upon quoted market prices, the carrying value of the acquired assets and widely accepted valuation techniques, including discounted cash flows and market multiple analyses depending on the nature of the assets being sold. We estimate the fair value of the contingent consideration liabilities based on the probability of achieving certain business milestones and/or management's forecast of expected results. The process for estimating fair values in many cases requires the use of significant estimates, assumptions and judgments, including determining the timing and estimates of future cash flows and developing appropriate discount rates. Unanticipated events or circumstances may occur which could affect the accuracy of our fair value estimates, including assumptions regarding industry economic factors and business strategies. Any adjustments to fair value subsequent to the measurement period are reflected in the consolidated statements of net income and comprehensive income.\nWe currently do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to complete the purchase price allocation and estimate the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities. However, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions, we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material\nGoodwill\nGoodwill acquired in a business combination is measured as the excess of the purchase price, or consideration transferred, over the net acquisition date fair values of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. Goodwill is not amortized as it has been determined to have an indefinite useful life.\nWe test goodwill for impairment annually during our first fiscal quarter, referred to as the annual test date. We will also test for impairment between annual test dates if an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate the carrying amount may be impaired. Impairment testing for goodwill is performed at a reporting-unit level, which is defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment (referred to as a component). A component of an operating segment is a reporting unit if the component constitutes a business for which discrete financial information is available and segment management regularly reviews the operating results of that component.\nAs part of our annual goodwill impairment test, we first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If we conclude that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, we conduct a two-step quantitative goodwill impairment test. The first step of the impairment test involves comparing the fair values of the applicable reporting units with their carrying values. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds the reporting unit's fair value, we perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test. The second step of the goodwill impairment test involves comparing the implied fair value of the affected reporting unit's goodwill with the carrying value of that goodwill. The amount by which the carrying value of the goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, if any, is recognized as an impairment loss.\nApplication of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units, assignment of goodwill to reporting units, and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit. The fair value of each reporting unit is estimated primarily through the use of a discounted cash flow methodology. This analysis requires significant judgments, including estimation of future cash flows, which is dependent on internal forecasts, estimation of the long-term rate of growth for our business, estimation of the useful life over which cash flows will occur, and determination of our weighted average cost of capital.\nThe estimates used to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit change from year to year based on operating results, market conditions, and other factors. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and goodwill impairment for each reporting unit.\nWe currently do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to test for impairment losses on goodwill. However, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions, we may be exposed to future impairment charges that could be material.\nIntangible Assets\nIntangible assets consist of trade names and contracts, customer relationships, and software technology, all of which arose in connection with our acquisitions.\nThese intangible assets are recorded at fair value and are stated net of accumulated amortization. We currently amortize intangible assets using a method that reflects the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible asset are consumed.\nAlthough currently we believe that our approach to estimates and judgments as described herein is reasonable, actual results could differ and we may be exposed to decreases in the fair value of our intangible assets, resulting in impairment charges that could be material. We test intangible assets for impairment if we believe indicators of impairment exist.\nShare-Based Compensation\nWe record share-based compensation related to our employee stock options plans, employee share purchase plans, restricted stock awards, and restricted performance stock awards and shares. See Note 13, Share-Based Awards,\u201d of our notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Report for a complete discussion of our stock-based compensation plans.\nShare-based compensation expense associated with the stock options under our equity incentive plans is based on the number of options expected to vest. We estimate the fair value of stock options on the date of grant using the Black Scholes option-pricing model based on required inputs, including expected term, volatility, risk-free rate, and expected dividend yield. Expected term is estimated based upon the historical exercise behavior and represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding and therefore the proportion of awards that is expected to vest. Volatility is estimated by using the weighted-average historical volatility of our common stock, which approximates expected volatility. The risk-free rate is the implied yield available on the U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with remaining terms equal to the expected term. The expected dividend yield is the average dividend rate during a period equal to the expected term of the option. The fair value vest is recognized ratably as expense over the requisite service period in our consolidated statements of net income and comprehensive income.\nShare-based compensation expense associated with restricted stock awards is estimated using the market price of the common stock on the date of grant. Share-based compensation expense associated with the restricted performance stock awards and shares is based on the grant date fair value measured at the underlying closing share price on the date of grant using a Monte Carlo-based valuation model.\nWe currently do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to determine share-based compensation expense. However, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions, we may be exposed to changes in share-based compensation expense that could be material.\nTrends and Events in Our Business\nWe believe that the following trends and events as described below have contributed to our consolidated results of operations and may continue to impact our future results.\nWe believe healthcare is more heavily influenced by regulatory and national health projects than by the cycles of our economy. The healthcare industry has been significantly impacted by the Obama Administration's broad healthcare reform efforts, including the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health portion of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (\"HITECH Act\") and the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (\"ACA\") that provided significant incentives to health care organizations for \"Meaningful Use\" adoption and interoperable electronic health record solutions.\nWe also believe that healthcare reform, including the repeal of the sustainable growth rate (SGR) formula as part of the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015 (\"MACRA\"), and a movement towards a value-based, pay-for-performance model and quality initiative efforts will stimulate demand for robust electronic health record solutions as well as new health information technology solutions from bundled billing capabilities to patient engagement and population health management. We believe MACRA may be the most important of the three regulations for our market because it permanently changes how ambulatory healthcare providers are reimbursed by Medicare. It offers certainty and a timeline for the market's move away from volume-based, fee-for-service models to value-based payment models that reward the delivery of lower cost, high quality care.\nWhile we expect to benefit from the increasing demands for greater efficiency as well as government support for increased adoption of electronic health records, the market for physician based electronic health records software is becoming increasingly saturated while physician group practices are rapidly being consolidated by hospitals, insurance payers and other entities. Hospital software providers are leveraging their position with their hospital clients to gain market share with hospital owned physician practices. Insurance providers and large physician groups are also consolidating physician offices creating additional opportunity for ambulatory software providers like us. Our strategy is to focus on addressing the growing needs of accountable care organizations around interoperability, patient engagements, population health, and data analytics.\nWe believe that our core strength lies in the central role our software products and services play in the delivery of healthcare by the primary physician in an ambulatory setting. We intend to remain at the forefront of upcoming new regulatory requirements and meaningful use requirements for stimulus payments. We intend to continue the development and enhancement of our software solutions to support healthcare reform, such as the recently enacted MACRA, which promotes the transition from fee-for-service to value-based, pay-for-performance and patient-centric and quality initiatives such as accountable care organizations. Key elements of our future software development will be to expand our interoperability capabilities enhancing the competitiveness of our software offerings, make our products more intuitive and easy to use, and to enhance the capability of our MediTouch\u00ae Platform to allow us to deliver our software over the cloud to larger ambulatory care practices.\nWe have a history of enhancing our solutions through both organic and inorganic activities. Over the last few years, we have entered into strategic transactions to complement and enhance our product portfolio in the ambulatory care market. In October 2015, we divested our former Hospital Solutions division. In January 2016, we acquired HealthFusion Holdings, Inc. (\"HealthFusion\") and in April 2017, we acquired Entrada, Inc. (\"Entrada\").\nWe continue to evaluate the organizational structure of our company with the objective of achieving greater synergies and further integration of our products and services, in support of our business strategies. In fiscal year 2016, we initiated a three-phase plan intended to better position our organization for future success. In the first phase, we redesigned the organization to more effectively support the execution of our strategy. This phase included implementing a series of actions with the objective of enabling a more efficient, integrated and client-centered delivery of the holistic solutions that we believe is required by our ambulatory care clients. During this phase, we transformed our management team with the appointment of a new Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Technology Officer, Chief Operating Officer, and Chief Strategy Officer. Under phase two of our reorganization, we have continued to build our infrastructure and enhance our healthcare information technology capabilities to drive future revenue growth. The phase includes a multi-year initiative, called NextGen 2.0, to merge our business units into a more streamlined, functional-based organization structure and to realign our organizational structure by consolidating the sales, marketing, information services, and software development responsibilities into single, company-wide roles to achieve greater efficiency. The third phase of the plan will consist of developing and marketing the services and solutions that we believe will accelerate revenue growth. The first phase was completed in April 2016, when we announced a corporate restructuring plan, which was approved by our Board of Directors.\nThe overall plan also includes a multi-year initiative, called NextGen 2.0, to merge our business units into a more streamlined, functional-based organization structure and to realign our organizational structure by consolidating the sales, marketing, information services, and software development responsibilities into single, company-wide roles to achieve greater efficiency.\nUnder our reorganization plan, we incurred approximately $7,078 of reorganization-related charges in the year ended March 31, 2017, consisting principally of severance, other one-time termination benefits, and facilities-related costs.\nWe have and intend to continue investments in our infrastructure, including but not limited to maintaining and expanding sales, marketing and product development activities to improve patient care and reduce healthcare costs, providing industry-leading, integrated clinical and administrative healthcare data systems, services, and expertise to clinical, medical, technology, and healthcare business professionals while continuing our strong commitment of service in support of our client satisfaction programs. These investments in our infrastructure will continue while maintaining reasonable expense discipline. We strive to add new clients and expand our relationship with existing clients through delivery of add-on and complementary products and\nservices and believe that our client base that is using our software on a daily basis is a strategic asset. We intend to leverage this strategic asset by expanding our product and service offerings towards this client base.\nLed by our vision and mission, we are resetting our strategy and structure to deliver value to our clients. To achieve a lower-cost, increased capability structure, our new management team is building what we believe is an aligned, client-focused organization, supported by a recurring revenue stream and a large and diverse existing client base.\nWe strive to be the trusted partner for clients of all sizes, integrating services and software into a consolidated solution that enables an efficient and effective caregiver and patient experience while driving positive financial outcomes. As a healthcare information technology and services company, we plan to continue investing in our current capabilities as well as building and/or acquiring new capabilities as we guide our clients through an evolving healthcare marketplace that is transitioning from fee-for-service to fee-for-value reimbursement models. With approximately 90,000 providers using our solutions, we are enabling care and believe we can truly transform the delivery of care through the following strategic priorities, including focus on the ambulatory client segment, platform as a service, and population health software and services. Refer to Item 1. Business\u201d included elsewhere in this Report for additional information on each of our strategic priorities.\nAs a healthcare information technology and services company, we plan to continue investing in our current capabilities as well as building and/or acquiring new capabilities as we guide our clients from fee-for-service to fee-for-value payer reimbursement models. With approximately 90,000 providers using our solutions, we are enabling care and believe we can truly transform the delivery of care.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table sets forth the

services, revenue cycle management and related services (\"RCM\"), electronic data interchange and data services ( EDI\u201d), and professional services, such as implementation, training, and consulting performed for clients who use our products.\nConsolidated revenue for the year ended March 31, 2017 increased $17.1 million compared to the prior year due mostly to a $31.6 million increase in software related subscription services and $6.6 million increase in EDI, partially offset by a $9.3 million decrease in professional services, $6.4 million decrease in support and maintenance, $5.0 million decrease in software license and hardware, and $0.5 million decrease in RCM. The increase in software related subscription services was primarily driven by a full year of sales related to the MediTouch\u00ae cloud-based solution acquired from HealthFusion in January 2016, combined with growth in subscriptions related to our interoperability, patient portal, and QSIDental Web product offerings as we continue to expand our client base. The increase in EDI is partially attributed to the acquisition of HealthFusion and growth in EDI transaction volume due to addition of new clients and further penetration of our existing client base. The decline in software license and hardware revenue was mostly caused by a shift in market dynamics toward cloud-based solutions and away from perpetual license arrangements, which has also resulted in lower demand for our professional services, including implementation, training, and consulting services. The decline in support and maintenance is due primarily to the disposition of the former Hospital Solutions division in October 2015, which accounted for $5.3 million of the decrease, and net attrition in products sold with accompanying maintenance. The lower RCM revenue is due to customer attrition and a decline in new bookings.\nConsolidated revenue for the year ended March 31, 2016 increased $2.3 million compared to the year ended March 31, 2015 due to higher software related subscription services, RCM, and EDI revenue, partially offset by lower software license and hardware, professional services, and support and maintenance revenue. The $11.1 million decline in software license and hardware revenue compared to the year ended March 31, 2015 reflects the increasingly saturated end-market for electronic health records software and the disposition of the former Hospital Solutions division, which contributed to $1.9 million of the total decrease in software license and hardware revenue. Software related subscription services revenue increased $10.8 million compared to the year ended March 31, 2015 primarily due to additional revenues from the acquisition of HealthFusion, combined with growth in subscriptions related to our interoperability, patient portal, and QSIDental Web product offerings, offset by a $1.9 million decrease primarily related to the disposition of the former Hospital Solutions division. Support and maintenance revenue decreased $4.0 million, which consists of a $4.9 million decrease related to the former Hospital Solutions division, partially offset by growth in support and maintenance related to our interoperability solutions and other ambulatory software products. RCM and EDI revenue grew by $8.8 million and $6.0 million, respectively, compared to the year ended March 31, 2015, due to addition of new clients and further penetration of our existing client base. The acquisition of HealthFusion also partially contributed to the increase in EDI revenues. Professional services revenue decreased $8.2 million compared to the year ended March 31, 2015, due to the recent decline in system sales, resulting in lower client demand for our core software products and related implementation, training, and consulting services. The disposition of the former Hospital Solutions division also contributed to $1.7 million of the decrease in professional services revenue compared to the year ended March 31, 2015.\nConsolidated bookings reflect the estimated annual value of our executed contracts and are adjusted to include the effect of pre-acquisition bookings for HealthFusion and exclude the historical impact of the former Hospital Solutions division. For the year ended March 31, 2017, consolidated bookings were $125.5 million, which decreased compared to $141.7 million in the prior year primarily due to lower sales of perpetual license arrangements associated with a shift in market dynamics and a decline in new RCM bookings, as described above. Consolidated bookings decreased in the year ended March 31, 2016 compared to $175.4 million in the year ended March 31, 2015, which was primarily driven by lower sales of perpetual license arrangements.\nRecurring service revenue, consisting of software related subscription services, support and maintenance, RCM, and EDI, represented 82%, 78%, and 74% of total revenue for the years ended March 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively.\nWe expect to benefit from the growth of a replacement market driven by an expected consolidation of electronic health records vendors. We also anticipate the creation of new opportunities in connection with the evolution of healthcare from a fee-for-services reimbursement model to a pay-for-performance model around the management of patient populations. Through our acquisition of HealthFusion in January 2016, we obtained a highly scalable, pure cloud-based and mobile-enabled platform with capabilities that we intend to expand to serve the requirements of larger ambulatory practices. When combined with our Mirth-branded products, we can offer our clients a full suite of cloud-based solutions that better enable our clients to focus on care delivery. While it remains difficult to assess the relative impact or the timing of positive and negative trends affecting the aforementioned market opportunities, we believe we are well positioned to remain a leader in serving the evolving market needs for healthcare information technology.\nGross Profit\nThe following table presents our consolidated cost of revenue and gross profit for the years ended March 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015 (in thousands): Table 70: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal Year Ended March 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total cost of revenue\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>223,134\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>225,615\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>223,164\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross profit\n</td> <td>286,490\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>266,862\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>267,061\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross margin %\n</td> <td>56.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>54.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>54.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCost of revenue consists primarily of compensation expense, including share-based compensation, for personnel that deliver our products and services. Cost of revenue also includes amortization of capitalized software costs and acquired technology, third party consultant and outsourcing costs, costs associated with our EDI business partners and clearinghouses, hosting service costs, third party software costs and royalties, and other costs directly associated with delivering our products and services. Refer to Note 7, \"Intangible Assets\" and Note 8, \"Capitalized Software Costs\" of our notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Report for additional information on current period amortization of capitalized software costs and acquired technology and an estimate of future expected amortization.\nShare-based compensation expense included in cost of revenue was $0.5 million, $0.4 million, and $0.4 million for the years ended March 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively, and is included in the amounts in the table above.\nGross profit for the year ended March 31, 2017 increased $19.6 million compared to the prior year due primarily to the higher revenues as discussed above, combined with a $2.5 million decrease in cost of revenue. Cost of revenue decreased due to lower payroll costs associated with delivering support and maintenance and professional services and lower amortization of previously capitalized software development costs that became fully amortized during the year, partially offset by higher amortization of the software technology intangible asset acquired from HealthFusion. The increase in the gross margin percentage to 56.2% for the year ended March 31, 2017 compared to 54.2% in the prior year period primarily reflects higher profitability related to sales of the MediTouch\u00ae cloud-based solution acquired from HealthFusion in January 2016, offset by lower profitability of professional services as the demand for such services have declined at a quicker pace than the associated payroll costs.\nGross profit decreased $0.2 million for the year ended March 31, 2016 compared to the year ended March 31, 2015 due primarily to a decline in high-margin software license sales associated with the market saturation noted above and a decline in gross profit associated with the disposition of the former Hospital Solutions division, offset by increases in gross profit associated with higher software and related subscription services, RCM, and EDI revenues and contributions to gross profit from the acquisition of HealthFusion.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expense\nThe following table presents our consolidated selling, general and administrative expense for the years ended March 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015 (in thousands):\nTable 71: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal Year Ended March 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling, general and administrative\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>163,623\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>156,234\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>158,172\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling, general and administrative, as a percentage of revenue\n</td> <td>32.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>31.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>32.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSelling, general and administrative expense consist of compensation expense, including share-based compensation, for management and administrative personnel, selling and marketing expense, facilities costs, depreciation, professional service fees, including legal and accounting services, acquisition and transaction-related costs, and other general corporate and administrative expenses.\nShare-based compensation expense included in selling, general and administrative expenses was $6.1 million, $2.6 million, and $2.7 million for the years ended March 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively, and is included in the amounts in the table above. The increase in share-based compensation expense for the year ended March 31, 2017 compared to the prior year is due to higher issuances of equity awards to officers and employees as incentive compensation. Refer to Note 13, \"Share-Based Awards\" of our notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Report for additional information on equity award grants.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses increased $7.4 million for the year ended March 31, 2017 compared to the prior year primarily due to higher incremental costs associated with HealthFusion acquired in January 2016, higher legal expense related to shareholder litigation, partially offset by lower payroll costs associated with our reorganization efforts and lower acquisition costs.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended March 31, 2016 decreased $1.9 million compared to the year ended March 31, 2015 primarily due to a $6.3 million decrease in legal expenses associated mostly with shareholder litigation defense costs (net of insurance recoveries), a $2.1 million decrease in sales commissions related to a decline in new system sales, a $1.5 million decrease in equipment and software maintenance expense, and a $0.7 million decrease in facilities and utilities expense, offset by a $2.7 million increase in bad debt expense, a $2.7 million increase in salaries and benefits, $2.3 million higher transaction costs associated mostly with the acquisition of HealthFusion and a $1.8 million loss on the disposition of the former Hospital Solutions division (including related incremental direct costs).\nResearch and Development Costs, net\nThe following table presents our consolidated net research and development costs, capitalized software costs, and gross expenditures prior to capitalization, for the years ended March 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015 (in thousands): Table 72: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal Year Ended March 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross expenditures\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>86,590\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>80,336\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>83,841\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capitalized software costs\n</td> <td>(8,249\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(14,675\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(14,601\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Research and development costs, net\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>78,341\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>65,661\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>69,240\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Research and development costs, net, as a percentage of revenue\n</td> <td>15.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14.1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capitalized software costs as a percentage of gross expenditures\n</td> <td>9.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nGross research and development expenditures, including costs expensed and costs capitalized, consist of compensation expense, including share-based compensation for research and development personnel, certain third-party consultant fees, software maintenance costs, and other costs related to new product development and enhancement to our existing products. We intend to continue to invest heavily in research and development expenses as we continue to bring additional functionality and features to the medical community and develop a new integrated inpatient and outpatient, web-based software platform.\nThe capitalization of software development costs results in a reduction to our reported net research and development costs. Our software capitalization rate, or capitalized software costs as a percentage of gross expenditures, has varied historically and may continue to vary based on the nature and status of specific projects and initiatives in progress. Although changes in software capitalization rates have no impact on our overall cash flows, it results in fluctuations in the amount of software development costs being expensed up front and the amount of net research and development costs reported in our consolidated statement of net income and comprehensive income.\nShare-based compensation expense included in research and development costs was $1.0 million, $0.3 million, and $0.4 million for the years ended March 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively, and is included in the amounts in the table above.\nNet research and development costs for the year ended March 31, 2017 increased $12.7 million compared to the prior year due to a $6.3 million increase in our gross expenditures, combined with a $6.4 million decrease in capitalized software costs. The increase in gross expenditures is primarily the result of incremental costs from HealthFusion and higher costs related to development of the next versions of our software products, partially offset by lower gross expenditures from the discontinuation of the former NextGen Now development project during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 and lower personnel costs associated with our reorganization efforts. The reduction in capitalized software costs and rate of software capitalization is primarily due to the discontinuation of the former NextGen Now development project and the recent releases of the next major version of our core software products. Our software capitalization rate fluctuates due to differences in the nature and status of our projects and initiatives during a given year, which affects the amount of development costs that may be capitalized.\nNet research and development costs for the year ended March 31, 2016 decreased $3.6 million compared to the year ended March 31, 2015 primarily due to lower gross expenditures related to the former NextGen Now development project, which was discontinued during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. Refer to the \"Impairment of Assets\" section below for additional information.\nAmortization of Acquired Intangible Assets\nThe following table presents our amortization of acquired intangible assets for the years ended March 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015 (in thousands): Table 73: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal Year Ended March 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of acquired intangible assets\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>10,435\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,367\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,693\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAmortization of acquired intangible assets included in operating expense consist of the amortization related to our customer relationships, trade name, and contracts intangible assets acquired as part of our business combinations. Refer to Note 7, \"Intangible Assets\" of our notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Report for an estimate of future expected amortization.\nAmortization of acquired intangible assets for the year ended March 31, 2017 increased $5.1 million, compared to the prior year period due to additional amortization of the customer relationships and trade name intangible assets related to the acquisition of HealthFusion. Amortization of acquired intangible assets for the year ended March 31, 2016 increased $1.7 million compared to the prior year due to additional amortization of the customer relationships and trade name intangible assets related to the acquisition of HealthFusion.\nImpairment of Assets\nDuring the year ended March 31, 2016, we recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $32.2 million that is reflected within the impairment of assets caption in our consolidated statements of net income and comprehensive income. The impairment relates to the previously capitalized investment in the former NextGen Now development project, which we had deemed to have zero net realizable value. The impairment charge did not result in any cash expenditures. The impairment charge followed our assessment of the NextGen Now development project and the MediTouch platform that we obtained through our acquisition of HealthFusion. We had determined that the MediTouch platform offered the most efficient path to providing a high-quality, robust, cloud-based solution for ambulatory care and decided to cease further investment in NextGen Now and immediately discontinued all efforts to use or repurpose the NextGen Now platform.\nRestructuring Costs\nDuring the year ended March 31, 2017, we recorded $7.1 million of restructuring costs within operating expenses in our consolidated statements of net income and comprehensive income. The restructuring costs resulted from a restructuring plan that we announced in April 2016, and such costs consist primarily of payroll-related costs, such as severance, outplacement costs, and continuing healthcare coverage, associated with the involuntary separation of employees pursuant to a one-time benefit arrangement. Also included in restructuring costs was $1.7 million of facilities-related costs associated with accruals for the remaining lease obligations at certain locations, including Solana Beach, Costa Mesa, and a portion of Horsham with contractual lease terms ending between January 2018 and September 2023. We have vacated each of the locations or portions thereof and are actively marketing the locations for sublease. As of March 31, 2017, the remaining restructuring liability associated with payroll-related costs was $0.6 million, which we expect to settle in the first quarter of fiscal 2018, and the remaining lease obligation, net of estimated projected sublease rentals, was $2.3 million. Refer to Note 14, \"Commitments, Guarantees, and Contingencies,\" of our notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Report for estimated timing of payments related to remaining lease obligations. The restructuring plan was substantially complete by the end of fiscal 2017.\nThe restructuring is part of a three-phase plan initiated in fiscal year 2016 that was intended to better position our organization for future success. In the first phase, we redesigned the organization to more effectively support the execution of our strategy. This phase included implementing a series of actions with the objective of enabling a more efficient, integrated and client-centered delivery of the holistic solutions that we believe is required by our ambulatory care clients. During this phase, we transformed our management team with the appointment of a new Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Technology Officer, Chief Operating Officer, and Chief Strategy Officer. Under phase two of our reorganization, we have continued to build our infrastructure and enhance our healthcare information technology capabilities to drive future revenue growth. The third phase of the plan will consist of developing and marketing the services and solutions that we believe will accelerate revenue growth.\nThe overall plan also includes a multi-year initiative, called NextGen 2.0, to merge our business units into a more streamlined, functional-based organization structure and to realign our organizational structure by consolidating the sales, marketing, information services, and software development responsibilities into single, company-wide roles to achieve greater efficiency. As a result, our reportable segments have changed and may change again due to such changes in the organization of our business.\nRefer to Note 15, \"Restructuring Plan\" of our notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Report for additional information.\nInterest and Other Income and Expense\nThe following table presents our interest expense for the for the years ended March 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015 (in thousands):\nTable 74: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal Year Ended March 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>14\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>428\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>111\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense\n</td> <td>(3,156\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,304\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(341\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other expense, net\n</td> <td>(262\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(166\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(62\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nInterest income relates primarily to our marketable securities. Interest expense relates to our revolving credit agreement that was entered into in January 2016 and the related amortization of deferred debt issuance costs. Refer to Note 9, Line of Credit\u201d of our notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Report for additional information. Other expense and income relates primarily to net realized gains and losses on our marketable securities.\nInterest expense for the year ended March 31, 2017 increased $1.9 million compared to the prior year, and interest expense for the year ended March 31, 2016 increased $1.0 million compared to the year ended March 31, 2015. The increases in interest expense is associated with our revolving credit agreement entered into in January 2016 and the related amortization of deferred debt issuance costs. As of March 31, 2017, we had $15.0 million in outstanding loans under the revolving credit agreement.\nAll other fluctuations in interest and other income and expense are not deemed significant.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nThe following table presents our provision for income taxes for the years ended March 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015 (in thousands): Table 75: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal Year Ended March 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Provision for income taxes\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,368\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>663\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8,332\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effective tax rate\n</td> <td>22.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe effective tax rate for the year ended March 31, 2017 increased compared to the prior year primarily because the lower income before taxes in the prior year caused the rate reconciling items to have a more significant impact to the effective tax rate.\nThe effective tax rate for the year ended March 31, 2016 decreased compared to the year ended March 31, 2015 primarily as a result of favorable tax benefits from the federal research and development tax credit and other permanent items having a more significant effective tax rate impact due to lower income before taxes for the year ended March 31, 2016. The Internal Revenue Service statute related to research and development credits expired on December 31, 2014 and was retroactively reinstated and made permanent in December 2015. The research and development credits claimed for the year ended March 31, 2016 represent credits for the twelve-month period.\nRefer to Note 11, Income Tax\u201d of our notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Report for a reconciliation of the federal statutory income tax rate to our effective tax rate.\nNet Income\nThe following table presents our net income (in thousands) and net income per share and for the years ended March 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015: Table 76: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal Year Ended March 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>18,241\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,657\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>27,332\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income per share:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Basic\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.30\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.09\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.45\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Diluted\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.29\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.09\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.45\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs a result of the foregoing changes in revenue and expense, net income for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017 increased $12.6 million compared to the prior year period.\nAs a result of the foregoing changes in revenue and expense, net income for the year ended March 31, 2016 decreased $21.7 million compared to the year ended March 31, 2015. The significant decrease is primarily due to the $32.2 million impairment of previously capitalized software costs related to the former NextGen Now development project, offset by a decrease in provision for income taxes as a result of lower pre-tax net income.\nOperating Segment Information\nEffective July 1, 2016, we revised our reportable operating segments. As part of our ongoing reorganization efforts, we refined the measurement of our segment data to better reflect our current internal organizational structure whereby certain functions that formerly existed"}
