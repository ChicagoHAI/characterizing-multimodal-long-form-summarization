MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion should be read together with the information contained in the Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes included in the annual report.\nOverview\nWe are a leading online service provider of live and on-demand corporate audio and web communications, virtual event technology and social media marketing, provided primarily to corporate (including large as well as small to medium sized businesses), education and government customers. We had approximately 75 full time employees as of October 7, 2016, with operations organized in two main operating groups:\n\u00b7 Audio and Web Conferencing Services Group\n\u00b7 Digital Media Services Group\nOur Audio and Web Conferencing Services Group consists of our Infinite Conferencing (\u201cInfinite\u201d) division, our Onstream Conferencing Corporation (\u201cOCC\u201d) division and our EDNet division. Our Infinite division, which operates primarily from the New York City area, and our OCC division, which operates primarily from San Diego, California, provide \u201creservationless\u201d and operator-assisted audio and web conferencing services. Our EDNet division, which operates primarily from San Francisco, California, provides connectivity (in the form of high quality audio and multimedia data communications) within the entertainment and advertising industries through its managed network, which encompasses production and post-production companies, advertisers, producers, directors, and talent.\nOur Digital Media Services Group consists primarily of our Webcasting division and our DMSP (\u201cDigital Media Services Platform\u201d) division. The DMSP division includes the related UGC (\u201cUser Generated Content\u201d) and Smart Encoding divisions. Our Webcasting division, which operates primarily from Pompano Beach, Florida and has a sales and support facility in New York City, provides an array of corporate-oriented, web-based media services to the corporate market including live audio and video webcasting and on-demand audio and video streaming for any business, government or educational entity. Our DMSP division, which operates primarily from Colorado Springs, Colorado, provides an online, subscription based service that includes access to enabling technologies and features for our clients to acquire, store, index, secure, manage, distribute and transform these digital assets into saleable commodities. Our UGC division, which also operates as Auction Video and operates primarily from Colorado Springs, Colorado, provides a video ingestion and flash encoder that can be used by our clients on a stand-alone basis or in conjunction with the DMSP. Our Smart Encoding division, which operates primarily from San Francisco, California, provides both automated and manual encoding and editorial services for processing digital media. This division also provides hosting, storage and streaming services for digital media, which are provided via the DMSP.\nFor segment information related to the revenue and operating income of these groups, see Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nRecent Developments\nAs of September 30, 2014 we were obligated to Sigma Opportunity Fund II, LLC (\u201cSigma\u201d) for principal and accrued interest aggregating $1,539,340. After our December 31, 2014 payment to Sigma of all accrued interest through that date, but no principal payments, we were obligated to Sigma under a secured note for $1,358,000, with future interest payable monthly at 21% per annum and the principal due on October 15, 2015 (the \u201cNew Sigma Note\u201d). On September 21, 2015, Sigma loaned us an additional $225,000, which resulted in $192,500 cash proceeds net of certain fees and expenses charged by Sigma. The net proceeds were used to pay approximately $173,000 of outstanding principal on one of the Working Capital Notes plus approximately $20,000 of accrued interest on that note. Accordingly, the outstanding balance of the New Sigma Note increased to $1,583,000 and the maturity date was extended to April 15, 2016, which extension resulted in our obligation to pay Sigma up to $250,000 in additional fees (plus monthly interest and penalties for late SEC filings, as applicable). During December 2015 we repaid $1.0 million of the outstanding balance due on the New Sigma Note and entered into additional agreements with Sigma whereby the maturity date on the remaining balance was extended from April 15, 2016 to December 31, 2016 and the interest rate, as well as certain other fees, was reduced. In the event of our default on the New Sigma Note, on or before the maturity date, the outstanding balance, including accrued interest, is convertible into our common shares at a price of $0.30 per common share.\nOn March 5 and 6, 2015, we received aggregate gross cash proceeds of $1.0 million for our sale, effective February 28, 2015, of a defined subset of Infinite Conferencing's (\u201cInfinite\u201d) audio conferencing customers (and the related future business to those customers) (\u201cSold Accounts\u201d) to Infinite Conferencing Partners LLC, a Florida limited liability company (\u201cPartners\u201d), which represent historical annual revenues of approximately $1.35 million. The proceeds from this sale were used by us to pay (i) approximately $311,000 of outstanding principal and approximately $136,000 of accrued interest on certain notes payable and (ii) approximately $69,000 for the cash portion of legal and consulting fees related to this transaction. The remaining proceeds were used for fee obligations under the New Sigma Note and for other operating expenses. After giving effect to our determination that Partners is a Variable Interest Entity (VIE) requiring consolidation in our financial statements, (i) the gross proceeds from this and subsequent transactions are reflected as an increase in our equity (noncontrolling owners' interest in VIE), (ii) the revenues from the Sold Accounts, and accounts sold as part of our subsequent transactions with Partners, are included in our consolidated revenues and (iii) the payment of the Partners' guaranteed return percentage, which is deducted from these gross revenues, is reflected as a decrease in our equity (distributions to owners of VIE).\nDuring December 2015, we received gross proceeds of approximately $2.1 million for our sale, effective December 16, 2015, of a defined subset of Infinite's audio conferencing customers (and the related future business to those customers) (\u201cFirst Tranche of Additional Sold Accounts\u201d) to Partners, which represented historical annual revenues of approximately $2.7 million which transaction resulted in an increase, as a percentage of revenues, of the management fee received by us with respect to the accounts sold by us in a similar transaction in February 2015 and which improved management fee also applied to the accounts sold in December 2015. From the December 2015 proceeds, we repaid an aggregate of $481,000 against the net outstanding balances of certain subordinated notes, in addition to the $1.0 million repayment against the New Sigma Note discussed above. During March through June 2016, we received gross proceeds of approximately $0.8 million for our sale, effective June 30, 2016, of a defined subset of Infinite's audio conferencing customers (and the related future business to those customers) (\u201cSecond Tranche of Additional Sold Accounts\u201d) to Partners, which represented historical annual revenues of approximately $1.0 million, and were sold under the same terms as the accounts sold in December 2015. During September and October 2016, subscriptions for approximately $225,000 were received by Partners and funded against an anticipated total of $1.5 million for our sale, which we expect will be effective during November 2016, of a defined subset of Infinite's audio conferencing customers (and the related future business to those customers) (\u201cThird Tranche of Additional Sold Accounts\u201d) to Partners, will represent historical annual revenues of approximately $1.9 million, and will be sold under the same terms as the accounts sold in December 2015 and June 2016.\nSince December 2007, we have had a line of credit arrangement with a financial institution under which we could borrow up to an aggregate of $2.0 million for working capital, collateralized by our accounts receivable and certain other related assets and the amount of such borrowing being further subject to the amount, aging and concentration of such receivables. On February 10, 2016, we entered into a loan modification agreement which extended the term of this line of credit arrangement through December 31, 2017.\nSee Liquidity and Capital Resources for further details with respect to the above transactions with Sigma, Thermo and Partners.\nOn April 30, 2015, we received a funding commitment letter (the \u201cFunding Letter\u201d) from J&C Resources, Inc. (\u201cJ&C\u201d), agreeing to provide us, within twenty (20) days after our notice on or before January 5, 2016, aggregate cash funding of up to $800,000. Such notice was not given by us, but on April 30, 2016, we exercised our option for a one year extension of the Funding Letter, including an extension of the notice deadline to January 5, 2017. The Funding Letter was obtained solely to demonstrate our ability to obtain short-term funds in the event other funding sources are not available, but does not represent any obligation to accept such funding on these terms and is not expected by us to be exercised. Cash provided under the Funding Letter, as extended, would be in exchange for our issuance of (a) a note or notes with interest payable monthly at 15% per annum and principal payable on the earlier of a date twelve months from funding or July 15, 2017 and (b) 10.0 million unregistered common shares, which shares would be prorated in the case of partial funding. The note or notes would be unsecured and subordinated to all of our other debts, except to the extent such the terms of such debts would allow pari passu status.\nOn March 27, 2007 we acquired the assets, technology and patents pending of privately owned Auction Video, Inc., a Utah corporation, and Auction Video Japan, Inc., a Tokyo-Japan corporation (collectively, \u201cAuction Video\u201d). In connection with our subsequent pursuit of approval of these patents pending (i) on October 13, 2015, the USPTO issued to us U.S. Patent Number 9,161,068 (the \u201cFirst Granted Patent\u201d) with a Patent Term Adjustment of 2,377 days, resulting in a September 26, 2030 expiration date, provided all maintenance fees are paid and (ii) on October 11, 2016, the USPTO issued to us U.S. Patent Number 9,467,728 (the \u201cSecond Granted Patent\u201d) with a Patent Term Adjustment of 1,362 days, resulting in a December 16, 2027 expiration date, provided all maintenance fees are paid. These patents address live streaming of audio and/or video from multiple devices to a storage location, such as the Internet or cloud, and the ability to access and retrieve the audio and/or video to multiple devices, whereby the content is not stored on the device. Our management believes that the First and Second Granted Patents, as well as two other related patents still pending, may have significant value, although this cannot be assured, and is presently exploring the financial potential of the First and Second Granted Patents and the patents pending.\nRevenue Recognition\nRevenues from recurring service are recognized when (i) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists between us and the customer, (ii) the goods or service has been provided to the customer, (iii) the price to the customer is fixed or determinable and (iv) collectibility of the sales price is reasonably assured.\nOur Audio and Web Conferencing Services Group recognizes revenue from audio and web conferencing as well as customer usage of digital network connections.\nThe Infinite and OCC divisions generally charge for audio conferencing and web conferencing services on a per-minute usage rate, although webconferencing services are also available for a monthly subscription fee allowing a certain level of usage. Audio conferencing and web conferencing revenue is recognized based on the timing of the customer's use of those services. The EDNet division primarily generates revenue from customer usage of digital network connections. EDNet purchases the rights to access digital network connections from national communications companies and resells such access to its customers for a fixed monthly fee plus separate per-minute usage charges. Network usage and bridging (managed transcoding and multipoint sessions) revenue is recognized based on the timing of the customer's usage of those services.\nOur Digital Media Services Group recognizes revenues from the acquisition, editing, transcoding, indexing, storage and distribution of its customers' digital media, as well as from live and on-demand internet webcasting and internet distribution of travel information.\nThe Webcasting division charges for live and on-demand webcasting at the time an event is accessible for streaming over the Internet. Charges to customers by the DMSP division are generally based on a monthly subscription fee, as well as charges for hosting, storage and professional services. Fees charged to customers for customized applications or set-up are recognized as revenue at the time the application or set-up is completed. Charges to customers by the Smart Encoding and UGC divisions are generally based on the activity or volumes of such media, expressed in megabytes or similar terms, and are recognized at the time the service is performed. This division also provides hosting, storage and streaming services for digital media, which are provided via the DMSP.\nWe include the DMSP and UGC divisions' revenues, along with the Smart Encoding division's revenues from hosting, storage and streaming, in the DMSP and Hosting revenue caption. We include the EDNet division's revenues from equipment sales and rentals and the Smart Encoding division's revenues from encoding and editorial services in the Other Revenue caption.\nWe add to our customer billings for certain services an amount to recover USF contributions which we have determined that we will be obligated to pay to the FCC, related to those particular services. This additional billing to our customers is not reflected as revenue by us, but rather is recorded as a liability on our books, which liability is relieved upon our remittance of USF contributions as they are billed to us by USAC, an administrative and collection agency of the FCC.\nResults of Operations\nOur consolidated net loss for the year ended September 30, 2015 was approximately $8.4 million, as compared to a net loss of approximately $1.7 million for the prior fiscal year, an increase in our net loss of approximately $6.7 million, or 404.4%. The increased net loss was due to (i) an approximately $5.6 million impairment loss on goodwill and other intangible assets recorded by us for the year ended September 30, 2015, for which there was no comparable transaction in fiscal 2014, (ii) an approximately $800,000 impairment loss on property and equipment recorded by us for the year ended September 30, 2015, for which there was no comparable transaction in fiscal 2014 and (iii) an approximately $744,000 gain from litigation settlement recorded by us for the year ended September 30, 2014, for which there was no comparable transaction in fiscal 2015 and (iv) an approximately $523,000, or 4.3%, decrease in gross margin for the year ended September 30, 2015, as compared to the prior fiscal year. These items are discussed in more detail below.\nThe impact of the above items for the year ended September 30, 2015 was partially offset by (i) an approximately $440,000, or 21.0%, decrease in interest expense, (ii) an approximately $270,000, or 28.2%, decrease in depreciation and amortization expense and (iii) an approximately $219,000, or 1.9%, decrease in general and administrative expenses (operating expenses other than the impairment loss on goodwill and other intangible assets, the impairment loss on property and equipment and depreciation and amortization expense), all as compared to the prior fiscal year and discussed in more detail below.\nOur consolidated net loss for the year ended September 30, 2015 included approximately $233,000 net income attributable to noncontrolling owner's interest in the VIE Partners, versus no corresponding amount for the year ended September 30, 2014. Accordingly, the net loss attributable to the Onstream Media shareholders for the year ended September 30, 2015 was approximately $8.6 million, as compared to a net loss attributable to the Onstream Media shareholders of approximately $1.7 million for the prior fiscal year.\nYear ended September 30, 2015 compared to the year ended September 30, 2014 - The following table shows, for the periods indicated, the percentage of total consolidated revenue represented by items on our consolidated statements of operations.\nTable 6: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> Years ended September 30,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> 2015\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revenue:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Audio and web conferencing\n</td> <td> 56.5%\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 56.0%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Webcasting\n</td> <td> 28.2\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 26.6\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Network usage\n</td> <td> 10.2\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 11.0\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> DMSP and hosting\n</td> <td> 4.8\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 5.5\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other\n</td> <td> 0.3\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 0.9\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total revenue\n</td> <td> 100.0%\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 100.0%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Costs of revenue:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Audio and web conferencing\n</td> <td> 14.6%\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 14.8%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Webcasting\n</td> <td> 7.3\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 7.1\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Network usage\n</td> <td> 5.0\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 4.8\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> DMSP and hosting\n</td> <td> 0.7\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 1.0\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 0.2\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total costs of revenue\n</td> <td> 27.6%\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 27.9%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gross margin\n</td> <td> 72.4%\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 72.1%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating expenses:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Compensation (excluding equity)\n</td> <td> 45.2%\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 42.6%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Compensation (paid with equity)\n</td> <td> 1.3\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 3.4\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Professional fees\n</td> <td> 6.8\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 8.0\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other general and administrative\n</td> <td> 16.2\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 13.6\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Impairment loss on goodwill and other intangible assets\n</td> <td> 34.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Impairment loss on property and equipment\n</td> <td> 5.0\n</td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td> 4.2\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 5.6\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total operating expenses\n</td> <td> 113.4%\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 73.2%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loss from operations\n</td> <td> (41.0)%\n</td> <td> </td> <td> (1.1)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other expense, net:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest expense\n</td> <td> (10.2)%\n</td> <td> </td> <td> (12.3)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Debt extinguishment loss\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> (0.8)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gain from litigation settlement\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 4.4\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other (expense) income, net\n</td> <td> (0.6)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total other expense, net\n</td> <td> (10.8)%\n</td> <td> </td> <td> (8.7)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net loss\n</td> <td> (51.8)%\n</td> <td> </td> <td> (9.8)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net income attributable to noncontrolling\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> owners' interest in Variable Interest Entity\n</td> <td> (1.4)%\n</td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Onstream Media shareholders' net loss\n</td> <td> (53.2)%\n</td> <td> </td> <td> (9.8)%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following table is presented to illustrate our discussion and analysis of our results of operations.

</tr>\n</table>\nRevenues and Gross Margin\nConsolidated operating revenue was approximately $16.1 million for the year ended September 30, 2015, a decrease of approximately $790,000 (4.7%) from the prior fiscal year, primarily due to decreased revenues of the Audio and Web Conferencing Services Group, but also due to decreased revenues of the Digital Media Services Group.\nAudio and Web Conferencing Services Group revenues were approximately $10.8 million for the year ended September 30, 2015, a decrease of approximately $620,000 (5.4%) from the prior fiscal year, which included decreases in audio and web conferencing revenues as well as a decrease in the network usage revenues from the EDNet division.\nCombined revenues from audio and web conferencing (the Infinite and OCC divisions combined) were approximately $9.1 million for the year ended September 30, 2015, which represented a decrease of approximately $371,000 (3.9%) as compared to the prior fiscal year, with results for each of the two divisions reflecting similar declines (in absolute dollars).\nThe OCC division's revenues were approximately $804,000 for the year ended September 30, 2015, which represented a decrease of approximately $201,000 (20.0%) as compared to the prior fiscal year. This was in turn primarily due to lower total free conferencing business (\u201cTFCB\u201d) revenue, which was approximately $153,000 for fiscal 2014, with no corresponding amount for the year ended September 30, 2015. We purchased the TFCB business as part of our November 30, 2012 acquisition of certain assets and operations of Intella2 Inc., a San Diego-based communications company Intella2. However, under the terms of the July 29, 2014 settlement of litigation with Intella2 and its owner Paul Cohen, we transferred all TFCB customers and all associated revenues and expenses to Mr. Cohen, effective July 1, 2014.\nThe Infinite division's revenues of approximately $8.3 million for the year ended September 30, 2015 represented a decrease of approximately $170,000 (3.1%) as compared to the prior fiscal year. This was primarily due to a decrease in average revenue per minute, which was approximately 5.5 cents for the year ended September 30, 2015, as compared to approximately 6.0 cents for the prior fiscal year. This decrease in average revenue per minute was partially offset by a 7.6% increase in the number of minutes billed by the Infinite division, which was approximately 159 million for the year ended September 30, 2015, as compared to approximately 148 million minutes for the prior fiscal year. The average revenue per minute statistic includes auxiliary services and fees that are not billed to the customer on a per minute basis. The average revenue per minute statistic is also calculated including revenue billed by Infinite to its customers but purchased by Infinite from another Onstream division and thus included in that other division's (and not Infinite's) reported revenues. Although the decrease in average revenue per minute reflects our reactions to competitive pressures on the pricing side, we have been able to reduce our costs for the same reason.\nThe EDNet division's network usage revenues were approximately $1.6 million for the year ended September 30, 2015, which represented a decrease of approximately $208,000 (11.2%) as compared to the prior fiscal year. This was in turn primarily due to lower usage of EDNet's bridging services, with a corresponding decrease of approximately $131,000 in those billings for the year ended September 30, 2015 as compared to the prior fiscal year.\nDigital Media Services Group revenues were approximately $5.4 million for the year ended September 30, 2015, a decrease of approximately $170,000 (3.1%) from the prior fiscal year, primarily due to a decrease in DMSP and hosting revenues.\nDMSP and hosting revenues were approximately $773,000 for the year ended September 30, 2015, which represented a decrease of approximately $152,000 (16.4%) as compared to the prior fiscal year. This decrease reflects competitive pressures resulting in the continuing decline in the number of customers using these products and services.\nWebcasting division revenues increased by approximately $55,000 (1.2%) for the year ended September 30, 2015 as compared to the prior fiscal year. We produced approximately 4,100 webcasts during the year ended September 30, 2015, which was approximately 200 greater than the number of webcasts produced in the prior fiscal year. The impact on revenue arising from the increased number of events was partially offset by a decrease in the average revenue per webcast event to $1,154 for the year ended September 30, 2015, which represented a decrease of $68, or 5.6%, as compared to the prior fiscal year. The average revenue per webcast includes revenue billed by the webcasting division to its customers but purchased by the webcasting division from another Onstream division and thus included in that other division's (and not webcasting's) reported revenues.\nWe expect to shortly introduce and begin marketing a \u201cdo it yourself\u201d large audience webcasting product that can be run from the customer's desktop and will be available on a fixed cost monthly subscription basis that can be purchased on-line. We have recently introduced the following audio and web conferencing products: (i) Onstream Meetings and (ii) Onstream Webinars, both of which feature fully integrated audio conferencing, allowing customers to interact from land based, mobile or desktop headsets (VOIP) as well as high definition Dolby audio.\nConsolidated gross margin was approximately $11.7 million for the year ended September 30, 2015, a decrease of approximately $523,000 (4.3%) from the prior fiscal year. This decrease generally corresponds to the approximately $790,000 (4.7%) decrease in revenues for the corresponding period, as discussed above. However, our consolidated gross margin percentage increased to 72.4% for the year ended September 30, 2015, versus 72.1% for the prior fiscal year. This increased percentage was primarily due to the percentage decrease in cost of sales for audio and web conferencing (the Infinite and OCC divisions combined) being larger than the percentage decrease in audio and web conferencing revenues.\nOperating Expenses\nConsolidated operating expenses were approximately $18.3 million for the year ended September 30, 2015, an increase of approximately $5.9 million (47.7%) from the prior fiscal year, due to (i) an approximately $5.6 million impairment loss on goodwill and other intangible assets recorded by us for the year ended September 30, 2015, for which there was no comparable transaction in fiscal 2014, (ii) an approximately $800,000 impairment loss on property and equipment recorded by us for the year ended September 30, 2015, for which there was no comparable transaction in fiscal 2014 and (iii) an approximately $317,000, or 13.8%, increase in other general and administrative expenses as compared to the prior fiscal year, such increases partially offset by (i) an approximately $366,000, or 63.6%, decrease in compensation paid with common shares and other equity, (ii) an approximately $270,000, or 28.2%, decrease in depreciation and amortization expense and (iii) an approximately $257,000, or 19.1%, decrease in professional fees, all decreases as compared to the prior fiscal year.\nSee \u201cGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets\u201d, which is part of the Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates section below, for details with respect to the approximately $5.6 million impairment loss on goodwill and other intangible assets and the $800,000 impairment loss on property and equipment, both as recorded by us for the year ended September 30, 2015.\nThe approximately $317,000 increase in other general and administrative expenses was primarily due to an increase in advertising and marketing costs, which are charged to operations as incurred and classified in our financial statements primarily under other general and administrative expenses but also under professional fees. These expenses were approximately $980,000 and $640,000 for the years ended September 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively, representing an increase of $340,000, or 53.1%. These amounts include third party marketing consultant fees and third party sales commissions, but do not include commissions or other compensation to our employee sales staff.\nThe approximately $366,000 decrease in compensation paid with common shares and other equity was primarily due to an approximately $272,000 decrease in the expense recorded for the year ended September 30, 2015, as compared to the prior fiscal year, with respect to our obligation to reimburse the Executives, upon their resale of 1,700,000 ONSM common shares that we agreed in January 2013 to issue to them in lieu of certain compensation, for any shortfall versus $0.29 per share. The closing ONSM price of $0.27 per share as of September 30, 2013 resulted in an approximately $34,000 liability on our financial statements. Based on the closing ONSM price of $0.16 per share as of September 30, 2014, we increased the liability to approximately $221,000, which resulted in an approximately $187,000 increase in non-cash compensation expense for the year ended September 30, 2014. Based on the closing ONSM price of $0.21 per share as of September 30, 2015, we decreased the liability to approximately $136,000, which resulted in an approximately $85,000 reduction of non-cash compensation expense for the year ended September 30, 2015. The difference between the $85,000 expense reduction for the year ended September 30, 2015 and the $187,000 expense increase for the year ended September 30, 2014 accounts for a $272,000 total decrease in the expense between the two years.\nThis approximately $257,000 decrease in professional fees was primarily due to (i) an approximately $238,000 decrease in legal and consulting fees and (ii) an approximately $58,000 decrease in accounting fees, such decreases partially offset by an approximately $85,000 aggregate increase in financial consultant fees and due diligence expenses incurred in connection with negotiations for potential financing.\nLegal and consulting fees were approximately $214,000 for the year ended September 30, 2015, as compared to approximately $452,000 for the prior fiscal year, representing a decrease of approximately $238,000, or 52.8%. Legal and consulting fees incurred during the year ended September 30, 2015 were primarily related to (i) legal fees and (ii) marketing consultant expenses. Legal, consulting and other professional fees incurred during the year ended September 30, 2014 were primarily related to (i) corporate development and investor relations consulting activities, which activities were substantially curtailed during the year ended September 30, 2015 and (ii) litigation with Intella2 and its owner Paul Cohen, which was settled on July 29, 2014.\nAccounting fees were approximately $182,000 for the year ended September 30, 2015, as compared to approximately $240,000 for the prior fiscal year, representing a decrease of approximately $58,000, or 24.2%. Forms 10-Q for the first, second and third quarters of fiscal 2014 were filed on April 30, June 5 and August 19, 2014, respectively, and the related accounting fees were expensed during the year ended September 30, 2014. Fees for the review of our quarterly financial statements included in our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q for the second and third quarters of fiscal 2015 were incurred, invoiced and paid subsequent to September 30, 2015 (i.e., in fiscal 2016).\nOther Expense\nOther expense, which is primarily interest, of approximately $1.8 million for the year ended September 30, 2015 represented an approximately $273,000 (18.5%) increase as compared to the prior fiscal year. This increase was due to an approximately $744,000 gain from litigation settlement recorded by us for the year ended September 30, 2014, for which there was no comparable transaction in fiscal 2015, partially offset by an approximately $440,000, or 21.0%, decrease in interest expense for the year ended September 30, 2015 as compared to the prior fiscal year.\nOn November 26, 2013, Intella2 and its owner Paul Cohen filed a civil lawsuit in Florida naming Onstream Media Corporation, Onstream Conferencing Corporation and Infinite Conferencing as defendants. The action alleged breach of contract with respect to payment of certain components of the purchase price for the Intella2 acquisition and related commissions and sought money damages as well as declaratory relief declaring Mr. Cohen's related non-compete agreement with us unenforceable. On December 31, 2013 we filed our response to this lawsuit, which contained various objections to the lawsuit allegations as well as a number of counterclaims. On July 29, 2014, the parties entered into a settlement agreement and on August 4, 2014, the lawsuit was dismissed with prejudice by the court. Based on the conditions of that settlement, we reduced the approximately $782,000 estimated liability for the unpaid portion of the purchase price to the $38,000 we ultimately paid under the settlement (in cash and equipment), which resulted in our recognition of other income of approximately $744,000 for the year ended September 30, 2014.\nThe approximately $440,000 decrease in interest expense was primarily due to (i) an approximately $183,000 aggregate net decrease in interest expense recognized for certain subordinated debt (the Working Capital Notes, the Intella2 Investor Notes, the Fuse Note and the Subordinated Notes) for fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014, (ii) an approximately $111,000 aggregate net decrease in interest expense recognized for certain senior debt (the New Sigma Note, the Rockridge Note, the Line and the USAC Notes) for fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 (iii) an approximately $84,000 aggregate net decrease in the expense paid and/or accrued by us for fiscal 2015 related to our obligation to reimburse the shortfall upon the resale of certain of our common shares as well as the accretion of interest on obligations to repurchase certain of our common shares, as compared to the aggregate net amount of such accruals for fiscal 2014 and (iv) $52,000 of interest accretion recorded by us in connection with the Intella2 purchase price during fiscal 2014, for which there was no corresponding item in fiscal 2015, since we no longer accrued accretion after the July 29, 2014 Intella2 litigation settlement, as discussed above.\nAs discussed above under \u201cRecent Developments\u201d, on March 5 and 6, 2015, we received aggregate gross cash proceeds of $1.0 million for our sale, effective February 28, 2015, of a defined subset of Infinite's audio conferencing customers (and the related future business to those customers) to Partners. The proceeds from this sale were used by us to pay (i) approximately $311,000 of outstanding principal and approximately $136,000 of accrued interest on certain notes payable and (ii) approximately $69,000 for the cash portion of legal and consulting fees related to this transaction. The remaining proceeds were used for fee obligations under the New Sigma Note and for other operating expenses. As a result of certain of the items we repaid using the proceeds from Partners, our interest expense decreased. As a result of our treatment of Partners as a VIE requiring consolidation in our financial statements, the $1.0 million gross proceeds from this transaction was reflected by us as an increase in our equity and the approximately $233,000 paid and/or accrued for the Partners' guaranteed return related to those invested proceeds for the year ended September 30, 2015, was reflected as a distribution out of our equity, and not as interest expense.\nNet Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Owners' Interest in VIE\nOur consolidated net loss for the year ended September 30, 2015 included approximately $233,000 net income attributable to noncontrolling owner's interest in the VIE Partners, versus no corresponding amount for the year ended September 30, 2014.\nOn March 5 and 6, 2015, we received aggregate gross cash proceeds of $1.0 million for our sale, effective February 28, 2015, of the Sold Accounts to Partners. Based on our determination that Partners is a Variable Interest Entity (VIE) requiring consolidation in our financial statements, the revenues from the Sold Accounts are included in our consolidated revenues. The payment of the Partners' guaranteed return percentage, which is based on the cash proceeds received for this sale, is reflected as a decrease in our equity (distributions to owners of VIE) and also represents the portion of our consolidated results that are attributable to the VIE, with the balance of our consolidated results after deducting the VIE portion being the net loss attributable to the Onstream Media shareholders for the period.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nFor the year ended September 30, 2015, we had a net loss of approximately $8.4 million, although cash provided by operating activities for that period was approximately $343,000. Cash provided by operating activities is calculated after adding back to our net loss the periodic amortization of the amount of other fees and expenses incurred in connection with obtaining or maintaining our debt, which fees and expenses are initially recorded by us as debt discount and presented by us on the balance sheet as a reduction of the outstanding principal balance. The other fees and expenses included in debt discount include amounts payable in cash and/or equity and may be payable to the lender, to third parties engaged by the lender or to third parties engaged by us.\nOur cash balance decreased by approximately $72,000 during the year ended September 30, 2015. This was the result of approximately $320,000 used in investing activities and approximately $95,000 used in financing activities, partially offset by approximately $343,000 provided by operating activities. Although we had cash of approximately $317,000 at September 30, 2015, we had a working capital deficit of approximately $5.3 million at that date. This $5.3 million deficit includes the following items classified as current on our September 30, 2015 balance sheet: (i) approximately $1.5 million of net debt repaid by us from the proceeds of the Partners transaction in December 2015 and (ii) approximately $1.7 million of debt outstanding under the Line which we recently renewed through December 31, 2017, both as discussed in more detail below.\nCash provided by operating activities of approximately $343,000 for the year ended September 30, 2015, represents an approximately $114,000 decrease in cash provided by operating activities as compared to approximately $457,000 cash provided by operating activities for the prior fiscal year. The approximately $343,000 cash provided by operating activities for the year ended September 30, 2015 reflects (i) net cash used by operating activities before changes in current assets and liabilities other than cash of approximately $96,000, which in turn represents our net loss of approximately $8.4 million, offset by approximately $8.3 million non-cash expenses included in that net loss and (ii) an approximately $440,000 net decrease in working capital other than cash. The primary non-cash expenses included in our loss for the year ended September 30, 2015 were an approximately $5.6 million impairment loss on goodwill and other intangible assets, an $800,000 impairment loss on property and equipment, approximately $715,000 of amortization of discount on notes payable and convertible debentures and approximately $686,000 of depreciation and amortization. The approximately $440,000 net decrease in working capital other than cash for the year ended September 30, 2015 is primarily due to an approximately $414,000 increase in accounts payable, accrued liabilities and amounts due to directors and officers. The $440,000 net decrease in working capital other than cash represented approximately $511,000 more cash than the net increase in working capital other than cash of approximately $71,000 for the prior fiscal year. The primary sources of cash inflows from operations are from receivables collected from sales to customers.\nCash used in investing activities was approximately $320,000 for the year ended September 30, 2015 as compared to approximately $556,000 cash used in investing activities for the prior fiscal year. Current and prior period investing activities related to the acquisition of property and equipment, including capitalized software development costs.\nCash used in financing activities was approximately $95,000 for the year ended September 30, 2015 as compared to approximately $231,000 cash provided by financing activities for the prior fiscal year. The current year period financing activities primarily related to (i) the December 31, 2014 repayment to Sigma of all accrued interest due on Sigma Notes 1 and 2 through that date, which interest had been capitalized as part of the outstanding principal balance, after which Sigma Notes 1 and 2 were cancelled and replaced with a new note payable to Sigma, (ii) the March 2015 repayment of the outstanding principal on certain notes payable from the proceeds of the March 2015 sale to Partners and (iii) the recurring distributions to the owners of Partners, effective March 1, 2015 through September 30, 2015, such uses of cash partially offset by the net proceeds we received in March 2015 from our sale, effective February 28, 2015, of a defined subset of Infinite's audio conferencing customers (and the related future business to those customers) to Partners. These transactions are all discussed in more detail below. Financing activities for the year ended September 30, 2014, excluding accounts receivable based borrowing and repayment activity under the Line, primarily related to proceeds from the Working Capital Notes and from Sigma Note 2 and the repayment of certain notes payable from the proceeds of those two financings.\nIn December 2007, we entered into a line of credit arrangement (the \u201cLine\u201d) with a financial institution (the \u201cLender\u201d). The Lender was Thermo Credit LLC through February 10, 2016 and as a result of an assignment, Thermo Communications Funding LLC, an affiliated company, subsequent to that date. Mr. Leon Nowalsky, a member of our Board, is an investor and board member in both entities.\nThe Line has been renewed and modified from time to time, and under which we may presently borrow up to an aggregate of $2.0 million for working capital, collateralized by our accounts receivable and certain other related assets and the amount of such borrowing being further subject to the amount, aging and concentration of such receivables. Although the Line expired on December 27, 2013, we continued after that date to negotiate renewal terms with the Lender and to maintain an outstanding borrowing balance under the Line and on February 10, 2016 (the \u201cEffective Date\u201d), we entered into a Loan Modification Agreement (\u201cModification\u201d) which extended the term of the Line through December 31, 2017 (the \u201cMaturity Date\u201d). Notwithstanding this renewal for a period ending more than one year after our September 30, 2015 balance sheet, since the outstanding balance at that date could, in the absence of continuing revenues generating eligible receivables with a sufficient dollar value, be fully repayable within one year, it is classified as a current liability on that balance sheet, as well as our September 30, 2014 balance sheet.\nThe Modification also provides that, if no Default or Event of Default, as defined in the Modification, shall have occurred and be continuing as of the Maturity Date, and upon our notice and request to Lender sent per the timing and other requirements in the Modification, Lender shall (in good faith) engage in, and conclude as quickly as commercially reasonable, negotiations with us to extend the Maturity Date by up to an additional twelve months (i.e., through December 31, 2018). The Modification also changed a number of the other terms of the Line, as discussed below.\nPrior to the Effective Date, the outstanding balance (approximately $1.7 million as of September 30, 2015 and approximately $1.6 million as of October 24, 2016) bears interest at 12.0% per annum, adjustable based on changes in prime after December 28, 2009, payable monthly in arrears. The Modification provides that as of the Effective Date the interest rate will be the prime rate plus seven and one-half percent (7.5%) per annum, but no less than eleven percent (11.0%) per annum or any higher rate that might be allowed by the terms of the Line, including the Modification, arising from certain events such as default. Accordingly, as of the Effective Date, the outstanding balance bears interest at 11.0% per annum.\nUnder the terms of the Line, we also incur a monitoring fee and a commitment fee, which fees were unchanged by the Modification. The monitoring fee is one twentieth of a percent (0.05%) of the borrowing limit per week, payable monthly in arrears, and the commitment fee is one percent (1%) per year of the maximum allowable borrowing amount, payable annually in advance.\nThe terms of the Line prior to the Effective Date required that all funds remitted by our customers in payment of receivables be deposited directly to a bank account owned by the Lender (the \u201cLockbox Account\u201d), although this was never implemented. This requirement continues after the Effective Date, including the provision that such funds received in the Lockbox Account shall be immediately applied to any balance outstanding under the Line, or returned to us one day following clearance by the receiving bank, to the extent there is no balance outstanding under the Line. The Modification provides that we shall be responsible for the additional expenses related to the Lender-owned bank account, which we expect to be in the range of $12,000 to $18,000 per year.\nThe Modification provides that our failure to comply with these provisions shall be an immediate Event of Default, and although as of July 8, 2016 (the extended deadline granted by the Lender on June 8, 2016) these provisions had not been fully implemented, we were in substantial compliance with such provisions since August 1, 2016 and through October 28, 2016 and we have not received any notification from the Lender as to any Event of Default under these provisions, as of October 28, 2016. In a letter dated October 26, 2016, the Lender agreed that there was no default by us with respect to such lockbox provisions up to and including October 31, 2016, although this does not constitute authorization for any non-compliance with these provisions after October 31, 2016.\nThe Line is subject to us maintaining an adequate level of receivables, based on certain formulas. However, due to the lack of a formal renewal of the Line, in June 2014 the Lender determined that there would be no further advances under the Line, although no further repayments have been required either, and as a result the outstanding principal balance of the Line did not change from that time through June 24, 2016, regardless of weekly changes in the calculated borrowing availability based on the applicable formulas applied to our receivable levels. Effective June 24, 2016, the first deposit was made to the Lockbox Account and applied against the balance outstanding under the Line.\nThe Modification allows our receivable from any single party, including Partners, to be considered an Eligible Receivable to the extent that (i) the aggregate of all accounts receivable from such party and its affiliates does not exceed thirty percent (30%) of all Eligible Receivables (all Eligible Receivables for this purpose including the portion of the our accounts receivable from such party that is ultimately considered to be an Eligible Receivable) then owed by all of our account debtors and (ii) it meets all of the other requirements for eligibility as set forth in the Line.\nAs of the Effective Date, although the outstanding balance under the Line exceeded the maximum allowable borrowing amount under the Line (the \u201cBorrowing Base\u201d), the Modification provided that notwithstanding any other provisions of the Line or the Modification, such condition would not be considered a Default or an Event of Default, and Lender would agree to make advances to us thereunder based on the Borrowing Base plus an overadvance amount determined by a schedule which started at $300,000 through February 27, 2016 but declined to zero as of July 31, 2016 and thereafter. As of October 24, 2016, the outstanding balance under the Line was approximately $1,576,000, which exceeded the Borrowing Base by approximately $248,000. Although there is no formal obligation to do so, as of October 24, 2016 the Lender is allowing such overadvance condition to continue, under their expectation that we are seeking alternative funding to replace that overadvance. In a letter dated October 26, 2016, the Lender agreed that there was no default by us with respect to such overadvances up to and including October 31, 2016, although this does not constitute authorization for any non-compliance with these provisions after October 31, 2016.\nThe Line is also subject to our compliance with a quarterly debt service coverage covenant (the \u201cCovenant\u201d). Prior to the Modification, the Covenant requires that the sum of (i) our net income or loss, adjusted to remove all non-cash expenses as well as cash interest expense and (ii) contributions to capital (less cash distributions and/or cash dividends paid during such period) and proceeds from subordinated unsecured debt, be equal to or greater than the sum of cash payments for interest and debt principal payments. The Lender waived the requirement to comply with the Covenant for the quarter ended September 30, 2015. We have complied with the Covenant for all other applicable quarters through June 30, 2016.\nThe Modification provides that effective January 1, 2016 and thereafter, the Covenant will require that our net income or loss, adjusted to (i) add back all non-cash expenses as well as cash interest expense and (ii) subtract cash distributions and/or cash dividends paid during such period, be equal to or greater than 1.2 times the sum of cash payments for interest and debt principal payments. The Modification also provides that we will not declare or pay any dividends or distributions on any equity interest, if before or after such event an Event of Default or Default, as defined in the Modification, would exist. Both before and after the Modification, the terms of the Line allow us to achieve compliance with the Covenant by (i) including any excess of adjusted net income over the amount of adjusted net income required to comply with the Covenant in the preceding two quarters or (ii) adding to adjusted net income the proceeds from subordinated debt or equity sales meeting defined conditions, and received within certain time frames extending prior to, and in some cases subsequent to, the relevant date of determination, all set forth in the Line and the Modification. The Modification also explicitly allows, subject to Lender's prior consent, proceeds from our sales of revenues/customer accounts to a separate legal entity and received within a time frames extending six months prior to, and one month subsequent to, the relevant date of determination, to be added to adjusted net income for purposes of the Covenant. In a letter dated October 26, 2016, the Lender consented to the inclusion of proceeds from our December 2015 and June 2016 sales of revenue/customer accounts to Partners, as well as the proceeds from such sale in process that we expect to be effective during November 2016, and extended the carryback period for those proceeds from one month to three months.\nAlthough we do not have final financial results for periods after June 30, 2016, our estimated calculations for the quarter ended September 30, 2016, including our expectations of additional financing proceeds after that date that would be allowable for inclusion in those calculations, indicate that we are in compliance with the Covenant.\nThe outstanding principal is due on demand in the event a payment default is uncured one (1) day after written notice. The Modification provides that, without limiting any other rights and remedies provided by the terms of the Line or otherwise available to the Lender, the Lender may exercise one or more of certain rights and remedies, as listed in the Amendment, during the existence of any uncured Default (upon not less than five days prior written notice by Lender) or Event of Default which has not been waived in writing by Lender. Lender's rights to exercise such rights and remedies will end if and when all of Debtors' obligations to Lender in connection with the Line have been satisfied. The rights and remedies listed in the Modification include, but are not limited to: (i) verify the validity and amount of, or any other matter relating to, the accounts by mail, telephone, telegraph or otherwise, (ii) notify all account debtors that the accounts have been assigned to Lender and that Lender has a security interest in the accounts, (iii) direct all account debtors to make payment of all accounts directly to Lender or the Lockbox Account (iv) in any case and for any reason, notify the United States Postal Service to change the addresses for delivery of mail addressed to us to such address as Lender may designate, as well as receive, open and dispose of all such mail, provided that Lender shall promptly forward to us any such items not related to the accounts, (v) exercise all of our rights and remedies with respect to the collection of accounts, (vi) settle, adjust, compromise, extend, renew, discharge or release accounts, for amounts and upon terms which Lender considers advisable and (vii) sell or assign accounts on such terms, for such amounts and at such times as Lender deems advisable.\nAs of September 30, 2015, in addition to the Line as discussed above, we were also obligated for the following term debt, discussed in more detail below:\nTable 8: <table> <tr> <td> New Sigma Note\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,583,000\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Rockridge Note\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 400,000\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Fuse Note\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 220,000\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Working Capital Notes\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 465,000\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Subordinated Notes\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 192,500\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Intella2 Investor Notes\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 415,000\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> USAC Note and other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 196,983\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total term debt\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,472,483\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nApproximately $1.5 million, in aggregate, of the above debt was repaid by us from the proceeds of the Partners transaction in December 2015, as discussed in more detail below.\nAs of September 30, 2015 we were obligated to Sigma Opportunity Fund II, LLC (\u201cSigma\u201d) under a secured note for $1,583,000, with interest payable monthly at 21% per annum and the principal due on April 15, 2016 (the \u201cNew Sigma Note\u201d).\nOn December 17, 2015, we made a $1.0 million payment to Sigma against the outstanding principal balance of the New Sigma Note, reducing the remaining outstanding principal balance on the Note to $583,000. On December 22, 2015, we entered into certain agreements with Sigma and Sigma Capital, which included an amendment to the New Sigma Note. As a result of these agreements, the outstanding balance of the New Sigma Note was increased to $600,000, to reflect a one-time administrative fee of $17,000, and we also reimbursed $3,500 of Sigma's legal expenses related to the transactions. In addition, the maturity date of the remaining balance due under the New Sigma Note was extended from April 15, 2016 to December 31, 2016.\nAs part of the December 22, 2015 agreements, the interest rate on the New Sigma Note was reduced from 21% to 17% per annum, the monthly advisory fee payable to Sigma Capital was reduced from $12,500 to $10,000 and the following obligations to Sigma Capital were eliminated - (i) future monthly damages payable for late SEC filings which were initiated as part of an April 30, 2015 agreement with Sigma and Sigma Capital and (ii) the third and final installment of the fee incurred by us as a result of a previous extension of the maturity date of the New Sigma Note to April 15, 2016, and which would have been $50,000 payable on December 15, 2015. We have agreed, regardless of the early repayment of the New Sigma Note, to pay a minimum aggregate amount of $100,000 of monthly advisory fee payments to Sigma Capital as scheduled, starting with the January 15, 2016 payment of $10,000.\nIn connection with an Advisory Services Agreement dated December 31, 2014, entered into by us with Sigma Capital in connection with the issuance of the New Sigma Note, we agreed to (i) pay Sigma Capital an initial advisory fee of $100,000, (ii) issue 70,000 restricted common shares to Sigma and 30,000 restricted common shares to Sigma Capital, such shares having an aggregate fair value of approximately $20,000, (iii) pay Sigma approximately $20,000 as reimbursement of legal expenses and (iv) make additional advisory fee payments to Sigma Capital totaling $160,000 in monthly installments through June 30, 2015. The value of the common shares issued plus the fees and expenses we agreed to pay in connection with the December 31, 2014 Sigma agreement (there was no remaining unamortized discount from previous Sigma transactions as of that date) were amortized as interest based on the initial six month the term of the New Sigma Note, resulting in an effective interest rate of approximately 65% per annum for the period from January 1, 2015 through April 30, 2015.\nAs part of the April 30, 2015 agreement with Sigma we (i) paid Sigma Capital a $25,000 transaction fee, (ii) paid Sigma $14,000 as reimbursement of legal expenses and (iii) agreed to make additional advisory fee payments to Sigma Capital aggregating $40,000 in monthly installments from July 15, 2015 through October 15, 2015. The April 30, 2015 agreement also required us to pay liquidated damages for late SEC filings and in accordance with that requirement we paid Sigma Capital an aggregate of $42,500 for such damages from April 30, 2015 through September 30, 2015 and another $25,000 for such damages after that date through November 27, 2015, the last payment date before the agreement to pay such damages was cancelled. When the amortization of the fees and expenses we agreed to pay in connection with the April 30, 2015 Sigma agreement, including the anticipated liquidated damages for late SEC filings, such items aggregating $121,500, were combined with the amortization of the remaining unamortized discount arising from the December 31, 2014 financing, the resulting effective interest rate of the New Sigma Note was approximately 57% per annum for the period from May 1, 2015 through September 30, 2015. Although this effective rate would be impacted by the September 21, 2015 transaction discussed below, we will not reflect that impact until October 1, 2015 and have determined that the impact of this delayed implementation is immaterial. This effective interest rate does not include the impact if an early repayment was required, as discussed above.\nAs part of the September 21, 2015 agreement with Sigma we (i) paid Sigma Capital a $25,000 fee (added to the loan principal balance), (ii) paid Sigma $7,500 as reimbursement of legal expenses, (iii) agreed to make an additional advisory fee payment to Sigma Capital of $2,500 on October 15, 2015, and (iv) agreed, in consideration of the loan maturity date extension from October 15, 2015 to April 15, 2016, to pay fees to Sigma Capital aggregating $175,000 in three monthly installments from October 15, 2015 through December 15, 2015 (of which we paid $125,000, with the remaining $50,000 obligation cancelled as part of the December 22, 2015 agreement with Sigma as discussed above) and to make additional advisory fee payments to Sigma Capital aggregating $75,000 in monthly installments from November 15, 2015 through April 15, 2016 (of which we paid $25,000, with the remaining $50,000 obligation cancelled and replaced with a new advisory fee obligation as part of the December 22, 2015 agreement with Sigma as discussed above).\nUpon our receipt of funds as a result of (i) the sale of any portion of our business, however structured, including, without limitation, sale of assets, subsidiaries, revenues or business units, and/or (ii) the issuance of additional equity, debt or convertible debt capital, and/or (iii) our consolidation or merger with or into another entity, all outstanding principal and interest with respect to the New Sigma Note will be due, but not to exceed the net proceeds of such funds received by us in any such transaction(s). However, this early repayment requirement did not apply to the $1.0 million proceeds we received in March 2015 from the sale of certain of Infinite's audio conferencing customer accounts to Partners and does not apply to up to $800,000 in proceeds should we elect to exercise our rights under the Funding Letter, both as discussed below. Also, the December 22, 2015 transactions with Sigma and Sigma Capital include (i) their agreement to limit to $1.0 million the required principal repayment against the New Sigma Note arising from the $2.1 million proceeds we received in December 2015 from the sale of certain of Infinite's audio conferencing customer accounts to Partners, and which $1.0 million we paid Sigma on December 17, 2015 and (ii) their consent to our receipt of future proceeds of up to an additional $772,500 from Revenue Sales without requiring further principal repayments against the New Sigma Note, which proceeds we received in June 2016. Revenue Sales are defined in our agreements with Sigma as \u201cfinancing from a private placement structured in a separate legal entity collateralized by a portion of our Infinite operations\u201d.\nSigma has the right to convert the New Sigma Note (including the accrued interest thereon) to common stock at a rate of $0.30 per share, which right Sigma may exercise after the maturity date, in its entirety or partially, at its option or it may exercise before the maturity date, but only if we are in default on the New Sigma Note or upon the sale of all or substantially all of our business, assets or capital stock.\nAs of September 30, 2015 and as of October 28, 2016, we were obligated for an outstanding balance of $400,000 on a secured convertible note payable (the \u201cRockridge Note\u201d) to Rockridge Capital Holdings LLC (\u201cRockridge\u201d), with interest payable monthly at 12% per annum. On December 31, 2014, we entered into an agreement with Rockridge whereby the maturity date of the Rockridge Note was extended from December 31, 2014 to June 30, 2015, in exchange for our agreement to increase the origination fee payable under such note by 50,000 restricted common shares. On April 30, 2015, we entered into an agreement with Rockridge whereby the maturity date of the Rockridge Note was extended from June 30, 2015 to October 15, 2015, in exchange for our agreement to increase the origination fee payable under such note by 30,000 restricted common shares. On August 18, 2015, we entered into an agreement with Rockridge whereby the maturity date of the Rockridge Note was extended from October 15, 2015 to April 15, 2016, in exchange for our agreement to increase the origination fee payable under such note by 50,000 restricted common shares. On December 16, 2015, we entered into an agreement with Rockridge whereby the maturity date of the Rockridge Note was extended from April 15, 2016 to December 31, 2016, in exchange for our agreement to increase the origination fee payable under such note by 70,000 restricted common shares.\nIn connection with the New Sigma Note, as amended, an agreement is in place between Sigma and Rockridge, which includes Rockridge's agreement (along with our agreement) that Sigma has the right, but not the obligation, to repay the Rockridge Note at face value in case of our default on the New Sigma Note or the Rockridge Note. Such repayment amount would be added to the principal of the New Sigma Note, with the principal being payable and accruing interest under the terms of the New Sigma Note. Furthermore, the fees payable to Sigma in the event of such repayment would be $25,000 cash payable upon such early repayment plus $4,000 per month starting from the one-month anniversary of such repayment date through the date that all amounts we owe Sigma are repaid.\nThe Rockridge Note is secured by a first priority lien on all of our assets, such lien subordinated only to the extent higher priority liens on assets, primarily accounts receivable and certain designated software and equipment, are held by certain of our other lenders. We also entered into a Security Agreement with Rockridge that contains certain covenants and other restrictions with respect to the collateral.\nUpon notice from Rockridge at any time and from time to time prior to the Maturity Date, all or part of the outstanding principal amount of the Rockridge Note may be converted into a number of restricted shares of ONSM common stock. These conversions are subject to a minimum of one month between conversion notices (unless such conversion amount exceeds $25,000) and will use a conversion price of eighty percent (80%) of the fair market value of the average closing bid price for ONSM common stock for the twenty (20) days of trading on the OTCQB (or such other exchange or market on which ONSM common shares are trading) prior to such Rockridge notice, but such conversion price will not be less than $2.40 per share.\nThe Note and Stock Purchase Agreement with Rockridge calls for our issuance of an origination fee, upon not less than sixty-one (61) days written notice to us, of 816,667 restricted shares of our common stock (the \u201cShares\u201d), which includes the increases noted above. The value of those Shares is subject to a limited guaranty of no more than an additional payment by us of $75,000 which will be effective in the event the Shares are sold for an average share price less than the minimum of $1.20 per share (the \u201cShortfall Payment\u201d). If the closing ONSM share price of $0.18 per share on October 7, 2016 was used as a basis of calculation, the required Shortfall Payment would be $75,000, which is equal to the liability reflected on our financial statements as of September 30, 2015.\nIncluding the fair market value of the Shares at the time they were recorded on our books, plus legal fees paid by us, the effective interest rate of the Rockridge Note was approximately 44.3% per annum, until a September 2009 amendment, when it was reduced to approximately 28.0% per annum, the October 2012 Shortfall Payment accrual, which increased it to approximately 31.1% per annum and the December 2012 Allonge, which decreased it to approximately 29.1% per annum. Effective February 28, 2014, as a result of the inclusion of the remaining unamortized discount in a debt extinguishment loss, the effective rate was reduced to 12% per annum and, because of the expensing of the value of all subsequent increases in the number of origination fee Shares on the basis of immateriality, it is deemed to have remained at that level to date. These rates do not give effect to any difference between the sum of the value of the Shares at the time of issuance plus the Shortfall Payment, as compared to the recorded value of the Shares on our books, nor do they give effect to any variance between the conversion price versus market prices if principal is satisfied with common shares issued upon conversion instead of cash.\nAs of September 30, 2015, we were obligated for $220,000 under an unsecured subordinated note issued on March 19, 2013 to Fuse Capital LLC (\u201cFuse\u201d) (the \u201cFuse Note\u201d). The Fuse Note, which is convertible into restricted common shares at Fuse's option using a rate of $0.50 per share, was payable on March 19, 2015, with interest at 12% per annum payable on a monthly basis. Effective February 28, 2015 the Fuse Note was amended, extending the maturity date to March 1, 2016. This amendment provided that interest would be paid quarterly, commencing June 30, 2015 and also increased the outstanding principal balance from the original $200,000, to $220,000, for the effect of a $20,000 due diligence fee earned by the noteholder in connection with the amendment, although the portion of the principal balance convertible to common shares remains at $200,000. This amendment also provided that in the event we receive funds in excess of $5 million as a result of the sale of our assets, that the outstanding principal and interest will be repaid within thirty days of the receipt of the proceeds from the asset sale.\nEffective October 15, 2015 the Fuse Note was further amended, extending the maturity date to July 15, 2016. Effective December 16, 2015 a $100,000 principal payment was made and the Fuse Note was further amended to extend the maturity date to December 31, 2016. Effective June 6, 2016 the Fuse Note was further amended, extending the maturity date to January 15, 2017. Accordingly, the amount repaid in December 2015 is classified as current on our September 30, 2015 balance sheet and the remaining $120,000 balance is classified as non-current.\nIn connection with the original issuance of the Fuse Note, we issued Fuse 80,000 restricted common shares (the \u201cFuse Common Stock\u201d), which we agreed to buy back, to the extent permitted by law, at $0.40 per share, if the fair market value of the Fuse Common Stock was not equal to at least $0.40 per share as of March 19, 2015 (two years after issuance). As of June 30, 2013 we determined that our share price had remained below $0.40 per share for a sufficient period that it was appropriate to record a liability for this repurchase commitment. Therefore, we recorded the $20,000 present value of this obligation as a liability on our financial statements as of June 30, 2013 (under the caption \u201cAccrued liabilities\u201d on our balance sheet) which increased to $22,000 as of September 30, 2013, as a result of the accretion of $2,000 as interest expense for the year then ended, increased again to $28,000 as of September 30, 2014 as a result of the accretion of $6,000 as interest expense for the year then ended and increased again to $32,000 as of September 30, 2015 as a result of the accretion of $4,000 as interest expense for the year then ended.\nThe closing ONSM share price was $0.16 per share as of March 19, 2015, which would trigger the above repurchase obligation, which would be $32,000 based on 80,000 shares at $0.30 per share. This only applies to the extent the Fuse Common Stock was still held by Fuse at the applicable date. Furthermore, as part of the February 28, 2015 amendment discussed above, it was agreed that Fuse would not request any payments by us under this commitment prior to the maturity date of the Fuse Note, which is currently January 15, 2017.\nIn connection with the original issuance of the Fuse Note, we also issued 40,000 restricted common shares to another third party for finder and other fees. Including the value of the Fuse Common Stock plus the value of the common stock issued for related financing fees (but excluding a portion of this amount written off as a debt extinguishment loss as a result of the modification, by virtue of its inclusion in the Fuse Note, of a predecessor note) results in an effective interest rate of approximately 19% per annum through March 19, 2015.\nThe $20,000 due diligence fee earned by the noteholder in connection with the February 28, 2015 amendment was recorded as a discount against the Fuse Note and is being amortized as interest expense over the approximately one year extension period, resulting in an effective interest rate of approximately 21% per annum.\nAs of September 30, 2015, we were obligated for $465,000 under partially secured promissory notes issued to two investors during October and November 2013 (the \u201cWorking Capital Notes\u201d), bearing interest at 15% per annum. The Working Capital Notes originally provided that in the event that we receive funds in excess of $5 million as a result of a single transaction for the sale of all or a part of our operations or assets, they are payable in full within ten (10) days of our receipt of such funds, along with any interest due at that time.\nEffective February 28, 2015 one of the Working Capital Notes with an original outstanding principal balance of $250,000 was amended, extending the maturity date to March 1, 2016. This amendment provided that interest would be paid quarterly, commencing June 30, 2015 and also increases the outstanding principal balance to $275,000, for the effect of a $25,000 due diligence fee earned by the noteholder in connection with the amendment. This amendment also provided that in the event we receive funds in excess of $5 million as a result of the sale of our assets, that the outstanding principal and interest will be repaid within thirty days of the receipt of the proceeds from the asset sale. Although this Working Capital Note was further amended, effective October 15, 2015, to extend the maturity date to July 15, 2016, it was paid in full on December 30, 2015. Such repayment, in accordance with our December 29, 2015 agreement with J&C Resources, Inc. (\u201cJ&C\u201d), was made in consideration of our receipt of $157,000 from J&C on December 30, 2015 for our issuance of an unsecured, subordinated note with a December 31, 2016 maturity date. Accordingly $157,000 of this Working Capital Note, the amount replaced by the proceeds of the J&C financing, is classified as non-current on our September 30, 2015 balance sheet and the remaining $118,000 balance is classified as current.\nEffective September 16, 2015 the other of these two Working Capital Notes, which had a remaining outstanding principal balance of $170,000, was amended to extend the maturity date to April 16, 2016. This amendment provided that interest accrued but unpaid as of the date of the amendment of approximately $36,000, plus interest from the date of the amendment, would be paid on the amended maturity date and also increased the outstanding principal balance to $190,000, for the effect of a $20,000 loan extension fee earned by the noteholder in connection with the amendment. Effective October 15, 2015 this Working Capital Note was further amended, extending the maturity date to July 15, 2016 and effective June 6, 2016 this Working Capital Note was further amended, extending the maturity date to January 15, 2017. Accordingly this Working Capital Note is classified as non-current on our September 30, 2015 balance sheet.\nThe Working Capital Notes are expressly subordinated to the following notes issued by us and outstanding at the time of the issuance of the Working Capital Notes: Thermo Credit LLC, Rockridge Capital Holdings LLC, Sigma Opportunity Fund II, LLC, USAC, and certain capital leases, or any assignees or successors thereto, subject to a cumulative maximum outstanding balance of $3.9 million. The Working Capital Notes are secured by a limited claim to our assets, pari passu with up to $775,000 of total indebtedness and related obligations raised and incurred by us during the first quarter of fiscal 2014, subject to all prior liens of the foregoing entities and limited to the extent such a lien is allowable by the terms of the loan documents executed between us and the foregoing entities. The Working Capital Note with an amended principal balance of $190,000 provides that we will be bound to a limit of $3.9 million in total debt senior to that Working Capital Note while that note is outstanding.\nIn connection with the above financing, we issued to the holders of Working Capital Notes an aggregate of 358,334 restricted common shares (the \u201cWorking Capital Shares\u201d), which we have agreed to buy back, to the extent permitted by law, from the holder for $0.30 per share on the maturity dates of the Working Capital Notes, if the fair market value is less than that on that date. The above only applies to the extent the Working Capital Shares are still held by the noteholder on the applicable date and the buyback obligation only applies if the noteholder gives us notice and delivers the shares within fifteen days after the applicable maturity dates. The $108,000 present value of this obligation is recorded as a liability on our financial statements as of September 30, 2015.\n312,500 of the 358,334 Working Capital Shares were issued in connection with the Working Capital Note having an adjusted principal balance prior to its repayment on December 30, 2015 of $275,000. However since the terms of the buyback obligation reference the maturity date, and not the repayment date, we have determined that our buyback obligation with respect to those shares would be determined with reference to the July 15, 2016 maturity date. The present value of this obligation is included as a liability of approximately $94,000 on our September 30, 2015 balance sheet. If the closing ONSM share price of $0.18 per share on October 7, 2016 was used as a basis of calculation, a stock repurchase payment of $93,750 would be required.\nThe remaining 45,834 of the 358,334 Working Capital Shares were issued in connection with the Working Capital Note having an adjusted principal balance of $190,000 and a maturity date of January 15, 2017 which as discussed above would be the date based on which our buyback obligation with respect to those shares would be determined. The present value of this obligation is included as a liability of approximately $14,000 on our September 30, 2015 balance sheet. If the closing ONSM share price of $0.18 per share on October 7, 2016 was used as a basis of calculation, a stock repurchase payment of $13,750 would be required.\nThe fair market value at the time of issuance of the Working Capital Shares, plus 100,000 finders agreement shares we also issued, plus the cash deducted from the proceeds for related origination fees, was $258,260. $88,807 of this amount was reflected as a non-cash debt extinguishment loss. The remainder of $169,453 was reflected as a discount against the Working Capital Notes (as well as a corresponding increase in additional paid-in capital for the shares) and that amount was amortized as interest expense over the term of the initial term of the Working Capital Notes, resulting in a weighted average effective interest rate of approximately 33.2% per annum.\nAs of September 30, 2015, we were obligated for $192,500 under unsecured Subordinated Notes issued to various lenders from April 2012 through January 2013, which are fully subordinated to the Line and the Rockridge Note and bear cash interest at 12% per annum. Modifications made in January 2014 to the terms of these notes extended the maturity dates to October 2014. Although we did not make the October 2014 principal payments, in March 2015 we repaid $75,000 of the outstanding principal on these notes and also extended the maturity dates on the remaining notes to March 1, 2016. The amended terms also provided that interest would be paid quarterly, commencing June 30, 2015 and also increased the original outstanding balance on these remaining notes from $175,000 to $192,500, for the effect of $17,500 in aggregate due diligence fees earned by the noteholders in connection with the amendments. The amendments also provided that in the event we receive funds in excess of $5 million as a result of the sale of our assets, that the outstanding principal and interest will be repaid within thirty days of the receipt of the proceeds from the asset sale. These notes were further amended, effective October 15, 2015, to extend the maturity dates to July 15, 2016, but an aggregate of $162,500 was paid against the outstanding balances on December 16, 2015. Effective December 16, 2015, the one note with a remaining outstanding balance was further amended to extend the maturity date on the remaining outstanding balance to December 31, 2016. Accordingly $162,500 of these note balances, the amount repaid in December 2015, is classified as current on our September 30, 2015 balance sheet and the remaining $30,000 balance is classified as non-current.\nAs of September 30, 2015, we were obligated for $415,000 outstanding principal on unsecured subordinated notes issued in November 2012 to various lenders (the \u201cIntella2 Investor Notes\u201d), which are fully subordinated to the Line and the Rockridge Note and bear cash interest at 12% per annum. $200,000 of the total $220,000 outstanding principal balance of one of these notes held by Fuse (the \u201cIntella2 Fuse Note\u201d), is convertible into restricted common shares at Fuse's option using a rate of $0.50 per share.\nDuring April and May 2014, the Intella2 Fuse Note and Intella2 Investor Notes held by two of the other four investors were further amended to provide that the principal balances aggregating $290,000 would not be payable until the November 30, 2014 maturity date, although interest would continue to be payable on a monthly basis. We did not make the principal payments on the Intella2 Investor Notes when due on November 30, 2014, but we continued to accrue interest expense after that point on the outstanding balance at the stated interest rate. Effective February 28, 2015, we entered into an agreement with certain of the noteholders whereby (i) we paid all accrued interest through that date plus the aggregate outstanding principal of $60,000 on two of the Intella2 Investor Notes and (ii) we paid all accrued interest through that date related to the Intella2 Fuse Note and one of the two other Intella2 Investor Notes remaining unpaid. These two notes, representing aggregate outstanding principal of $250,000, were also amended at that time to extend the maturity date to March 1, 2016 and to increase the aggregate outstanding principal balance to $275,000, for the effect of due diligence fees aggregating $25,000 earned by the noteholders in connection with the amendments although the portion of the Intella2 Fuse Note convertible to common shares remained at $200,000.\nThe February 28, 2015 amendments also provided that future interest would be paid quarterly, commencing June 30, 2015, and further provided that in the event we received funds in excess of $5 million as a result of the sale of our assets, the outstanding principal and interest would be repaid within thirty days of the receipt of such proceeds.\nEffective October 15, 2015 the Intella2 Fuse Note, having an outstanding principal balance of $220,000, was further amended, extending the maturity date to July 15, 2016. Effective December 16, 2015 a $100,000 principal payment was made and the Intella2 Fuse Note was further amended to extend the maturity date to December 31, 2016. Effective June 6, 2016 the Intella2 Fuse Note was further amended, extending the maturity date to January 15, 2017. Accordingly $100,000 of the Intella2 Fuse Note balance, the amount repaid in December 2015, is classified as current on our September 30, 2015 balance sheet and the remaining $120,000 balance is classified as non-current.\nEffective June 6, 2016, one of the two other Intella2 Investor Notes remaining unpaid, with an outstanding principal balance of $55,000 was further amended, extending the maturity date to January 15, 2017. Accordingly this balance is classified as non-current on our September 30, 2015 balance sheet.\nEffective June 1, 2016, the fifth Intella2 Investor Note, with an outstanding principal balance of $140,000, was amended, extending the maturity date to January 15, 2017. Accordingly this balance is classified as non-current on our September 30, 2015 balance sheet. This note had previously been due in full as of November 30, 2014, plus accrued but unpaid interest of approximately $27,000 through that date, none of which was paid prior to the June 1, 2016 amendment. We had continued to accrue interest expense after the maturity date through September 30, 2015 on the outstanding balance at the stated interest rate and as part of the June 1, 2016 amendment, we paid $25,200 of the $50,400 of interest accrued through the date of that amendment and agreed to pay the balance as follows: $10,000 on or before June 30, 2016, $7,600 on or before September 1, 2016 and $7,600 on or before December 1, 2016.\nIn connection with the initial issuance of the Intella2 Investor Notes, we issued to the holders of the certain of those notes having an initial outstanding balance of $450,000 an aggregate of 180,000 restricted common shares, which we agreed to buy back, to the extent permitted by law, at $0.40 per share, if the fair market value of those shares was not equal to at least $0.40 per share as of November 30, 2014 (two years after issuance). The $66,000 present value of this obligation is recorded as a liability on our financial statements as of September 30, 2015. This approximately $66,000 liability is equal to the potential repurchase of 164,000 shares at $0.40 per share, since we satisfied our obligation with respect to 16,000 shares by our reimbursement of the shortfall upon a single holder's resale of those shares in the market, which payment we recorded as interest expense in fiscal 2014.\nIn connection with the initial issuance of other subordinated notes repaid by us in March 2015, we issued to the holders of certain of those notes having an initial outstanding balance of $200,000 an aggregate of 240,000 restricted common shares, of which we agreed to buy back, to the extent permitted by law, up to 40,000 shares if the fair market value of the Investor Common Stock was not equal to at least $0.80 per share as of November 30, 2014 (two years after issuance). The $8,000 present value of this obligation is recorded as a liability on our financial statements as of September 30, 2015. This approximately $8,000 liability is equal to the potential repurchase of 10,000 shares at $0.80 per share, since we satisfied our obligation with respect to 30,000 shares by our reimbursement of the shortfall (i) upon a single holder's resale of 5,000 of those shares in the market, which payment we recorded as interest expense of approximately $3,200 in fiscal 2014 and (ii) upon three holders;' resale of an aggregate of 25,000 of those shares in the market, which payment we recorded as interest expense of approximately $16,000 in the year ended September 30, 2015.\nThe closing ONSM share price was $0.17 per share as of November 30, 2014, which would trigger the above repurchase obligations. However, these repurchase obligations are subject to the shares being still held by the investor(s) at such date and the investor giving us notice and delivering the shares within fifteen days after such date, as well as any other legal restrictions with respect to our repurchase of shares. It is possible that some or all of these repurchase obligations could be avoided by us due to the failure of the investor or investors to formally present the shares to us and/or provide notice by the specified date, or as a result of legal restrictions with respect to our repurchase of shares. However, because of our ongoing discussions with certain of these investors, including past discussions with respect to debt principal and/or interest payments in arrears to them and our communications to them at the time that we would not be in a position to honor these repurchase obligations for some of the same reasons we were in arrears on debt principal and/or interest payments, it is possible those investors could assert mitigating circumstances under which we might honor all or part of these repurchase obligations. Therefore, pending our further evaluation of our position with respect to these repurchase obligations, we are leaving the accrued liability on our financial statements as of September 30, 2015.\nOn May 15, 2015 we executed a letter agreement promissory note with the Universal Service Administrative Company (\u201cUSAC\u201d) for $220,616, payable in monthly installments of $10,463 (which include interest at 12.75% per annum) over twenty-four months starting June 15, 2015 through May 15, 2017 - the outstanding balance was $212,534 as of September 30, 2015. The May 15, 2015 letter agreement promissory note is related to our liability for Universal Service Fund (USF) contribution payments not made by us during the first and second quarters of fiscal 2015, but which were reflected as an accrued liability on our balance sheet as of those dates and therefore resulted in the May 2015 reclassification of a portion of that accrued liability to notes payable. USAC is a not-for-profit corporation designated by the Federal Communications Commission (\u201cFCC\u201d) as the administrator of the USF program.\nAlthough they were repaid on March 21, 2013, the terms of the Equipment Notes still provided that on the maturity dates (as established in the December 12, 2012 modification), the Recognized Value of the shares issued as part of such repayment would be calculated as the sum of the following two items - (i) the gross proceeds to the Investors from the sales of the 583,334 shares issued per the December 12, 2012 modification plus (ii) the value of those shares issued and still held by the Noteholders and not sold, using the average ONSM closing bid price per share for the ten (10) trading days prior to the applicable maturity date. If the Recognized Value exceeded the Credited Value, then we would receive 50% (fifty percent) of such excess, although the amount received by us shall not exceed $175,000. If the Credited Value exceeded the Recognized Value, then we would be obligated to pay such excess to the Noteholders. With respect to Equipment Notes held by one of the three Noteholders, the Credited Value exceeded the Recognized Value for 166,667 common shares by approximately $16,000 as of the respective November 15, 2013 maturity date, which we have recognized as a liability on our September 30, 2015 balance sheet.\nIn connection with financing obtained by us in October and November 2013 from the other two Noteholders (see \u201cWorking Capital Notes\u201d above), the above terms with respect to settlement of differences between the Credited Value and the Recognized Value were replaced with our agreement to buy back, to the extent permitted by law, the 416,667 common shares issued to those Noteholders, if the fair market value of the shares are not equal to at least $0.30 per share on the maturity dates of the October and November 2013 financing, which were April 24 and May 4, 2015, respectively. The $125,000 present value of this obligation is recorded as a liability on our financial statements as of September 30, 2015. Furthermore, we have agreed that in the event we receive funds in excess of $5 million as a result of a single transaction for the sale of all or a part of our operations or assets, that those funds will be available to satisfy the above buyback obligation, such availability subject only to prior satisfaction of any claims held by Thermo Credit LLC, Rockridge Capital Holdings LLC, Sigma Opportunity Fund II, LLC, USAC, and certain capital leases (HP Financial and Tamco), or any assignees or successors thereto and pari passu with up to $775,000 of total indebtedness and related obligations raised and incurred by us during the first quarter of fiscal 2014.\nThe closing ONSM share price was $0.14 and $0.16 per share on April 24 and May 4, 2015, respectively, which would trigger the above repurchase obligation in the gross amount of $125,000, based on 416,667 shares at $0.30 per share. However, this repurchase obligation is subject to the shares being still held by the Noteholder(s) at such date and the Noteholder giving us notice and delivering the shares within fifteen days after such date, as well as any other legal restrictions with respect to our repurchase of shares. It is possible that some or all of this repurchase obligation could be avoided by us due to the failure of the Noteholder or Noteholders to formally present the shares to us and/or provide notice by the specified date, or as a result of legal restrictions with respect to our repurchase of shares. However, because of our ongoing discussions with certain of these Noteholders, including past discussions with respect to debt principal and/or interest payments in arrears to them and our communications to them at the time that we would not be in a position to honor this repurchase obligation for some of the same reasons we were in arrears on debt principal and/or interest payments, it is possible those Noteholders could assert mitigating circumstances under which we might honor all or part of this repurchase obligation. Therefore, pending our further evaluation of our position with respect to this repurchase obligation, we are leaving the accrued liability on our financial statements as of September 30, 2015.\nIn December 2012, as part of a transaction under which J&C Resources issued us a funding commitment letter, we agreed to reimburse CCJ in cash the shortfall, payable on December 31, 2014, as compared to minimum guaranteed net proceeds of $175,000, from their resale of 437,500 common shares CCJ received on December 31, 2012 upon their conversion of 17,500 shares of Series A-13 and after effecting our agreement as part of the same transaction to reduce the conversion rate on all Series A-13 shares from $1.72 per common share to $0.40 per common share. The $109,000 present value of our estimate of this obligation is recorded as a liability on our financial statements as of September 30, 2015. If the closing ONSM share price of $0.21 per share on December 31, 2014 (the end of the period during which the shares must be sold to be eligible for reimbursement of any shortfall) was used as a basis of calculation, our obligation for this shortfall payment would be $83,000 plus brokerage commissions and other selling costs.\nAs a condition of the above shortfall reimbursement, CCJ agreed to sell the Conversion Shares in the open market between the December 21, 2013 conversion date and December 31, 2014 payment date, taking due care with respect to the timing and volume of those sales and the market conditions. As of April 5, 2016, CCJ has not formally requested this reimbursement nor have they provided proof that the above conditions of reimbursement have been met. However, because of our ongoing discussions with CCJ, including past discussions with respect to debt principal and/or interest payments in arrears to them and our communications to them at the time that we would not be in a position to honor this shortfall reimbursement obligation for some of the same reasons we were in arrears on debt principal and/or interest payments, it is possible that CCJ could assert mitigating circumstances, notwithstanding whether or not they met the conditions of reimbursement, under which we might honor all or part of this shortfall reimbursement obligation. Therefore, pending our further evaluation of our position with respect to this shortfall reimbursement obligation, we are leaving the accrued liability on our balance sheet as of September 30, 2015.\nAfter annual increases in prior years as set forth in the employment agreements, the contractual annual base salaries for the five Executives in aggregate as of September 30, 2015 was approximately $1.8 million, subject to a five percent (5%) increase on September 27, 2016 and each year thereafter - a portion of these contractual salaries are presently not being paid to the Executives and we are accruing these unpaid amounts as non-cash compensation expense, with the unpaid portion reflected as an accrued liability under the balance sheet caption \u201cAmounts due to executives and officers\u201d. In addition, each of the Executives receives an auto allowance payment of $1,000 per month, a \u201cretirement savings\u201d payment of $1,500 per month and an annual reimbursement of dues or charitable donations up to $5,000. We also pay insurance premiums for the Executives, including medical, life and disability coverage. Effective October 1, 2009, in response to our operating cash requirements, the base salary amounts being paid to the Executives were adjusted to be 10% less than the contractual amounts. In addition, until certain actions as discussed below, the amounts representing the subsequent contractual annual increases to those base salary amounts were not paid. Effective September 16, 2012, the base salary amounts being paid to the Executives were reinstated by an amount representing approximately 7.8% of the contractual base salary at that time. Effective September 16, 2014, the base salary amounts being paid to the Executives were reinstated by an amount representing approximately 5.0% of the contractual base salary at that time. Effective May 1, 2015, the base salary amounts being paid to the Executives were reinstated by an amount representing approximately 7.4% of the contractual base salary at that time. Effective August 15, 2016, the base salary amounts being paid to the Executives were reduced by an amount representing approximately 3.0% of the contractual base salary at that time. As of October 7, 2016, the base salary payments to the Executives are approximately 21.5% less than the contractual base salaries (as adjusted through the September 27, 2016 raise), compared to the 10% reduction instituted in October 2009 and which reduction was initially company-wide but at this time affects very few of our other employees. The 21.5% shortfall cited above is before considering the impact of the two lump-sum payments made to the Executives in April and December 2015, as discussed below. Under the terms of the employment agreements, upon a termination subsequent to a change of control, termination without cause or constructive termination, each as defined in the agreements, we would be obligated to pay each of the Executives an amount equal to three (3) times the Executive's base salary plus full benefits for a period of the lesser of (i) three (3) years from the date of termination or (ii) the date of termination until a date one (1) year after the end of the initial employment contract term.\nIn consideration of the waiver and satisfaction of any remaining unpaid salary due to the Executives through December 31, 2012 under their employment agreements, as well as the waiver and satisfaction of any remaining unpaid amounts due to certain of those Executives in connection with the acquisition of Acquired Onstream, we (as authorized by our Board of Directors) and the Executives agreed, effective January 22, 2013, (i) to pay $100,000 ($20,000 per Executive) of the withheld compensation in cash and (ii) to issue 1,700,000 (340,000 per Executive) fully vested ONSM common shares, subject to certain trading restrictions (the \u201cExecutive Shares\u201d).\n$125,000 in cash ($25,000 per Executive) was paid in April 2015, which satisfied the above commitment to pay the $100,000 of pre December 31, 2012 compensation not covered by the Executive Shares (and also satisfied $25,000 of post December 31, 2012 compensation previously withheld by us and accrued as a liability).\nAlthough, as of October 28, 2016, the Executive Shares have not been issued, due to certain administrative and documentation requirements, since the Executive Shares were committed to be issued by the January 22, 2013 action of the Board, that issuance was reflected in our financial statements as of the date of such commitment. To the extent there is any shortfall from the gross proceeds upon resale by the Executives of the Executive Shares as compared to twenty-nine cents ($0.29) per share, the shortfall will be reimbursed to the Executives by us in cash, or at our option, by the issuance of additional fully vested ONSM common shares (the \u201cAdditional Executive Shares\u201d), with the Additional Executive Shares subject to reimbursement by us to the Executives of any shortfall from the gross proceeds upon resale as compared to the fair value used to determine the number of such Additional Executive Shares. All shortfall reimbursements shall be payable by us within ten (10) business days after presentation by reasonable supporting documentation of the shortfall to us by the Executives. The $136,000 value of this obligation is recorded as a liability on our financial statements as of September 30, 2015, based on the closing ONSM share price as of that date. If the closing ONSM share price of $0.18 per share on October 7, 2016 was used as a basis of calculation, our obligation for this shortfall payment would be $187,000, or the equivalent in common shares.\nAn additional $125,000 in cash compensation ($25,000 per Executive) was paid in December 2015, which will reduce the previously accrued liability for unpaid compensation and will also result in a corresponding reclassification between cash compensation and non-cash compensation expense.\nOn February 20, 2013, we (as authorized by our Board of Directors) and the Executives agreed to certain changes in the Executives' employment agreements, which among other things included the implementation of an executive incentive compensation plan (the \u201cExecutive Incentive Plan\u201d). Compensation under the Executive Incentive Plan would be in the form of Fully Restricted (as defined below) ONSM common Plan shares (\u201cExecutive Incentive Shares\u201d) and is based on the Company achieving certain financial objectives as follows for fiscal year 2015:\n\u00b7 Increased revenues (as compared to the respective prior year).\n\u00b7 Positive operating cash flow (as defined in the Executive Incentive Plan).\n\u00b7 EBITDA, as adjusted, (as defined in the Executive Incentive Plan) for at least two quarters.\nWe recorded the issuance of 375,000 Executive Incentive Shares in our financial statements for the year ended September 30, 2015, based on our previous determinations that (i) the fiscal 2015 financial objective for EBITDA, as adjusted, was met and (ii) it was probable that the fiscal 2015 financial objective for positive operating cash flow, would be met. These shares were recorded at a value of $71,250, which was recognized as non-cash compensation expense of (i) $47,500 over the six months ended March 31, 2015 (with respect to the EBITDA objective) and (ii) $23,750 over the twelve months ended September 30, 2015 (with respect to the cash flow objective). Although our final fiscal 2015 financial statements indicate that the operating cash flow objective was not met, we have continued to recognize the related compensation expense in our September 30, 2015 financial statements, pending further review of this matter by the Board of Directors. Regardless of the results of this review, this amount is considered immaterial for adjustment prior to finalization of the fiscal 2015 financial results. The third fiscal 2015 financial objective, increased revenues, was not met. If accomplished, it would have resulted in an aggregate of 250,000 additional Executive Incentive Shares issued to the Executives as a group.\nNone of the shares recorded on our financial statements through September 30, 2015 and related to the financial objectives for fiscal 2015 have been issued as of October 28, 2016.\nThe Executive Incentive Shares are subject to a complete restriction on the Executive's ability to access or transact in any way such shares until the restriction is lifted. Upon a change of control, termination of the Executive's employment or the imminently proposed and/or anticipated sale of the Company at a price of $1.00 per common share or more, all restrictions on the Executive Incentive Shares and any other common shares held by the Executives will be lifted. In the case of a sale, all restrictions will be lifted in time for those previously restricted shares to participate in all voting with respect to the proposed sale and will be eligible, at the Executive's option, for inclusion as part of the shares sold in that transaction. Due to the restrictions on the Executive Incentive Shares, we have determined that the issuance thereof will not result in taxable compensation income to the Executives (or tax deductible compensation expense to the Company) until such restrictions have been lifted.\nAs of September 30, 2015, we were obligated under operating leases for five office locations (one each in Pompano Beach, Florida, San Francisco, California and Colorado Springs, Colorado and two in the New York City area), which call for monthly payments totaling approximately $54,000. The leases have expiration dates ranging from 2015 to 2022 (after considering our rights of termination) and in most cases provide for renewal options. The future minimum lease payments required under the non-cancelable operating leases total approximately $1.4 million through September 30, 2022, of which approximately $383,000 relates to the year ending September 30, 2016. Also, although approximately nine months of unpaid rent with respect to our Pompano Beach facility is included as a liability on our balance sheet as of September 30, 2015, these amounts are not included in the future minimum lease payments of approximately $1.4 million. As of October 28, 2016, our rent payments for that location remain in arrears, by approximately twelve months, and we are in negotiations with the landlord with respect to this obligation and the terms of our continuing tenancy.\nWe have entered into various agreements for our purchase of Internet, long distance and other connectivity as well as use of certain co-location facilities, for an aggregate remaining minimum purchase commitment of approximately $1.6 million, approximately $1.0 million of that commitment related to the one year period ending September 30, 2016 and the balance of such commitment related to the period from October 2016 through August 2017.\nProjected capital expenditures for the year ending September 30, 2016 total approximately $240,000, which includes software and hardware upgrades to the webcasting platform, the DMSP and the audio and web conferencing infrastructure. Some of these projected capital expenditures may be financed, deferred past the twelve month period or cancelled entirely, depending on our other cash flow considerations.\nOn March 5 and 6, 2015, we received aggregate gross cash proceeds of $1.0 million for our sale, effective February 28, 2015, of a defined subset of Infinite Conferencing's (\u201cInfinite\u201d) audio conferencing customers (and the related future business to those customers) (\u201cSold Accounts\u201d) to Infinite Conferencing Partners LLC, a Florida limited liability company (\u201cPartners\u201d). The Sold Accounts represented historical annual revenues of approximately $1.35 million. After giving effect to our determination that Partners is a Variable Interest Entity (VIE) requiring consolidation in our financial statements, (i) the gross proceeds from this and our subsequent transactions with Partners are reflected as an increase in our equity (noncontrolling owners' interest in VIE), (ii) the gross revenues from the Sold Accounts, and accounts sold as part of our subsequent transactions with Partners, are included in our consolidated revenues and (iii) the payment of the Partners' guaranteed return percentage, which is deducted from these gross revenues, is reflected as a decrease in our equity (distributions to owners of VIE).\nIn connection with the February 28, 2015 sale, Infinite and Partners entered into a Management Services Agreement (\u201cMSA\u201d) that provides for Infinite to continue to invoice the Sold Accounts but the payments when received from those Sold Accounts will be deposited in a segregated Partners owned bank account. Partners will return those customer proceeds to Infinite on a weekly basis in the form of a Management Fee, after deducting a certain amount representing (i) Partners' guaranteed return (which is 40% of the Purchase Price per annum with the first six months guaranteed regardless of whether we exercise our rights under the Option Agreement or the MSA is otherwise terminated) and (ii) accounting fees payable to the third-party accounting firm as discussed below. Infinite will continue to service the Sold Accounts, incurring and absorbing all related costs of doing so - i.e., Partners will have no operating responsibilities and no operating costs related to the sold accounts other than to pay the Management Fee to Infinite. As part of the sale of additional Infinite customer accounts in a December 2015 transaction discussed in more detail below, the Partners' guaranteed return percentage decreased. The MSA defines specific services, along with certain minimum standards of quality for such services, required to be provided by Infinite with respect to the Sold Accounts. The MSA contains provisions that prohibit (i) Infinite servicing the Sold Accounts for a period of two years after the termination of the MSA and (ii) Partners interfering in any way with Infinite's performance of its duties thereunder or communicating with the Sold Accounts or with Infinite's employees, vendors, consultants or agents during the term of the MSA.\nThe MSA initially had a two year term expiring on February 28, 2017, unless and until terminated by mutual consent of the parties or pursuant to certain termination rights as follows. As part of the sale of additional Infinite customer accounts in a December 2015 transaction discussed in more detail below, the expiration date of the MSA was extended. Partners has the right to terminate the MSA, effective immediately upon written notice to Infinite, in the event of the following: (i) an Infinite Event of Default or (ii) the sale by Partners of the Sold Accounts subject to the terms of the Membership Interest Option Agreement.\nAn Infinite Event of Default is (i) Bankruptcy of Infinite (as defined), (ii) a lack of compliance by Infinite with the provisions of the MSA which is continuing five (5) business days after receiving written notice from partners specifying such lack of compliance or (iii) a breach by Infinite or Onstream of any obligation under the Make Whole Agreement. Infinite has the right to terminate the MSA, effective immediately upon written notice to Partners, in the event of a Partners Event of Default. A Partners Event of Default is (i) a deliberate and material lack of compliance by Partners with the provisions of the MSA which is continuing five (5) business days after receiving written notice from Infinite specifying such lack of compliance or (ii) a breach by Partners of Partners' obligations under the Membership Interest Option Agreement. Notwithstanding termination of the MSA, only for so long as the Infinite owns the Sold Accounts, Partners shall continue to pay the Management Fee, provided that Partners may deduct from such Management Fee Partners' payment of all reasonable costs of providing the services to the Sold Accounts otherwise required to be provided by Infinite under the MSA.\nPartners has engaged a third-party accounting firm to manage all cash transactions under the MSA and Infinite, Partners and the accounting firm have entered into a separate agreement (Agreement Re Distributions) whereby the accounting firm has explicitly agreed to carry out the terms of the MSA and other related documents executed between Infinite and Partners, particularly with respect to distributions of funds and to not vary from that except upon joint written instructions from Infinite and Partners. We have agreed to be responsible for the fees of the third-party accounting firm.\nIn connection with the February 28, 2015 sale, Infinite and Partners entered into a Make Whole Agreement which provides that if the revenues from the Sold Accounts falls below $1.0 million, Infinite will transfer additional customer accounts to Partners (which will become part of the Sold Accounts) sufficient to bring the revenues from the Sold Accounts back to $1.25 million (or the equivalent in cash flow). Onstream Media Corporation (\u201cOnstream\u201d) and Infinite have also committed that in the event there is any impediment, which directly or indirectly is caused by, or relates in any way to Infinite or Onstream, which would prevent more than 20% of the revenue from these sold accounts being earned or distributed to Partners, Infinite and Onstream would take all necessary steps to ensure that such impeded revenue or revenue shortfall is otherwise earned or distributed or shall pay the amount of such impeded revenue or revenue shortfall to Partners to the extent due on a quarterly basis.\nIn connection with the February 28, 2015 sale, Infinite and Partners entered into a Membership Interest Option Agreement (\u201cOption Agreement\u201d) whereby we have the right for the two-year period through February 28, 2017 to buy 100% ownership (i.e., all of the membership interests) of Partners by payment of the Purchase Price plus a premium, which premium increases on a pro-rata basis to 20% of the Purchase Price over the two year period, subject to a minimum premium of 10%. Starting six months after the Effective Date, Partners may sell the Sold Accounts to a third party, provide that they must provide us four month written advance notice of such sale during which four month period we have the right to exercise our rights under the Option Agreement. In the event we do not exercise our rights under the Option Agreement, and Partners sells the Customer Accounts to a third party, we are entitled to receive 50% of any excess of the sales price to the third party over what would have been our option price under the Option Agreement. As part of the sale of additional Infinite customer accounts in a December 2015 transaction discussed in more detail below, the expiration date of the Option Agreement was extended and the premium percentage decreased.\nThe Option Agreement provides that during the two-year option term, and until the option closing in the event of a timely exercise of the option thereunder, neither Partners nor its members will (i) encumber any of Partners' assets or membership interests to any party, other than Infinite, (ii) incur any liability whatsoever, whether actual or contingent, other than per the terms and provisions of the partnership operating agreement and the MSA or (iii) place a lien on the Sold Accounts.\nOn December 16 and 18, 2015, we received aggregate gross proceeds of approximately $2.1 million for our sale, effective December 16, 2015, of a defined subset of Infinite's audio conferencing customers (and the related future business to those customers) (\u201cFirst Tranche of Additional Sold Accounts\u201d) to Partners, which represented historical annual revenues of approximately $2.7 million. The increase in the number of limited partners of Partners resulting from this transaction decreased the total related party ownership percentage to approximately 25% as of December 16, 2015.\nIn connection with the December 16, 2015 sale, Infinite and Partners entered into:\n\u00b7 an Amended and Restated Make Whole Agreement (\u201cAmended Make Whole Agreement\u201d) which provides that if the combined revenues from the Sold Accounts and the First Tranche of Additional Sold Accounts (\u201cCombined Revenues\u201d) falls below approximately $3.2 million, Infinite will transfer additional customer accounts to Partners (which will become part of the Sold Accounts) sufficient to bring the Combined Revenues back to approximately $4.0 million (or the equivalent in cash flow). All other terms of the Amended Make Whole Agreement were substantially the same as the terms of the Make Whole Agreement as discussed above.\n\u00b7 an Amended and Restated Membership Interest Option Agreement (\u201cAmended Option Agreement\u201d) whereby we have the right for the two-year period through December 16, 2017 to buy 100% ownership (i.e., all of the membership interests) of Partners by payment of the combined purchase price of the Sold Accounts and the First Tranche of Additional Sold Accounts plus $100,000 (\u201cPurchase Price\u201d), plus a premium, which premium increases on a pro-rata basis to 10% of the Purchase Price over the two year period, subject to a minimum premium of 5%. All other terms of the Amended Option Agreement were substantially the same as the terms of the Membership Interest Option Agreement as discussed above.\n\u00b7 an Amended and Restated Management Services Agreement (\u201cAmended MSA\u201d) with a two year term expiring on December 16, 2017, unless and until terminated by mutual consent of the parties or pursuant to certain termination rights. The Amended MSA provides that the Partners' guaranteed return percentage be reduced to 30% per annum of the Purchase Price, with the first six months guaranteed regardless of whether we exercise our rights under the Amended Option Agreement or the Amended MSA is otherwise terminated. All other terms of the Amended MSA were substantially the same as the terms of the MSA as discussed above.\nDuring the period from March 25, 2016 through June 30, 2016 we received aggregate gross proceeds of approximately $800,000 for our sale, effective June 30, 2016, of a defined subset of Infinite's audio conferencing customers (and the related future business to those customers) (\u201cSecond Tranche of Additional Sold Accounts\u201d) to Partners, which represented historical annual revenues of approximately $1.0 million. The increase in the number of limited partners of Partners resulting from this transaction decreased the total related party ownership percentage to approximately 21% as of June 30, 2016.\nIn connection with the June 30, 2016 sale, Infinite and Partners entered into:\n\u00b7 an Amended and Restated Make Whole Agreement (\u201cSecond Amended Make Whole Agreement\u201d) which provides that if the combined revenues from the Sold Accounts, the First Tranche of Additional Sold Accounts and the Second Tranche of Additional Sold Accounts (\u201cCombined Revenues\u201d) falls below approximately $3.9 million, Infinite will transfer additional customer accounts to Partners (which will become part of the Sold Accounts) sufficient to bring the Combined Revenues back to approximately $4.9 million (or the equivalent in cash flow). All other terms of the Second Amended Make Whole Agreement were substantially the same as the terms of the Amended Make Whole Agreement as discussed above.\n\u00b7 an Amended and Restated Membership Interest Option Agreement (\u201cSecond Amended Option Agreement\u201d) whereby we have the right for the two-year period through December 16, 2017 to buy 100% ownership (i.e., all of the membership interests) of Partners by payment of the combined purchase price of the Sold Accounts, the First Tranche of Additional Sold Accounts and the Second Tranche of Additional Sold Accounts plus $100,000 (\u201cPurchase Price\u201d), plus a premium, which premium increases on a pro-rata basis to 10% of the Purchase Price over the two year period, subject to a minimum premium of 5%. All other terms of the Second Amended Option Agreement were substantially the same as the terms of the Amended Option Agreement as discussed above.\n\u00b7 an Amended and Restated Management Services Agreement (\u201cSecond Amended MSA\u201d) with a two year term expiring on December 16, 2017, unless and until terminated by mutual consent of the parties or pursuant to certain termination rights. The Second Amended MSA provides that the Partners' return is guaranteed for the first six months regardless of whether we exercise our rights under the Second Amended Option Agreement or the Second Amended MSA is otherwise terminated. All other terms of the Second Amended MSA were substantially the same as the terms of the Amended MSA as discussed above.\nDuring September and October 2016, subscriptions for approximately $225,000 were received by Partners and funded against an anticipated total of $1.5 million for our sale, which we expect will be effective during November 2016, of a defined subset of Infinite's audio conferencing customers (and the related future business to those customers) (\u201cThird Tranche of Additional Sold Accounts\u201d) to Partners, will represent historical annual revenues of approximately $1.9 million, and will be sold under the same terms as the accounts sold in December 2015 and June 2016.\nWe are responsible for legal, consulting, finders and other fees related to the initial closing of the above transactions, as well as ongoing fees to administer these transactions, including (i) the third-party accounting firm as discussed above, (ii) certain compensation and expense payments to the general partner and (iii) certain other financial transaction expenses. These expenses are included as part of non-operating expenses (other (expense) income, net) and were approximately $115,000 and none for the years ended September 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nIn December 2015 we recorded the issuance of 200,000 unregistered common shares for professional management services rendered in connection with Partners, such shares having a fair value of approximately $38,000 and are being recognized as part of the above non-operating expenses over a service period of twelve months starting December 16, 2015.\nOn April 30, 2015, we received a funding commitment letter (the \u201cFunding Letter\u201d) from J&C Resources, Inc. (\u201cJ&C\u201d), agreeing to provide us, within twenty (20) days after our notice on or before January 5, 2016, aggregate cash funding of up to $800,000. Such notice was not given by us, but on\nApril 30, 2016, we exercised our option for a one year extension of the Funding Letter, including an extension of the notice deadline to January 5, 2017. This Funding Letter was obtained solely to demonstrate our ability to obtain short-term funds in the event other funding sources are not available. Mr. Charles Johnston, a former ONSM director, is the president of J&C. Cash provided under the Funding Letter would be in exchange for our issuance of (a) a note or notes with interest payable monthly at 15% per annum and principal payable on the earlier of a date twelve months from funding or July 15, 2017 and (b) 10.0 million unregistered common shares, which shares would be prorated in the case of partial funding. The note or notes would be unsecured and subordinated to all of our other debts, except to the extent such the terms of such debts would allow pari passu status. Furthermore, the note or notes would not be subject to any provisions, other than with respect to priority of payments or collateral, of our other debts. Upon receipt by us of funds in excess of $5.0 million as a result of a single transaction for the sale of all or a part of our operations or assets, this Funding Letter will be terminated. The consideration for the Funding Letter was $25,000, which we have paid, and the consideration for the Funding Letter extension is $25,000, to be withheld from any proceeds lent thereunder but in any event paid no later than September 1, 2016. On March 27, 2007 we acquired the assets, technology and patents pending of privately owned Auction Video, Inc., a Utah corporation, and Auction Video Japan, Inc., a Tokyo-Japan corporation (collectively, \u201cAuction Video\u201d). In connection with our subsequent pursuit of approval of these patents pending (i) on October 13, 2015, the USPTO issued to us U.S. Patent Number 9,161,068 (the \u201cFirst Granted Patent\u201d) with a Patent Term Adjustment of 2,377 days, resulting in a September 26, 2030 expiration date, provided all maintenance fees are paid and (ii)on October 11, 2016, the USPTO issued to us U.S. Patent Number 9,467,728 (the \u201cSecond Granted Patent\u201d) with a Patent Term Adjustment of 1,362 days, resulting in a December 16, 2027 expiration date, provided all maintenance fees are paid. These patents address live streaming of audio and/or video from multiple devices to a storage location, such as the Internet or cloud, and the ability to access and retrieve the audio and/or video to multiple devices, whereby the content is not stored on the device. Our management believes that the First and Second Granted Patents, as well as two other related patents still pending, may have significant value, although this cannot be assured, and is presently exploring the financial potential of the First and Second Granted Patents and the patents pending. Regardless of the ultimate outcome with respect to the results of this process and/or the eventual USPTO decision with respect to the pending patent applications, our management has determined that there is no material exposure to an adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations, since all of the previous costs incurred by us in connection with the patents have been amortized to expense as of September 30, 2013 and are being expensed as incurred subsequent to that date. Certain of the former owners of Auction Video, Inc. have an interest in proceeds that we may receive under certain circumstances in connection with the First and Second Granted Patents and the patents pending.\nAs of the October 28, 2016 filing of this 10-K, more than one year after the latest balance sheet date being presented, we are operating in the normal course of business. The liquidity discussion below includes information from our June 30, 2016 10-Q, which is also being filed on October 28, 2016.\nWe have incurred losses since our inception, and have an accumulated deficit of approximately $149.0 million as of September 30, 2015. Our operations have been financed primarily through the issuance of equity and debt, including convertible debt and debt combined with the issuance of equity.For the year ended September 30, 2015, our revenues were not sufficient to fund our total cash expenditures (for operating and investing activities plus scheduled debt principal repayments and distributions to the VIE owners, both classified as financing activities) for that period and as a result we obtained additional funding from the March 2015 sale of certain of our audio conferencing customers (and the related future business to those customers) to Partners as well as restructuring the payment terms of Sigma Notes 1 and 2, the New Sigma Note and certain other notes. For the nine months ended June 30, 2016, our revenues were not sufficient to fund our total cash expenditures (for operating and investing activities plus the scheduled debt principal payments and distributions to the VIE owners) for that period and as a result we obtained additional funding from the December 2015 and June 2016 sales of certain of our audio conferencing customers (and the related future business to those customers) to Partners as well as restructuring the payment terms of the New Sigma Note and certain other notes.\nDuring the period from July 2015 through October 2016 we made certain headcount reductions and other changes in compensation which we expect will reduce our compensation expenditures for the twelve months ended June 30, 2017 by approximately $540,000, as compared to the twelve months ended June 30, 2016. We have also taken other actions which we expect will reduce our cost of sales as well as our expenses for professional fees, insurance and advertising and marketing for the twelve months ended June 30, 2017, as compared to the twelve months ended June 30, 2016.\nBased on historical results as well as results since September 30, 2015 to date, we do not expect that our fiscal 2016 revenues will be sufficient to fund our total cash expenditures (for operating and investing activities plus the scheduled debt principal payments and distributions to the VIE owners) for the twelve month period ended June 30, 2017, even after the anticipated impact of the expense reductions discussed above. However, we believe we will be able to cover this anticipated shortfall from the raising of additional capital in the form of debt and/or equity and/or the sales of assets or operations, including our transactions with Partners and the Funding Letter and/or the monetization of our patents, all sources of capital as discussed above. In the event that we are unable to cover this shortfall, including curing any potential defaults with respect to the Line, as discussed above, our auditors have advised us that a going concern qualification to their opinion on our September 30, 2016 financial statements may be necessary.\nCash required to fund our continued operations will be affected by numerous known and unknown risks and uncertainties including, but not limited to, our ability to successfully market and sell our products and services, the degree to which competitive products and services are introduced to the market, our ability to control and/or reduce expenses, our need to invest in new equipment and/or technology, and our ability to service and/or refinance our existing debt and accounts payable. We cannot assure that our revenues will continue at their present levels, nor can we assure that they will not decrease.\nTo the extent our cash flow from sales is insufficient to completely fund operating expenses, financing costs (including principal repayments) and capital expenditures, as well as any acceleration of our repayments of accounts payable and/or accrued liabilities, we will continue depleting our cash and other financial resources. Other than working capital which may become available to us from further borrowing or sales of equity or assets or operations (including but not limited to proceeds from the Line or the Funding Letter, as discussed above), we do not presently have any additional sources of working capital other than cash on hand and cash, if any, generated from operations. As a result of the uncertainty as to our available working capital over the upcoming months, we may be required to delay or cancel certain of the projected capital expenditures, some of the planned marketing expenditures, or other planned expenses. In addition, it is possible that we will need to seek additional capital through equity and/or debt financing or through other activities. If we raise additional capital through the issuance of debt, this will result in increased interest expense. If we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity or convertible debt securities, the percentage ownership of our company held by existing shareholders will be reduced and those shareholders may experience significant dilution.\nThe resolution of debt and other obligations becoming due within a few months after the filing of this 10-K represent an imminent issue that will require significant cash resources in the near-term. These include (i) the New Sigma Note and the Rockridge Note, secured obligations which will require principal payments on December 31, 2016 aggregating $1.0 million and (ii) other notes payable, mostly unsecured, which will require principal payments of $187,000 on December 31, 2016 and $625,000 on January 15, 2017. In the event we exercised our rights under the extended Funding Letter, we would need to repay the proceeds borrowed thereunder on the earlier of a date twelve months from funding or July 15, 2017.\nWe are closely monitoring our revenue and other business activity to determine if and when further cost reductions, the raising of additional capital or other activity is considered necessary. The Executives have deferred a portion of their compensation in the past, to the extent we needed that cash to meet other operating expenses, and have agreed to defer a portion of their compensation to the extent we need that cash to enable us to be a going concern through September 30, 2017.\nOur continued existence is dependent upon our ability to raise capital and to market and sell our services successfully. Based on our plan to continue our operations through September 30, 2017, we will need to raise the remaining $1.275 million from the sale of the Third Tranche of Additional Sold Accounts and borrow $800,000 per our option to do so under the Funding Letter, as discussed above, or from other funding sources, and we will also need to obtain extensions of the existing maturity dates past that date for certain identified notes payable representing aggregate principal of $640,000. In addition we will need to increase our gross margin and/or decrease our operating expenses by an aggregate of approximately $1.0 million per year, as compared to their current levels, for the year ended September 30, 2017 - our plan includes specific potential sources of new gross margin and expense reductions aggregating approximately $1.5 million. However, there are no assurances whatsoever that we will be able to sell additional common shares or other forms of equity and/or that we will be able to borrow further funds other than under the Funding Letter and/or that we will be able to sell assets or operations and/or that we will be able to increase our revenues and/or control our expenses to a level sufficient to provide positive cash flow. The financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or amounts and classification of liabilities that may result if we are unsuccessful.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles (\u201cGAAP\u201d) and our significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 to those statements. The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires that we make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying footnotes. Our assumptions are based on historical experiences and changes in the business environment. However, actual results may differ from estimates under different conditions, sometimes materially. Critical accounting policies and estimates are defined as those that are most important to the management's most subjective judgments. Our most critical accounting policies and estimates are described below.\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets:\nOur prior acquisitions of several businesses, including Infinite Conferencing, Intella2, EDNet and Acquired Onstream, have resulted in significant increases in goodwill and other intangible assets. Goodwill was approximately $3.2 million at September 30, 2015, representing approximately 48% of our total assets. Other intangible assets resulting from prior acquisitions have been fully amortized and/or written down as of September 30, 2015. In addition, property and equipment as of September 30, 2015 includes approximately $423,000 (net of depreciation) representing approximately 6% of our total assets and primarily related to the capitalized development costs of the DMSP platform. The book value of our equity (both excluding and including noncontrolling owners' interest in VIE) was negative as of September 30, 2015.\nIn accordance with GAAP, we periodically test these assets for potential impairment. As part of our testing, we rely on both historical operating performance as well as anticipated future operating performance of the entities that have generated these intangibles. Factors that could indicate potential impairment include a significant change in projected operating results and cash flow, a new technology developed and other external market factors that may affect our customer base. We will continue to monitor our goodwill and other intangible assets and our overall business environment. If there is a material adverse and ongoing change in our business operations (or if an adverse change initially considered temporary is determined to be ongoing), the value of our goodwill and other intangible assets could decrease significantly. In the event that it is determined that we will be unable to successfully market or sell any of our services, an impairment charge to our statement of operations could result. Any future determination requiring the write-off of a significant portion of goodwill or unamortized intangible assets, although not requiring any additional cash outlay, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nIn accordance with ASC Topic 350, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other, which addresses the financial accounting and reporting standards for goodwill and other intangible assets subsequent to their acquisition, goodwill must be tested for impairment on a periodic basis, at a level of reporting referred to as a reporting unit. Although other intangible assets are being amortized to expense over their estimated useful lives, the unamortized balances are still subject to review and adjustment for impairment. There is a two-step process for impairment testing of goodwill and other intangible assets. The first step of this test, used to identify potential impairment, compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. The second step, if necessary, measures the amount of the impairment, including a comparison and reconciliation of the carrying value of all of our reporting units to our market capitalization, after appropriate adjustments for control premium and other considerations.\nThe provisions of ASC 350-20-35-3 in certain cases would allow us to forego the two-step impairment testing process based on certain qualitative evaluation. However, based on our assessment as of September 30, 2015 and 2014 of relevant events and circumstances as listed in ASC 350-20-35-3C, we determined that we were not eligible to employ qualitative evaluation to forego the two-step impairment testing process with respect to our reporting units as of those dates, as it was not more likely than not that impairment loss had not occurred. These relevant events and circumstances included our declining revenues as well as certain macroeconomic conditions, including access to capital and the ongoing decrease in the ONSM share price.\nThe material portion of our goodwill and other intangible assets are contained in the EDNet reporting unit, the Acquired Onstream/DMSP reporting unit and the audio and web conferencing reporting unit, which includes the Infinite Conferencing and the OCC/Intella2 divisions. Our reporting units were identified based on the requirements of ASC 350-20-35-33 through 350-20-35-46. According to ASC 350-20-35-34, a component of an operating segment is a reporting unit if that component represents a business for which discrete financial information is available and segment management regularly reviews the operating results of that component. This is the case for the EDNet division, the Acquired Onstream/DMSP division, the Infinite Conferencing division, the OCC/Intella2 division and the Webcasting division. However, ASC 350-20-35-35 provides that two or more components of an operating segment shall be aggregated and deemed a single reporting unit if the components have similar economic characteristics. This is the case for the Infinite Conferencing division and the OCC/Intella2 division, since they are both in the business of audio and web conferencing sold primarily to business customers. Although EDNet is in the same operating segment as the Infinite Conferencing division and the OCC/Intella2 division, it is not considered to be part of the audio and web conferencing reporting unit since EDNet offers a specialized service to the entertainment industry (movies, television, advertising) that uses a specific type of network connection (integrated services digital network or \u201cISDN\u201d) to transport its clients' multimedia content. ISDN is a significantly different technology from the standard telephone lines used by the Infinite Conferencing division and the OCC/Intella2 division.\nAs part of the two-step process discussed above for the September 30, 2015 and 2014 evaluations, our management performed discounted cash flow (\u201cDCF\u201d) projections and market value (\u201cMV\u201d) analyses, to determine whether the goodwill of our reporting units was potentially impaired and the amount of such impairment. The results of these projections and analyses were weighted, and the weighted result reduced by the amount of associated allocable non-current debt, to come up with a single estimated fair value (\u201cFV\u201d) for each reporting unit. A third-party valuation services firm was engaged by us to assist with these projections and analyses, value calculations and weightings.\nFor the September 30, 2015 and 2014 evaluations, our management, with the assistance of the third-party valuation services firm, determined the rates and assumptions (including probability of future revenues and costs, tax shields and annual and terminal discount factors) used by it to prepare the DCF projections and also considered macroeconomic and other conditions such as: our credit rating, stock price and access to capital; industry growth projections; our historical sales trends and our technological accomplishments compared to our peer group.\nAs part of the DCF projections prepared for use in the September 30, 2015 and 2014 evaluations, we analyzed our corporate payroll and other general and administrative expenses to determine their relevance to the reporting units, and to the extent relevant, we allocated such costs when preparing those projections. For the years ended September 30, 2015 and 2014, we determined that approximately 82% and 83%, respectively, of our corporate payroll plus other general and administrative expenses (excluding non-cash expenses) were allocable to our reporting units, including those without goodwill or other intangible assets. The non-allocable corporate costs related to various public company related requirements, including D&O insurance and certain legal, accounting and other professional and consulting fees and expenses, as well as the costs of evaluating new business opportunities and products outside the existing divisions.\nDuring the time period from February 2015 through June 2016, we received cash proceeds for our sales, in tranches, of defined subsets of Infinite Conferencing's (\u201cInfinite\u201d) audio conferencing customers (and the related future business to those customers) to Infinite Conferencing Partners LLC, a Florida limited liability company (\u201cPartners\u201d). In accordance with management fee agreements we entered into with Partners in connection with these sales, we are required to continue servicing the sold accounts and absorb all related costs of doing so but we also receive the Partners' revenues from these sold accounts, less a deduction for the Partners' guaranteed return - see Liquidity and Capital Resources above for a detailed discussion of these transactions. For purposes of the September 30, 2015 and 2014 evaluations, we included the Partners' revenues and all related operating costs incurred by us in our DCF projections for the audio and web conferencing reporting unit, but considered the amount deducted for the Partners' guaranteed return to not be specific to that unit's operations but rather to be analogous to a corporate financing cost and thus this cash outflow was not included as part of our DCF projections for the audio and web conferencing reporting unit.\nFor the September 30, 2015 and 2014 evaluations, our management, with the assistance of the third-party valuation services firm, determined the appropriately comparable publicly reporting companies and public market transactions used by it to perform the MV analyses. Factors taken into consideration in selecting the appropriately comparable companies included the relative size of the candidate company, measured by revenues and assets, as compared to our reporting units and the extent to which the stated business activities of the candidate company align with the primary business activities of our reporting units. Once comparable companies and transactions were identified, the valuation calculation was based on multiples of revenues and, to the extent applicable, EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization). In the case of the September 30, 2015 evaluation, we, based on the advice of the third-party valuations services firm, determined that the publicly reporting companies and public market transactions that we were able to identify as available for our analysis were not sufficiently comparable to the operating characteristics of most of our reporting units therefore these MV analyses were given a zero percent (0%) weighting - i.e., they were not considered - when determining FV.\nBased on the above, as well as a report prepared by the third-party valuation services firm, we determined that the FVs of the Acquired Onstream, EDNet and audio and web conferencing reporting units, calculated as described above, were less than their respective net carrying amounts as of September 30, 2015 and that further evaluation under the second step of the two-step process described above was necessary.\nAs part of this second step, our management, with the assistance of the third-party valuation services firm, determined the fair value of all tangible and intangible assets and liabilities of each of our reporting units, including any material unrecorded assets or liabilities. This allocation process was performed only for purposes of testing goodwill for impairment, and did not result in the write up or write down of recognized assets or liabilities, or the recognition of previously unrecognized assets or liabilities. The carrying value of each reporting unit's goodwill was then compared to the implied fair value of that reporting unit's goodwill, such implied value being any excess of the FV of a reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities, and the excess of the carrying value over the implied fair value was written off, as follows: approximately $4.1 million related to the audio and web conferencing reporting unit's goodwill (of which we allocated approximately $3.9 million to Infinite and approximately $250,000 to Intella2), approximately $750,000 related to the EDNet reporting unit's goodwill and approximately $271,000 related to the Acquired Onstream reporting unit's goodwill. In addition, as a result of the above valuation, we recorded an approximately $446,000 write-off of the remaining Intella2 intangible assets, primarily the customer list. These write-offs were classified in our financial statements as impairment losses on goodwill and other intangible assets aggregating approximately $5.6 million for the year ended September 30, 2015.\nFurthermore, in order to address whether any further consideration of ONSM's share price was needed with respect to impairment testing, we, with the assistance of the third-party valuation services firm, performed an analysis to compare our book value to our market capitalization as of September 30, 2015, including adjustments for (i) paid-for but not issued common shares, such as the Rockridge Shares and the Executive Shares and (ii) an appropriate control premium. Based on this analysis, we concluded that there were no conditions with respect to our market capitalization as of September 30, 2015 which would require further evaluation with respect to the carrying values of our reporting units. The above analysis was performed based on a closing ONSM share price of $0.21 per share as of September 30, 2015.\nHowever, as of September 30, 2014, based on the above, as well as a report prepared by the third-party valuation services firm, we determined that the FVs of the Acquired Onstream, EDNet and audio and web conferencing reporting units, calculated as described above, were more than their respective net carrying amounts. Furthermore, in order to address whether any further consideration of ONSM's share price was needed with respect to impairment testing, we, with the assistance of the third-party valuation services firm, performed an analysis to compare our book value to our market capitalization as of September 30, 2014, including adjustments for (i) paid-for but not issued common shares, such as the Rockridge Shares and the Executive Shares and (ii) an appropriate control premium. Based on this analysis, we concluded that there were no conditions with respect to our market capitalization as of September 30, 2014 which would require further evaluation with respect to the carrying values of our reporting units. The above analysis was performed based on a closing ONSM share price of $0.17 per share as of September 30, 2014.\nAn annual impairment review of our goodwill will be performed as part of preparing our September 30, 2016 financial statements. Until that time, we are reviewing certain factors to determine whether a triggering event has occurred that would require an interim impairment review. Those factors include, but are not limited to, our management's estimates of future sales and operating income, which in turn take into account specific company, product and customer factors, as well as general economic conditions and the market price of our common stock.\nEDNet's operations are heavily dependent on the use of ISDN connections, which are only available from a limited number of suppliers. The two companies which are the primary suppliers of ISDN to EDNet have made recent public indications of intentions to restrict, or even eventually eliminate, their provision of ISDN. Such actions could have a significant adverse impact on our future evaluations of the carrying value of EDNet goodwill, especially if alternative ISDN suppliers cannot be identified or if an alternative such as Internet based technology is not available or economically feasible as a basis to continue the EDNet operations. However, these two companies have not announced definitive timetables for taking any extensive actions with regard to restricting ISDN and therefore we have not assumed any such actions would take place within the timeframe of our discounted cash flow analyses used by us for these evaluations to date.\nAs of September 30, 2015 we have capitalized as part of other internal use software approximately $2.0 million of employee compensation and other costs for the development of webcasting applications. As of September 30, 2015, substantially all of these costs have been placed in service, including approximately $444,000 placed in service in December 2009 for the initial release of iEncode software, which runs on a self-administered, webcasting appliance used to produce a live video webcast, approximately $352,000 placed in service in January 2013 for a new release of our basic webcasting platform and approximately $99,000, $251,000 and $96,000 placed in service in October 2013, July 2014 and July 2015, respectively, for enhancements to that new release. As of September 30, 2015, the approximately $262,000 of the total capitalized costs not yet placed in service relate to our development during the period from July 2013 through September 2015 of a \u201cdo it yourself\u201d large audience webcasting product that can be run from the customer's desktop and will be available on a fixed cost monthly subscription basis that can be purchased on-line. We expect to release this product in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. As part of our annual review of the carrying values of our long-lived assets for impairment as of September 30, 2015, we evaluated the remaining carrying value of the webcasting division's assets, primarily the unamortized software development costs, for impairment. We performed such an analysis by comparing the carrying value of those assets to the projected undiscounted future cash flows from the webcasting operations, as prescribed by applicable accounting literature for evaluating impairment of a depreciable asset with a fixed life. These projected future cash flows took into account (i) the webcasting revenues during fiscal 2015, which in spite of an increase for the nine months ended June 30, 2015 versus the corresponding prior year period, declined for the three months ended June 30, 2015, versus the corresponding prior year period, and were generally flat for the three months ended September 30, 2015, versus the corresponding prior year period (and which trend has continued through June 30, 2016) and (ii) information available to us with respect to backlog and potential future revenues as of September 30, 2015. Based on this information, we determined that it would not be appropriate to project growth in webcasting revenues for these purposes as of September 30, 2015. The initial decline in webcasting revenues that occurred for the quarter ended June 30, 2015 was not considered a \u201ctriggering event\u201d that might require an interim evaluation, since we were unable to determine that such decline represented a trend that might result in impairment until we saw additional results for the quarter ended September 30, 2015, as well as evaluated the backlog and potential future revenues as of that date. Since there was a significant level of recently capitalized software development costs for webcasting products as of September 30, 2015, and we did not project growth in webcasting revenues for this purpose, as a result of our analysis, we recognized a net impairment loss of $800,000 for the year ended September 30, 2015. After the impairment loss, the carrying cost of the webcasting division's capitalized internal software was reduced to approximately $35,000, which will be depreciated over the twelve months ending September 30, 2016. We will continue to evaluate any webcasting division development costs capitalized by us after September 30, 2015 for impairment on the same basis.", "summary": "- According to the annual report for

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion should be read together with the information contained in the Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes included in the annual report.\nOverview\nWe are a leading online service provider of live and on-demand corporate audio and web communications, virtual event technology and social media marketing, provided primarily to corporate (including large as well as small to medium sized businesses), education and government customers. We had approximately 75 full time employees as of October 7, 2016, with operations organized in two main operating groups:\n\u00b7 Audio and Web Conferencing Services Group\n\u00b7 Digital Media Services Group\nOur Audio and Web Conferencing Services Group consists of our Infinite Conferencing (\u201cInfinite\u201d) division, our Onstream Conferencing Corporation (\u201cOCC\u201d) division and our EDNet division. Our Infinite division, which operates primarily from the New York City area, and our OCC division, which operates primarily from San Diego, California, provide \u201creservationless\u201d and operator-assisted audio and web conferencing services. Our EDNet division, which operates primarily from San Francisco, California, provides connectivity (in the form of high quality audio and multimedia data communications) within the entertainment and advertising industries through its managed network, which encompasses production and post-production companies, advertisers, producers, directors, and talent.\nOur Digital Media Services Group consists primarily of our Webcasting division and our DMSP (\u201cDigital Media Services Platform\u201d) division. The DMSP division includes the related UGC (\u201cUser Generated Content\u201d) and Smart Encoding divisions. Our Webcasting division, which operates primarily from Pompano Beach, Florida and has a sales and support facility in New York City, provides an array of corporate-oriented, web-based media services to the corporate market including live audio and video webcasting and on-demand audio and video streaming for any business, government or educational entity. Our DMSP division, which operates primarily from Colorado Springs, Colorado, provides an online, subscription based service that includes access to enabling technologies and features for our clients to acquire, store, index, secure, manage, distribute and transform these digital assets into saleable commodities. Our UGC division, which also operates as Auction Video and operates primarily from Colorado Springs, Colorado, provides a video ingestion and flash encoder that can be used by our clients on a stand-alone basis or in conjunction with the DMSP. Our Smart Encoding division, which operates primarily from San Francisco, California, provides both automated and manual encoding and editorial services for processing digital media. This division also provides hosting, storage and streaming services for digital media, which are provided via the DMSP.\nFor segment information related to the revenue and operating income of these groups, see Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nRecent Developments\nAs of September 30, 2014 we were obligated to Sigma Opportunity Fund II, LLC (\u201cSigma\u201d) for principal and accrued interest aggregating $1,539,340. After our December 31, 2014 payment to Sigma of all accrued interest through that date, but no principal payments, we were obligated to Sigma under a secured note for $1,358,000, with future interest payable monthly at 21% per annum and the principal due on October 15, 2015 (the \u201cNew Sigma Note\u201d). On September 21, 2015, Sigma loaned us an additional $225,000, which resulted in $192,500 cash proceeds net of certain fees and expenses charged by Sigma. The net proceeds were used to pay approximately $173,000 of outstanding principal on one of the Working Capital Notes plus approximately $20,000 of accrued interest on that note. Accordingly, the outstanding balance of the New Sigma Note increased to $1,583,000 and the maturity date was extended to April 15, 2016, which extension resulted in our obligation to pay Sigma up to $250,000 in additional fees (plus monthly interest and penalties for late SEC filings, as applicable). During December 2015 we repaid $1.0 million of the outstanding balance due on the New Sigma Note and entered into additional agreements with Sigma whereby the maturity date on the remaining balance was extended from April 15, 2016 to December 31, 2016 and the interest rate, as well as certain other fees, was reduced. In the event of our default on the New Sigma Note, on or before the maturity date, the outstanding balance, including accrued interest, is convertible into our common shares at a price of $0.30 per common share.\nOn March 5 and 6, 2015, we received aggregate gross cash proceeds of $1.0 million for our sale, effective February 28, 2015, of a defined subset of Infinite Conferencing's (\u201cInfinite\u201d) audio conferencing customers (and the related future business to those customers) (\u201cSold Accounts\u201d) to Infinite Conferencing Partners LLC, a Florida limited liability company (\u201cPartners\u201d), which represent historical annual revenues of approximately $1.35 million. The proceeds from this sale were used by us to pay (i) approximately $311,000 of outstanding principal and approximately $136,000 of accrued interest on certain notes payable and (ii) approximately $69,000 for the cash portion of legal and consulting fees related to this transaction. The remaining proceeds were used for fee obligations under the New Sigma Note and for other operating expenses. After giving effect to our determination that Partners is a Variable Interest Entity (VIE) requiring consolidation in our financial statements, (i) the gross proceeds from this and subsequent transactions are reflected as an increase in our equity (noncontrolling owners' interest in VIE), (ii) the revenues from the Sold Accounts, and accounts sold as part of our subsequent transactions with Partners, are included in our consolidated revenues and (iii) the payment of the Partners' guaranteed return percentage, which is deducted from these gross revenues, is reflected as a decrease in our equity (distributions to owners of VIE).\nDuring December 2015, we received gross proceeds of approximately $2.1 million for our sale, effective December 16, 2015, of a defined subset of Infinite's audio conferencing customers (and the related future business to those customers) (\u201cFirst Tranche of Additional Sold Accounts\u201d) to Partners, which represented historical annual revenues of approximately $2.7 million which transaction resulted in an increase, as a percentage of revenues, of the management fee received by us with respect to the accounts sold by us in a similar transaction in February 2015 and which improved management fee also applied to the accounts sold in December 2015. From the December 2015 proceeds, we repaid an aggregate of $481,000 against the net outstanding balances of certain subordinated notes, in addition to the $1.0 million repayment against the New Sigma Note discussed above. During March through June 2016, we received gross proceeds of approximately $0.8 million for our sale, effective June 30, 2016, of a defined subset of Infinite's audio conferencing customers (and the related future business to those customers) (\u201cSecond Tranche of Additional Sold Accounts\u201d) to Partners, which represented historical annual revenues of approximately $1.0 million, and were sold under the same terms as the accounts sold in December 2015. During September and October 2016, subscriptions for approximately $225,000 were received by Partners and funded against an anticipated total of $1.5 million for our sale, which we expect will be effective during November 2016, of a defined subset of Infinite's audio conferencing customers (and the related future business to those customers) (\u201cThird Tranche of Additional Sold Accounts\u201d) to Partners, will represent historical annual revenues of approximately $1.9 million, and will be sold under the same terms as the accounts sold in December 2015 and June 2016.\nSince December 2007, we have had a line of credit arrangement with a financial institution under which we could borrow up to an aggregate of $2.0 million for working capital, collateralized by our accounts receivable and certain other related assets and the amount of such borrowing being further subject to the amount, aging and concentration of such receivables. On February 10, 2016, we entered into a loan modification agreement which extended the term of this line of credit arrangement through December 31, 2017.\nSee Liquidity and Capital Resources for further details with respect to the above transactions with Sigma, Thermo and Partners.\nOn April 30, 2015, we received a funding commitment letter (the \u201cFunding Letter\u201d) from J&C Resources, Inc. (\u201cJ&C\u201d), agreeing to provide us, within twenty (20) days after our notice on or before January 5, 2016, aggregate cash funding of up to $800,000. Such notice was not given by us, but on April 30, 2016, we exercised our option for a one year extension of the Funding Letter, including an extension of the notice deadline to January 5, 2017. The Funding Letter was obtained solely to demonstrate our ability to obtain short-term funds in the event other funding sources are not available, but does not represent any obligation to accept such funding on these terms and is not expected by us to be exercised. Cash provided under the Funding Letter, as extended, would be in exchange for our issuance of (a) a note or notes with interest payable monthly at 15% per annum and principal payable on the earlier of a date twelve months from funding or July 15, 2017 and (b) 10.0 million unregistered common shares, which shares would be prorated in the case of partial funding. The note or notes would be unsecured and subordinated to all of our other debts, except to the extent such the terms of such debts would allow pari passu status.\nOn March 27, 2007 we acquired the assets, technology and patents pending of privately owned Auction Video, Inc., a Utah corporation, and Auction Video Japan, Inc., a Tokyo-Japan corporation (collectively, \u201cAuction Video\u201d). In connection with our subsequent pursuit of approval of these patents pending (i) on October 13, 2015, the USPTO issued to us U.S. Patent Number 9,161,068 (the \u201cFirst Granted Patent\u201d) with a Patent Term Adjustment of 2,377 days, resulting in a September 26, 2030 expiration date, provided all maintenance fees are paid and (ii) on October 11, 2016, the USPTO issued to us U.S. Patent Number 9,467,728 (the \u201cSecond Granted Patent\u201d) with a Patent Term Adjustment of 1,362 days, resulting in a December 16, 2027 expiration date, provided all maintenance fees are paid. These patents address live streaming of audio and/or video from multiple devices to a storage location, such as the Internet or cloud, and the ability to access and retrieve the audio and/or video to multiple devices, whereby the content is not stored on the device. Our management believes that the First and Second Granted Patents, as well as two other related patents still pending, may have significant value, although this cannot be assured, and is presently exploring the financial potential of the First and Second Granted Patents and the patents pending.\nRevenue Recognition\nRevenues from recurring service are recognized when (i) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists between us and the customer, (ii) the goods or service has been provided to the customer, (iii) the price to the customer is fixed or determinable and (iv) collectibility of the sales price is reasonably assured.\nOur Audio and Web Conferencing Services Group recognizes revenue from audio and web conferencing as well as customer usage of digital network connections.\nThe Infinite and OCC divisions generally charge for audio conferencing and web conferencing services on a per-minute usage rate, although webconferencing services are also available for a monthly subscription fee allowing a certain level of usage. Audio conferencing and web conferencing revenue is recognized based on the timing of the customer's use of those services. The EDNet division primarily generates revenue from customer usage of digital network connections. EDNet purchases the rights to access digital network connections from national communications companies and resells such access to its customers for a fixed monthly fee plus separate per-minute usage charges. Network usage and bridging (managed transcoding and multipoint sessions) revenue is recognized based on the timing of the customer's usage of those services.\nOur Digital Media Services Group recognizes revenues from the acquisition, editing, transcoding, indexing, storage and distribution of its customers' digital media, as well as from live and on-demand internet webcasting and internet distribution of travel information.\nThe Webcasting division charges for live and on-demand webcasting at the time an event is accessible for streaming over the Internet. Charges to customers by the DMSP division are generally based on a monthly subscription fee, as well as charges for hosting, storage and professional services. Fees charged to customers for customized applications or set-up are recognized as revenue at the time the application or set-up is completed. Charges to customers by the Smart Encoding and UGC divisions are generally based on the activity or volumes of such media, expressed in megabytes or similar terms, and are recognized at the time the service is performed. This division also provides hosting, storage and streaming services for digital media, which are provided via the DMSP.\nWe include the DMSP and UGC divisions' revenues, along with the Smart Encoding division's revenues from hosting, storage and streaming, in the DMSP and Hosting revenue caption. We include the EDNet division's revenues from equipment sales and rentals and the Smart Encoding division's revenues from encoding and editorial services in the Other Revenue caption.\nWe add to our customer billings for certain services an amount to recover USF contributions which we have determined that we will be obligated to pay to the FCC, related to those particular services. This additional billing to our customers is not reflected as revenue by us, but rather is recorded as a liability on our books, which liability is relieved upon our remittance of USF contributions as they are billed to us by USAC, an administrative and collection agency of the FCC.\nResults of Operations\nOur consolidated net loss for the year ended September 30, 2015 was approximately $8.4 million, as compared to a net loss of approximately $1.7 million for the prior fiscal year, an increase in our net loss of approximately $6.7 million, or 404.4%. The increased net loss was due to (i) an approximately $5.6 million impairment loss on goodwill and other intangible assets recorded by us for the year ended September 30, 2015, for which there was no comparable transaction in fiscal 2014, (ii) an approximately $800,000 impairment loss on property and equipment recorded by us for the year ended September 30, 2015, for which there was no comparable transaction in fiscal 2014 and (iii) an approximately $744,000 gain from litigation settlement recorded by us for the year ended September 30, 2014, for which there was no comparable transaction in fiscal 2015 and (iv) an approximately $523,000, or 4.3%, decrease in gross margin for the year ended September 30, 2015, as compared to the prior fiscal year. These items are discussed in more detail below.\nThe impact of the above items for the year ended September 30, 2015 was partially offset by (i) an approximately $440,000, or 21.0%, decrease in interest expense, (ii) an approximately $270,000, or 28.2%, decrease in depreciation and amortization expense and (iii) an approximately $219,000, or 1.9%, decrease in general and administrative expenses (operating expenses other than the impairment loss on goodwill and other intangible assets, the impairment loss on property and equipment and depreciation and amortization expense), all as compared to the prior fiscal year and discussed in more detail below.\nOur consolidated net loss for the year ended September 30, 2015 included approximately $233,000 net income attributable to noncontrolling owner's interest in the VIE Partners, versus no corresponding amount for the year ended September 30, 2014. Accordingly, the net loss attributable to the Onstream Media shareholders for the year ended September 30, 2015 was approximately $8.6 million, as compared to a net loss attributable to the Onstream Media shareholders of approximately $1.7 million for the prior fiscal year.\nYear ended September 30, 2015 compared to the year ended September 30, 2014 - The following table shows, for the periods indicated, the percentage of total consolidated revenue represented by items on our consolidated statements of operations.\n\nThe following table is presented to illustrate our discussion and analysis of our results of operations. This table should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto.\n\nRevenues and Gross Margin\nConsolidated operating revenue was approximately $16.1 million for the year ended September 30, 2015, a decrease of approximately $790,000 (4.7%) from the prior fiscal year, primarily due to decreased revenues of the Audio and Web Conferencing Services Group, but also due to decreased revenues of the Digital Media Services Group.\nAudio and Web Conferencing Services Group revenues were approximately $10.8 million for the year ended September 30, 2015, a decrease of approximately $620,000 (5.4%) from the prior fiscal year, which included decreases in audio and web conferencing revenues as well as a decrease in the network usage revenues from the EDNet division.\nCombined revenues from audio and web conferencing (the Infinite and OCC divisions combined) were approximately $9.1 million for the year ended September 30, 2015, which represented a decrease of approximately $371,000 (3.9%) as compared to the prior fiscal year, with results for each of the two divisions reflecting similar declines (in absolute dollars).\nThe OCC division's revenues were approximately $804,000 for the year ended September 30, 2015, which represented a decrease of approximately $201,000 (20.0%) as compared to the prior fiscal year. This was in turn primarily due to lower total free conferencing business (\u201cTFCB\u201d) revenue, which was approximately $153,000 for fiscal 2014, with no corresponding amount for the year ended September 30, 2015. We purchased the TFCB business as part of our November 30, 2012 acquisition of certain assets and operations of Intella2 Inc., a San Diego-based communications company Intella2. However, under the terms of the July 29, 2014 settlement of litigation with Intella2 and its owner Paul Cohen, we transferred all TFCB customers and all associated revenues and expenses to Mr. Cohen, effective July 1, 2014.\nThe Infinite division's revenues of approximately $8.3 million for the year ended September 30, 2015 represented a decrease of approximately $170,000 (3.1%) as compared to the prior fiscal year. This was primarily due to a decrease in average revenue per minute, which was approximately 5.5 cents for the year ended September 30, 2015, as compared to approximately 6.0 cents for the prior fiscal year. This decrease in average revenue per minute was partially offset by a 7.6% increase in the number of minutes billed by the Infinite division, which was approximately 159 million for the year ended September 30, 2015, as compared to approximately 148 million minutes for the prior fiscal year. The average revenue per minute statistic includes auxiliary services and fees that are not billed to the customer on a per minute basis. The average revenue per minute statistic is also calculated including revenue billed by Infinite to its customers but purchased by Infinite from another Onstream division and thus included in that other division's (and not Infinite's) reported revenues. Although the decrease in average revenue per minute reflects our reactions to competitive pressures on the pricing side, we have been able to reduce our costs for the same reason.\nThe EDNet division's network usage revenues were approximately $1.6 million for the year ended September 30, 2015, which represented a decrease of approximately $208,000 (11.2%) as compared to the prior fiscal year. This was in turn primarily due to lower usage of EDNet's bridging services, with a corresponding decrease of approximately $131,000 in those billings for the year ended September 30, 2015 as compared to the prior fiscal year.\nDigital Media Services Group revenues were approximately $5.4 million for the year ended September 30, 2015, a decrease of approximately $170,000 (3.1%) from the prior fiscal year, primarily due to a decrease in DMSP and hosting revenues.\nDMSP and hosting revenues were approximately $773,000 for the year ended September 30, 2015, which represented a decrease of approximately $152,000 (16.4%) as compared to the prior fiscal year. This decrease reflects competitive pressures resulting in the continuing decline in the number of customers using these products and services.\nWebcasting division revenues increased by approximately $55,000 (1.2%) for the year ended September 30, 2015 as compared to the prior fiscal year. We produced approximately 4,100 webcasts during the year ended September 30, 2015, which was approximately 200 greater than the number of webcasts produced in the prior fiscal year. The impact on revenue arising from the increased number of events was partially offset by a decrease in the average revenue per webcast event to $1,154 for the year ended September 30, 2015, which represented a decrease of $68, or 5.6%, as compared to the prior fiscal year. The average revenue per webcast includes revenue billed by the webcasting division to its customers but purchased by the webcasting division from another Onstream division and thus included in that other division's (and not webcasting's) reported revenues.\nWe expect to shortly introduce and begin marketing a \u201cdo it yourself\u201d large audience webcasting product that can be run from the customer's desktop and will be available on a fixed cost monthly subscription basis that can be purchased on-line. We have recently introduced the following audio and web conferencing products: (i) Onstream Meetings and (ii) Onstream Webinars, both of which feature fully integrated audio conferencing, allowing customers to interact from land based, mobile or desktop headsets (VOIP) as well as high definition Dolby audio.\nConsolidated gross margin was approximately $11.7 million for the year ended September 30, 2015, a decrease of approximately $523,000 (4.3%) from the prior fiscal year. This decrease generally corresponds to the approximately $790,000 (4.7%) decrease in revenues for the corresponding period, as discussed above. However, our consolidated gross margin percentage increased to 72.4% for the year ended September 30, 2015, versus 72.1% for the prior fiscal year. This increased percentage was primarily due to the percentage decrease in cost of sales for audio and web conferencing (the Infinite and OCC divisions combined) being larger than the percentage decrease in audio and web conferencing revenues.\nOperating Expenses\nConsolidated operating expenses were approximately $18.3 million for the year ended September 30, 2015, an increase of approximately $5.9 million (47.7%) from the prior fiscal year, due to (i) an approximately $5.6 million impairment loss on goodwill and other intangible assets recorded by us for the year ended September 30, 2015, for which there was no comparable transaction in fiscal 2014, (ii) an approximately $800,000 impairment loss on property and equipment recorded by us for the year ended September 30, 2015, for which there was no comparable transaction in fiscal 2014 and (iii) an approximately $317,000, or 13.8%, increase in other general and administrative expenses as compared to the prior fiscal year, such increases partially offset by (i) an approximately $366,000, or 63.6%, decrease in compensation paid with common shares and other equity, (ii) an approximately $270,000, or 28.2%, decrease in depreciation and amortization expense and (iii) an approximately $257,000, or 19.1%, decrease in professional fees, all decreases as compared to the prior fiscal year.\nSee \u201cGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets\u201d, which is part of the Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates section below, for details with respect to the approximately $5.6 million impairment loss on goodwill and other intangible assets and the $800,000 impairment loss on property and equipment, both as recorded by us for the year ended September 30, 2015.\nThe approximately $317,000 increase in other general and administrative expenses was primarily due to an increase in advertising and marketing costs, which are charged to operations as incurred and classified in our financial statements primarily under other general and administrative expenses but also under professional fees. These expenses were approximately $980,000 and $640,000 for the years ended September 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively, representing an increase of $340,000, or 53.1%. These amounts include third party marketing consultant fees and third party sales commissions, but do not include commissions or other compensation to our employee sales staff.\nThe approximately $366,000 decrease in compensation paid with common shares and other equity was primarily due to an approximately $272,000 decrease in the expense recorded for the year ended September 30, 2015, as compared to the prior fiscal year, with respect to our obligation to reimburse the Executives, upon their resale of 1,700,000 ONSM common shares that we agreed in January 2013 to issue to them in lieu of certain compensation, for any shortfall versus $0.29 per share. The closing ONSM price of $0.27 per share as of September 30, 2013 resulted in an approximately $34,000 liability on our financial statements. Based on the closing ONSM price of $0.16 per share as of September 30, 2014, we increased the liability to approximately $221,000, which resulted in an approximately $187,000 increase in non-cash compensation expense for the year ended September 30, 2014. Based on the closing ONSM price of $0.21 per share as of September 30, 2015, we decreased the liability to approximately $136,000, which resulted in an approximately $85,000 reduction of non-cash compensation expense for the year ended September 30, 2015. The difference between the $85,000 expense reduction for the year ended September 30, 2015 and the $187,000 expense increase for the year ended September 30, 2014 accounts for a $272,000 total decrease in the expense between the two years.\nThis approximately $257,000 decrease in professional fees was primarily due to (i) an approximately $238,000 decrease in legal and consulting fees and (ii) an approximately $58,000 decrease in accounting fees, such decreases partially offset by an approximately $85,000 aggregate increase in financial consultant fees and due diligence expenses incurred in connection with negotiations for potential financing.\nLegal and consulting fees were approximately $214,000 for the year ended September 30, 2015, as compared to approximately $452,000 for the prior fiscal year, representing a decrease of approximately $238,000, or 52.8%. Legal and consulting fees incurred during the year ended September 30, 2015 were primarily related to (i) legal fees and (ii) marketing consultant expenses. Legal, consulting and other professional fees incurred during the year ended September 30, 2014 were primarily related to (i) corporate development and investor relations consulting activities, which activities were substantially curtailed during the year ended September 30, 2015 and (ii) litigation with Intella2 and its owner Paul Cohen, which was settled on July 29, 2014.\nAccounting fees were approximately $182,000 for the year ended September 30, 2015, as compared to approximately $240,000 for the prior fiscal year, representing a decrease of approximately $58,000, or 24.2%. Forms 10-Q for the first, second and third quarters of fiscal 2014 were filed on April 30, June 5 and August 19, 2014, respectively, and the related accounting fees were expensed during the year ended September 30, 2014. Fees for the review of our quarterly financial statements included in our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q for the second and third quarters of fiscal 2015 were incurred, invoiced and paid subsequent to September 30, 2015 (i.e., in fiscal 2016).\nOther Expense\nOther expense, which is primarily interest, of approximately $1.8 million for the year ended September 30, 2015 represented an approximately $273,000 (18.5%) increase as compared to the prior fiscal year. This increase was due to an approximately $744,000 gain from litigation settlement recorded by us for the year ended September 30, 2014, for which there was no comparable transaction in fiscal 2015, partially offset by an approximately $440,000, or 21.0%, decrease in interest expense for the year ended September 30, 2015 as compared to the prior fiscal year.\nOn November 26, 2013, Intella2 and its owner Paul Cohen filed a civil lawsuit in Florida naming Onstream Media Corporation, Onstream Conferencing Corporation and Infinite Conferencing as defendants. The action alleged breach of contract with respect to payment of certain components of the purchase price for the Intella2 acquisition and related commissions and sought money damages as well as declaratory relief declaring Mr. Cohen's related non-compete agreement with us unenforceable. On December 31, 2013 we filed our response to this lawsuit, which contained various objections to the lawsuit allegations as well as a number of counterclaims. On July 29, 2014, the parties entered into a settlement agreement and on August 4, 2014, the lawsuit was dismissed with prejudice by the court. Based on the conditions of that settlement, we reduced the approximately $782,000 estimated liability for the unpaid portion of the purchase price to the $38,000 we ultimately paid under the settlement (in cash and equipment), which resulted in our recognition of other income of approximately $744,000 for the year ended September 30, 2014.\nThe approximately $440,000 decrease in interest expense was primarily due to (i) an approximately $183,000 aggregate net decrease in interest expense recognized for certain subordinated debt (the Working Capital Notes, the Intella2 Investor Notes, the Fuse Note and the Subordinated Notes) for fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014, (ii) an approximately $111,000 aggregate net decrease in interest expense recognized for certain senior debt (the New Sigma Note, the Rockridge Note, the Line and the USAC Notes) for fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 (iii) an approximately $84,000 aggregate net decrease in the expense paid and/or accrued by us for fiscal 2015 related to our obligation to reimburse the shortfall upon the resale of certain of our common shares as well as the accretion of interest on obligations to repurchase certain of our common shares, as compared to the aggregate net amount of such accruals for fiscal 2014 and (iv) $52,000 of interest accretion recorded by us in connection with the Intella2 purchase price during fiscal 2014, for which there was no corresponding item in fiscal 2015, since we no longer accrued accretion after the July 29, 2014 Intella2 litigation settlement, as discussed above.\nAs discussed above under \u201cRecent Developments\u201d, on March 5 and 6, 2015, we received aggregate gross cash proceeds of $1.0 million for our sale, effective February 28, 2015, of a defined subset of Infinite's audio conferencing customers (and the related future business to those customers) to Partners. The proceeds from this sale were used by us to pay (i) approximately $311,000 of outstanding principal and approximately $136,000 of accrued interest on certain notes payable and (ii) approximately $69,000 for the cash portion of legal and consulting fees related to this transaction. The remaining proceeds were used for fee obligations under the New Sigma Note and for other operating expenses. As a result of certain of the items we repaid using the proceeds from Partners, our interest expense decreased. As a result of our treatment of Partners as a VIE requiring consolidation in our financial statements, the $1.0 million gross proceeds from this transaction was reflected by us as an increase in our equity and the approximately $233,000 paid and/or accrued for the Partners' guaranteed return related to those invested proceeds for the year ended September 30, 2015, was reflected as a distribution out of our equity, and not as interest expense.\nNet Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Owners' Interest in VIE\nOur consolidated net loss for the year ended September 30, 2015 included approximately $233,000 net income attributable to noncontrolling owner's interest in the VIE Partners, versus no corresponding amount for the year ended September 30, 2014.\nOn March 5 and 6, 2015, we received aggregate gross cash proceeds of $1.0 million for our sale, effective February 28, 2015, of the Sold Accounts to Partners. Based on our determination that Partners is a Variable Interest Entity (VIE) requiring consolidation in our financial statements, the revenues from the Sold Accounts are included in our consolidated revenues. The payment of the Partners' guaranteed return percentage, which is based on the cash proceeds received for this sale, is reflected as a decrease in our equity (distributions to owners of VIE) and also represents the portion of our consolidated results that are attributable to the VIE, with the balance of our consolidated results after deducting the VIE portion being the net loss attributable to the Onstream Media shareholders for the period.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nFor the year ended September 30, 2015, we had a net loss of approximately $8.4 million, although cash provided by operating activities for that period was approximately $343,000. Cash provided by operating activities is calculated after adding back to our net loss the periodic amortization of the amount of other fees and expenses incurred in connection with obtaining or maintaining our debt, which fees and expenses are initially recorded by us as debt discount and presented by us on the balance sheet as a reduction of the outstanding principal balance. The other fees and expenses included in debt discount include amounts payable in cash and/or equity and may be payable to the lender, to third parties engaged by the lender or to third parties engaged by us.\nOur cash balance decreased by approximately $72,000 during the year ended September 30, 2015. This was the result of approximately $320,000 used in investing activities and approximately $95,000 used in financing activities, partially offset by approximately $343,000 provided by operating activities. Although we had cash of approximately $317,000 at September 30, 2015, we had a working capital deficit of approximately $5.3 million at that date. This $5.3 million deficit includes the following items classified as current on our September 30, 2015 balance sheet: (i) approximately $1.5 million of net debt repaid by us from the proceeds of the Partners transaction in December 2015 and (ii) approximately $1.7 million of debt outstanding under the Line which we recently renewed through December 31, 2017, both as discussed in more detail below.\nCash provided by operating activities of approximately $343,000 for the year ended September 30, 2015, represents an approximately $114,000 decrease in cash provided by operating activities as compared to approximately $457,000 cash provided by operating activities for the prior fiscal year. The approximately $343,000 cash provided by operating activities for the year ended September 30, 2015 reflects (i) net cash used by operating activities before changes in current assets and liabilities other than cash of approximately $96,000, which in turn represents our net loss of approximately $8.4 million, offset by approximately $8.3 million non-cash expenses included in that net loss and (ii) an approximately $440,000 net decrease in working capital other than cash. The primary non-cash expenses included in our loss for the year ended September 30, 2015 were an approximately $5.6 million impairment loss on goodwill and other intangible assets, an $800,000 impairment loss on property and equipment, approximately $715,000 of amortization of discount on notes payable and convertible debentures and approximately $686,000 of depreciation and amortization. The approximately $440,000 net decrease in working capital other than cash for the year ended September 30, 2015 is primarily due to an approximately $414,000 increase in accounts payable, accrued liabilities and amounts due to directors and officers. The $440,000 net decrease in working capital other than cash represented approximately $511,000 more cash than the net increase in working capital other than cash of approximately $71,000 for the prior fiscal year. The primary sources of cash inflows from operations are from receivables collected from sales to customers.\nCash used in investing activities was approximately $320,000 for the year ended September 30, 2015 as compared to approximately $556,000 cash used in investing activities for the prior fiscal year. Current and prior period investing activities related to the acquisition of property and equipment, including capitalized software development costs.\nCash used in financing activities was approximately $95,000 for the year ended September 30, 2015 as compared to approximately $231,000 cash provided by financing activities for the prior fiscal year. The current year period financing activities primarily related to (i) the December 31, 2014 repayment to Sigma of all accrued interest due on Sigma Notes 1 and 2 through that date, which interest had been capitalized as part of the outstanding principal balance, after which Sigma Notes 1 and 2 were cancelled and replaced with a new note payable to Sigma, (ii) the March 2015 repayment of the outstanding principal on certain notes payable from the proceeds of the March 2015 sale to Partners and (iii) the recurring distributions to the owners of Partners, effective March 1, 2015 through September 30, 2015, such uses of cash partially offset by the net proceeds we received in March 2015 from our sale, effective February 28, 2015, of a defined subset of Infinite's audio conferencing customers (and the related future business to those customers) to Partners. These transactions are all discussed in more detail below. Financing activities for the year ended September 30, 2014, excluding accounts receivable based borrowing and repayment activity under the Line, primarily related to proceeds from the Working Capital Notes and from Sigma Note 2 and the repayment of certain notes payable from the proceeds of those two financings.\nIn December 2007, we entered into a line of credit arrangement (the \u201cLine\u201d) with a financial institution (the \u201cLender\u201d). The Lender was Thermo Credit LLC through February 10, 2016 and as a result of an assignment, Thermo Communications Funding LLC, an affiliated company, subsequent to that date. Mr. Leon Nowalsky, a member of our Board, is an investor and board member in both entities.\nThe Line has been renewed and modified from time to time, and under which we may presently borrow up to an aggregate of $2.0 million for working capital, collateralized by our accounts receivable and certain other related assets and the amount of such borrowing being further subject to the amount, aging and concentration of such receivables. Although the Line expired on December 27, 2013, we continued after that date to negotiate renewal terms with the Lender and to maintain an outstanding borrowing balance under the Line and on February 10, 2016 (the \u201cEffective Date\u201d), we entered into a Loan Modification Agreement (\u201cModification\u201d) which extended the term of the Line through December 31, 2017 (the \u201cMaturity Date\u201d). Notwithstanding this renewal for a period ending more than one year after our September 30, 2015 balance sheet, since the outstanding balance at that date could, in the absence of continuing revenues generating eligible receivables with a sufficient dollar value, be fully repayable within one year, it is classified as a current liability on that balance sheet, as well as our September 30, 2014 balance sheet.\nThe Modification also provides that, if no Default or Event of Default, as defined in the Modification, shall have occurred and be continuing as of the Maturity Date, and upon our notice and request to Lender sent per the timing and other requirements in the Modification, Lender shall (in good faith) engage in, and conclude as quickly as commercially reasonable, negotiations with us to extend the Maturity Date by up to an additional twelve months (i.e., through December 31, 2018). The Modification also changed a number of the other terms of the Line, as discussed below.\nPrior to the Effective Date, the outstanding balance (approximately $1.7 million as of September 30, 2015 and approximately $1.6 million as of October 24, 2016) bears interest at 12.0% per annum, adjustable based on changes in prime after December 28, 2009, payable monthly in arrears. The Modification provides that as of the Effective Date the interest rate will be the prime rate plus seven and one-half percent (7.5%) per annum, but no less than eleven percent (11.0%) per annum or any higher rate that might be allowed by the terms of the Line, including the Modification, arising from certain events such as default. Accordingly, as of the Effective Date, the outstanding balance bears interest at 11.0% per annum.\nUnder the terms of the Line, we also incur a monitoring fee and a commitment fee, which fees were unchanged by the Modification. The monitoring fee is one twentieth of a percent (0.05%) of the borrowing limit per week, payable monthly in arrears, and the commitment fee is one percent (1%) per year of the maximum allowable borrowing amount, payable annually in advance.\nThe terms of the Line prior to the Effective Date required that all funds remitted by our customers in payment of receivables be deposited directly to a bank account owned by the Lender (the \u201cLockbox Account\u201d), although this was never implemented. This requirement continues after the Effective Date, including the provision that such funds received in the Lockbox Account shall be immediately applied to any balance outstanding under the Line, or returned to us one day following clearance by the receiving bank, to the extent there is no balance outstanding under the Line. The Modification provides that we shall be responsible for the additional expenses related to the Lender-owned bank account, which we expect to be in the range of $12,000 to $18,000 per year.\nThe Modification provides that our failure to comply with these provisions shall be an immediate Event of Default, and although as of July 8, 2016 (the extended deadline granted by the Lender on June 8, 2016) these provisions had not been fully implemented, we were in substantial compliance with such provisions since August 1, 2016 and through October 28, 2016 and we have not received any notification from the Lender as to any Event of Default under these provisions, as of October 28, 2016. In a letter dated October 26, 2016, the Lender agreed that there was no default by us with respect to such lockbox provisions up to and including October 31, 2016, although this does not constitute authorization for any non-compliance with these provisions after October 31, 2016.\nThe Line is subject to us maintaining an adequate level of receivables, based on certain formulas. However, due to the lack of a formal renewal of the Line, in June 2014 the Lender determined that there would be no further advances under the Line, although no further repayments have been required either, and as a result the outstanding principal balance of the Line did not change from that time through June 24, 2016, regardless of weekly changes in the calculated borrowing availability based on the applicable formulas applied to our receivable levels. Effective June 24, 2016, the first deposit was made to the Lockbox Account and applied against the balance outstanding under the Line.\nThe Modification allows our receivable from any single party, including Partners, to be considered an Eligible Receivable to the extent that (i) the aggregate of all accounts receivable from such party and its affiliates does not exceed thirty percent (30%) of all Eligible Receivables (all Eligible Receivables for this purpose including the portion of the our accounts receivable from such party that is ultimately considered to be an Eligible Receivable) then owed by all of our account debtors and (ii) it meets all of the other requirements for eligibility as set forth in the Line.\nAs of the Effective Date, although the outstanding balance under the Line exceeded the maximum allowable borrowing amount under the Line (the \u201cBorrowing Base\u201d), the Modification provided that notwithstanding any other provisions of the Line or the Modification, such condition would not be considered a Default or an Event of Default, and Lender would agree to make advances to us thereunder based on the Borrowing Base plus an overadvance amount determined by a schedule which started at $300,000 through February 27, 2016 but declined to zero as of July 31, 2016 and thereafter. As of October 24, 2016, the outstanding balance under the Line was approximately $1,576,000, which exceeded the Borrowing Base by approximately $248,000. Although there is no formal obligation to do so, as of October 24, 2016 the Lender is allowing such overadvance condition to continue, under their expectation that we are seeking alternative funding to replace that overadvance. In a letter dated October 26, 2016, the Lender agreed that there was no default by us with respect to such overadvances up to and including October 31, 2016, although this does not constitute authorization for any non-compliance with these provisions after October 31, 2016.\nThe Line is also subject to our compliance with a quarterly debt service coverage covenant (the \u201cCovenant\u201d). Prior to the Modification, the Covenant requires that the sum of (i) our net income or loss, adjusted to remove all non-cash expenses as well as cash interest expense and (ii) contributions to capital (less cash distributions and/or cash dividends paid during such period) and proceeds from subordinated unsecured debt, be equal to or greater than the sum of cash payments for interest and debt principal payments. The Lender waived the requirement to comply with the Covenant for the quarter ended September 30, 2015. We have complied with the Covenant for all other applicable quarters through June 30, 2016.\nThe Modification provides that effective January 1, 2016 and thereafter, the Covenant will require that our net income or loss, adjusted to (i) add back all non-cash expenses as well as cash interest expense and (ii) subtract cash distributions and/or cash dividends paid during such period, be equal to or greater than 1.2 times the sum of cash payments for interest and debt principal payments. The Modification also provides that we will not declare or pay any dividends or distributions on any equity interest, if before or after such event an Event of Default or Default, as defined in the Modification, would exist. Both before and after the Modification, the terms of the Line allow us to achieve compliance with the Covenant by (i) including any excess of adjusted net income over the amount of adjusted net income required to comply with the Covenant in the preceding two quarters or (ii) adding to adjusted net income the proceeds from subordinated debt or equity sales meeting defined conditions, and received within certain time frames extending prior to, and in some cases subsequent to, the relevant date of determination, all set forth in the Line and the Modification. The Modification also explicitly allows, subject to Lender's prior consent, proceeds from our sales of revenues/customer accounts to a separate legal entity and received within a time frames extending six months prior to, and one month subsequent to, the relevant date of determination, to be added to adjusted net income for purposes of the Covenant. In a letter dated October 26, 2016, the Lender consented to the inclusion of proceeds from our December 2015 and June 2016 sales of revenue/customer accounts to Partners, as well as the proceeds from such sale in process that we expect to be effective during November 2016, and extended the carryback period for those proceeds from one month to three months.\nAlthough we do not have final financial results for periods after June 30, 2016, our estimated calculations for the quarter ended September 30, 2016, including our expectations of additional financing proceeds after that date that would be allowable for inclusion in those calculations, indicate that we are in compliance with the Covenant.\nThe outstanding principal is due on demand in the event a payment default is uncured one (1) day after written notice. The Modification provides that, without limiting any other rights and remedies provided by the terms of the Line or otherwise available to the Lender, the Lender may exercise one or more of certain rights and remedies, as listed in the Amendment, during the existence of any uncured Default (upon not less than five days prior written notice by Lender) or Event of Default which has not been waived in writing by Lender. Lender's rights to exercise such rights and remedies will end if and when all of Debtors' obligations to Lender in connection with the Line have been satisfied. The rights and remedies listed in the Modification include, but are not limited to: (i) verify the validity and amount of, or any other matter relating to, the accounts by mail, telephone, telegraph or otherwise, (ii) notify all account debtors that the accounts have been assigned to Lender and that Lender has a security interest in the accounts, (iii) direct all account debtors to make payment of all accounts directly to Lender or the Lockbox Account (iv) in any case and for any reason, notify the United States Postal Service to change the addresses for delivery of mail addressed to us to such address as Lender may designate, as well as receive, open and dispose of all such mail, provided that Lender shall promptly forward to us any such items not related to the accounts, (v) exercise all of our rights and remedies with respect to the collection of accounts, (vi) settle, adjust, compromise, extend, renew, discharge or release accounts, for amounts and upon terms which Lender considers advisable and (vii) sell or assign accounts on such terms, for such amounts and at such times as Lender deems advisable.\nAs of September 30, 2015, in addition to the Line as discussed above, we were also obligated for the following term debt, discussed in more detail below:\n\nApproximately $1.5 million, in aggregate, of the above debt was repaid by us from the proceeds of the Partners transaction in December 2015, as discussed in more detail below.\nAs of September 30, 2015 we were obligated to Sigma Opportunity Fund II, LLC (\u201cSigma\u201d) under a secured note for $1,583,000, with interest payable monthly at 21% per annum and the principal due on April 15, 2016 (the \u201cNew Sigma Note\u201d).\nOn December 17, 2015, we made a $1.0 million payment to Sigma against the outstanding principal balance of the New Sigma Note, reducing the remaining outstanding principal balance on the Note to $583,000. On December 22, 2015, we entered into certain agreements with Sigma and Sigma Capital, which included an amendment to the New Sigma Note. As a result of these agreements, the outstanding balance of the New Sigma Note was increased to $600,000, to reflect a one-time administrative fee of $17,000, and we also reimbursed $3,500 of Sigma's legal expenses related to the transactions. In addition, the maturity date of the remaining balance due under the New Sigma Note was extended from April 15, 2016 to December 31, 2016.\nAs part of the December 22, 2015 agreements, the interest rate on the New Sigma Note was reduced from 21% to 17% per annum, the monthly advisory fee payable to Sigma Capital was reduced from $12,500 to $10,000 and the following obligations to Sigma Capital were eliminated - (i) future monthly damages payable for late SEC filings which were initiated as part of an April 30, 2015 agreement with Sigma and Sigma Capital and (ii) the third and final installment of the fee incurred by us as a result of a previous extension of the maturity date of the New Sigma Note to April 15, 2016, and which would have been $50,000 payable on December 15, 2015. We have agreed, regardless of the early repayment of the New Sigma Note, to pay a minimum aggregate amount of $100,000 of monthly advisory fee payments to Sigma Capital as scheduled, starting with the January 15, 2016 payment of $10,000.\nIn connection with an Advisory Services Agreement dated December 31, 2014, entered into by us with Sigma Capital in connection with the issuance of the New Sigma Note, we agreed to (i) pay Sigma Capital an initial advisory fee of $100,000, (ii) issue 70,000 restricted common shares to Sigma and 30,000 restricted common shares to Sigma Capital, such shares having an aggregate fair value of approximately $20,000, (iii) pay Sigma approximately $20,000 as reimbursement of legal expenses and (iv) make additional advisory fee payments to Sigma Capital totaling $160,000 in monthly installments through June 30, 2015. The value of the common shares issued plus the fees and expenses we agreed to pay in connection with the December 31, 2014 Sigma agreement (there was no remaining unamortized discount from previous Sigma transactions as of that date) were amortized as interest based on the initial six month the term of the New Sigma Note, resulting in an effective interest rate of approximately 65% per annum for the period from January 1, 2015 through April 30, 2015.\nAs part of the April 30, 2015 agreement with Sigma we (i) paid Sigma Capital a $25,000 transaction fee, (ii) paid Sigma $14,000 as reimbursement of legal expenses and (iii) agreed to make additional advisory fee payments to Sigma Capital aggregating $40,000 in monthly installments from July 15, 2015 through October 15, 2015. The April 30, 2015 agreement also required us to pay liquidated damages for late SEC filings and in accordance with that requirement we paid Sigma Capital an aggregate of $42,500 for such damages from April 30, 2015 through September 30, 2015 and another $25,000 for such damages after that date through November 27, 2015, the last payment date before the agreement to pay such damages was cancelled. When the amortization of the fees and expenses we agreed to pay in connection with the April 30, 2015 Sigma agreement, including the anticipated liquidated damages for late SEC filings, such items aggregating $121,500, were combined with the amortization of the remaining unamortized discount arising from the December 31, 2014 financing, the resulting effective interest rate of the New Sigma Note was approximately 57% per annum for the period from May 1, 2015 through September 30, 2015. Although this effective rate would be impacted by the September 21, 2015 transaction discussed below, we will not reflect that impact until October 1, 2015 and have determined that the impact of this delayed implementation is immaterial. This effective interest rate does not include the impact if an early repayment was required, as discussed above.\nAs part of the September 21, 2015 agreement with Sigma we (i) paid Sigma Capital a $25,000 fee (added to the loan principal balance), (ii) paid Sigma $7,500 as reimbursement of legal expenses, (iii) agreed to make an additional advisory fee payment to Sigma Capital of $2,500 on October 15, 2015, and (iv) agreed, in consideration of the loan maturity date extension from October 15, 2015 to April 15, 2016, to pay fees to Sigma Capital aggregating $175,000 in three monthly installments from October 15, 2015 through December 15, 2015 (of which we paid $125,000, with the remaining $50,000 obligation cancelled as part of the December 22, 2015 agreement with Sigma as discussed above) and to make additional advisory fee payments to Sigma Capital aggregating $75,000 in monthly installments from November 15, 2015 through April 15, 2016 (of which we paid $25,000, with the remaining $50,000 obligation cancelled and replaced with a new advisory fee obligation as part of the December 22, 2015 agreement with Sigma as discussed above).\nUpon our receipt of funds as a result of (i) the sale of any portion of our business, however structured, including, without limitation, sale of assets, subsidiaries, revenues or business units, and/or (ii) the issuance of additional equity, debt or convertible debt capital, and/or (iii) our consolidation or merger with or into another entity, all outstanding principal and interest with respect to the New Sigma Note", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion should be read together with the information contained in the Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes included in the annual report.\nOverview\nWe are a leading online service provider of live and on-demand corporate audio and web communications, virtual event technology and social media marketing, provided primarily to corporate (including large as well as small to medium sized businesses), education and government customers. We had approximately 75 full time employees as of October 7, 2016, with operations organized in two main operating groups:\n\u00b7 Audio and Web Conferencing Services Group\n\u00b7 Digital Media Services Group\nOur Audio and Web Conferencing Services Group consists of our Infinite Conferencing (\u201cInfinite\u201d) division, our Onstream Conferencing Corporation (\u201cOCC\u201d) division and our EDNet division. Our Infinite division, which operates primarily from the New York City area, and our OCC division, which operates primarily from San Diego, California, provide \u201creservationless\u201d and operator-assisted audio and web conferencing services. Our EDNet division, which operates primarily from San Francisco, California, provides connectivity (in the form of high quality audio and multimedia data communications) within the entertainment and advertising industries through its managed network, which encompasses production and post-production companies, advertisers, producers, directors, and talent.\nOur Digital Media Services Group consists primarily of our Webcasting division and our DMSP (\u201cDigital Media Services Platform\u201d) division. The DMSP division includes the related UGC (\u201cUser Generated Content\u201d) and Smart Encoding divisions. Our Webcasting division, which operates primarily from Pompano Beach, Florida and has a sales and support facility in New York City, provides an array of corporate-oriented, web-based media services to the corporate market including live audio and video webcasting and on-demand audio and video streaming for any business, government or educational entity. Our DMSP division, which operates primarily from Colorado Springs, Colorado, provides an online, subscription based service that includes access to enabling technologies and features for our clients to acquire, store, index, secure, manage, distribute and transform these digital assets into saleable commodities. Our UGC division, which also operates as Auction Video and operates primarily from Colorado Springs, Colorado, provides a video ingestion and flash encoder that can be used by our clients on a stand-alone basis or in conjunction with the DMSP. Our Smart Encoding division, which operates primarily from San Francisco, California, provides both automated and manual encoding and editorial services for processing digital media. This division also provides hosting, storage and streaming services for digital media, which are provided via the DMSP.\nFor segment information related to the revenue and operating income of these groups, see Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nRecent Developments\nAs of September 30, 2014 we were obligated to Sigma Opportunity Fund II, LLC (\u201cSigma\u201d) for principal and accrued interest aggregating $1,539,340. After our December 31, 2014 payment to Sigma of all accrued interest through that date, but no principal payments, we were obligated to Sigma under a secured note for $1,358,000, with future interest payable monthly at 21% per annum and the principal due on October 15, 2015 (the \u201cNew Sigma Note\u201d). On September 21, 2015, Sigma loaned us an additional $225,000, which resulted in $192,500 cash proceeds net of certain fees and expenses charged by Sigma. The net proceeds were used to pay approximately $173,000 of outstanding principal on one of the Working Capital Notes plus approximately $20,000 of accrued interest on that note. Accordingly, the outstanding balance of the New Sigma Note increased to $1,583,000 and the maturity date was extended to April 15, 2016, which extension resulted in our obligation to pay Sigma up to $250,000 in additional fees (plus monthly interest and penalties for late SEC filings, as applicable). During December 2015 we repaid $1.0 million of the outstanding balance due on the New Sigma Note and entered into additional agreements with Sigma whereby the maturity date on the remaining balance was extended from April 15, 2016 to December 31, 2016 and the interest rate, as well as certain other fees, was reduced. In the event of our default on the New Sigma Note, on or before the maturity date, the outstanding balance, including accrued interest, is convertible into our common shares at a price of $0.30 per common share.\nOn March 5 and 6, 2015, we received aggregate gross cash proceeds of $1.0 million for our sale, effective February 28, 2015, of a defined subset of Infinite Conferencing's (\u201cInfinite\u201d) audio conferencing customers (and the related future business to those customers) (\u201cSold Accounts\u201d) to Infinite Conferencing Partners LLC, a Florida limited liability company (\u201cPartners\u201d), which represent historical annual revenues of approximately $1.35 million. The proceeds from this sale were used by us to pay (i) approximately $311,000 of outstanding principal and approximately $136,000 of accrued interest on certain notes payable and (ii) approximately $69,000 for the cash portion of legal and consulting fees related to this transaction. The remaining proceeds were used for fee obligations under the New Sigma Note and for other operating expenses. After giving effect to our determination that Partners is a Variable Interest Entity (VIE) requiring consolidation in our financial statements, (i) the gross proceeds from this and subsequent transactions are reflected as an increase in our equity (noncontrolling owners' interest in VIE), (ii) the revenues from the Sold Accounts, and accounts sold as part of our subsequent transactions with Partners, are included in our consolidated revenues and (iii) the payment of the Partners' guaranteed return percentage, which is deducted from these gross revenues, is reflected as a decrease in our equity (distributions to owners of VIE).\nDuring December 2015, we received gross proceeds of approximately $2.1 million for our sale, effective December 16, 2015, of a defined subset of Infinite's audio conferencing customers (and the related future business to those customers) (\u201cFirst Tranche of Additional Sold Accounts\u201d) to Partners, which represented historical annual revenues of approximately $2.7 million which transaction resulted in an increase, as a percentage of revenues, of the management fee received by us with respect to the accounts sold by us in a similar transaction in February 2015 and which improved management fee also applied to the accounts sold in December 2015. From the December 2015 proceeds, we repaid an aggregate of $481,000 against the net outstanding balances of certain subordinated notes, in addition to the $1.0 million repayment against the New Sigma Note discussed above. During March through June 2016, we received gross proceeds of approximately $0.8 million for our sale, effective June 30, 2016, of a defined subset of Infinite's audio conferencing customers (and the related future business to those customers) (\u201cSecond Tranche of Additional Sold Accounts\u201d) to Partners, which represented historical annual revenues of approximately $1.0 million, and were sold under the same terms as the accounts sold in December 2015. During September and October 2016, subscriptions for approximately $225,000 were received by Partners and funded against an anticipated total of $1.5 million for our sale, which we expect will be effective during November 2016, of a defined subset of Infinite's audio conferencing customers (and the related future business to those customers) (\u201cThird Tranche of Additional Sold Accounts\u201d) to Partners, will represent historical annual revenues of approximately $1.9 million, and will be sold under the same terms as the accounts sold in December 2015 and June 2016.\nSince December 2007, we have had a line of credit arrangement with a financial institution under which we could borrow up to an aggregate of $2.0 million for working capital, collateralized by our accounts receivable and certain other related assets and the amount of such borrowing being further subject to the amount, aging and concentration of such receivables. On February 10, 2016, we entered into a loan modification agreement which extended the term of this line of credit arrangement through December 31, 2017.\nSee Liquidity and Capital Resources for further details with respect to the above transactions with Sigma, Thermo and Partners.\nOn April 30, 2015, we received a funding commitment letter (the \u201cFunding Letter\u201d) from J&C Resources, Inc. (\u201cJ&C\u201d), agreeing to provide us, within twenty (20) days after our notice on or before January 5, 2016, aggregate cash funding of up to $800,000. Such notice was not given by us, but on April 30, 2016, we exercised our option for a one year extension of the Funding Letter, including an extension of the notice deadline to January 5, 2017. The Funding Letter was obtained solely to demonstrate our ability to obtain short-term funds in the event other funding sources are not available, but does not represent any obligation to accept such funding on these terms and is not expected by us to be exercised. Cash provided under the Funding Letter, as extended, would be in exchange for our issuance of (a) a note or notes with interest payable monthly at 15% per annum and principal payable on the earlier of a date twelve months from funding or July 15, 2017 and (b) 10.0 million unregistered common shares, which shares would be prorated in the case of partial funding. The note or notes would be unsecured and subordinated to all of our other debts, except to the extent such the terms of such debts would allow pari passu status.\nOn March 27, 2007 we acquired the assets, technology and patents pending of privately owned Auction Video, Inc., a Utah corporation, and Auction Video Japan, Inc., a Tokyo-Japan corporation (collectively, \u201cAuction Video\u201d). In connection with our subsequent pursuit of approval of these patents pending (i) on October 13, 2015, the USPTO issued to us U.S. Patent Number 9,161,068 (the \u201cFirst Granted Patent\u201d) with a Patent Term Adjustment of 2,377 days, resulting in a September 26, 2030 expiration date, provided all maintenance fees are paid and (ii) on October 11, 2016, the USPTO issued to us U.S. Patent Number 9,467,728 (the \u201cSecond Granted Patent\u201d) with a Patent Term Adjustment of 1,362 days, resulting in a December 16, 2027 expiration date, provided all maintenance fees are paid. These patents address live streaming of audio and/or video from multiple devices to a storage location, such as the Internet or cloud, and the ability to access and retrieve the audio and/or video to multiple devices, whereby the content is not stored on the device. Our management believes that the First and Second Granted Patents, as well as two other related patents still pending, may have significant value, although this cannot be assured, and is presently exploring the financial potential of the First and Second Granted Patents and the patents pending.\nRevenue Recognition\nRevenues from recurring service are recognized when (i) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists between us and the customer, (ii) the goods or service has been provided to the customer, (iii) the price to the customer is fixed or determinable and (iv) collectibility of the sales price is reasonably assured.\nOur Audio and Web Conferencing Services Group recognizes revenue from audio and web conferencing as well as customer usage of digital network connections.\nThe Infinite and OCC divisions generally charge for audio conferencing and web conferencing services on a per-minute usage rate, although webconferencing services are also available for a monthly subscription fee allowing a certain level of usage. Audio conferencing and web conferencing revenue is recognized based on the timing of the customer's use of those services. The EDNet division primarily generates revenue from customer usage of digital network connections. EDNet purchases the rights to access digital network connections from national communications companies and resells such access to its customers for a fixed monthly fee plus separate per-minute usage charges. Network usage and bridging (managed transcoding and multipoint sessions) revenue is recognized based on the timing of the customer's usage of those services.\nOur Digital Media Services Group recognizes revenues from the acquisition, editing, transcoding, indexing, storage and distribution of its customers' digital media, as well as from live and on-demand internet webcasting and internet distribution of travel information.\nThe Webcasting division charges for live and on-demand webcasting at the time an event is accessible for streaming over the Internet. Charges to customers by the DMSP division are generally based on a monthly subscription fee, as well as charges for hosting, storage and professional services. Fees charged to customers for customized applications or set-up are recognized as revenue at the time the application or set-up is completed. Charges to customers by the Smart Encoding and UGC divisions are generally based on the activity or volumes of such media, expressed in megabytes or similar terms, and are recognized at the time the service is performed. This division also provides hosting, storage and streaming services for digital media, which are provided via the DMSP.\nWe include the DMSP and UGC divisions' revenues, along with the Smart Encoding division's revenues from hosting, storage and streaming, in the DMSP and Hosting revenue caption. We include the EDNet division's revenues from equipment sales and rentals and the Smart Encoding division's revenues from encoding and editorial services in the Other Revenue caption.\nWe add to our customer billings for certain services an amount to recover USF contributions which we have determined that we will be obligated to pay to the FCC, related to those particular services. This additional billing to our customers is not reflected as revenue by us, but rather is recorded as a liability on our books, which liability is relieved upon our remittance of USF contributions as they are billed to us by USAC, an administrative and collection agency of the FCC.\nResults of Operations\nOur consolidated net loss for the year ended September 30, 2015 was approximately $8.4 million, as compared to a net loss of approximately $1.7 million for the prior fiscal year, an increase in our net loss of approximately $6.7 million, or 404.4%. The increased net loss was due to (i) an approximately $5.6 million impairment loss on goodwill and other intangible assets recorded by us for the year ended September 30, 2015, for which there was no comparable transaction in fiscal 2014, (ii) an approximately $800,000 impairment loss on property and equipment recorded by us for the year ended September 30, 2015, for which there was no comparable transaction in fiscal 2014 and (iii) an approximately $744,000 gain from litigation settlement recorded by us for the year ended September 30, 2014, for which there was no comparable transaction in fiscal 2015 and (iv) an approximately $523,000, or 4.3%, decrease in gross margin for the year ended September 30, 2015, as compared to the prior fiscal year. These items are discussed in more detail below.\nThe impact of the above items for the year ended September 30, 2015 was partially offset by (i) an approximately $440,000, or 21.0%, decrease in interest expense, (ii) an approximately $270,000, or 28.2%, decrease in depreciation and amortization expense and (iii) an approximately $219,000, or 1.9%, decrease in general and administrative expenses (operating expenses other than the impairment loss on goodwill and other intangible assets, the impairment loss on property and equipment and depreciation and amortization expense), all as compared to the prior fiscal year and discussed in more detail below.\nOur consolidated net loss for the year ended September 30, 2015 included approximately $233,000 net income attributable to noncontrolling owner's interest in the VIE Partners, versus no corresponding amount for the year ended September 30, 2014. Accordingly, the net loss attributable to the Onstream Media shareholders for the year ended September 30, 2015 was approximately $8.6 million, as compared to a net loss attributable to the Onstream Media shareholders of approximately $1.7 million for the prior fiscal year.\nYear ended September 30, 2015 compared to the year ended September 30, 2014 - The following table shows, for the periods indicated, the percentage of total consolidated revenue represented by items on our consolidated statements of operations.\nTable 6: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> Years ended September 30,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> 2015\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revenue:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Audio and web conferencing\n</td> <td> 56.5%\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 56.0%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Webcasting\n</td> <td> 28.2\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 26.6\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Network usage\n</td> <td> 10.2\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 11.0\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> DMSP and hosting\n</td> <td> 4.8\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 5.5\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other\n</td> <td> 0.3\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 0.9\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total revenue\n</td> <td> 100.0%\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 100.0%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Costs of revenue:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Audio and web conferencing\n</td> <td> 14.6%\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 14.8%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Webcasting\n</td> <td> 7.3\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 7.1\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Network usage\n</td> <td> 5.0\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 4.8\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> DMSP and hosting\n</td> <td> 0.7\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 1.0\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 0.2\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total costs of revenue\n</td> <td> 27.6%\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 27.9%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gross margin\n</td> <td> 72.4%\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 72.1%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating expenses:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Compensation (excluding equity)\n</td> <td> 45.2%\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 42.6%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Compensation (paid with equity)\n</td> <td> 1.3\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 3.4\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Professional fees\n</td> <td> 6.8\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 8.0\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other general and administrative\n</td> <td> 16.2\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 13.6\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Impairment loss on goodwill and other intangible assets\n</td> <td> 34.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Impairment loss on property and equipment\n</td> <td> 5.0\n</td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td> 4.2\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 5.6\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total operating expenses\n</td> <td> 113.4%\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 73.2%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loss from operations\n</td> <td> (41.0)%\n</td> <td> </td> <td> (1.1)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other expense, net:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest expense\n</td> <td> (10.2)%\n</td> <td> </td> <td> (12.3)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Debt extinguishment loss\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> (0.8)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gain from litigation settlement\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 4.4\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other (expense) income, net\n</td> <td> (0.6)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total other expense, net\n</td> <td> (10.8)%\n</td> <td> </td> <td> (8.7)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net loss\n</td> <td> (51.8)%\n</td> <td> </td> <td> (9.8)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net income attributable to noncontrolling\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> owners' interest in Variable Interest Entity\n</td> <td> (1.4)%\n</td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Onstream Media shareholders' net loss\n</td> <td> (53.2)%\n</td> <td> </td> <td> (9.8)%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following table is presented to illustrate our discussion and analysis of our results of operations.

</tr>\n</table>\nRevenues and Gross Margin\nConsolidated operating revenue was approximately $16.1 million for the year ended September 30, 2015, a decrease of approximately $790,000 (4.7%) from the prior fiscal year, primarily due to decreased revenues of the Audio and Web Conferencing Services Group, but also due to decreased revenues of the Digital Media Services Group.\nAudio and Web Conferencing Services Group revenues were approximately $10.8 million for the year ended September 30, 2015, a decrease of approximately $620,000 (5.4%) from the prior fiscal year, which included decreases in audio and web conferencing revenues as well as a decrease in the network usage revenues from the EDNet division.\nCombined revenues from audio and web conferencing (the Infinite and OCC divisions combined) were approximately $9.1 million for the year ended September 30, 2015, which represented a decrease of approximately $371,000 (3.9%) as compared to the prior fiscal year, with results for each of the two divisions reflecting similar declines (in absolute dollars).\nThe OCC division's revenues were approximately $804,000 for the year ended September 30, 2015, which represented a decrease of approximately $201,000 (20.0%) as compared to the prior fiscal year. This was in turn primarily due to lower total free conferencing business (\u201cTFCB\u201d) revenue, which was approximately $153,000 for fiscal 2014, with no corresponding amount for the year ended September 30, 2015. We purchased the TFCB business as part of our November 30, 2012 acquisition of certain assets and operations of Intella2 Inc., a San Diego-based communications company Intella2. However, under the terms of the July 29, 2014 settlement of litigation with Intella2 and its owner Paul Cohen, we transferred all TFCB customers and all associated revenues and expenses to Mr. Cohen, effective July 1, 2014.\nThe Infinite division's revenues of approximately $8.3 million for the year ended September 30, 2015 represented a decrease of approximately $170,000 (3.1%) as compared to the prior fiscal year. This was primarily due to a decrease in average revenue per minute, which was approximately 5.5 cents for the year ended September 30, 2015, as compared to approximately 6.0 cents for the prior fiscal year. This decrease in average revenue per minute was partially offset by a 7.6% increase in the number of minutes billed by the Infinite division, which was approximately 159 million for the year ended September 30, 2015, as compared to approximately 148 million minutes for the prior fiscal year. The average revenue per minute statistic includes auxiliary services and fees that are not billed to the customer on a per minute basis. The average revenue per minute statistic is also calculated including revenue billed by Infinite to its customers but purchased by Infinite from another Onstream division and thus included in that other division's (and not Infinite's) reported revenues. Although the decrease in average revenue per minute reflects our reactions to competitive pressures on the pricing side, we have been able to reduce our costs for the same reason.\nThe EDNet division's network usage revenues were approximately $1.6 million for the year ended September 30, 2015, which represented a decrease of approximately $208,000 (11.2%) as compared to the prior fiscal year. This was in turn primarily due to lower usage of EDNet's bridging services, with a corresponding decrease of approximately $131,000 in those billings for the year ended September 30, 2015 as compared to the prior fiscal year.\nDigital Media Services Group revenues were approximately $5.4 million for the year ended September 30, 2015, a decrease of approximately $170,000 (3.1%) from the prior fiscal year, primarily due to a decrease in DMSP and hosting revenues.\nDMSP and hosting revenues were approximately $773,000 for the year ended September 30, 2015, which represented a decrease of approximately $152,000 (16.4%) as compared to the prior fiscal year. This decrease reflects competitive pressures resulting in the continuing decline in the number of customers using these products and services.\nWebcasting division revenues increased by approximately $55,000 (1.2%) for the year ended September 30, 2015 as compared to the prior fiscal year. We produced approximately 4,100 webcasts during the year ended September 30, 2015, which was approximately 200 greater than the number of webcasts produced in the prior fiscal year. The impact on revenue arising from the increased number of events was partially offset by a decrease in the average revenue per webcast event to $1,154 for the year ended September 30, 2015, which represented a decrease of $68, or 5.6%, as compared to the prior fiscal year. The average revenue per webcast includes revenue billed by the webcasting division to its customers but purchased by the webcasting division from another Onstream division and thus included in that other division's (and not webcasting's) reported revenues.\nWe expect to shortly introduce and begin marketing a \u201cdo it yourself\u201d large audience webcasting product that can be run from the customer's desktop and will be available on a fixed cost monthly subscription basis that can be purchased on-line. We have recently introduced the following audio and web conferencing products: (i) Onstream Meetings and (ii) Onstream Webinars, both of which feature fully integrated audio conferencing, allowing customers to interact from land based, mobile or desktop headsets (VOIP) as well as high definition Dolby audio.\nConsolidated gross margin was approximately $11.7 million for the year ended September 30, 2015, a decrease of approximately $523,000 (4.3%) from the prior fiscal year. This decrease generally corresponds to the approximately $790,000 (4.7%) decrease in revenues for the corresponding period, as discussed above. However, our consolidated gross margin percentage increased to 72.4% for the year ended September 30, 2015, versus 72.1% for the prior fiscal year. This increased percentage was primarily due to the percentage decrease in cost of sales for audio and web conferencing (the Infinite and OCC divisions combined) being larger than the percentage decrease in audio and web conferencing revenues.\nOperating Expenses\nConsolidated operating expenses were approximately $18.3 million for the year ended September 30, 2015, an increase of approximately $5.9 million (47.7%) from the prior fiscal year, due to (i) an approximately $5.6 million impairment loss on goodwill and other intangible assets recorded by us for the year ended September 30, 2015, for which there was no comparable transaction in fiscal 2014, (ii) an approximately $800,000 impairment loss on property and equipment recorded by us for the year ended September 30, 2015, for which there was no comparable transaction in fiscal 2014 and (iii) an approximately $317,000, or 13.8%, increase in other general and administrative expenses as compared to the prior fiscal year, such increases partially offset by (i) an approximately $366,000, or 63.6%, decrease in compensation paid with common shares and other equity, (ii) an approximately $270,000, or 28.2%, decrease in depreciation and amortization expense and (iii) an approximately $257,000, or 19.1%, decrease in professional fees, all decreases as compared to the prior fiscal year.\nSee \u201cGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets\u201d, which is part of the Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates section below, for details with respect to the approximately $5.6 million impairment loss on goodwill and other intangible assets and the $800,000 impairment loss on property and equipment, both as recorded by us for the year ended September 30, 2015.\nThe approximately $317,000 increase in other general and administrative expenses was primarily due to an increase in advertising and marketing costs, which are charged to operations as incurred and classified in our financial statements primarily under other general and administrative expenses but also under professional fees. These expenses were approximately $980,000 and $640,000 for the years ended September 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively, representing an increase of $340,000, or 53.1%. These amounts include third party marketing consultant fees and third party sales commissions, but do not include commissions or other compensation to our employee sales staff.\nThe approximately $366,000 decrease in compensation paid with common shares and other equity was primarily due to an approximately $272,000 decrease in the expense recorded for the year ended September 30, 2015, as compared to the prior fiscal year, with respect to our obligation to reimburse the Executives, upon their resale of 1,700,000 ONSM common shares that we agreed in January 2013 to issue to them in lieu of certain compensation, for any shortfall versus $0.29 per share. The closing ONSM price of $0.27 per share as of September 30, 2013 resulted in an approximately $34,000 liability on our financial statements. Based on the closing ONSM price of $0.16 per share as of September 30, 2014, we increased the liability to approximately $221,000, which resulted in an approximately $187,000 increase in non-cash compensation expense for the year ended September 30, 2014. Based on the closing ONSM price of $0.21 per share as of September 30, 2015, we decreased the liability to approximately $136,000, which resulted in an approximately $85,000 reduction of non-cash compensation expense for the year ended September 30, 2015. The difference between the $85,000 expense reduction for the year ended September 30, 2015 and the $187,000 expense increase for the year ended September 30, 2014 accounts for a $272,000 total decrease in the expense between the two years.\nThis approximately $257,000 decrease in professional fees was primarily due to (i) an approximately $238,000 decrease in legal and consulting fees and (ii) an approximately $58,000 decrease in accounting fees, such decreases partially offset by an approximately $85,000 aggregate increase in financial consultant fees and due diligence expenses incurred in connection with negotiations for potential financing.\nLegal and consulting fees were approximately $214,000 for the year ended September 30, 2015, as compared to approximately $452,000 for the prior fiscal year, representing a decrease of approximately $238,000, or 52.8%. Legal and consulting fees incurred during the year ended September 30, 2015 were primarily related to (i) legal fees and (ii) marketing consultant expenses. Legal, consulting and other professional fees incurred during the year ended September 30, 2014 were primarily related to (i) corporate development and investor relations consulting activities, which activities were substantially curtailed during the year ended September 30, 2015 and (ii) litigation with Intella2 and its owner Paul Cohen, which was settled on July 29, 2014.\nAccounting fees were approximately $182,000 for the year ended September 30, 2015, as compared to approximately $240,000 for the prior fiscal year, representing a decrease of approximately $58,000, or 24.2%. Forms 10-Q for the first, second and third quarters of fiscal 2014 were filed on April 30, June 5 and August 19, 2014, respectively, and the related accounting fees were expensed during the year ended September 30, 2014. Fees for the review of our quarterly financial statements included in our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q for the second and third quarters of fiscal 2015 were incurred, invoiced and paid subsequent to September 30, 2015 (i.e., in fiscal 2016).\nOther Expense\nOther expense, which is primarily interest, of approximately $1.8 million for the year ended September 30, 2015 represented an approximately $273,000 (18.5%) increase as compared to the prior fiscal year. This increase was due to an approximately $744,000 gain from litigation settlement recorded by us for the year ended September 30, 2014, for which there was no comparable transaction in fiscal 2015, partially offset by an approximately $440,000, or 21.0%, decrease in interest expense for the year ended September 30, 2015 as compared to the prior fiscal year.\nOn November 26, 2013, Intella2 and its owner Paul Cohen filed a civil lawsuit in Florida naming Onstream Media Corporation, Onstream Conferencing Corporation and Infinite Conferencing as defendants. The action alleged breach of contract with respect to payment of certain components of the purchase price for the Intella2 acquisition and related commissions and sought money damages as well as declaratory relief declaring Mr. Cohen's related non-compete agreement with us unenforceable. On December 31, 2013 we filed our response to this lawsuit, which contained various objections to the lawsuit allegations as well as a number of counterclaims. On July 29, 2014, the parties entered into a settlement agreement and on August 4, 2014, the lawsuit was dismissed with prejudice by the court. Based on the conditions of that settlement, we reduced the approximately $782,000 estimated liability for the unpaid portion of the purchase price to the $38,000 we ultimately paid under the settlement (in cash and equipment), which resulted in our recognition of other income of approximately $744,000 for the year ended September 30, 2014.\nThe approximately $440,000 decrease in interest expense was primarily due to (i) an approximately $183,000 aggregate net decrease in interest expense recognized for certain subordinated debt (the Working Capital Notes, the Intella2 Investor Notes, the Fuse Note and the Subordinated Notes) for fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014, (ii) an approximately $111,000 aggregate net decrease in interest expense recognized for certain senior debt (the New Sigma Note, the Rockridge Note, the Line and the USAC Notes) for fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 (iii) an approximately $84,000 aggregate net decrease in the expense paid and/or accrued by us for fiscal 2015 related to our obligation to reimburse the shortfall upon the resale of certain of our common shares as well as the accretion of interest on obligations to repurchase certain of our common shares, as compared to the aggregate net amount of such accruals for fiscal 2014 and (iv) $52,000 of interest accretion recorded by us in connection with the Intella2 purchase price during fiscal 2014, for which there was no corresponding item in fiscal 2015, since we no longer accrued accretion after the July 29, 2014 Intella2 litigation settlement, as discussed above.\nAs discussed above under \u201cRecent Developments\u201d, on March 5 and 6, 2015, we received aggregate gross cash proceeds of $1.0 million for our sale, effective February 28, 2015, of a defined subset of Infinite's audio conferencing customers (and the related future business to those customers) to Partners. The proceeds from this sale were used by us to pay (i) approximately $311,000 of outstanding principal and approximately $136,000 of accrued interest on certain notes payable and (ii) approximately $69,000 for the cash portion of legal and consulting fees related to this transaction. The remaining proceeds were used for fee obligations under the New Sigma Note and for other operating expenses. As a result of certain of the items we repaid using the proceeds from Partners, our interest expense decreased. As a result of our treatment of Partners as a VIE requiring consolidation in our financial statements, the $1.0 million gross proceeds from this transaction was reflected by us as an increase in our equity and the approximately $233,000 paid and/or accrued for the Partners' guaranteed return related to those invested proceeds for the year ended September 30, 2015, was reflected as a distribution out of our equity, and not as interest expense.\nNet Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Owners' Interest in VIE\nOur consolidated net loss for the year ended September 30, 2015 included approximately $233,000 net income attributable to noncontrolling owner's interest in the VIE Partners, versus no corresponding amount for the year ended September 30, 2014.\nOn March 5 and 6, 2015, we received aggregate gross cash proceeds of $1.0 million for our sale, effective February 28, 2015, of the Sold Accounts to Partners. Based on our determination that Partners is a Variable Interest Entity (VIE) requiring consolidation in our financial statements, the revenues from the Sold Accounts are included in our consolidated revenues. The payment of the Partners' guaranteed return percentage, which is based on the cash proceeds received for this sale, is reflected as a decrease in our equity (distributions to owners of VIE) and also represents the portion of our consolidated results that are attributable to the VIE, with the balance of our consolidated results after deducting the VIE portion being the net loss attributable to the Onstream Media shareholders for the period.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nFor the year ended September 30, 2015, we had a net loss of approximately $8.4 million, although cash provided by operating activities for that period was approximately $343,000. Cash provided by operating activities is calculated after adding back to our net loss the periodic amortization of the amount of other fees and expenses incurred in connection with obtaining or maintaining our debt, which fees and expenses are initially recorded by us as debt discount and presented by us on the balance sheet as a reduction of the outstanding principal balance. The other fees and expenses included in debt discount include amounts payable in cash and/or equity and may be payable to the lender, to third parties engaged by the lender or to third parties engaged by us.\nOur cash balance decreased by approximately $72,000 during the year ended September 30, 2015. This was the result of approximately $320,000 used in investing activities and approximately $95,000 used in financing activities, partially offset by approximately $343,000 provided by operating activities. Although we had cash of approximately $317,000 at September 30, 2015, we had a working capital deficit of approximately $5.3 million at that date. This $5.3 million deficit includes the following items classified as current on our September 30, 2015 balance sheet: (i) approximately $1.5 million of net debt repaid by us from the proceeds of the Partners transaction in December 2015 and (ii) approximately $1.7 million of debt outstanding under the Line which we recently renewed through December 31, 2017, both as discussed in more detail below.\nCash provided by operating activities of approximately $343,000 for the year ended September 30, 2015, represents an approximately $114,000 decrease in cash provided by operating activities as compared to approximately $457,000 cash provided by operating activities for the prior fiscal year. The approximately $343,000 cash provided by operating activities for the year ended September 30, 2015 reflects (i) net cash used by operating activities before changes in current assets and liabilities other than cash of approximately $96,000, which in turn represents our net loss of approximately $8.4 million, offset by approximately $8.3 million non-cash expenses included in that net loss and (ii) an approximately $440,000 net decrease in working capital other than cash. The primary non-cash expenses included in our loss for the year ended September 30, 2015 were an approximately $5.6 million impairment loss on goodwill and other intangible assets, an $800,000 impairment loss on property and equipment, approximately $715,000 of amortization of discount on notes payable and convertible debentures and approximately $686,000 of depreciation and amortization. The approximately $440,000 net decrease in working capital other than cash for the year ended September 30, 2015 is primarily due to an approximately $414,000 increase in accounts payable, accrued liabilities and amounts due to directors and officers. The $440,000 net decrease in working capital other than cash represented approximately $511,000 more cash than the net increase in working capital other than cash of approximately $71,000 for the prior fiscal year. The primary sources of cash inflows from operations are from receivables collected from sales to customers.\nCash used in investing activities was approximately $320,000 for the year ended September 30, 2015 as compared to approximately $556,000 cash used in investing activities for the prior fiscal year. Current and prior period investing activities related to the acquisition of property and equipment, including capitalized software development costs.\nCash used in financing activities was approximately $95,000 for the year ended September 30, 2015 as compared to approximately $231,000 cash provided by financing activities for the prior fiscal year. The current year period financing activities primarily related to (i) the December 31, 2014 repayment to Sigma of all accrued interest due on Sigma Notes 1 and 2 through that date, which interest had been capitalized as part of the outstanding principal balance, after which Sigma Notes 1 and 2 were cancelled and replaced with a new note payable to Sigma, (ii) the March 2015 repayment of the outstanding principal on certain notes payable from the proceeds of the March 2015 sale to Partners and (iii) the recurring distributions to the owners of Partners, effective March 1, 2015 through September 30, 2015, such uses of cash partially offset by the net proceeds we received in March 2015 from our sale, effective February 28, 2015, of a defined subset of Infinite's audio conferencing customers (and the related future business to those customers) to Partners. These transactions are all discussed in more detail below. Financing activities for the year ended September 30, 2014, excluding accounts receivable based borrowing and repayment activity under the Line, primarily related to proceeds from the Working Capital Notes and from Sigma Note 2 and the repayment of certain notes payable from the proceeds of those two financings.\nIn December 2007, we entered into a line of credit arrangement (the \u201cLine\u201d) with a financial institution (the \u201cLender\u201d). The Lender was Thermo Credit LLC through February 10, 2016 and as a result of an assignment, Thermo Communications Funding LLC, an affiliated company, subsequent to that date. Mr. Leon Nowalsky, a member of our Board, is an investor and board member in both entities.\nThe Line has been renewed and modified from time to time, and under which we may presently borrow up to an aggregate of $2.0 million for working capital, collateralized by our accounts receivable and certain other related assets and the amount of such borrowing being further subject to the amount, aging and concentration of such receivables. Although the Line expired on December 27, 2013, we continued after that date to negotiate renewal terms with the Lender and to maintain an outstanding borrowing balance under the Line and on February 10, 2016 (the \u201cEffective Date\u201d), we entered into a Loan Modification Agreement (\u201cModification\u201d) which extended the term of the Line through December 31, 2017 (the \u201cMaturity Date\u201d). Notwithstanding this renewal for a period ending more than one year after our September 30, 2015 balance sheet, since the outstanding balance at that date could, in the absence of continuing revenues generating eligible receivables with a sufficient dollar value, be fully repayable within one year, it is classified as a current liability on that balance sheet, as well as our September 30, 2014 balance sheet.\nThe Modification also provides that, if no Default or Event of Default, as defined in the Modification, shall have occurred and be continuing as of the Maturity Date, and upon our notice and request to Lender sent per the timing and other requirements in the Modification, Lender shall (in good faith) engage in, and conclude as quickly as commercially reasonable, negotiations with us to extend the Maturity Date by up to an additional twelve months (i.e., through December 31, 2018). The Modification also changed a number of the other terms of the Line, as discussed below.\nPrior to the Effective Date, the outstanding balance (approximately $1.7 million as of September 30, 2015 and approximately $1.6 million as of October 24, 2016) bears interest at 12.0% per annum, adjustable based on changes in prime after December 28, 2009, payable monthly in arrears. The Modification provides that as of the Effective Date the interest rate will be the prime rate plus seven and one-half percent (7.5%) per annum, but no less than eleven percent (11.0%) per annum or any higher rate that might be allowed by the terms of the Line, including the Modification, arising from certain events such as default. Accordingly, as of the Effective Date, the outstanding balance bears interest at 11.0% per annum.\nUnder the terms of the Line, we also incur a monitoring fee and a commitment fee, which fees were unchanged by the Modification. The monitoring fee is one twentieth of a percent (0.05%) of the borrowing limit per week, payable monthly in arrears, and the commitment fee is one percent (1%) per year of the maximum allowable borrowing amount, payable annually in advance.\nThe terms of the Line prior to the Effective Date required that all funds remitted by our customers in payment of receivables be deposited directly to a bank account owned by the Lender (the \u201cLockbox Account\u201d), although this was never implemented. This requirement continues after the Effective Date, including the provision that such funds received in the Lockbox Account shall be immediately applied to any balance outstanding under the Line, or returned to us one day following clearance by the receiving bank, to the extent there is no balance outstanding under the Line. The Modification provides that we shall be responsible for the additional expenses related to the Lender-owned bank account, which we expect to be in the range of $12,000 to $18,000 per year.\nThe Modification provides that our failure to comply with these provisions shall be an immediate Event of Default, and although as of July 8, 2016 (the extended deadline granted by the Lender on June 8, 2016) these provisions had not been fully implemented, we were in substantial compliance with such provisions since August 1, 2016 and through October 28, 2016 and we have not received any notification from the Lender as to any Event of Default under these provisions, as of October 28, 2016. In a letter dated October 26, 2016, the Lender agreed that there was no default by us with respect to such lockbox provisions up to and including October 31, 2016, although this does not constitute authorization for any non-compliance with these provisions after October 31, 2016.\nThe Line is subject to us maintaining an adequate level of receivables, based on certain formulas. However, due to the lack of a formal renewal of the Line, in June 2014 the Lender determined that there would be no further advances under the Line, although no further repayments have been required either, and as a result the outstanding principal balance of the Line did not change from that time through June 24, 2016, regardless of weekly changes in the calculated borrowing availability based on the applicable formulas applied to our receivable levels. Effective June 24, 2016, the first deposit was made to the Lockbox Account and applied against the balance outstanding under the Line.\nThe Modification allows our receivable from any single party, including Partners, to be considered an Eligible Receivable to the extent that (i) the aggregate of all accounts receivable from such party and its affiliates does not exceed thirty percent (30%) of all Eligible Receivables (all Eligible Receivables for this purpose including the portion of the our accounts receivable from such party that is ultimately considered to be an Eligible Receivable) then owed by all of our account debtors and (ii) it meets all of the other requirements for eligibility as set forth in the Line.\nAs of the Effective Date, although the outstanding balance under the Line exceeded the maximum allowable borrowing amount under the Line (the \u201cBorrowing Base\u201d), the Modification provided that notwithstanding any other provisions of the Line or the Modification, such condition would not be considered a Default or an Event of Default, and Lender would agree to make advances to us thereunder based on the Borrowing Base plus an overadvance amount determined by a schedule which started at $300,000 through February 27, 2016 but declined to zero as of July 31, 2016 and thereafter. As of October 24, 2016, the outstanding balance under the Line was approximately $1,576,000, which exceeded the Borrowing Base by approximately $248,000. Although there is no formal obligation to do so, as of October 24, 2016 the Lender is allowing such overadvance condition to continue, under their expectation that we are seeking alternative funding to replace that overadvance. In a letter dated October 26, 2016, the Lender agreed that there was no default by us with respect to such overadvances up to and including October 31, 2016, although this does not constitute authorization for any non-compliance with these provisions after October 31, 2016.\nThe Line is also subject to our compliance with a quarterly debt service coverage covenant (the \u201cCovenant\u201d). Prior to the Modification, the Covenant requires that the sum of (i) our net income or loss, adjusted to remove all non-cash expenses as well as cash interest expense and (ii) contributions to capital (less cash distributions and/or cash dividends paid during such period) and proceeds from subordinated unsecured debt, be equal to or greater than the sum of cash payments for interest and debt principal payments. The Lender waived the requirement to comply with the Covenant for the quarter ended September 30, 2015. We have complied with the Covenant for all other applicable quarters through June 30, 2016.\nThe Modification provides that effective January 1, 2016 and thereafter, the Covenant will require that our net income or loss, adjusted to (i) add back all non-cash expenses as well as cash interest expense and (ii) subtract cash distributions and/or cash dividends paid during such period, be equal to or greater than 1.2 times the sum of cash payments for interest and debt principal payments. The Modification also provides that we will not declare or pay any dividends or distributions on any equity interest, if before or after such event an Event of Default or Default, as defined in the Modification, would exist. Both before and after the Modification, the terms of the Line allow us to achieve compliance with the Covenant by (i) including any excess of adjusted net income over the amount of adjusted net income required to comply with the Covenant in the preceding two quarters or (ii) adding to adjusted net income the proceeds from subordinated debt or equity sales meeting defined conditions, and received within certain time frames extending prior to, and in some cases subsequent to, the relevant date of determination, all set forth in the Line and the Modification. The Modification also explicitly allows, subject to Lender's prior consent, proceeds from our sales of revenues/customer accounts to a separate legal entity and received within a time frames extending six months prior to, and one month subsequent to, the relevant date of determination, to be added to adjusted net income for purposes of the Covenant. In a letter dated October 26, 2016, the Lender consented to the inclusion of proceeds from our December 2015 and June 2016 sales of revenue/customer accounts to Partners, as well as the proceeds from such sale in process that we expect to be effective during November 2016, and extended the carryback period for those proceeds from one month to three months.\nAlthough we do not have final financial results for periods after June 30, 2016, our estimated calculations for the quarter ended September 30, 2016, including our expectations of additional financing proceeds after that date that would be allowable for inclusion in those calculations, indicate that we are in compliance with the Covenant.\nThe outstanding principal is due on demand in the event a payment default is uncured one (1) day after written notice. The Modification provides that, without limiting any other rights and remedies provided by the terms of the Line or otherwise available to the Lender, the Lender may exercise one or more of certain rights and remedies, as listed in the Amendment, during the existence of any uncured Default (upon not less than five days prior written notice by Lender) or Event of Default which has not been waived in writing by Lender. Lender's rights to exercise such rights and remedies will end if and when all of Debtors' obligations to Lender in connection with the Line have been satisfied. The rights and remedies listed in the Modification include, but are not limited to: (i) verify the validity and amount of, or any other matter relating to, the accounts by mail, telephone, telegraph or otherwise, (ii) notify all account debtors that the accounts have been assigned to Lender and that Lender has a security interest in the accounts, (iii) direct all account debtors to make payment of all accounts directly to Lender or the Lockbox Account (iv) in any case and for any reason, notify the United States Postal Service to change the addresses for delivery of mail addressed to us to such address as Lender may designate, as well as receive, open and dispose of all such mail, provided that Lender shall promptly forward to us any such items not related to the accounts, (v) exercise all of our rights and remedies with respect to the collection of accounts, (vi) settle, adjust, compromise, extend, renew, discharge or release accounts, for amounts and upon terms which Lender considers advisable and (vii) sell or assign accounts on such terms, for such amounts and at such times as Lender deems advisable.\nAs of September 30, 2015, in addition to the Line as discussed above, we were also obligated for the following term debt, discussed in more detail below:\nTable 8: <table> <tr> <td> New Sigma Note\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,583,000\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Rockridge Note\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 400,000\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Fuse Note\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 220,000\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Working Capital Notes\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 465,000\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Subordinated Notes\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 192,500\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Intella2 Investor Notes\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 415,000\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> USAC Note and other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 196,983\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total term debt\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,472,483\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nApproximately $1.5 million, in aggregate, of the above debt was repaid by us from the proceeds of the Partners transaction in December 2015, as discussed in more detail below.\nAs of September 30, 2015 we were obligated to Sigma Opportunity Fund II, LLC (\u201cSigma\u201d) under a secured note for $1,583,000, with interest payable monthly at 21% per annum and the principal due on April 15, 2016 (the \u201cNew Sigma Note\u201d).\nOn December 17, 2015, we made a $1.0 million payment to Sigma against the outstanding principal balance of the New Sigma Note, reducing the remaining outstanding principal balance on the Note to $583,000. On December 22, 2015, we entered into certain agreements with Sigma and Sigma Capital, which included an amendment to the New Sigma Note. As a result of these agreements, the outstanding balance of the New Sigma Note was increased to $600,000, to reflect a one-time administrative fee of $17,000, and we also reimbursed $3,500 of Sigma's legal expenses related to the transactions. In addition, the maturity date of the remaining balance due under the New Sigma Note was extended from April 15, 2016 to December 31, 2016.\nAs part of the December 22, 2015 agreements, the interest rate on the New Sigma Note was reduced from 21% to 17% per annum, the monthly advisory fee payable to Sigma Capital was reduced from $12,500 to $10,000 and the following obligations to Sigma Capital were eliminated - (i) future monthly damages payable for late SEC filings which were initiated as part of an April 30, 2015 agreement with Sigma and Sigma Capital and (ii) the third and final installment of the fee incurred by us as a result of a previous extension of the maturity date of the New Sigma Note to April 15, 2016, and which would have been $50,000 payable on December 15, 2015. We have agreed, regardless of the early repayment of the New Sigma Note, to pay a minimum aggregate amount of $100,000 of monthly advisory fee payments to Sigma Capital as scheduled, starting with the January 15, 2016 payment of $10,000.\nIn connection with an Advisory Services Agreement dated December 31, 2014, entered into by us with Sigma Capital in connection with the issuance of the New Sigma Note, we agreed to (i) pay Sigma Capital an initial advisory fee of $100,000, (ii) issue 70,000 restricted common shares to Sigma and 30,000 restricted common shares to Sigma Capital, such shares having an aggregate fair value of approximately $20,000, (iii) pay Sigma approximately $20,000 as reimbursement of legal expenses and (iv) make additional advisory fee payments to Sigma Capital totaling $160,000 in monthly installments through June 30, 2015. The value of the common shares issued plus the fees and expenses we agreed to pay in connection with the December 31, 2014 Sigma agreement (there was no remaining unamortized discount from previous Sigma transactions as of that date) were amortized as interest based on the initial six month the term of the New Sigma Note, resulting in an effective interest rate of approximately 65% per annum for the period from January 1, 2015 through April 30, 2015.\nAs part of the April 30, 2015 agreement with Sigma we (i) paid Sigma Capital a $25,000 transaction fee, (ii) paid Sigma $14,000 as reimbursement of legal expenses and (iii) agreed to make additional advisory fee payments to Sigma Capital aggregating $40,000 in monthly installments from July 15, 2015 through October 15, 2015. The April 30, 2015 agreement also required us to pay liquidated damages for late SEC filings and in accordance with that requirement we paid Sigma Capital an aggregate of $42,500 for such damages from April 30, 2015 through September 30, 2015 and another $25,000 for such damages after that date through November 27, 2015, the last payment date before the agreement to pay such damages was cancelled. When the amortization of the fees and expenses we agreed to pay in connection with the April 30, 2015 Sigma agreement, including the anticipated liquidated damages for late SEC filings, such items aggregating $121,500, were combined with the amortization of the remaining unamortized discount arising from the December 31, 2014 financing, the resulting effective interest rate of the New Sigma Note was approximately 57% per annum for the period from May 1, 2015 through September 30, 2015. Although this effective rate would be impacted by the September 21, 2015 transaction discussed below, we will not reflect that impact until October 1, 2015 and have determined that the impact of this delayed implementation is immaterial. This effective interest rate does not include the impact if an early repayment was required, as discussed above.\nAs part of the September 21, 2015 agreement with Sigma we (i) paid Sigma Capital a $25,000 fee (added to the loan principal balance), (ii) paid Sigma $7,500 as reimbursement of legal expenses, (iii) agreed to make an additional advisory fee payment to Sigma Capital of $2,500 on October 15, 2015, and (iv) agreed, in consideration of the loan maturity date extension from October 15, 2015 to April 15, 2016, to pay fees to Sigma Capital aggregating $175,000 in three monthly installments from October 15, 2015 through December 15, 2015 (of which we paid $125,000, with the remaining $50,000 obligation cancelled as part of the December 22, 2015 agreement with Sigma as discussed above) and to make additional advisory fee payments to Sigma Capital aggregating $75,000 in monthly installments from November 15, 2015 through April 15, 2016 (of which we paid $25,000, with the remaining $50,000 obligation cancelled and replaced with a new advisory fee obligation as part of the December 22, 2015 agreement with Sigma as discussed above).\nUpon our receipt of funds as a result of (i) the sale of any portion of our business, however structured, including, without limitation, sale of assets, subsidiaries, revenues or business units, and/or (ii) the issuance of additional equity, debt or convertible debt capital, and/or (iii) our consolidation or merger with or into another entity, all outstanding principal and interest with respect to the New Sigma Note"}
