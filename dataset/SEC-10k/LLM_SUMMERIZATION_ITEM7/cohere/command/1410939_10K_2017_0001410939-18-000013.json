Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with our financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business and related financing, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties and should be read together with the \"Risk Factors\" section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis.\nOverview\nWe are a science-driven biopharmaceutical company specializing in the development of novel therapies to treat ophthalmic diseases, with a focus on age-related and orphan retinal diseases. Our multi-track strategy is to leverage our clinical experience and retina expertise to develop therapies for large market, age-related retinal diseases, where unmet medical needs remain for these patients, and for orphan eye diseases with a focus on underserved patients, and to utilize a disciplined business development approach to obtain additional products, product candidates and technologies in these disease areas. We believe that there are advantages to pursuing drug development for orphan indications, including the potential for regulatory exclusivity, the potential for clinical trials with smaller sample sizes and the potential for accelerated development timelines. Our team has significant ophthalmic drug development experience and deep relationships with global ophthalmology thought leaders. We have an extensive network of ophthalmic clinical trial sites, having worked with over 250 sites worldwide. We believe that the combination of these factors, together with our experience in designing and executing IND-enabling studies and clinical trials for eye diseases, and specifically back of the eye diseases, provide us a competitive advantage.\nWe are developing Zimura\u00ae (avacincaptad pegol), our complement C5 inhibitor, for dry and wet forms of age-related macular degeneration, or AMD, which is a disorder of the central portion of the retina, known as the macula, that may result in loss of central vision, and autosomal recessive Stargardt disease, or STDG1, which is an orphan inherited retinal disease that also may result in loss of central and peripheral vision. In connection with our Stargardt clinical trial, which we recently initiated, we have expanded our network of thought leaders and clinical trial sites for orphan ophthalmic indications to include leading research university hospitals around the world, where patients with orphan retinal diseases are often referred.\nWe are actively engaged in extensive business development efforts to identify, evaluate and potentially obtain rights to and develop additional therapeutic and gene therapy product candidates that would complement our strategic goals and leverage our competitive advantages. We believe that our strategy will provide multiple potential opportunities to bring ophthalmic therapies to market.\nZimura\nBased on our Zimura development experience to date, as well as scientific literature in the field, we believe there is a strong rationale to pursue the development of our C5 complement inhibitor, Zimura, in multiple ophthalmic diseases. Zimura is a chemically-synthesized, pegylated RNA aptamer. Aptamers are short molecules made up of a single stranded nucleic acid sequence or an amino acid sequence that bind molecular targets with high selectivity and specificity. We have multiple clinical development programs for Zimura ongoing or planned to initiate by the end of 2018. Our ongoing and planned clinical trials for Zimura, all of which are designed to obtain data to guide potential future development efforts, include the following:\nTable 278: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>OPH2003 (geographic atrophy (GA) secondary to dry AMD): an ongoing, randomized, double-masked, sham controlled, multi-center Phase 2b clinical trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of Zimura monotherapy in patients with geographic atrophy, or GA, secondary to dry AMD.

Without limiting any option, the principal focus of this plan, based on our deep expertise and experience in ophthalmic drug development, has been to actively explore obtaining rights to additional products, product candidates and technologies to treat ophthalmic diseases, particularly those in the back of the eye. We evaluated a large number of assets and platforms during 2017 and continue to actively review assets, platforms and other compelling ophthalmology opportunities that would complement our strategic goals. We have considered multiple opportunities over the last several months, including in-licensing, obtaining rights to products, product candidates or technologies, acquisitions, mergers and reverse mergers. Our selection criteria are based on several factors. In general, we are looking for:\nTable 283: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>compelling science;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 284: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>an identified unmet medical need based on the current standard of care;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 285: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>a meaningful commercial opportunity based on existing treatment options and treatment options known to be in development; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 286: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>areas where we believe we can apply our competitive advantages.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nBased on our work to date, among the novel technologies we have evaluated, we believe that gene therapy solutions may be particularly well-suited for our strategy as potential treatments for both orphan and age-related eye diseases. We remain committed to being opportunistic and will consider other compelling opportunities that may emerge.\nGene Therapy Research Programs\nIn February 2018, we announced that an element of our strategy will include initiating collaborative gene therapy programs focused on discovering and developing novel gene therapy technologies to treat retinal diseases. We intend to investigate promising gene therapy product candidates through collaborations with leading companies and academic and research institutions in the United States and internationally.\nFor our first gene therapy research collaboration, we have entered into a series of sponsored research agreements with the University of Massachusetts Medical School, or UMMS, and its Horae Gene Therapy Center to utilize their novel gene delivery technologies and \"minigene\" therapy approach to target retinal diseases. AAV vectors are generally limited as a delivery vehicle by the size of their genetic cargo, which is restricted to approximately 4,700 base pairs of genetic code. The use of \"minigenes\" as a novel therapeutic strategy seeks to deliver a shortened but still functional form of a larger gene packaged into a standard-size AAV delivery vector. The \"minigene\" strategy may offer an innovative solution for diseases that would otherwise be difficult to address through conventional AAV gene replacement therapy where the size of the gene of interest exceeds the transgene packaging capacity of conventional AAV vectors. Furthermore, one of the differentiating advantages of the \"minigene\" approach is that it could potentially provide a treatment that is independent of the specific mutation a patient has. The scope of the UMMS collaboration addresses Leber Congenital Amaurosis type 10, or LCA10, which is the most common type of LCA and is caused by mutations in the CEP290 gene, and STDG1, which is caused by mutations in the ABCA4 gene. LCA10 and STDG1 are both orphan inherited degenerative retinal diseases that lead to vision loss without any FDA or EMA approved treatment. As a condition of each sponsored research agreement, UMMS has granted\nus an option to obtain an exclusive license to any patents or patent applications that result from the sponsored research. Our aggregate financial commitment for the sponsored research agreements is in the low, single-digit millions of dollars.\nRemaining Fovista Activities\nIn December 2016 and August 2017, we received initial top-line data from our three pivotal clinical trials, referred to as OPH1002, OPH1003 and OPH1004, evaluating the anti-platelet derived growth factor, or anti-PDGF, aptamer Fovista\u00ae (pegpleranib) administered in combination with anti-VEGF agents for the treatment of wet AMD, indicating that these trials failed to achieve their pre-specified primary endpoints. We have terminated these trials, as well as several other smaller Fovista trials in wet AMD, which we have referred to as the Fovista Expansion Studies. The National Eye Institute and an academic pre-clinical program are evaluating various uses of Fovista for the treatment of retinal capillary hemangiomas associated with the orphan disease Von-Hippel-Lindau Syndrome, and for the treatment of retinoblastoma, a rare cancer of the eye in children, respectively. We have completed our commitments to these two programs, which primarily involved providing Fovista drug product and drug substance that we had on hand for use in the studies.\nTherefore, we do not currently expect any development activity for Fovista going forward, as we have no intentions to resume development of Fovista in wet AMD and our supply commitments for the two external studies are complete.\nNovartis Agreement\nIn May 2014, we entered into a licensing and commercialization agreement with Novartis Pharma AG, or Novartis, which we refer to as the Novartis Agreement. Under the Novartis Agreement, we granted Novartis exclusive rights under specified patent rights, know-how and trademarks controlled by us to manufacture, from bulk active pharmaceutical ingredient, or API, supplied by us, standalone Fovista products and products combining Fovista with an anti-VEGF agent to which Novartis has rights in a co-formulated product, for the treatment, prevention, cure or control of any human disease, disorder or condition of the eye, and to develop and commercialize those licensed products in all countries outside of the United States, which we refer to as the Novartis Territory. We agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to complete our pivotal Phase 3 clinical program for Fovista and Novartis agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop a standalone Fovista product and a co-formulated product containing Fovista and an anti-VEGF agent to which Novartis has rights, as well as a pre-filled syringe presentation of such products and to use commercially reasonable efforts, subject to obtaining marketing approval, to commercialize licensed products in the Novartis Territory in accordance with agreed development and marketing plans. Novartis paid us a $200.0 million upfront fee upon execution of the Novartis Agreement, as well as $50.0 million upon the achievement of each of two patient enrollment-based milestones, and $30.0 million upon the achievement of a third, and final, enrollment-based milestone, for an aggregate of $330.0 million. In July 2017, we and Novartis entered into a letter agreement to streamline the process and timeline for evaluating data from the final Fovista Phase 3 clinical trial once it became available. On October 23, 2017, following the failure of the Phase 3 Fovista program and pursuant to the terms of the July 2017 letter agreement, Novartis elected to terminate the Novartis Agreement with immediate effect.\nFinancial matters\nAs of December 31, 2017, we had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $167.0 million, of which approximately $2.0 million is committed to satisfying our remaining financial obligations with respect to the wind-down of the Fovista Phase 3 trials and obligations incurred in connection with our reduction in personnel, which was substantially completed during 2017. For 2018, we expect the cash required to fund our operations and capital expenditures, including our Zimura development programs and collaborative gene therapy research programs, as currently planned will range between $50.0 million and $55.0 million.\nAs a result of our ongoing reassessment of our development programs and potential business development opportunities and pipeline expansion activities, we may modify, expand or terminate some or all of our research or development programs or clinical trials at any time. The outcome of these reassessments, as well as the progress of our plans to potentially acquire additional products, product candidates or technologies will determine whether and to what extent we will continue to incur research and development costs for each of our development programs going forward.\nOur ability to become and remain profitable depends on our ability to generate revenue in excess of our expenses. We do not expect to generate significant product revenue unless, and until, we obtain marketing approval for, and commercialize, any of our product candidates, which, if we are successful, will likely take at least several years. We may be unsuccessful in our efforts to develop and commercialize these product candidates. Even if we succeed in developing and commercializing one or more of our product candidates, we may never achieve sufficient sales revenue to achieve or maintain\nprofitability. Our capital requirements will also depend on many other factors, including whether we are successful in our pursuit to acquire or in-license and subsequently develop additional product candidates or technologies. We may need to obtain substantial additional funding in connection with our continuing operations. If we are unable to raise capital when needed or on attractive terms, we could be forced to delay, reduce or eliminate our research and development programs or any future commercialization efforts.\nFinancial Operations Overview\nRevenue\nIn May 2014, we entered into the Novartis Agreement, which is described below under \"-Liquidity and Capital Resources-Licensing and Commercialization Agreement with Novartis Pharma AG.\" We used the relative selling price method to allocate arrangement consideration to our performance obligations under the Novartis Agreement. Upon entry into the Novartis Agreement, we received an upfront payment of $200.0 million, which was not previously recorded as revenue due to our right to terminate the agreement in the event that the parties were prevented from materially progressing the development or commercialization of Fovista products for a specified period as a result of specified governmental actions and the associated termination fee equivalent to the entire $200.0 million upfront payment, which we would have been required to pay if we elected to exercise this termination option. In each of September 2014 and March 2015, we achieved a $50.0 million enrollment-based milestone, and in June 2016, we achieved a $30.0 million enrollment-based milestone, for an aggregate total of $130.0 million, under the Novartis Agreement. In July 2017, we entered into a letter agreement with Novartis, which resulted in the recognition of the remaining deferred revenue under the Novartis Agreement during the third quarter of 2017, as described below under \"Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates-Revenue Recognition-Collaboration Revenue\". The recognition of this revenue during the period did not impact our cash balance. Below is a summary of the components of our collaboration revenue for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015:\nTable 287: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>License revenue\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>152,912\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>22,937\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>38,083\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Research and development activity revenue\n</td> <td>56,180\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,741\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,378\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>API transfer revenue\n</td> <td>754\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18,212\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,020\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Joint operating committee revenue\n</td> <td>131\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total collaboration revenue\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>209,977\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>50,909\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>51,505\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOn October 23, 2017, following the failure of the Fovista Phase 3 program and pursuant to the terms of the July 2017 letter agreement, Novartis elected to terminate the Novartis Agreement with immediate effect. As we have no products approved for sale, we will not receive any revenue from any product candidates that we develop until we obtain regulatory approval and commercialize such products, or until we potentially enter into agreements with third parties for the development and commercialization of product candidates. If our development efforts for any of our product candidates result in regulatory approval or we enter into collaboration agreements with third parties, we may generate revenue from product sales or from such third parties.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nResearch and development expenses primarily consist of costs associated with the development and clinical testing and manufacturing of Zimura and, historically, Fovista, as well as costs associated with the preclinical development of other product candidates and formulations. Our research and development expenses consist of:\nTable 288: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>external research and development expenses incurred under arrangements with third parties, such as contract research organizations, or CROs, and other vendors and contract manufacturing organizations, or CMOs, for the production of API and drug product; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 289: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>employee-related expenses, including salaries, benefits and share-based compensation expense.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nResearch and development expenses also include costs of acquired product licenses and related technology rights where there is no alternative future use, costs of prototypes used in research and development, consultant fees and amounts paid to collaborative partners. We expect that research and development expenses in the future will also include the costs of our\ncollaborative gene therapy research programs, including the costs of our research collaboration with UMMS, entered into in February 2018.\nAll research and development expenses are charged to operations as incurred in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification Topic, or ASC, 730, Research and Development. We account for non-refundable advance payments for goods and services that will be used in future research and development activities as expenses when the service has been performed or when the goods have been received, rather than when the payment is made. To date, the large majority of our research and development activity has been related to Fovista and Zimura. We do not currently utilize a formal time allocation system to capture expenses on a project-by-project basis because we record expenses by functional department. Accordingly, we do not allocate expenses to individual projects or product candidates, although we do allocate some portion of our research and development expenses by functional area and by compound, as shown below.\nThe following table summarizes our research and development expenses for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015: Table 290: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fovista\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>21,698\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>129,661\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>86,906\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Zimura\n</td> <td>11,986\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,400\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,644\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Personnel-related\n</td> <td>19,413\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26,700\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15,830\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Share-based compensation\n</td> <td>11,114\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21,380\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16,608\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other\n</td> <td>2,078\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11,154\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,024\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>66,289\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>196,295\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>131,012\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe expect to continue to incur significant research and development expenses as we pursue the development of Zimura as currently planned. We also expect very limited research and development expenses related to Fovista in the future, as we have terminated our Fovista development programs and have no plans for the future development of Fovista. As we pursue our ongoing and planned Zimura development programs, or as we commence any new development efforts in relation to additional product candidates we may in-license or acquire as we pursue our business plan, we expect that our overall research and development expenses will begin to increase from the current level of expenditure.\nOur expenses may exceed our expectations if we experience delays in enrollment or with the availability of drug supply for our clinical trials, if we experience any unforeseen issue in our ongoing clinical trials or if we further expand the scope of our collaborative research programs or clinical trials. Our costs may also exceed our expectations for other reasons, for example, if we experience issues with process development, establishing or scaling-up of manufacturing activities or activities to enable and qualify second source suppliers or if we decide to increase licensing or preclinical research and development activities, including by building internal capabilities or pursuing internal research efforts.\nThe future development of our product candidates is highly uncertain. We expect the clinical development for Zimura will continue for at least the next several years. At this time, we cannot reasonably estimate the remaining costs necessary to complete clinical development, to complete process development and manufacturing scale-up and validation activities or to potentially seek marketing approval with respect to our product candidates.\nThe successful development of our product candidates is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties associated with developing drugs, including the uncertainty of:\nTable 291: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the scope, rate of progress and expense of our research and development activities;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 292: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the potential benefits of our product candidates over other therapies;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 293: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>clinical trial results;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 294: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the terms and timing of regulatory approvals;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 295: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>our ability to market, commercialize and achieve market acceptance for any of our product candidates; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 296: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>our ability to successfully file, prosecute, defend and enforce patent claims and other intellectual property rights, together with associated expenses.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nA change in the outcome of any of these variables with respect to the development of our product candidates could mean a significant change in the costs and timing associated with the development of that product candidate. For example, if regulatory authorities were to require us to conduct clinical trials beyond those that we currently anticipate will be required for the completion of clinical development of a product candidate or if we experience significant delays in enrollment in any clinical trials, we could be required to expend significant additional financial resources and time on the completion of clinical development.\nSee the Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d section on page 92 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information regarding our current and future financial resources and our expectations regarding our research and development expenses and funding requirements.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related costs for personnel, including share-based compensation expense, in our executive, legal, finance, human resources, investor relations and business development functions. Other general and administrative expenses include facility costs and professional fees for legal, patent, pre-launch commercialization activities, travel expenses, consulting and accounting services.\nWe anticipate that our general and administrative expenses will decrease in future periods as a result of a reduction in personnel to focus on our revised business plan, which we expect will involve a total expected workforce of approximately 40 employees. We substantially completed the reduction in personnel during 2017 as part of implementing our revised business plan.\nInterest Income\nOur cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities are invested primarily in money market funds, U.S. Treasury securities and investment-grade corporate debt securities, which generate a nominal amount of interest income.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates\nOur management's discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements, which we have prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our financial statements. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and judgments, including those related to accrued research and development expenses, revenue recognition, share-based compensation and income taxes described in greater detail below. We base our estimates on our limited historical experience, known trends and events and various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nOur significant accounting policies are described in more detail in the notes to our financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Of those policies, we believe that the following accounting policies are the most critical to aid our stockholders in fully understanding and evaluating our financial condition and results of operations.\nAccrued Research and Development Expenses\nAs part of the process of preparing our financial statements, we are required to estimate our accrued expenses. This process involves reviewing quotations and contracts, identifying services that have been performed on our behalf and estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred for the service when we have not yet been invoiced or otherwise notified of the actual cost. The majority of our service providers invoice us monthly in arrears for services performed or when contractual milestones are met. We make estimates of our accrued expenses as of each balance sheet date in our financial statements based on facts and circumstances known to us at that time. We periodically confirm the accuracy of our estimates with the service providers and make adjustments if necessary. The significant estimates in our accrued research and development expenses are related to expenses incurred with respect to CROs, CMOs and other vendors in connection with research and development and manufacturing activities.\nWe base our expenses related to CROs and CMOs on our estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to quotations and contracts with such vendors that conduct research and development and manufacturing activities on our behalf. The financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation, vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows. There may be instances in which payments made to our vendors will exceed the level of services provided and result in a prepayment of the applicable research and development or manufacturing expense. In accruing service fees, we estimate the time period over which services will be performed and the level of effort to be expended in each period. If the actual timing of the performance of services or the level of effort varies from our estimate, we adjust the accrual or prepaid expense accordingly. Although we do not expect our estimates to be materially different from amounts actually incurred, our understanding of the status and timing of services performed relative to the actual status and timing of services performed may vary and could result in us reporting amounts that are too high or too low in any particular period. There have been no material changes in estimates for the periods presented.\nRevenue Recognition-Collaboration Revenue\nIn May 2014, we received an upfront payment of $200.0 million in connection with our entry into the Novartis Agreement, which was not recorded as revenue due to the existence of a contingency with respect to our right to terminate the agreement in certain circumstances and the associated termination fee equivalent to the entire $200.0 million upfront payment, which we would have been required to pay if we elected to exercise this termination option. In each of September 2014 and March 2015, we achieved a $50.0 million enrollment-based milestone, and in June 2016, we achieved a $30.0 million enrollment-based milestone, for an aggregate total of $130.0 million in milestones, under the Novartis Agreement. We used the relative selling price method to allocate these payments to contract deliverables based on our performance obligations under the Novartis Agreement.\nThe July 2017 letter agreement with Novartis resolved the contingency with respect to our termination right, allowing us to immediately recognize as revenue the portion of the upfront payment allocated using the relative selling price method to deliverables completed during prior periods. During the third quarter of 2017, we completed the remaining deliverables under the Novartis Agreement and the July 2017 letter agreement and recognized as revenue the balance of all of the payments previously received from Novartis related to licensing, research and development, manufacturing and joint operating committee activities that had been previously deferred using the relative selling price method. In total, during the third quarter of 2017, we recognized $206.7 million in previously deferred collaboration revenue in connection with the Novartis Agreement. The recognition of this revenue during the period did not impact our cash balance. On October 23, 2017, following the failure of the Fovista Phase 3 program and pursuant to the terms of the July 2017 letter agreement, Novartis elected to terminate the Novartis Agreement with immediate effect.\nBelow is a summary of the components of our collaboration revenue for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015:\nTable 297: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>License revenue\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>152,912\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>22,937\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>38,083\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Research and development activity revenue\n</td> <td>56,180\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,741\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,378\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>API transfer revenue\n</td> <td>754\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18,212\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,020\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Joint operating committee revenue\n</td> <td>131\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total collaboration revenue\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>209,977\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>50,909\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>51,505\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRoyalty Purchase Liability\nThe proceeds from the financing we received under our Fovista royalty financing agreement with Novo A/S, or the Novo Agreement, have been recorded as a liability on our Balance Sheet in accordance with ASC 730, Research and Development. Although there is no explicit repayment obligation contained in the Novo Agreement, because there was a significant related party relationship between us and Novo A/S at the time the Novo Agreement was entered into, we are treating our obligation to make royalty payments under the Novo Agreement as an implicit obligation to repay the funds advanced by Novo A/S, and thus have recorded the proceeds as a liability on our Balance Sheet. In the event that we make royalty payments to Novo A/S, we will reduce the liability balance. At the time that such royalty payments become probable and estimable, and if such amounts exceed the liability balance, we will impute interest accordingly on a prospective basis based on such estimates, which would result in a corresponding increase in the liability balance.\nShare-Based Compensation\nWe account for all share-based compensation payments issued to employees, non-employee directors, and consultants by estimating the fair value of each equity award. Accordingly, share-based compensation expense is measured based on the estimated fair value of the awards on the date of grant, net of forfeitures. We recognize compensation expense for the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest over the period during which the recipient renders the required services to us on a straight-line basis. In accordance with authoritative guidance, we re-measure the fair value of consultant share-based awards as the awards vest, and recognize the resulting value, if any, as expense during the period the related services are rendered.\nWe apply the fair value recognition provisions of ASC 718, Compensation-Stock Compensation. Determining the amount of share-based compensation to be recorded requires us to develop estimates of the fair value of stock options as of their grant date. We recognize share-based compensation expense ratably over the requisite service period, which in most cases is the vesting period of the award. For grants containing performance-based vesting provisions, expense is recognized over the estimated achievement period. Calculating the fair value of share-based awards requires that we make highly subjective assumptions.\nWe use the Black-Scholes option pricing model to value our stock option awards and the options to purchase shares under our employee stock purchase plan. Use of this valuation methodology requires that we make assumptions as to the volatility of our common stock, the expected term of our stock options, and the risk-free interest rate for a period that approximates the expected term of our stock options and the expected dividend yield of our common stock. As a recent public company, we do not have sufficient history to estimate the volatility of our common stock price or the expected life of the options. We calculate expected volatility based on reported data for similar publicly traded companies for which historical information is available and will continue to do so until the historical volatility of our common stock is sufficient to measure expected volatility for future option grants.\nWe use the simplified method as prescribed by the Securities and Exchange Commission Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 107, Share-Based Payment, to calculate the expected term of stock option grants to employees as we do not have sufficient historical exercise data to provide a reasonable basis upon which to estimate the expected term of stock options granted to employees. The risk-free interest rate used for each grant is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for instruments with a similar expected life. We utilize a dividend yield of zero based on the fact that we have never paid cash dividends and have no current intention to pay cash dividends. The weighted-average assumptions used to estimate grant date fair value of stock options using the Black-Scholes option pricing model were as follows for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015: Table 298: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Expected common stock price volatility\n</td> <td>81%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>71%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>72%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Risk-free interest rate\n</td> <td>1.82% - 2.38%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.14% - 2.37%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.35% - 2.24%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Expected term of options (years)\n</td> <td>6.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.2\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Expected dividend yield\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe estimate the fair value of restricted stock units, or RSUs, granted to employees using the closing market price of our common stock on the date of grant.\nWe also estimate forfeitures at the time of grant, and revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from our estimates. We use historical data to estimate pre-vesting forfeitures and record share-based compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest. To the extent that actual forfeitures differ from our estimates, the difference is recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period the estimates were revised.\nShare-based compensation expense for equity grants to employees, non-employee directors and consultants was $18.2 million, $31.7 million and $24.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. As of December 31, 2017, we had $20.7 million of total unrecognized share-based compensation expense, which we expect to recognize over a weighted-average remaining vesting period of approximately 2.4 years. We expect our share-based compensation expense for our equity awards to employees, non-employee directors and consultants to increase as a result of recognizing our existing unrecognized share-based compensation for awards that will vest and as we issue additional equity awards to attract and retain our employees.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, we allocated share-based compensation as follows: Table 299: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Research and development\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>11,114\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>21,380\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>16,608\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General and administrative\n</td> <td>7,057\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,280\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,152\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>18,171\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>31,660\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>24,760\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIncome Taxes\nOn December 22, 2017, the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, or the TCJA, was enacted reducing the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% effective for tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2018. As a result of the passage of the TCJA, the value of our deferred tax assets and related valuation allowance was reduced by a provisional amount of approximately $54.6 million. Additionally, under the TCJA, the Corporate Alternative Minimum Tax, or AMT, was repealed. Accordingly, our previously recorded AMT credits of approximately $3.5 million are now refundable over a four-year period beginning in 2018 and the previously recorded valuation allowance for these AMT credits has been reversed as a result of the TCJA during the fourth quarter of 2017.\nThe deferred tax assets associated with our losses incurred to date in 2017 have a full valuation allowance recorded against them due to our history of losses and the lack of other positive evidence to support future taxable income against which these losses could be applied. See Note 8 to our financial statements in Part IV-Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information regarding our expectations with respect to our income tax provision.\nWe are projecting a tax loss for 2017, none of which may be carried back to any prior taxable years. Although we recognized income under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, during 2017, this income is primarily due to the recognition of deferred income that had previously been recorded on our federal and state income tax returns. This recognition of income resulted in the reduction of a deferred tax asset that was completely offset by a previously recorded valuation allowance. With respect to the remaining deferred tax assets, except for the AMT credits previously discussed above, there was no change in the amount of assets realizable at December 31, 2017.\nResults of Operations\nComparison of Years Ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 Table 300: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase\n(Decrease)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Statements of Operations Data:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Collaboration revenue\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>209,977\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>50,909\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>159,068\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating expenses:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Research and development\n</td> <td>66,289\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>196,295\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(130,006\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General and administrative\n</td> <td>35,683\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>50,178\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(14,495\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total operating expenses\n</td> <td>101,972\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>246,473\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(144,501\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income (loss) from operations\n</td> <td>108,005\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(195,564\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(303,569\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest income\n</td> <td>1,522\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,704\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(182\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other income (expense)\n</td> <td>(34\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>34\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(68\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income (loss) before income tax benefit\n</td> <td>109,493\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(193,826\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(303,319\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax benefit\n</td> <td>(4,712\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(406\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4,306\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income (loss)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>114,205\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(193,420\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(307,625\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCollaboration Revenue\nCollaboration revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $210.0 million, an increase of $159.1 million compared to $50.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Collaboration revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased as we completed all deliverables required under the Novartis Agreement during the period. The July 2017 letter\nagreement with Novartis resolved the contingency with respect to our right to terminate the agreement in the event that the parties were prevented from materially progressing the development or commercialization of Fovista products for a specified period as a result of specified governmental actions and the associated termination fee equivalent to the entire $200.0 million upfront payment, which we would have been required to pay if we elected to exercise this termination option. We had previously deferred the entire $200.0 million upfront payment based on this contingency. As a result of our entry into the letter agreement and resolution of the contingency, we immediately recognized the revenue attributable to deliverables completed during prior periods. Further, as our remaining deliverables under the Novartis Agreement and the letter agreement were completed during the third quarter of 2017, we recognized all of the remaining collaboration revenue previously deferred under the Novartis Agreement. Using the relative selling price method, we recognized $152.9 million related to the license we delivered to Novartis under the Novartis Agreement, $56.2 million related to the research and development activities we performed under the Novartis Agreement, $0.8 million related to Fovista API we previously transferred to Novartis, and $0.1 million related to our joint operating committee participation obligations.\nCollaboration revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $50.9 million, of which $22.9 million was allocated to the license delivered to Novartis under the Novartis Agreement, $9.7 million was allocated to research and development activities performed under the Novartis Agreement, $18.2 million related to Fovista API we transferred to Novartis, and a de minimis amount of revenue was associated with our joint operating committee participation obligation during the same period.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nOur research and development expenses were $66.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, a decrease of $130.0 million compared to $196.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Research and development expenses for the year ended December 31, 2017 include approximately $7.5 million in costs related to our previously announced reduction in personnel. The decrease in research and development expenses for the year ended December 31, 2017 was primarily due to a $107.1 million decrease in costs associated with our Fovista program, including our Fovista Phase 3 clinical program and our Fovista Expansion Studies, a $6.2 million decrease in professional services and consulting fees, and a $10.3 million decrease in share-based compensation costs. The decreased costs for our Fovista program included lower costs related to Fovista manufacturing activities and lower clinical trial costs as a result of the wind-down of OPH1002 and OPH1003 and the Fovista Expansion Studies. This overall decrease was offset by a $4.6 million increase associated with our Zimura program, primarily related to manufacturing expenses.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nOur general and administrative expenses were $35.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, a decrease of $14.5 million, compared to $50.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. General and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2017 include approximately $5.6 million in costs related to our previously announced reduction in force and the termination of facilities leases. The decrease in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to a decrease in costs to support our operations and infrastructure offset by the additional severance and lease termination costs.\nInterest Income\nInterest income for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $1.5 million compared to interest income of $1.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease in interest income earned during the year ended December 31, 2017 was the result of a decrease in our cash and cash equivalent balances available for investment.\nIncome Tax Benefit\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, we recorded a benefit from income taxes of approximately $4.7 million, which primarily related to a $3.5 million reduction in our valuation allowances for AMT credits to reflect the impact of the TCJA enactment and a settlement of a franchise tax audit for $1.4 million partially offset by the reversal of previously recoded benefits related to the change in unrealized gains of our investment portfolio. Although we had $109.5 million of net income before income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2017 as a result of the recognition of deferred revenue under the Novartis Agreement, we expect a net loss for tax purposes for 2017 with minimal taxes due. For tax purposes, we treated payments received under the Novartis Agreement as revenue at the time the payments were received and the related deferred tax assets had a full valuation recorded against them.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, we recorded a benefit from income taxes of approximately $0.4 million, which related to unanticipated refunds received and the reduction in our valuation allowances to reflect the income tax associated with unrealized gains in our investment portfolio.\nComparison of Years Ended December 31, 2016 and 2015\nTable 301: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase\n(Decrease)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Statements of Operations Data:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Collaboration revenue\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>50,909\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>51,505\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(596\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating expenses:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Research and development\n</td> <td>196,295\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>131,012\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>65,283\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General and administrative\n</td> <td>50,178\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>44,021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,157\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total operating expenses\n</td> <td>246,473\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>175,033\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>71,440\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss from operations\n</td> <td>(195,564\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(123,528\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>72,036\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest income\n</td> <td>1,704\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>971\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>733\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other income\n</td> <td>34\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>53\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(19\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss before income tax provision\n</td> <td>(193,826\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(122,504\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>71,322\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax benefit\n</td> <td>(406\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(16,787\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(16,381\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net loss\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(193,420\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(105,717\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>87,703\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCollaboration Revenue\nCollaboration revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016 was approximately $50.9 million. Using the relative selling price method, we allocated $22.9 million to the license delivered to Novartis under the Novartis Agreement, $9.7 million to research and development activities performed under the Novartis Agreement, $18.2 million related to the Fovista API we transferred to Novartis, and a de minimis amount of revenue associated with our joint operating committee participation obligation during the year ended December 31, 2016.\nCollaboration revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $51.5 million, of which $38.1 million was allocated to the license delivered to Novartis under the Novartis Agreement, $8.4 million was allocated to research and development activities performed under the Novartis Agreement and $5.0 million related to Fovista API we transferred to Novartis during the same period.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nOur research and development expenses were $196.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, an increase of $65.3 million compared to $131.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in research and development expenses for the year ended December 31, 2016 was primarily due to a $42.8 million increase in costs associated with our Fovista program, including our Fovista Phase 3 clinical program and our Fovista Expansion Studies. The increased costs for our Fovista program included higher clinical trial costs relating to increased patient enrollment in the Fovista Phase 3 clinical trials and the Fovista Expansion Studies, the initiation of additional Fovista Expansion Studies, as well as higher manufacturing costs to support our clinical trials and for API validation activities, and certain costs related to the cancellation of Fovista API purchase orders following our receipt of initial, top-line data from OPH1002 and OPH1003 in December 2016. Also contributing to the overall increase was a $10.9 million increase to personnel expenses associated with additional research and development staffing and a $4.8 million increase to share-based compensation costs. In addition, costs related to professional services and consulting fees increased by $6.1 million.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nOur general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2016 were $50.2 million, an increase of $6.2 million, compared to $44.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase was primarily due to an increase in personnel expenses of $2.6 million, including $2.1 million in share-based compensation costs, an increase of $2.8 million in facility costs, as well as other costs to support the expansion of our operations during 2016, including our public company infrastructure, and the early stages of a commercial organization. Also contributing to the increase were increased costs for professional services and consulting fees of $0.8 million.\nInterest Income\nInterest income for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $1.7 million compared to net interest expense of $1.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in interest income earned during the year ended December 31, 2016 was the result of an increase in our average investment portfolio balances, and a change in the mix of our investment portfolio, which previously included only investments in U.S. Treasury securities and now includes investments in certain investment-grade corporate debt securities.\nIncome Tax Benefit\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, we recorded a benefit from income taxes of approximately $0.4 million, which related to unanticipated refunds received and the reduction in our valuation allowances to reflect the income tax associated with unrealized gains in our investment portfolio. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we recorded a benefit for income taxes of approximately $16.8 million, which related to our tax losses for tax year 2015 and our ability to carry these losses back to 2014 to recapture a portion of the federal income tax payments we paid in 2014.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nSources of Liquidity\nSince inception, we have financed our operations primarily through private placements of our preferred stock, venture debt borrowings, funding we received under the Novo Agreement, our initial public offering of common stock, which we closed in September 2013, our follow-on public offering of common stock, which we closed in February 2014, and funds we received under the Novartis Agreement. In September 2013, we issued and sold an aggregate of 8,740,000 shares of common stock in our initial public offering at a public offering price of $22.00 per share. We received net proceeds from the initial public offering of $175.6 million. In February 2014, we issued and sold 1,900,000 shares of common stock and selling shareholders sold 728,571 shares of common stock in a follow-on public offering at a public offering price of $31.50 per share. We received net proceeds of $55.4 million from the follow-on offering. The Novo Agreement, which is described in more detail below, provided for financing of up to $125.0 million in the aggregate in return for the sale to Novo A/S of royalty interests in worldwide sales of Fovista. We received an aggregate of $125.0 million from this financing in separate tranches in May 2013, January 2014 and November 2014, which constitutes the full amount of funding under the Novo Agreement. In May 2013, we issued and sold an aggregate of 6,666,667 shares of our series C preferred stock at a price per share of $2.50, for an aggregate purchase price of $16.7 million. In August 2013, we issued and sold an aggregate of 13,333,333 additional shares of our series C preferred stock to the same purchasers at a price per share of $2.50, for an aggregate purchase price of $33.3 million.\nIn May 2014, we received an upfront payment of $200.0 million upon execution of the Novartis Agreement in connection with the grant of a license for the rights to commercialize Fovista outside the United States. In each of November 2014 and April 2015 we received payments of $50.0 million upon the achievement of two patient enrollment-based milestones, and in August 2016, $30.0 million upon the achievement of a third, and final, enrollment-based milestone, for an aggregate total of $130.0 million. In connection with the receipt of the upfront payment from Novartis, we made a milestone payment in June 2014 of approximately $19.8 million to Nektar Therapeutics, or Nektar, pursuant to a license, manufacturing and supply agreement that we agreed to terminate with Nektar in October 2017.\nCash Flows\nAs of December 31, 2017, we had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling $167.0 million and no debt. We primarily invest our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities in U.S. Treasury securities, money market funds and certain investment-grade corporate debt securities.\nThe following table shows a summary of our cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015:\nTable 302: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash (used in) provided by:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating Activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(121,821\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(108,596\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(78,531\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investing Activities\n</td> <td>154,792\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13,731\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>247,803\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Financing Activities\n</td> <td>71\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,934\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12,775\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net change in cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>33,042\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(87,931\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>182,047\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\nNet cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $121.8 million and relates primarily to net cash used for the wind-down of OPH1002 and OPH1003 and the Fovista Expansion Studies, implementation of a previously announced reduction in personnel and related costs, and cancellation fees related to manufacturing commitments, as well as continuation of our OPH1004 trial through initial, top-line data in August 2017 and wind-down thereafter and general and administrative and corporate infrastructure expense.\nNet cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $108.6 million and related primarily to net cash used to fund our Fovista Phase 3 program, our Fovista Expansion Studies, Fovista manufacturing activities, as well as manufacturing and clinical trial costs for our Zimura program and expenditures related to general and administrative expenses.\nSee \"-Funding Requirements\" below for a description of how we expect to use our cash for operating activities in future periods.\nCash Flows from Investing Activities\nNet cash provided by investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $154.8 million and relates primarily to proceeds from the maturities of marketable securities totaling $166.8 million offset by purchases of marketable securities totaling $12.0 million. Net cash provided by investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $13.7 million and relates primarily to proceeds from the maturity of marketable securities totaling $86.5 million offset by purchases of marketable securities totaling $72.2 million.\nCash Flows from Financing Activities\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $0.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 and $6.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 and related to the proceeds from stock option plan exercises and purchases made under our employee stock purchase plan.\nFunding Requirements\nOur product candidate Zimura is in clinical development. We expect to continue to incur significant research and development expenses as we pursue the development of Zimura as currently planned. We could also incur additional research and development expenses if we conclude that there is a scientific rationale for potentially developing, or if we undertake the development of Zimura in additional indications, beyond those already in development, and as we evaluate and potentially in-license or acquire, and undertake development of, additional product candidates, including any promising product candidates that emerge from our collaborative gene therapy research programs. Furthermore, if we successfully develop and obtain marketing approval for any of our product candidates, we expect to incur significant commercialization expenses related to product sales, marketing, distribution and manufacturing. We are party to an agreement with Archemix that imposes significant milestone payment obligations on us in connection with our achievement of specific clinical, regulatory and commercial milestones with respect to Zimura. It is likely that any future in-licensing or acquisition agreements that we enter into with respect to additional products, product candidates or technologies would include similar obligations.\nWe expect that we will continue to incur significant expenses as we:\nTable 303: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>continue the clinical development of Zimura as currently planned or potentially in other indications if we believe there is a sufficient scientific rationale to pursue such development;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 304: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>in-license or acquire the rights to, and pursue the development of, other products, product candidates or technologies;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 305: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>pursue our collaborative gene therapy research programs;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 306: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>maintain, expand and protect our intellectual property portfolio;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 307: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>hire additional clinical, manufacturing, quality control, quality assurance and scientific personnel, especially if we are successful in acquiring or in-licensing rights to additional products, product candidates or technologies or progressing the clinical development of any of our product candidates or if we decide to establish internal gene therapy capabilities;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 308: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>seek marketing approval for any product candidates that successfully complete clinical trials;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 309: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>expand our outsourced manufacturing activities or establish commercial operations or sales, marketing and distribution capabilities, if we receive, or expect to receive, marketing approval for any of our product candidates; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 310: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>expand our general and administrative functions to support future growth of the company.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> As of December 31, 2017, we had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $167.0 million, of which approximately $2.0 million is committed to satisfying our remaining financial obligations with respect to the wind-down of the Fovista Phase 3 trials and obligations incurred in connection with our reduction in personnel substantially completed during 2017. For 2018, we expect the cash required to fund our operations and capital expenditures, including our Zimura development programs and collaborative gene therapy research programs, as currently planned will range between $50.0 million and $55.0 million. We also had $137.5 million in total liabilities as of December 31, 2017, of which $125.0 million related to the Novo Agreement, which we are required to show as a liability on our balance sheets under generally accepted accounting principles but which does not correspond to any contractual repayment obligation.\nWe believe that our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities will be sufficient to fund our operations and capital expenditure requirements as currently planned for at least the next 12 months. This estimate does not reflect any additional expenditures resulting from additional sponsored research or the in-licensing or acquisition of additional product candidates or technologies or associated development that we may pursue following any such transactions. We have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could use our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect. Our capital requirements will depend on several factors, including the scope of any additional collaborative research programs, the success of our pursuit, by acquisition, in-licensing or otherwise, and subsequent development of additional product candidates or technologies, and the success of our ongoing development programs. We believe that we may need additional funding in the event that we acquire or in-license one or more additional product candidates and undertake development. In addition, our expenses may exceed our expectations if we experience delays in enrollment or with the availability of drug supply for our clinical trials, if we experience any unforeseen issues in our ongoing clinical trials or if we further expand the scope or size of our clinical trials and programs. Our costs may also exceed our expectations for other reasons, for example, if we experience issues with manufacturing or process development, or if we are required by the FDA, the EMA, or regulatory authorities in other jurisdictions to perform clinical or nonclinical trials or other studies in addition to those we currently expect to conduct. As a result, we may need or may seek to obtain additional funding in connection with our continuing operations sooner than expected.\nThe future development of our product candidates is highly uncertain. We expect the clinical development for Zimura will continue for at least the next several years. At this time, we cannot reasonably estimate the remaining costs necessary to complete clinical development, to complete process development and manufacturing scale-up and validation activities or to potentially seek marketing approval with respect to our product candidates.\nOur future capital requirements, therefore, will depend on many factors, including:\nTable 311: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the scope, costs and results of our ongoing Zimura clinical programs, as well as any additional clinical trials we undertake to obtain data sufficient to seek marketing approval for Zimura in any indication;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 312: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the extent to which we in-license or acquire rights to, and undertake research or development of products, product candidates or technologies, including any product candidate or other technologies we may evaluate as part of our collaborative gene therapy research programs;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 313: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the amount of any upfront, milestone payments and other financial obligations associated with the in-license or acquisition of other product candidates;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 314: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the scope, progress, results and costs of preclinical development and/or clinical trials for any other product candidates that we may develop;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 315: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the costs and timing of process development, manufacturing scale-up and validation activities and ongoing stability studies associated with Zimura or any other product candidates that we may develop;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 316: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>our ability to establish collaborations on favorable terms, if at all;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 317: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the costs, timing and outcome of regulatory reviews of our product candidates;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 318: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the costs of preparing, filing and prosecuting patent applications, maintaining and protecting our intellectual property rights and defending intellectual property-related claims;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 319: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the timing, scope and cost of commercialization activities for any of our product candidates if we receive, or expect to receive, marketing approval for a product candidate; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 320: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>subject to receipt of marketing approval, net revenue received from commercial sales of any of our product candidates, after milestone payments and royalty payments that we would be obligated to make.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> We do not have any committed external source of funds. Our future commercial revenues, if any, will be derived from sales of any of our product candidates that we are able to successfully develop, which may not be available for at least several years, if at all. In addition, if approved, our product candidates may not achieve commercial success. If that is the case, we will need to obtain substantial additional financing to achieve our business objectives. Even if we do achieve profitability, we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis.\nUntil such time, if ever, as we can generate substantial product revenues, we may need or may seek to finance our operations through a combination of equity offerings, debt financings, collaborations, strategic alliances and marketing, distribution or licensing arrangements.\nAdequate additional financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. If we are unable to raise additional funds when needed, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our product development or future commercialization efforts.\nIn addition, we may seek additional capital due to favorable market conditions or strategic considerations, even if we believe that we have sufficient funds for our current or future operating plans.\nTo the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, our existing stockholders' ownership interests would be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect their rights as a common stockholder. Debt financing and preferred equity financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends. If we raise additional funds through collaborations, strategic alliances or marketing, distribution or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams, products or product candidates or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. If we are unable to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings when needed, we may be required to grant rights to develop and market products or product candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market ourselves.\nLicensing and Commercialization Agreement with Novartis Pharma AG\nIn May 2014, we entered into a licensing and commercialization agreement with Novartis Pharma AG, which we refer to as the Novartis Agreement. Under the Novartis Agreement, we granted Novartis exclusive rights under specified patent rights, know-how and trademarks controlled by us to manufacture, from bulk API supplied by us, standalone Fovista products and products combining Fovista with an anti-VEGF agent to which Novartis has rights in a co-formulated product, for the treatment, prevention, cure or control of any human disease, disorder or condition of the eye, and to develop and commercialize those licensed products in all countries outside of the United States, which we refer to as the Novartis Territory.\nIn July 2017, we and Novartis entered into a letter agreement to streamline the process and timeline for evaluating data from the OPH1004 trial once it became available. The letter agreement provides Novartis with a fully paid-up, royalty-free license to use data from the Lucentis monotherapy arms of our Phase 2b OPH1001 trial and Phase 3 OPH1002 and OPH1003 trials in the Novartis Territory in connection with the development, manufacturing and commercialization of Novartis-controlled anti-VEGF products. The Lucentis study data license shall continue until the fifth anniversary of the letter agreement or the date the Novartis Agreement expires or terminates, whichever is later. On October 23, 2017, following the failure of the Phase 3 Fovista program and pursuant to the terms of the Letter Agreement, Novartis elected to terminate the Novartis Agreement with immediate effect.\nNovartis paid us a $200.0 million upfront fee upon execution of the Novartis Agreement. Novartis also paid us $50.0 million upon the achievement of each of two patient enrollment-based milestones, and $30.0 million upon the achievement of a third, and final, enrollment-based milestone, for an aggregate of $130.0 million.\nRoyalty Financing Agreement with Novo A/S\nIn May 2013, we entered into the Novo Agreement, pursuant to which we had the ability to obtain financing in three tranches in an amount of up to $125.0 million in return for the sale to Novo A/S of aggregate royalties of a mid-single-digit\npercentage on worldwide sales of Fovista, with the royalty percentage determined by the amount of funding provided by Novo A/S. The three tranches of financing, in which Novo A/S purchased three low single-digit royalty interests and paid us $125.0 million in the aggregate, closed in May 2013, January 2014 and November 2014.\nThe royalty payment period begins on the commercial launch of Fovista and ends, on a country-by-country basis, on the latest to occur of the twelfth anniversary of the commercial launch of Fovista, the expiration of certain patent rights covering Fovista, and the expiration of regulatory exclusivity for Fovista, in each applicable country. Royalty payments will be payable quarterly in arrears during the royalty period. Our obligations under the Novo Agreement may also apply to certain other anti-PDGF, products we may develop.\nWe used a portion of the proceeds that we initially received under the Novo Agreement to repay in full an aggregate of $14.4 million of outstanding principal, interest and fees under our venture debt facility and used the remaining proceeds to support clinical development and regulatory activities for Fovista and for general corporate expenses.\nThe Novo Agreement requires the establishment by Novo A/S and us of a joint oversight committee in relation to the development of Fovista in the event that Novo A/S does not continue to have a representative on our board of directors. The Novo Agreement also contains customary representations and warranties, as well as certain covenants relating to the operation of our business, including covenants requiring us to use commercially reasonable efforts to complete the Phase 3 development of Fovista, to file, prosecute and maintain certain patent rights and, in our reasonable judgment, to pursue claims of infringement of our intellectual property rights. The Novo Agreement also places certain restrictions on our business, including restrictions on our ability to grant security interests in our intellectual property to third parties, to sell, transfer or out-license intellectual property, or to grant others rights to receive royalties on sales of Fovista and certain other products. We reimbursed Novo A/S for specified legal and other expenses and are required to provide Novo A/S with certain continuing information rights. We have agreed to indemnify Novo A/S and its representatives with respect to certain matters, including with respect to any third-party infringement or product liability claims relating to our products. Our obligations under the Novo agreement are secured by a lien on certain of our intellectual property and other rights related to Fovista and other anti-PDGF products we may develop.\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nThe following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2017:\nTable 321: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Payments Due by Period\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Less than\n1 year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1 - 3 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3 - 5 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>More than\n5 years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating Leases (1)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>951\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>895\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>56\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Severance and Other Employee Benefits (2)\n</td> <td>2,529\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,529\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total (3)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,480\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,424\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>56\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 322: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 323: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>The table above includes our continuing rent obligations through February 2020.

For a description of these obligations, see our definitive proxy statement on Schedule 14A for our 2017 annual meeting of stockholders, as filed with the SEC on April 24, 2017.\nIn addition, in the course of normal business operations, we have agreements with contract service providers to assist in the performance of our research and development and manufacturing activities. Expenditures to CROs and CMOs represent significant costs in clinical development. Subject to required notice periods and our obligations under binding purchase orders, we can elect to discontinue the work under these agreements at any time.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with our financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business and related financing, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties and should be read together with the \"Risk Factors\" section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis.\nOverview\nWe are a science-driven biopharmaceutical company specializing in the development of novel therapies to treat ophthalmic diseases, with a focus on age-related and orphan retinal diseases. Our multi-track strategy is to leverage our clinical experience and retina expertise to develop therapies for large market, age-related retinal diseases, where unmet medical needs remain for these patients, and for orphan eye diseases with a focus on underserved patients, and to utilize a disciplined business development approach to obtain additional products, product candidates and technologies in these disease areas. We believe that there are advantages to pursuing drug development for orphan indications, including the potential for regulatory exclusivity, the potential for clinical trials with smaller sample sizes and the potential for accelerated development timelines. Our team has significant ophthalmic drug development experience and deep relationships with global ophthalmology thought leaders. We have an extensive network of ophthalmic clinical trial sites, having worked with over 250 sites worldwide. We believe that the combination of these factors, together with our experience in designing and executing IND-enabling studies and clinical trials for eye diseases, and specifically back of the eye diseases, provide us a competitive advantage.\nWe are developing Zimura\u00ae (avacincaptad pegol), our complement C5 inhibitor, for dry and wet forms of age-related macular degeneration, or AMD, which is a disorder of the central portion of the retina, known as the macula, that may result in loss of central vision, and autosomal recessive Stargardt disease, or STDG1, which is an orphan inherited retinal disease that also may result in loss of central and peripheral vision. In connection with our Stargardt clinical trial, which we recently initiated, we have expanded our network of thought leaders and clinical trial sites for orphan ophthalmic indications to include leading research university hospitals around the world, where patients with orphan retinal diseases are often referred.\nWe are actively engaged in extensive business development efforts to identify, evaluate and potentially obtain rights to and develop additional therapeutic and gene therapy product candidates that would complement our strategic goals and leverage our competitive advantages. We believe that our strategy will provide multiple potential opportunities to bring ophthalmic therapies to market.\nZimura\nBased on our Zimura development experience to date, as well as scientific literature in the field, we believe there is a strong rationale to pursue the development of our C5 complement inhibitor, Zimura, in multiple ophthalmic diseases. Zimura is a chemically-synthesized, pegylated RNA aptamer. Aptamers are short molecules made up of a single stranded nucleic acid sequence or an amino acid sequence that bind molecular targets with high selectivity and specificity. We have multiple clinical development programs for Zimura ongoing or planned to initiate by the end of 2018. Our ongoing and planned clinical trials for Zimura, all of which are designed to obtain data to guide potential future development efforts, include the following:\n \u2022 OPH2003 (geographic atrophy (GA) secondary to dry AMD): an ongoing, randomized, double-masked, sham controlled, multi-center Phase 2b clinical trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of Zimura monotherapy in patients with geographic atrophy, or GA, secondary to dry AMD. GA, the end stage of dry AMD, is a disease characterized by retinal cell death and degeneration of retinal tissue. \n \u2022 OPH2007 (wet AMD): an ongoing, randomized, dose-ranging, open-label, multi-center Phase 2a clinical trial of Zimura in combination with the anti-vascular endothelial growth factor, or anti-VEGF, agent Lucentis\u00ae (ranibizumab) for the treatment of wet AMD in patients who have not previously been treated with anti-VEGF agents, referred to as treatment-na\u00efve patients. Wet AMD is characterized by the presence and growth of abnormal new blood vessels under and through the retina. \n \u2022 OPH2006 (IPCV): an ongoing, randomized, dose-ranging, open-label Phase 2a clinical trial of Zimura in combination with the anti-VEGF agent Eylea\u00ae (aflibercept) for the treatment of idiopathic polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy, or IPCV, in patients who have not responded to Eylea monotherapy. IPCV is an age-related retinal \ndisease involving the choroidal vasculature characterized by the presence of polypoidal lesions, which leads to vision loss. We are at a very early stage of site initiation and patient recruitment for this trial.\n \u2022 OPH2005 (autosomal recessive Stargardt disease (STGD1)): an ongoing, randomized, double-masked, sham controlled, multi-center Phase 2b clinical trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of Zimura monotherapy for the treatment of autosomal recessive Stargardt disease, referred to as STGD1. We are at a very early stage of patient recruitment for this trial. \n \u2022 Non-infectious intermediate and posterior uveitis: a planned open-label Phase 2a clinical trial of Zimura monotherapy for the treatment of non-infectious intermediate and posterior uveitis, a rare inflammatory disease of the back of the eye. \nSee \"Business-Zimura\" for additional information regarding each of our ongoing or planned clinical trials.\nOn-going Business Development and Pipeline Expansion Activities\nSince early 2017, we have been engaged in extensive business development efforts. Without limiting any option, the principal focus of this plan, based on our deep expertise and experience in ophthalmic drug development, has been to actively explore obtaining rights to additional products, product candidates and technologies to treat ophthalmic diseases, particularly those in the back of the eye. We evaluated a large number of assets and platforms during 2017 and continue to actively review assets, platforms and other compelling ophthalmology opportunities that would complement our strategic goals. We have considered multiple opportunities over the last several months, including in-licensing, obtaining rights to products, product candidates or technologies, acquisitions, mergers and reverse mergers. Our selection criteria are based on several factors. In general, we are looking for:\n \u2022 compelling science; \n \u2022 an identified unmet medical need based on the current standard of care; \n \u2022 a meaningful commercial opportunity based on existing treatment options and treatment options known to be in development; and \n \u2022 areas where we believe we can apply our competitive advantages. \nBased on our work to date, among the novel technologies we have evaluated, we believe that gene therapy solutions may be particularly well-suited for our strategy as potential treatments for both orphan and age-related eye diseases. We remain committed to being opportunistic and will consider other compelling opportunities that may emerge.\nGene Therapy Research Programs\nIn February 2018, we announced that an element of our strategy will include initiating collaborative gene therapy programs focused on discovering and developing novel gene therapy technologies to treat retinal diseases. We intend to investigate promising gene therapy product candidates through collaborations with leading companies and academic and research institutions in the United States and internationally.\nFor our first gene therapy research collaboration, we have entered into a series of sponsored research agreements with the University of Massachusetts Medical School, or UMMS, and its Horae Gene Therapy Center to utilize their novel gene delivery technologies and \"minigene\" therapy approach to target retinal diseases. AAV vectors are generally limited as a delivery vehicle by the size of their genetic cargo, which is restricted to approximately 4,700 base pairs of genetic code. The use of \"minigenes\" as a novel therapeutic strategy seeks to deliver a shortened but still functional form of a larger gene packaged into a standard-size AAV delivery vector. The \"minigene\" strategy may offer an innovative solution for diseases that would otherwise be difficult to address through conventional AAV gene replacement therapy where the size of the gene of interest exceeds the transgene packaging capacity of conventional AAV vectors. Furthermore, one of the differentiating advantages of the \"minigene\" approach is that it could potentially provide a treatment that is independent of the specific mutation a patient has. The scope of the UMMS collaboration addresses Leber Congenital Amaurosis type 10, or LCA10, which is the most common type of LCA and is caused by mutations in the CEP290 gene, and STDG1, which is caused by mutations in the ABCA4 gene. LCA10 and STDG1 are both orphan inherited degenerative retinal diseases that lead to vision loss without any FDA or EMA approved treatment. As a condition of each sponsored research agreement, UMMS has granted\nus an option to obtain an exclusive license to any patents or patent applications that result from the sponsored research. Our aggregate financial commitment for the sponsored research agreements is in the low, single-digit millions of dollars.\nRemaining Fovista Activities\nIn December 2016 and August 2017, we received initial top-line data from our three pivotal clinical trials, referred to as OPH1002, OPH1003 and OPH1004, evaluating the anti-platelet derived growth factor, or anti-PDGF, aptamer Fovista\u00ae (pegpleranib) administered in combination with anti-VEGF agents for the treatment of wet AMD, indicating that these trials failed to achieve their pre-specified primary endpoints. We have terminated these trials, as well as several other smaller Fovista trials in wet AMD, which we have referred to as the Fovista Expansion Studies. The National Eye Institute and an academic pre-clinical program are evaluating various uses of Fovista for the treatment of retinal capillary hemangiomas associated with the orphan disease Von-Hippel-Lindau Syndrome, and for the treatment of retinoblastoma, a rare cancer of the eye in children, respectively. We have completed our commitments to these two programs, which primarily involved providing Fovista drug product and drug substance that we had on hand for use in the studies.\nTherefore, we do not currently expect any development activity for Fovista going forward, as we have no intentions to resume development of Fovista in wet AMD and our supply commitments for the two external studies are complete.\nNovartis Agreement\nIn May 2014, we entered into a licensing and commercialization agreement with Novartis Pharma AG, or Novartis, which we refer to as the Novartis Agreement. Under the Novartis Agreement, we granted Novartis exclusive rights under specified patent rights, know-how and trademarks controlled by us to manufacture, from bulk active pharmaceutical ingredient, or API, supplied by us, standalone Fovista products and products combining Fovista with an anti-VEGF agent to which Novartis has rights in a co-formulated product, for the treatment, prevention, cure or control of any human disease, disorder or condition of the eye, and to develop and commercialize those licensed products in all countries outside of the United States, which we refer to as the Novartis Territory. We agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to complete our pivotal Phase 3 clinical program for Fovista and Novartis agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop a standalone Fovista product and a co-formulated product containing Fovista and an anti-VEGF agent to which Novartis has rights, as well as a pre-filled syringe presentation of such products and to use commercially reasonable efforts, subject to obtaining marketing approval, to commercialize licensed products in the Novartis Territory in accordance with agreed development and marketing plans. Novartis paid us a $200.0 million upfront fee upon execution of the Novartis Agreement, as well as $50.0 million upon the achievement of each of two patient enrollment-based milestones, and $30.0 million upon the achievement of a third, and final, enrollment-based milestone, for an aggregate of $330.0 million. In July 2017, we and Novartis entered into a letter agreement to streamline the process and timeline for evaluating data from the final Fovista Phase 3 clinical trial once it became available. On October 23, 2017, following the failure of the Phase 3 Fovista program and pursuant to the terms of the July 2017 letter agreement, Novartis elected to terminate the Novartis Agreement with immediate effect.\nFinancial matters\nAs of December 31, 2017, we had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $167.0 million, of which approximately $2.0 million is committed to satisfying our remaining financial obligations with respect to the wind-down of the Fovista Phase 3 trials and obligations incurred in connection with our reduction in personnel, which was substantially completed during 2017. For 2018, we expect the cash required to fund our operations and capital expenditures, including our Zimura development programs and collaborative gene therapy research programs, as currently planned will range between $50.0 million and $55.0 million.\nAs a result of our ongoing reassessment of our development programs and potential business development opportunities and pipeline expansion activities, we may modify, expand or terminate some or all of our research or development programs or clinical trials at any time. The outcome of these reassessments, as well as the progress of our plans to potentially acquire additional products, product candidates or technologies will determine whether and to what extent we will continue to incur research and development costs for each of our development programs going forward.\nOur ability to become and remain profitable depends on our ability to generate revenue in excess of our expenses. We do not expect to generate significant product revenue unless, and until, we obtain marketing approval for, and commercialize, any of our product candidates, which, if we are successful, will likely take at least several years. We may be unsuccessful in our efforts to develop and commercialize these product candidates. Even if we succeed in developing and commercializing one or more of our product candidates, we may never achieve sufficient sales revenue to achieve or maintain\nprofitability. Our capital requirements will also depend on many other factors, including whether we are successful in our pursuit to acquire or in-license and subsequently develop additional product candidates or technologies. We may need to obtain substantial additional funding in connection with our continuing operations. If we are unable to raise capital when needed or on attractive terms, we could be forced to delay, reduce or eliminate our research and development programs or any future commercialization efforts.\nFinancial Operations Overview\nRevenue\nIn May 2014, we entered into the Novartis Agreement, which is described below under \"-Liquidity and Capital Resources-Licensing and Commercialization Agreement with Novartis Pharma AG.\" We used the relative selling price method to allocate arrangement consideration to our performance obligations under the Novartis Agreement. Upon entry into the Novartis Agreement, we received an upfront payment of $200.0 million, which was not previously recorded as revenue due to our right to terminate the agreement in the event that the parties were prevented from materially progressing the development or commercialization of Fovista products for a specified period as a result of specified governmental actions and the associated termination fee equivalent to the entire $200.0 million upfront payment, which we would have been required to pay if we elected to exercise this termination option. In each of September 2014 and March 2015, we achieved a $50.0 million enrollment-based milestone, and in June 2016, we achieved a $30.0 million enrollment-based milestone, for an aggregate total of $130.0 million, under the Novartis Agreement. In July 2017, we entered into a letter agreement with Novartis, which resulted in the recognition of the remaining deferred revenue under the Novartis Agreement during the third quarter of 2017, as described below under \"Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates-Revenue Recognition-Collaboration Revenue\". The recognition of this revenue during the period did not impact our cash balance. Below is a summary of the components of our collaboration revenue for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015:\n\nOn October 23, 2017, following the failure of the Fovista Phase 3 program and pursuant to the terms of the July 2017 letter agreement, Novartis elected to terminate the Novartis Agreement with immediate effect. As we have no products approved for sale, we will not receive any revenue from any product candidates that we develop until we obtain regulatory approval and commercialize such products, or until we potentially enter into agreements with third parties for the development and commercialization of product candidates. If our development efforts for any of our product candidates result in regulatory approval or we enter into collaboration agreements with third parties, we may generate revenue from product sales or from such third parties.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nResearch and development expenses primarily consist of costs associated with the development and clinical testing and manufacturing of Zimura and, historically, Fovista, as well as costs associated with the preclinical development of other product candidates and formulations. Our research and development expenses consist of:\n \u2022 external research and development expenses incurred under arrangements with third parties, such as contract research organizations, or CROs, and other vendors and contract manufacturing organizations, or CMOs, for the production of API and drug product; and \n \u2022 employee-related expenses, including salaries, benefits and share-based compensation expense. \nResearch and development expenses also include costs of acquired product licenses and related technology rights where there is no alternative future use, costs of prototypes used in research and development, consultant fees and amounts paid to collaborative partners. We expect that research and development expenses in the future will also include the costs of our\ncollaborative gene therapy research programs, including the costs of our research collaboration with UMMS, entered into in February 2018.\nAll research and development expenses are charged to operations as incurred in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification Topic, or ASC, 730, Research and Development. We account for non-refundable advance payments for goods and services that will be used in future research and development activities as expenses when the service has been performed or when the goods have been received, rather than when the payment is made. To date, the large majority of our research and development activity has been related to Fovista and Zimura. We do not currently utilize a formal time allocation system to capture expenses on a project-by-project basis because we record expenses by functional department. Accordingly, we do not allocate expenses to individual projects or product candidates, although we do allocate some portion of our research and development expenses by functional area and by compound, as shown below.\nThe following table summarizes our research and development expenses for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015: \nWe expect to continue to incur significant research and development expenses as we pursue the development of Zimura as currently planned. We also expect very limited research and development expenses related to Fovista in the future, as we have terminated our Fovista development programs and have no plans for the future development of Fovista. As we pursue our ongoing and planned Zimura development programs, or as we commence any new development efforts in relation to additional product candidates we may in-license or acquire as we pursue our business plan, we expect that our overall research and development expenses will begin to increase from the current level of expenditure.\nOur expenses may exceed our expectations if we experience delays in enrollment or with the availability of drug supply for our clinical trials, if we experience any unforeseen issue in our ongoing clinical trials or if we further expand the scope of our collaborative research programs or clinical trials. Our costs may also exceed our expectations for other reasons, for example, if we experience issues with process development, establishing or scaling-up of manufacturing activities or activities to enable and qualify second source suppliers or if we decide to increase licensing or preclinical research and development activities, including by building internal capabilities or pursuing internal research efforts.\nThe future development of our product candidates is highly uncertain. We expect the clinical development for Zimura will continue for at least the next several years. At this time, we cannot reasonably estimate the remaining costs necessary to complete clinical development, to complete process development and manufacturing scale-up and validation activities or to potentially seek marketing approval with respect to our product candidates.\nThe successful development of our product candidates is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties associated with developing drugs, including the uncertainty of:\n \u2022 the scope, rate of progress and expense of our research and development activities; \n \u2022 the potential benefits of our product candidates over other therapies; \n \u2022 clinical trial results; \n \u2022 the terms and timing of regulatory approvals; \n \u2022 our ability to market, commercialize and achieve market acceptance for any of our product candidates; and \n \u2022 our ability to successfully file, prosecute, defend and enforce patent claims and other intellectual property rights, together with associated expenses. \nA change in the outcome of any of these variables with respect to the development of our product candidates could mean a significant change in the costs and timing associated with the development of that product candidate. For example, if regulatory authorities were to require us to conduct clinical trials beyond those that we currently anticipate will be required for the completion of clinical development of a product candidate or if we experience significant delays in enrollment in any clinical trials, we could be required to expend significant additional financial resources and time on the completion of clinical development.\nSee the Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d section on page 92 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information regarding our current and future financial resources and our expectations regarding our research and development expenses and funding requirements.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related costs for personnel, including share-based compensation expense, in our executive, legal, finance, human resources, investor relations and business development functions. Other general and administrative expenses include facility costs and professional fees for legal, patent, pre-launch commercialization activities, travel expenses, consulting and accounting services.\nWe anticipate that our general and administrative expenses will decrease in future periods as a result of a reduction in personnel to focus on our revised business plan, which we expect will involve a total expected workforce of approximately 40 employees. We substantially completed the reduction in personnel during 2017 as part of implementing our revised business plan.\nInterest Income\nOur cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities are invested primarily in money market funds, U.S. Treasury securities and investment-grade corporate debt securities, which generate a nominal amount of interest income.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates\nOur management's discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements, which we have prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our financial statements. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and judgments, including those related to accrued research and development expenses, revenue recognition, share-based compensation and income taxes described in greater detail below. We base our estimates on our limited historical experience, known trends and events and various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nOur significant accounting policies are described in more detail in the notes to our financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Of those policies, we believe that the following accounting policies are the most critical to aid our stockholders in fully understanding and evaluating our financial condition and results of operations.\nAccrued Research and Development Expenses\nAs part of the process of preparing our financial statements, we are required to estimate our accrued expenses. This process involves reviewing quotations and contracts, identifying services that have been performed on our behalf and estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred for the service when we have not yet been invoiced or otherwise notified of the actual cost. The majority of our service providers invoice us monthly in arrears for services performed or when contractual milestones are met. We make estimates of our accrued expenses as of each balance sheet date in our financial statements based on facts and circumstances known to us at that time. We periodically confirm the accuracy of our estimates with the service providers and make adjustments if necessary. The significant estimates in our accrued research and development expenses are related to expenses incurred with respect to CROs, CMOs and other vendors in connection with research and development and manufacturing activities.\nWe base our expenses related to CROs and CMOs on our estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to quotations and contracts with such vendors that conduct research and development and manufacturing activities on our behalf. The financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation, vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows. There may be instances in which payments made to our vendors will exceed the level of services provided and result in a prepayment of the applicable research and development or manufacturing expense. In accruing service fees, we estimate the time period over which services will be performed and the level of effort to be expended in each period. If the actual timing of the performance of services or the level of effort varies from our estimate, we adjust the accrual or prepaid expense accordingly. Although we do not expect our estimates to be materially different from amounts actually incurred, our understanding of the status and timing of services performed relative to the actual status and timing of services performed may vary and could result in us reporting amounts that are too high or too low in any particular period. There have been no material changes in estimates for the periods presented.\nRevenue Recognition-Collaboration Revenue\nIn May 2014, we received an upfront payment of $200.0 million in connection with our entry into the Novartis Agreement, which was not recorded as revenue due to the existence of a contingency with respect to our right to terminate the agreement in certain circumstances and the associated termination fee equivalent to the entire $200.0 million upfront payment, which we would have been required to pay if we elected to exercise this termination option. In each of September 2014 and March 2015, we achieved a $50.0 million enrollment-based milestone, and in June 2016, we achieved a $30.0 million enrollment-based milestone, for an aggregate total of $130.0 million in milestones, under the Novartis Agreement. We used the relative selling price method to allocate these payments to contract deliverables based on our performance obligations under the Novartis Agreement.\nThe July 2017 letter agreement with Novartis resolved the contingency with respect to our termination right, allowing us to immediately recognize as revenue the portion of the upfront payment allocated using the relative selling price method to deliverables completed during prior periods. During the third quarter of 2017, we completed the remaining deliverables under the Novartis Agreement and the July 2017 letter agreement and recognized as revenue the balance of all of the payments previously received from Novartis related to licensing, research and development, manufacturing and joint operating committee activities that had been previously deferred using the relative selling price method. In total, during the third quarter of 2017, we recognized $206.7 million in previously deferred collaboration revenue in connection with the Novartis Agreement. The recognition of this revenue during the period did not impact our cash balance. On October 23, 2017, following the failure of the Fovista Phase 3 program and pursuant to the terms of the July 2017 letter agreement, Novartis elected to terminate the Novartis Agreement with immediate effect.\nBelow is a summary of the components of our collaboration revenue for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015:\n\nRoyalty Purchase Liability\nThe proceeds from the financing we received under our Fovista royalty financing agreement with Novo A/S, or the Novo Agreement, have been recorded as a liability on our Balance Sheet in accordance with ASC 730, Research and Development. Although there is no explicit repayment obligation contained in the Novo Agreement, because there was a significant related party relationship between us and Novo A/S at the time the Novo Agreement was entered into, we are treating our obligation to make royalty payments under the Novo Agreement as an implicit obligation to repay the funds advanced by Novo A/S, and thus have recorded the proceeds as a liability on our Balance Sheet. In the event that we make royalty payments to Novo A/S, we will reduce the liability balance. At the time that such royalty payments become probable and estimable, and if such amounts exceed the liability balance, we will impute interest accordingly on a prospective basis based on such estimates, which would result in a corresponding increase in the liability balance.\nShare-Based Compensation\nWe account for all share-based compensation payments issued to employees, non-employee directors, and consultants by estimating the fair value of each equity award. Accordingly, share-based compensation expense is measured based on the estimated fair value of the awards on the date of grant, net of forfeitures. We recognize compensation expense for the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest over the period during which the recipient renders the required services to us on a straight-line basis. In accordance with authoritative guidance, we re-measure the fair value of consultant share-based awards as the awards vest, and recognize the resulting value, if any, as expense during the period the related services are rendered.\nWe apply the fair value recognition provisions of ASC 718, Compensation-Stock Compensation. Determining the amount of share-based compensation to be recorded requires us to develop estimates of the fair value of stock options as of their grant date. We recognize share-based compensation expense ratably over the requisite service period, which in most cases is the vesting period of the award. For grants containing performance-based vesting provisions, expense is recognized over the estimated achievement period. Calculating the fair value of share-based awards requires that we make highly subjective assumptions.\nWe use the Black-Scholes option pricing model to value our stock option awards and the options to purchase shares under our employee stock purchase plan. Use of this valuation methodology requires that we make assumptions as to the volatility of our common stock, the expected term of our stock options, and the risk-free interest rate for a period that approximates the expected term of our stock options and the expected dividend yield of our common stock. As a recent public company, we do not have sufficient history to estimate the volatility of our common stock price or the expected life of the options. We calculate expected volatility based on reported data for similar publicly traded companies for which historical information is available and will continue to do so until the historical volatility of our common stock is sufficient to measure expected volatility for future option grants.\nWe use the simplified method as prescribed by the Securities and Exchange Commission Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 107, Share-Based Payment, to calculate the expected term of stock option grants to employees as we do not have sufficient historical exercise data to provide a reasonable basis upon which to estimate the expected term of stock options granted to employees. The risk-free interest rate used for each grant is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for instruments with a similar expected life. We utilize a dividend yield of zero based on the fact that we have never paid cash dividends and have no current intention to pay cash dividends. The weighted-average assumptions used to estimate grant date fair value of stock options using the Black-Scholes option pricing model were as follows for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015: \nWe estimate the fair value of restricted stock units, or RSUs, granted to employees using the closing market price of our common stock on the date of grant.\nWe also estimate forfeitures at the time of grant, and revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from our estimates. We use historical data to estimate pre-vesting forfeitures and record share-based compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest. To the extent that actual forfeitures differ from our estimates, the difference is recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period the estimates were revised.\nShare-based compensation expense for equity grants to employees, non-employee directors and consultants was $18.2 million, $31.7 million and $24.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. As of December 31, 2017, we had $20.7 million of total unrecognized share-based compensation expense, which we expect to recognize over a weighted-average remaining vesting period of approximately 2.4 years. We expect our share-based compensation expense for our equity awards to employees, non-employee directors and consultants to increase as a result of recognizing our existing unrecognized share-based compensation for awards that will vest and as we issue additional equity awards to attract and retain our employees.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, we allocated share-based compensation as follows: \nIncome Taxes\nOn December 22, 2017, the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, or the TCJA, was enacted reducing the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% effective for tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2018. As a result of the passage of the TCJA, the value of our deferred tax assets and related valuation allowance was reduced by a provisional amount of approximately $54.6 million. Additionally, under the TCJA, the Corporate Alternative Minimum Tax, or AMT, was repealed. Accordingly, our previously recorded AMT credits of approximately $3.5 million are now refundable over a four-year period beginning in 2018 and the previously recorded valuation allowance for these AMT credits has been reversed as a result of the TCJA during the fourth quarter of 2017.\nThe deferred tax assets associated with our losses incurred to date in 2017 have a full valuation allowance recorded against them due to our history of losses and the lack of other positive evidence to support future taxable income against which these losses could be applied. See Note 8 to our financial statements in Part IV-Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information regarding our expectations with respect to our income tax provision.\nWe are projecting a tax loss for 2017, none of which may be carried back to any prior taxable years. Although we recognized income under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, during 2017, this income is primarily due to the recognition of deferred income that had previously been recorded on our federal and state income tax returns. This recognition of income resulted in the reduction of a deferred tax asset that was completely offset by a previously recorded valuation allowance. With respect to the remaining deferred tax assets, except for the AMT credits previously discussed above, there was no change in the amount of assets realizable at December 31, 2017.\nResults of Operations\nComparison of Years Ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 \nCollaboration Revenue\nCollaboration revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $210.0 million, an increase of $159.1 million compared to $50.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Collaboration revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased as we completed all deliverables required under the Novartis Agreement during the period. The July 2017 letter\nagreement with Novartis resolved the contingency with respect to our right to terminate the agreement in the event that the parties were prevented from materially progressing the development or commercialization of Fovista products for a specified period as a result of specified governmental actions and the associated termination fee equivalent to the entire $200.0 million upfront payment, which we would have been required to pay if we elected to exercise this termination option. We had previously deferred the entire $200.0 million upfront payment based on this contingency. As a result of our entry into the letter agreement and resolution of the contingency, we immediately recognized the revenue attributable to deliverables completed during prior periods. Further, as our remaining deliverables under the Novartis Agreement and the letter agreement were completed during the third quarter of 2017, we recognized all of the remaining collaboration revenue previously deferred under the Novartis Agreement. Using the relative selling price method, we recognized $152.9 million related to the license we delivered to Novartis under the Novartis Agreement, $56.2 million related to the research and development activities we performed under the Novartis Agreement, $0.8 million related to Fovista API we previously transferred to Novartis, and $0.1 million related to our joint operating committee participation obligations.\nCollaboration revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $50.9 million, of which $22.9 million was allocated to the license delivered to Novartis under the Novartis Agreement, $9.7 million was allocated to research and development activities performed under the Novartis Agreement, $18.2 million related to Fovista API we transferred to Novartis, and a de minimis amount of revenue was associated with our joint operating committee participation obligation during the same period.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nOur research and development expenses were $66.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, a decrease of $130.0 million compared to $196.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Research and development expenses for the year ended December 31, 2017 include approximately $7.5 million in costs related to our previously announced reduction in personnel. The decrease in research and development expenses for the year ended December 31, 2017 was primarily due to a $107.1 million decrease in costs associated with our Fovista program, including our Fovista Phase 3 clinical program and our Fovista Expansion Studies, a $6.2 million decrease in professional services and consulting fees, and a $10.3 million decrease in share-based compensation costs. The decreased costs for our Fovista program included lower costs related to Fovista manufacturing activities and lower clinical trial costs as a result of the wind-down of OPH1002 and OPH1003 and the Fovista Expansion Studies. This overall decrease was offset by a $4.6 million increase associated with our Zimura program, primarily related to manufacturing expenses.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nOur general and administrative expenses were $35.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, a decrease of $14.5 million, compared to $50.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. General and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2017 include approximately $5.6 million in costs related to our previously announced reduction in force and the termination of facilities leases. The decrease in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to a decrease in costs to support our operations and infrastructure offset by the additional severance and lease termination costs.\nInterest Income\nInterest income for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $1.5 million compared to interest income of $1.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease in interest income earned during the year ended December 31, 2017 was the result of a decrease in our cash and cash equivalent balances available for investment.\nIncome Tax Benefit\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, we recorded a benefit from income taxes of approximately $4.7 million, which primarily related to a $3.5 million reduction in our valuation allowances for AMT credits to reflect the impact of the TCJA enactment and a settlement of a franchise tax audit for $1.4 million partially offset by the reversal of previously recoded benefits related to the change in unrealized gains of our investment portfolio. Although we had $109.5 million of net income before income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2017 as a result of the recognition of deferred revenue under the Novartis Agreement, we expect a net loss for tax purposes for 2017 with minimal taxes due. For tax purposes, we treated payments received under the Novartis Agreement as revenue at the time the payments were received and the related deferred tax assets had a full valuation recorded against them.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, we recorded a benefit from income taxes of approximately $0.4 million, which related to unanticipated refunds received and the reduction in our valuation allowances to reflect the income tax associated with unrealized gains in our investment portfolio.\nComparison of Years Ended December 31, 2016 and 2015\n\nCollaboration Revenue\nCollaboration revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016 was approximately $50.9 million. Using the relative selling price method, we allocated $22.9 million to the license delivered to Novartis under the Novartis Agreement, $9.7 million to research and development activities performed under the Novartis Agreement, $18.2 million related to the Fovista API we transferred to Novartis, and a de minimis amount of revenue associated with our joint operating committee participation obligation during the year ended December 31, 2016.\nCollaboration revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $51.5 million, of which $38.1 million was allocated to the license delivered to Novartis under the Novartis Agreement, $8.4 million was allocated to research and development activities performed under the Novartis Agreement and $5.0 million related to Fovista API we transferred to Novartis during the same period.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nOur research and development expenses were $196.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, an increase of $65.3 million compared to $131.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in research and development expenses for the year ended December 31, 2016 was primarily due to a $42.8 million increase in costs associated with our Fovista program, including our Fovista Phase 3 clinical program and our Fovista Expansion Studies. The increased costs for our Fovista program included higher clinical trial costs relating to increased patient enrollment in the Fovista Phase 3 clinical trials and the Fovista Expansion Studies, the initiation of additional Fovista Expansion Studies, as well as higher manufacturing costs to support our clinical trials and for API validation activities, and certain costs related to the cancellation of Fovista API purchase orders following our receipt of initial, top-line data from OPH1002 and OPH1003 in December 2016. Also contributing to the overall increase was a $10.9 million increase to personnel expenses associated with additional research and development staffing and a $4.8 million increase to share-based compensation costs. In addition, costs related to professional services and consulting fees increased by $6.1 million.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nOur general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2016 were $50.2 million, an increase of $6.2 million, compared to $44.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase was primarily due to an increase in personnel expenses of $2.6 million, including $2.1 million in share-based compensation costs, an increase of $2.8 million in facility costs, as well as other costs to support the expansion of our operations during 2016, including our public company infrastructure, and the early stages of a commercial organization. Also contributing to the increase were increased costs for professional services and consulting fees of $0.8 million.\nInterest Income\nInterest income for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $1.7 million compared to net interest expense of $1.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in interest income earned during the year ended December 31, 2016 was the result of an increase in our average investment portfolio balances, and a change in the mix of our investment portfolio, which previously included only investments in U.S. Treasury securities and now includes investments in certain investment-grade corporate debt securities.\nIncome Tax Benefit\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, we recorded a benefit from income taxes of approximately $0.4 million, which related to unanticipated refunds received and the reduction in our valuation allowances to reflect the income tax associated with unrealized gains in our investment portfolio. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we recorded a benefit for income taxes of approximately $16.8 million, which related to our tax losses for tax year 2015 and our ability to carry these losses back to 2014 to recapture a portion of the federal income tax payments we paid in 2014.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nSources of Liquidity\nSince inception, we have financed our operations primarily through private placements of our preferred stock, venture debt borrowings, funding we received under the Novo Agreement, our initial public offering of common stock, which we closed in September 2013, our follow-on public offering of common stock, which we closed in February 2014, and funds we received under the Novartis Agreement. In September 2013, we issued and sold an aggregate of 8,740,000 shares of common stock in our initial public offering at a public offering price of $22.00 per share. We received net proceeds from the initial public offering of $175.6 million. In February 2014, we issued and sold 1,900,000 shares of common stock and selling shareholders sold 728,571 shares of common stock in a follow-on public offering at a public offering price of $31.50 per share. We received net proceeds of $55.4 million from the follow-on offering. The Novo Agreement, which is described in more detail below, provided for financing of up to $125.0 million in the aggregate in return for the sale to Novo A/S of royalty interests in worldwide sales of Fovista. We received an aggregate of $125.0 million from this financing in separate tranches in May 2013, January 2014 and November 2014, which constitutes the full amount of funding under the Novo Agreement. In May 2013, we issued and sold an aggregate of 6,666,667 shares of our series C preferred stock at a price per share of $2.50, for an aggregate purchase price of $16.7 million. In August 2013, we issued and sold an aggregate of 13,333,333 additional shares of our series C preferred stock to the same purchasers at a price per share of $2.50, for an aggregate purchase price of $33.3 million.\nIn May 2014, we received an upfront payment of $200.0 million upon execution of the Novartis Agreement in connection with the grant of a license for the rights to commercialize Fovista outside the United States. In each of November 2014 and April 2015 we received payments of $50.0 million upon the achievement of two patient enrollment-based milestones, and in August 2016, $30.0 million upon the achievement of a third, and final, enrollment-based milestone, for an aggregate total of $130.0 million. In connection with the receipt of the upfront payment from Novartis, we made a milestone payment in June 2014 of approximately $19.8 million to Nektar Therapeutics, or Nektar, pursuant to a license, manufacturing and supply agreement that we agreed to terminate with Nektar in October 2017.\nCash Flows\nAs of December 31, 2017, we had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling $167.0 million and no debt. We primarily invest our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities in U.S. Treasury securities, money market funds and certain investment-grade corporate debt securities.\nThe following table shows a summary of our cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015:\n\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\nNet cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $121.8 million and relates primarily to net cash used for the wind-down of OPH1002 and OPH1003 and the Fovista Expansion Studies, implementation of a previously announced reduction in personnel and related costs, and cancellation fees related to manufacturing commitments, as well as continuation of our OPH1004 trial through initial, top-line data in August 2017 and wind-down thereafter and general and administrative and corporate infrastructure expense.\nNet cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $108.6 million and related primarily to net cash used to fund our Fovista Phase 3 program, our Fovista Expansion Studies, Fovista manufacturing activities, as well as manufacturing and clinical trial costs for our Zimura program and expenditures related to general and administrative expenses.\nSee \"-Funding Requirements\" below for a description of how we expect to use our cash for operating activities in future periods.\nCash Flows from Investing Activities\nNet cash provided by investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $154.8 million and relates primarily to proceeds from the maturities of marketable securities totaling $166.8 million offset by purchases of marketable securities totaling $12.0 million. Net cash provided by investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $13.7 million and relates primarily to proceeds from the maturity of marketable securities totaling $86.5 million offset by purchases of marketable securities totaling $72.2 million.\nCash Flows from Financing Activities\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $0.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 and $6.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 and related to the proceeds from stock option plan exercises and purchases made under our employee stock purchase plan.\nFunding Requirements\nOur product candidate Zimura is in clinical development. We expect to continue to incur significant research and development expenses as we pursue the development of Zimura as currently planned. We could also incur additional research and development expenses if we conclude that there is a scientific rationale for potentially developing, or if we undertake the development of Zimura in additional indications, beyond those already in development, and as we evaluate and potentially in-license or acquire, and undertake development of, additional product candidates, including any promising product candidates that emerge from our collaborative gene therapy research programs. Furthermore, if we successfully develop and obtain marketing approval for any of our product candidates, we expect to incur significant commercialization expenses related to product sales, marketing, distribution and manufacturing. We are party to an agreement with Archemix that imposes significant milestone payment obligations on us in connection with our achievement of specific clinical, regulatory and commercial milestones with respect to Zimura. It is likely that any future in-licensing or acquisition agreements that we enter into with respect to additional products, product candidates or technologies would include similar obligations.\nWe expect that we will continue to incur significant expenses as we:\n \u2022 continue the clinical development of Zimura as currently planned or potentially in other indications if we believe there is a sufficient scientific rationale to pursue such development; \n \u2022 in-license or acquire the rights to, and pursue the development of, other products, product candidates or technologies; \n \u2022 pursue our collaborative gene therapy research programs; \n \u2022 maintain, expand and protect our intellectual property portfolio; \n \u2022 hire additional clinical, manufacturing, quality control, quality assurance and scientific personnel, especially if we are successful in acquiring or in-licensing rights to additional products, product candidates or technologies or progressing the clinical development of any of our product candidates or if we decide to establish internal gene therapy capabilities; \n \u2022 seek marketing approval for any product candidates that successfully complete clinical trials; \n \u2022 expand our outsourced manufacturing activities or establish commercial operations or sales, marketing and distribution capabilities, if we receive, or expect to receive, marketing approval for any of our product candidates; and \n \u2022 expand our general and administrative functions to support future growth of the company.  As of December 31, 2017, we had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $167.0 million, of which approximately $2.0 million is committed to satisfying our remaining financial obligations with respect to the wind-down of the Fovista Phase 3 trials and obligations incurred in connection with our reduction in personnel substantially completed during 2017. For 2018, we expect the cash required to fund our operations and capital expenditures, including our Zimura development programs and collaborative gene therapy research programs, as currently planned will range between $50.0 million and $55.0 million. We also had $137.5 million in total liabilities as of December 31, 2017, of which $125.0 million related to the Novo Agreement, which we are required to show as a liability on our balance sheets under generally accepted accounting principles but which does not correspond to any contractual repayment obligation.\nWe believe that our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities will be sufficient to fund our operations and capital expenditure requirements as currently planned for at least the next 12 months. This estimate does not reflect any additional expenditures resulting from additional sponsored research or the in-licensing or acquisition of additional product candidates or technologies or associated development that we may pursue following any such transactions. We have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could use our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect. Our capital requirements will depend on several factors, including the scope of any additional collaborative research programs, the success of our pursuit, by acquisition, in-licensing or otherwise, and subsequent development of additional product candidates or technologies, and the success of our ongoing development programs. We believe that we may need additional funding in the event that we acquire or in-license one or more additional product candidates and undertake development. In addition, our expenses may exceed our expectations if we experience delays in enrollment or with the availability of drug supply for our clinical trials, if we experience any unforeseen issues in our ongoing clinical trials or if we further expand the scope or size of our clinical trials and programs. Our costs may also exceed our expectations for other reasons, for example, if we experience issues with manufacturing or process development, or if we are required by the FDA, the EMA, or regulatory authorities in other jurisdictions to perform clinical or nonclinical trials or other studies in addition to those we currently expect to conduct. As a result, we may need or may seek to obtain additional funding in connection with our continuing operations sooner than expected.\nThe future development of our product candidates is highly uncertain. We expect the clinical development for Zimura will continue for at least the next several years. At this time, we cannot reasonably estimate the remaining costs necessary to complete clinical development, to complete process development and manufacturing scale-up and validation activities or to potentially seek marketing approval with respect to our product candidates.\nOur future capital requirements, therefore, will depend on many factors, including:\n \u2022 the scope, costs and results of our ongoing Zimura clinical", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with our financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business and related financing, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties and should be read together with the \"Risk Factors\" section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis.\nOverview\nWe are a science-driven biopharmaceutical company specializing in the development of novel therapies to treat ophthalmic diseases, with a focus on age-related and orphan retinal diseases. Our multi-track strategy is to leverage our clinical experience and retina expertise to develop therapies for large market, age-related retinal diseases, where unmet medical needs remain for these patients, and for orphan eye diseases with a focus on underserved patients, and to utilize a disciplined business development approach to obtain additional products, product candidates and technologies in these disease areas. We believe that there are advantages to pursuing drug development for orphan indications, including the potential for regulatory exclusivity, the potential for clinical trials with smaller sample sizes and the potential for accelerated development timelines. Our team has significant ophthalmic drug development experience and deep relationships with global ophthalmology thought leaders. We have an extensive network of ophthalmic clinical trial sites, having worked with over 250 sites worldwide. We believe that the combination of these factors, together with our experience in designing and executing IND-enabling studies and clinical trials for eye diseases, and specifically back of the eye diseases, provide us a competitive advantage.\nWe are developing Zimura\u00ae (avacincaptad pegol), our complement C5 inhibitor, for dry and wet forms of age-related macular degeneration, or AMD, which is a disorder of the central portion of the retina, known as the macula, that may result in loss of central vision, and autosomal recessive Stargardt disease, or STDG1, which is an orphan inherited retinal disease that also may result in loss of central and peripheral vision. In connection with our Stargardt clinical trial, which we recently initiated, we have expanded our network of thought leaders and clinical trial sites for orphan ophthalmic indications to include leading research university hospitals around the world, where patients with orphan retinal diseases are often referred.\nWe are actively engaged in extensive business development efforts to identify, evaluate and potentially obtain rights to and develop additional therapeutic and gene therapy product candidates that would complement our strategic goals and leverage our competitive advantages. We believe that our strategy will provide multiple potential opportunities to bring ophthalmic therapies to market.\nZimura\nBased on our Zimura development experience to date, as well as scientific literature in the field, we believe there is a strong rationale to pursue the development of our C5 complement inhibitor, Zimura, in multiple ophthalmic diseases. Zimura is a chemically-synthesized, pegylated RNA aptamer. Aptamers are short molecules made up of a single stranded nucleic acid sequence or an amino acid sequence that bind molecular targets with high selectivity and specificity. We have multiple clinical development programs for Zimura ongoing or planned to initiate by the end of 2018. Our ongoing and planned clinical trials for Zimura, all of which are designed to obtain data to guide potential future development efforts, include the following:\n \u2022 OPH2003 (geographic atrophy (GA) secondary to dry AMD): an ongoing, randomized, double-masked, sham controlled, multi-center Phase 2b clinical trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of Zimura monotherapy in patients with geographic atrophy, or GA, secondary to dry AMD. GA, the end stage of dry AMD, is a disease characterized by retinal cell death and degeneration of retinal tissue. \n \u2022 OPH2007 (wet AMD): an ongoing, randomized, dose-ranging, open-label, multi-center Phase 2a clinical trial of Zimura in combination with the anti-vascular endothelial growth factor, or anti-VEGF, agent Lucentis\u00ae (ranibizumab) for the treatment of wet AMD in patients who have not previously been treated with anti-VEGF agents, referred to as treatment-na\u00efve patients. Wet AMD is characterized by the presence and growth of abnormal new blood vessels under and through the retina. \n \u2022 OPH2006 (IPCV): an ongoing, randomized, dose-ranging, open-label Phase 2a clinical trial of Zimura in combination with the anti-VEGF agent Eylea\u00ae (aflibercept) for the treatment of idiopathic polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy, or IPCV, in patients who have not responded to Eylea monotherapy. IPCV is an age-related retinal \ndisease involving the choroidal vasculature characterized by the presence of polypoidal lesions, which leads to vision loss. We are at a very early stage of site initiation and patient recruitment for this trial.\n \u2022 OPH2005 (autosomal recessive Stargardt disease (STGD1)): an ongoing, randomized, double-masked, sham controlled, multi-center Phase 2b clinical trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of Zimura monotherapy for the treatment of autosomal recessive Stargardt disease, referred to as STGD1. We are at a very early stage of patient recruitment for this trial. \n \u2022 Non-infectious intermediate and posterior uveitis: a planned open-label Phase 2a clinical trial of Zimura monotherapy for the treatment of non-infectious intermediate and posterior uveitis, a rare inflammatory disease of the back of the eye. \nSee \"Business-Zimura\" for additional information regarding each of our ongoing or planned clinical trials.\nOn-going Business Development and Pipeline Expansion Activities\nSince early 2017, we have been engaged in extensive business development efforts. Without limiting any option, the principal focus of this plan, based on our deep expertise and experience in ophthalmic drug development, has been to actively explore obtaining rights to additional products, product candidates and technologies to treat ophthalmic diseases, particularly those in the back of the eye. We evaluated a large number of assets and platforms during 2017 and continue to actively review assets, platforms and other compelling ophthalmology opportunities that would complement our strategic goals. We have considered multiple opportunities over the last several months, including in-licensing, obtaining rights to products, product candidates or technologies, acquisitions, mergers and reverse mergers. Our selection criteria are based on several factors. In general, we are looking for:\n \u2022 compelling science; \n \u2022 an identified unmet medical need based on the current standard of care; \n \u2022 a meaningful commercial opportunity based on existing treatment options and treatment options known to be in development; and \n \u2022 areas where we believe we can apply our competitive advantages. \nBased on our work to date, among the novel technologies we have evaluated, we believe that gene therapy solutions may be particularly well-suited for our strategy as potential treatments for both orphan and age-related eye diseases. We remain committed to being opportunistic and will consider other compelling opportunities that may emerge.\nGene Therapy Research Programs\nIn February 2018, we announced that an element of our strategy will include initiating collaborative gene therapy programs focused on discovering and developing novel gene therapy technologies to treat retinal diseases. We intend to investigate promising gene therapy product candidates through collaborations with leading companies and academic and research institutions in the United States and internationally.\nFor our first gene therapy research collaboration, we have entered into a series of sponsored research agreements with the University of Massachusetts Medical School, or UMMS, and its Horae Gene Therapy Center to utilize their novel gene delivery technologies and \"minigene\" therapy approach to target retinal diseases. AAV vectors are generally limited as a delivery vehicle by the size of their genetic cargo, which is restricted to approximately 4,700 base pairs of genetic code. The use of \"minigenes\" as a novel therapeutic strategy seeks to deliver a shortened but still functional form of a larger gene packaged into a standard-size AAV delivery vector. The \"minigene\" strategy may offer an innovative solution for diseases that would otherwise be difficult to address through conventional AAV gene replacement therapy where the size of the gene of interest exceeds the transgene packaging capacity of conventional AAV vectors. Furthermore, one of the differentiating advantages of the \"minigene\" approach is that it could potentially provide a treatment that is independent of the specific mutation a patient has. The scope of the UMMS collaboration addresses Leber Congenital Amaurosis type 10, or LCA10, which is the most common type of LCA and is caused by mutations in the CEP290 gene, and STDG1, which is caused by mutations in the ABCA4 gene. LCA10 and STDG1 are both orphan inherited degenerative retinal diseases that lead to vision loss without any FDA or EMA approved treatment. As a condition of each sponsored research agreement, UMMS has granted\nus an option to obtain an exclusive license to any patents or patent applications that result from the sponsored research. Our aggregate financial commitment for the sponsored research agreements is in the low, single-digit millions of dollars.\nRemaining Fovista Activities\nIn December 2016 and August 2017, we received initial top-line data from our three pivotal clinical trials, referred to as OPH1002, OPH1003 and OPH1004, evaluating the anti-platelet derived growth factor, or anti-PDGF, aptamer Fovista\u00ae (pegpleranib) administered in combination with anti-VEGF agents for the treatment of wet AMD, indicating that these trials failed to achieve their pre-specified primary endpoints. We have terminated these trials, as well as several other smaller Fovista trials in wet AMD, which we have referred to as the Fovista Expansion Studies. The National Eye Institute and an academic pre-clinical program are evaluating various uses of Fovista for the treatment of retinal capillary hemangiomas associated with the orphan disease Von-Hippel-Lindau Syndrome, and for the treatment of retinoblastoma, a rare cancer of the eye in children, respectively. We have completed our commitments to these two programs, which primarily involved providing Fovista drug product and drug substance that we had on hand for use in the studies.\nTherefore, we do not currently expect any development activity for Fovista going forward, as we have no intentions to resume development of Fovista in wet AMD and our supply commitments for the two external studies are complete.\nNovartis Agreement\nIn May 2014, we entered into a licensing and commercialization agreement with Novartis Pharma AG, or Novartis, which we refer to as the Novartis Agreement. Under the Novartis Agreement, we granted Novartis exclusive rights under specified patent rights, know-how and trademarks controlled by us to manufacture, from bulk active pharmaceutical ingredient, or API, supplied by us, standalone Fovista products and products combining Fovista with an anti-VEGF agent to which Novartis has rights in a co-formulated product, for the treatment, prevention, cure or control of any human disease, disorder or condition of the eye, and to develop and commercialize those licensed products in all countries outside of the United States, which we refer to as the Novartis Territory. We agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to complete our pivotal Phase 3 clinical program for Fovista and Novartis agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop a standalone Fovista product and a co-formulated product containing Fovista and an anti-VEGF agent to which Novartis has rights, as well as a pre-filled syringe presentation of such products and to use commercially reasonable efforts, subject to obtaining marketing approval, to commercialize licensed products in the Novartis Territory in accordance with agreed development and marketing plans. Novartis paid us a $200.0 million upfront fee upon execution of the Novartis Agreement, as well as $50.0 million upon the achievement of each of two patient enrollment-based milestones, and $30.0 million upon the achievement of a third, and final, enrollment-based milestone, for an aggregate of $330.0 million. In July 2017, we and Novartis entered into a letter agreement to streamline the process and timeline for evaluating data from the final Fovista Phase 3 clinical trial once it became available. On October 23, 2017, following the failure of the Phase 3 Fovista program and pursuant to the terms of the July 2017 letter agreement, Novartis elected to terminate the Novartis Agreement with immediate effect.\nFinancial matters\nAs of December 31, 2017, we had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $167.0 million, of which approximately $2.0 million is committed to satisfying our remaining financial obligations with respect to the wind-down of the Fovista Phase 3 trials and obligations incurred in connection with our reduction in personnel, which was substantially completed during 2017. For 2018, we expect the cash required to fund our operations and capital expenditures, including our Zimura development programs and collaborative gene therapy research programs, as currently planned will range between $50.0 million and $55.0 million.\nAs a result of our ongoing reassessment of our development programs and potential business development opportunities and pipeline expansion activities, we may modify, expand or terminate some or all of our research or development programs or clinical trials at any time. The outcome of these reassessments, as well as the progress of our plans to potentially acquire additional products, product candidates or technologies will determine whether and to what extent we will continue to incur research and development costs for each of our development programs going forward.\nOur ability to become and remain profitable depends on our ability to generate revenue in excess of our expenses. We do not expect to generate significant product revenue unless, and until, we obtain marketing approval for, and commercialize, any of our product candidates, which, if we are successful, will likely take at least several years. We may be unsuccessful in our efforts to develop and commercialize these product candidates. Even if we succeed in developing and commercializing one or more of our product candidates, we may never achieve sufficient sales revenue to achieve or maintain\nprofitability. Our capital requirements will also depend on many other factors, including whether we are successful in our pursuit to acquire or in-license and subsequently develop additional product candidates or technologies. We may need to obtain substantial additional funding in connection with our continuing operations. If we are unable to raise capital when needed or on attractive terms, we could be forced to delay, reduce or eliminate our research and development programs or any future commercialization efforts.\nFinancial Operations Overview\nRevenue\nIn May 2014, we entered into the Novartis Agreement, which is described below under \"-Liquidity and Capital Resources-Licensing and Commercialization Agreement with Novartis Pharma AG.\" We used the relative selling price method to allocate arrangement consideration to our performance obligations under the Novartis Agreement. Upon entry into the Novartis Agreement, we received an upfront payment of $200.0 million, which was not previously recorded as revenue due to our right to terminate the agreement in the event that the parties were prevented from materially progressing the development or commercialization of Fovista products for a specified period as a result of specified governmental actions and the associated termination fee equivalent to the entire $200.0 million upfront payment, which we would have been required to pay if we elected to exercise this termination option. In each of September 2014 and March 2015, we achieved a $50.0 million enrollment-based milestone, and in June 2016, we achieved a $30.0 million enrollment-based milestone, for an aggregate total of $130.0 million, under the Novartis Agreement. In July 2017, we entered into a letter agreement with Novartis, which resulted in the recognition of the remaining deferred revenue under the Novartis Agreement during the third quarter of 2017, as described below under \"Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates-Revenue Recognition-Collaboration Revenue\". The recognition of this revenue during the period did not impact our cash balance. Below is a summary of the components of our collaboration revenue for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015:\nTable 287: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>License revenue\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>152,912\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>22,937\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>38,083\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Research and development activity revenue\n</td> <td>56,180\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,741\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,378\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>API transfer revenue\n</td> <td>754\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18,212\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,020\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Joint operating committee revenue\n</td> <td>131\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total collaboration revenue\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>209,977\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>50,909\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>51,505\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOn October 23, 2017, following the failure of the Fovista Phase 3 program and pursuant to the terms of the July 2017 letter agreement, Novartis elected to terminate the Novartis Agreement with immediate effect. As we have no products approved for sale, we will not receive any revenue from any product candidates that we develop until we obtain regulatory approval and commercialize such products, or until we potentially enter into agreements with third parties for the development and commercialization of product candidates. If our development efforts for any of our product candidates result in regulatory approval or we enter into collaboration agreements with third parties, we may generate revenue from product sales or from such third parties.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nResearch and development expenses primarily consist of costs associated with the development and clinical testing and manufacturing of Zimura and, historically, Fovista, as well as costs associated with the preclinical development of other product candidates and formulations. Our research and development expenses consist of:\n \u2022 external research and development expenses incurred under arrangements with third parties, such as contract research organizations, or CROs, and other vendors and contract manufacturing organizations, or CMOs, for the production of API and drug product; and \n \u2022 employee-related expenses, including salaries, benefits and share-based compensation expense. \nResearch and development expenses also include costs of acquired product licenses and related technology rights where there is no alternative future use, costs of prototypes used in research and development, consultant fees and amounts paid to collaborative partners. We expect that research and development expenses in the future will also include the costs of our\ncollaborative gene therapy research programs, including the costs of our research collaboration with UMMS, entered into in February 2018.\nAll research and development expenses are charged to operations as incurred in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification Topic, or ASC, 730, Research and Development. We account for non-refundable advance payments for goods and services that will be used in future research and development activities as expenses when the service has been performed or when the goods have been received, rather than when the payment is made. To date, the large majority of our research and development activity has been related to Fovista and Zimura. We do not currently utilize a formal time allocation system to capture expenses on a project-by-project basis because we record expenses by functional department. Accordingly, we do not allocate expenses to individual projects or product candidates, although we do allocate some portion of our research and development expenses by functional area and by compound, as shown below.\nThe following table summarizes our research and development expenses for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015: Table 290: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fovista\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>21,698\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>129,661\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>86,906\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Zimura\n</td> <td>11,986\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,400\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,644\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Personnel-related\n</td> <td>19,413\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26,700\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15,830\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Share-based compensation\n</td> <td>11,114\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21,380\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16,608\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other\n</td> <td>2,078\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11,154\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,024\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>66,289\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>196,295\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>131,012\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe expect to continue to incur significant research and development expenses as we pursue the development of Zimura as currently planned. We also expect very limited research and development expenses related to Fovista in the future, as we have terminated our Fovista development programs and have no plans for the future development of Fovista. As we pursue our ongoing and planned Zimura development programs, or as we commence any new development efforts in relation to additional product candidates we may in-license or acquire as we pursue our business plan, we expect that our overall research and development expenses will begin to increase from the current level of expenditure.\nOur expenses may exceed our expectations if we experience delays in enrollment or with the availability of drug supply for our clinical trials, if we experience any unforeseen issue in our ongoing clinical trials or if we further expand the scope of our collaborative research programs or clinical trials. Our costs may also exceed our expectations for other reasons, for example, if we experience issues with process development, establishing or scaling-up of manufacturing activities or activities to enable and qualify second source suppliers or if we decide to increase licensing or preclinical research and development activities, including by building internal capabilities or pursuing internal research efforts.\nThe future development of our product candidates is highly uncertain. We expect the clinical development for Zimura will continue for at least the next several years. At this time, we cannot reasonably estimate the remaining costs necessary to complete clinical development, to complete process development and manufacturing scale-up and validation activities or to potentially seek marketing approval with respect to our product candidates.\nThe successful development of our product candidates is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties associated with developing drugs, including the uncertainty of:\n \u2022 the scope, rate of progress and expense of our research and development activities; \n \u2022 the potential benefits of our product candidates over other therapies; \n \u2022 clinical trial results; \n \u2022 the terms and timing of regulatory approvals; \n \u2022 our ability to market, commercialize and achieve market acceptance for any of our product candidates; and \n \u2022 our ability to successfully file, prosecute, defend and enforce patent claims and other intellectual property rights, together with associated expenses. \nA change in the outcome of any of these variables with respect to the development of our product candidates could mean a significant change in the costs and timing associated with the development of that product candidate. For example, if regulatory authorities were to require us to conduct clinical trials beyond those that we currently anticipate will be required for the completion of clinical development of a product candidate or if we experience significant delays in enrollment in any clinical trials, we could be required to expend significant additional financial resources and time on the completion of clinical development.\nSee the Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d section on page 92 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information regarding our current and future financial resources and our expectations regarding our research and development expenses and funding requirements.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related costs for personnel, including share-based compensation expense, in our executive, legal, finance, human resources, investor relations and business development functions. Other general and administrative expenses include facility costs and professional fees for legal, patent, pre-launch commercialization activities, travel expenses, consulting and accounting services.\nWe anticipate that our general and administrative expenses will decrease in future periods as a result of a reduction in personnel to focus on our revised business plan, which we expect will involve a total expected workforce of approximately 40 employees. We substantially completed the reduction in personnel during 2017 as part of implementing our revised business plan.\nInterest Income\nOur cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities are invested primarily in money market funds, U.S. Treasury securities and investment-grade corporate debt securities, which generate a nominal amount of interest income.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates\nOur management's discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements, which we have prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our financial statements. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and judgments, including those related to accrued research and development expenses, revenue recognition, share-based compensation and income taxes described in greater detail below. We base our estimates on our limited historical experience, known trends and events and various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nOur significant accounting policies are described in more detail in the notes to our financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Of those policies, we believe that the following accounting policies are the most critical to aid our stockholders in fully understanding and evaluating our financial condition and results of operations.\nAccrued Research and Development Expenses\nAs part of the process of preparing our financial statements, we are required to estimate our accrued expenses. This process involves reviewing quotations and contracts, identifying services that have been performed on our behalf and estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred for the service when we have not yet been invoiced or otherwise notified of the actual cost. The majority of our service providers invoice us monthly in arrears for services performed or when contractual milestones are met. We make estimates of our accrued expenses as of each balance sheet date in our financial statements based on facts and circumstances known to us at that time. We periodically confirm the accuracy of our estimates with the service providers and make adjustments if necessary. The significant estimates in our accrued research and development expenses are related to expenses incurred with respect to CROs, CMOs and other vendors in connection with research and development and manufacturing activities.\nWe base our expenses related to CROs and CMOs on our estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to quotations and contracts with such vendors that conduct research and development and manufacturing activities on our behalf. The financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation, vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows. There may be instances in which payments made to our vendors will exceed the level of services provided and result in a prepayment of the applicable research and development or manufacturing expense. In accruing service fees, we estimate the time period over which services will be performed and the level of effort to be expended in each period. If the actual timing of the performance of services or the level of effort varies from our estimate, we adjust the accrual or prepaid expense accordingly. Although we do not expect our estimates to be materially different from amounts actually incurred, our understanding of the status and timing of services performed relative to the actual status and timing of services performed may vary and could result in us reporting amounts that are too high or too low in any particular period. There have been no material changes in estimates for the periods presented.\nRevenue Recognition-Collaboration Revenue\nIn May 2014, we received an upfront payment of $200.0 million in connection with our entry into the Novartis Agreement, which was not recorded as revenue due to the existence of a contingency with respect to our right to terminate the agreement in certain circumstances and the associated termination fee equivalent to the entire $200.0 million upfront payment, which we would have been required to pay if we elected to exercise this termination option. In each of September 2014 and March 2015, we achieved a $50.0 million enrollment-based milestone, and in June 2016, we achieved a $30.0 million enrollment-based milestone, for an aggregate total of $130.0 million in milestones, under the Novartis Agreement. We used the relative selling price method to allocate these payments to contract deliverables based on our performance obligations under the Novartis Agreement.\nThe July 2017 letter agreement with Novartis resolved the contingency with respect to our termination right, allowing us to immediately recognize as revenue the portion of the upfront payment allocated using the relative selling price method to deliverables completed during prior periods. During the third quarter of 2017, we completed the remaining deliverables under the Novartis Agreement and the July 2017 letter agreement and recognized as revenue the balance of all of the payments previously received from Novartis related to licensing, research and development, manufacturing and joint operating committee activities that had been previously deferred using the relative selling price method. In total, during the third quarter of 2017, we recognized $206.7 million in previously deferred collaboration revenue in connection with the Novartis Agreement. The recognition of this revenue during the period did not impact our cash balance. On October 23, 2017, following the failure of the Fovista Phase 3 program and pursuant to the terms of the July 2017 letter agreement, Novartis elected to terminate the Novartis Agreement with immediate effect.\nBelow is a summary of the components of our collaboration revenue for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015:\nTable 297: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>License revenue\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>152,912\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>22,937\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>38,083\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Research and development activity revenue\n</td> <td>56,180\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,741\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,378\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>API transfer revenue\n</td> <td>754\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18,212\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,020\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Joint operating committee revenue\n</td> <td>131\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total collaboration revenue\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>209,977\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>50,909\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>51,505\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRoyalty Purchase Liability\nThe proceeds from the financing we received under our Fovista royalty financing agreement with Novo A/S, or the Novo Agreement, have been recorded as a liability on our Balance Sheet in accordance with ASC 730, Research and Development. Although there is no explicit repayment obligation contained in the Novo Agreement, because there was a significant related party relationship between us and Novo A/S at the time the Novo Agreement was entered into, we are treating our obligation to make royalty payments under the Novo Agreement as an implicit obligation to repay the funds advanced by Novo A/S, and thus have recorded the proceeds as a liability on our Balance Sheet. In the event that we make royalty payments to Novo A/S, we will reduce the liability balance. At the time that such royalty payments become probable and estimable, and if such amounts exceed the liability balance, we will impute interest accordingly on a prospective basis based on such estimates, which would result in a corresponding increase in the liability balance.\nShare-Based Compensation\nWe account for all share-based compensation payments issued to employees, non-employee directors, and consultants by estimating the fair value of each equity award. Accordingly, share-based compensation expense is measured based on the estimated fair value of the awards on the date of grant, net of forfeitures. We recognize compensation expense for the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest over the period during which the recipient renders the required services to us on a straight-line basis. In accordance with authoritative guidance, we re-measure the fair value of consultant share-based awards as the awards vest, and recognize the resulting value, if any, as expense during the period the related services are rendered.\nWe apply the fair value recognition provisions of ASC 718, Compensation-Stock Compensation. Determining the amount of share-based compensation to be recorded requires us to develop estimates of the fair value of stock options as of their grant date. We recognize share-based compensation expense ratably over the requisite service period, which in most cases is the vesting period of the award. For grants containing performance-based vesting provisions, expense is recognized over the estimated achievement period. Calculating the fair value of share-based awards requires that we make highly subjective assumptions.\nWe use the Black-Scholes option pricing model to value our stock option awards and the options to purchase shares under our employee stock purchase plan. Use of this valuation methodology requires that we make assumptions as to the volatility of our common stock, the expected term of our stock options, and the risk-free interest rate for a period that approximates the expected term of our stock options and the expected dividend yield of our common stock. As a recent public company, we do not have sufficient history to estimate the volatility of our common stock price or the expected life of the options. We calculate expected volatility based on reported data for similar publicly traded companies for which historical information is available and will continue to do so until the historical volatility of our common stock is sufficient to measure expected volatility for future option grants.\nWe use the simplified method as prescribed by the Securities and Exchange Commission Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 107, Share-Based Payment, to calculate the expected term of stock option grants to employees as we do not have sufficient historical exercise data to provide a reasonable basis upon which to estimate the expected term of stock options granted to employees. The risk-free interest rate used for each grant is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for instruments with a similar expected life. We utilize a dividend yield of zero based on the fact that we have never paid cash dividends and have no current intention to pay cash dividends. The weighted-average assumptions used to estimate grant date fair value of stock options using the Black-Scholes option pricing model were as follows for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015: Table 298: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Expected common stock price volatility\n</td> <td>81%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>71%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>72%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Risk-free interest rate\n</td> <td>1.82% - 2.38%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.14% - 2.37%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.35% - 2.24%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Expected term of options (years)\n</td> <td>6.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.2\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Expected dividend yield\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe estimate the fair value of restricted stock units, or RSUs, granted to employees using the closing market price of our common stock on the date of grant.\nWe also estimate forfeitures at the time of grant, and revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from our estimates. We use historical data to estimate pre-vesting forfeitures and record share-based compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest. To the extent that actual forfeitures differ from our estimates, the difference is recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period the estimates were revised.\nShare-based compensation expense for equity grants to employees, non-employee directors and consultants was $18.2 million, $31.7 million and $24.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. As of December 31, 2017, we had $20.7 million of total unrecognized share-based compensation expense, which we expect to recognize over a weighted-average remaining vesting period of approximately 2.4 years. We expect our share-based compensation expense for our equity awards to employees, non-employee directors and consultants to increase as a result of recognizing our existing unrecognized share-based compensation for awards that will vest and as we issue additional equity awards to attract and retain our employees.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, we allocated share-based compensation as follows: Table 299: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Research and development\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>11,114\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>21,380\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>16,608\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General and administrative\n</td> <td>7,057\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,280\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,152\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>18,171\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>31,660\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>24,760\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIncome Taxes\nOn December 22, 2017, the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, or the TCJA, was enacted reducing the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% effective for tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2018. As a result of the passage of the TCJA, the value of our deferred tax assets and related valuation allowance was reduced by a provisional amount of approximately $54.6 million. Additionally, under the TCJA, the Corporate Alternative Minimum Tax, or AMT, was repealed. Accordingly, our previously recorded AMT credits of approximately $3.5 million are now refundable over a four-year period beginning in 2018 and the previously recorded valuation allowance for these AMT credits has been reversed as a result of the TCJA during the fourth quarter of 2017.\nThe deferred tax assets associated with our losses incurred to date in 2017 have a full valuation allowance recorded against them due to our history of losses and the lack of other positive evidence to support future taxable income against which these losses could be applied. See Note 8 to our financial statements in Part IV-Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information regarding our expectations with respect to our income tax provision.\nWe are projecting a tax loss for 2017, none of which may be carried back to any prior taxable years. Although we recognized income under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, during 2017, this income is primarily due to the recognition of deferred income that had previously been recorded on our federal and state income tax returns. This recognition of income resulted in the reduction of a deferred tax asset that was completely offset by a previously recorded valuation allowance. With respect to the remaining deferred tax assets, except for the AMT credits previously discussed above, there was no change in the amount of assets realizable at December 31, 2017.\nResults of Operations\nComparison of Years Ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 Table 300: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase\n(Decrease)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Statements of Operations Data:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Collaboration revenue\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>209,977\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>50,909\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>159,068\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating expenses:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Research and development\n</td> <td>66,289\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>196,295\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(130,006\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General and administrative\n</td> <td>35,683\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>50,178\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(14,495\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total operating expenses\n</td> <td>101,972\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>246,473\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(144,501\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income (loss) from operations\n</td> <td>108,005\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(195,564\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(303,569\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest income\n</td> <td>1,522\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,704\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(182\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other income (expense)\n</td> <td>(34\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>34\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(68\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income (loss) before income tax benefit\n</td> <td>109,493\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(193,826\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(303,319\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax benefit\n</td> <td>(4,712\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(406\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4,306\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income (loss)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>114,205\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(193,420\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(307,625\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCollaboration Revenue\nCollaboration revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $210.0 million, an increase of $159.1 million compared to $50.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Collaboration revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased as we completed all deliverables required under the Novartis Agreement during the period. The July 2017 letter\nagreement with Novartis resolved the contingency with respect to our right to terminate the agreement in the event that the parties were prevented from materially progressing the development or commercialization of Fovista products for a specified period as a result of specified governmental actions and the associated termination fee equivalent to the entire $200.0 million upfront payment, which we would have been required to pay if we elected to exercise this termination option. We had previously deferred the entire $200.0 million upfront payment based on this contingency. As a result of our entry into the letter agreement and resolution of the contingency, we immediately recognized the revenue attributable to deliverables completed during prior periods. Further, as our remaining deliverables under the Novartis Agreement and the letter agreement were completed during the third quarter of 2017, we recognized all of the remaining collaboration revenue previously deferred under the Novartis Agreement. Using the relative selling price method, we recognized $152.9 million related to the license we delivered to Novartis under the Novartis Agreement, $56.2 million related to the research and development activities we performed under the Novartis Agreement, $0.8 million related to Fovista API we previously transferred to Novartis, and $0.1 million related to our joint operating committee participation obligations.\nCollaboration revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $50.9 million, of which $22.9 million was allocated to the license delivered to Novartis under the Novartis Agreement, $9.7 million was allocated to research and development activities performed under the Novartis Agreement, $18.2 million related to Fovista API we transferred to Novartis, and a de minimis amount of revenue was associated with our joint operating committee participation obligation during the same period.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nOur research and development expenses were $66.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, a decrease of $130.0 million compared to $196.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Research and development expenses for the year ended December 31, 2017 include approximately $7.5 million in costs related to our previously announced reduction in personnel. The decrease in research and development expenses for the year ended December 31, 2017 was primarily due to a $107.1 million decrease in costs associated with our Fovista program, including our Fovista Phase 3 clinical program and our Fovista Expansion Studies, a $6.2 million decrease in professional services and consulting fees, and a $10.3 million decrease in share-based compensation costs. The decreased costs for our Fovista program included lower costs related to Fovista manufacturing activities and lower clinical trial costs as a result of the wind-down of OPH1002 and OPH1003 and the Fovista Expansion Studies. This overall decrease was offset by a $4.6 million increase associated with our Zimura program, primarily related to manufacturing expenses.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nOur general and administrative expenses were $35.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, a decrease of $14.5 million, compared to $50.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. General and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2017 include approximately $5.6 million in costs related to our previously announced reduction in force and the termination of facilities leases. The decrease in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to a decrease in costs to support our operations and infrastructure offset by the additional severance and lease termination costs.\nInterest Income\nInterest income for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $1.5 million compared to interest income of $1.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease in interest income earned during the year ended December 31, 2017 was the result of a decrease in our cash and cash equivalent balances available for investment.\nIncome Tax Benefit\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, we recorded a benefit from income taxes of approximately $4.7 million, which primarily related to a $3.5 million reduction in our valuation allowances for AMT credits to reflect the impact of the TCJA enactment and a settlement of a franchise tax audit for $1.4 million partially offset by the reversal of previously recoded benefits related to the change in unrealized gains of our investment portfolio. Although we had $109.5 million of net income before income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2017 as a result of the recognition of deferred revenue under the Novartis Agreement, we expect a net loss for tax purposes for 2017 with minimal taxes due. For tax purposes, we treated payments received under the Novartis Agreement as revenue at the time the payments were received and the related deferred tax assets had a full valuation recorded against them.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, we recorded a benefit from income taxes of approximately $0.4 million, which related to unanticipated refunds received and the reduction in our valuation allowances to reflect the income tax associated with unrealized gains in our investment portfolio.\nComparison of Years Ended December 31, 2016 and 2015\nTable 301: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase\n(Decrease)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Statements of Operations Data:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Collaboration revenue\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>50,909\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>51,505\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(596\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating expenses:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Research and development\n</td> <td>196,295\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>131,012\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>65,283\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General and administrative\n</td> <td>50,178\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>44,021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,157\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total operating expenses\n</td> <td>246,473\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>175,033\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>71,440\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss from operations\n</td> <td>(195,564\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(123,528\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>72,036\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest income\n</td> <td>1,704\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>971\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>733\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other income\n</td> <td>34\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>53\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(19\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss before income tax provision\n</td> <td>(193,826\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(122,504\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>71,322\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax benefit\n</td> <td>(406\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(16,787\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(16,381\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net loss\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(193,420\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(105,717\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>87,703\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCollaboration Revenue\nCollaboration revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016 was approximately $50.9 million. Using the relative selling price method, we allocated $22.9 million to the license delivered to Novartis under the Novartis Agreement, $9.7 million to research and development activities performed under the Novartis Agreement, $18.2 million related to the Fovista API we transferred to Novartis, and a de minimis amount of revenue associated with our joint operating committee participation obligation during the year ended December 31, 2016.\nCollaboration revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $51.5 million, of which $38.1 million was allocated to the license delivered to Novartis under the Novartis Agreement, $8.4 million was allocated to research and development activities performed under the Novartis Agreement and $5.0 million related to Fovista API we transferred to Novartis during the same period.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nOur research and development expenses were $196.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, an increase of $65.3 million compared to $131.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in research and development expenses for the year ended December 31, 2016 was primarily due to a $42.8 million increase in costs associated with our Fovista program, including our Fovista Phase 3 clinical program and our Fovista Expansion Studies. The increased costs for our Fovista program included higher clinical trial costs relating to increased patient enrollment in the Fovista Phase 3 clinical trials and the Fovista Expansion Studies, the initiation of additional Fovista Expansion Studies, as well as higher manufacturing costs to support our clinical trials and for API validation activities, and certain costs related to the cancellation of Fovista API purchase orders following our receipt of initial, top-line data from OPH1002 and OPH1003 in December 2016. Also contributing to the overall increase was a $10.9 million increase to personnel expenses associated with additional research and development staffing and a $4.8 million increase to share-based compensation costs. In addition, costs related to professional services and consulting fees increased by $6.1 million.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nOur general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2016 were $50.2 million, an increase of $6.2 million, compared to $44.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase was primarily due to an increase in personnel expenses of $2.6 million, including $2.1 million in share-based compensation costs, an increase of $2.8 million in facility costs, as well as other costs to support the expansion of our operations during 2016, including our public company infrastructure, and the early stages of a commercial organization. Also contributing to the increase were increased costs for professional services and consulting fees of $0.8 million.\nInterest Income\nInterest income for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $1.7 million compared to net interest expense of $1.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in interest income earned during the year ended December 31, 2016 was the result of an increase in our average investment portfolio balances, and a change in the mix of our investment portfolio, which previously included only investments in U.S. Treasury securities and now includes investments in certain investment-grade corporate debt securities.\nIncome Tax Benefit\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, we recorded a benefit from income taxes of approximately $0.4 million, which related to unanticipated refunds received and the reduction in our valuation allowances to reflect the income tax associated with unrealized gains in our investment portfolio. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we recorded a benefit for income taxes of approximately $16.8 million, which related to our tax losses for tax year 2015 and our ability to carry these losses back to 2014 to recapture a portion of the federal income tax payments we paid in 2014.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nSources of Liquidity\nSince inception, we have financed our operations primarily through private placements of our preferred stock, venture debt borrowings, funding we received under the Novo Agreement, our initial public offering of common stock, which we closed in September 2013, our follow-on public offering of common stock, which we closed in February 2014, and funds we received under the Novartis Agreement. In September 2013, we issued and sold an aggregate of 8,740,000 shares of common stock in our initial public offering at a public offering price of $22.00 per share. We received net proceeds from the initial public offering of $175.6 million. In February 2014, we issued and sold 1,900,000 shares of common stock and selling shareholders sold 728,571 shares of common stock in a follow-on public offering at a public offering price of $31.50 per share. We received net proceeds of $55.4 million from the follow-on offering. The Novo Agreement, which is described in more detail below, provided for financing of up to $125.0 million in the aggregate in return for the sale to Novo A/S of royalty interests in worldwide sales of Fovista. We received an aggregate of $125.0 million from this financing in separate tranches in May 2013, January 2014 and November 2014, which constitutes the full amount of funding under the Novo Agreement. In May 2013, we issued and sold an aggregate of 6,666,667 shares of our series C preferred stock at a price per share of $2.50, for an aggregate purchase price of $16.7 million. In August 2013, we issued and sold an aggregate of 13,333,333 additional shares of our series C preferred stock to the same purchasers at a price per share of $2.50, for an aggregate purchase price of $33.3 million.\nIn May 2014, we received an upfront payment of $200.0 million upon execution of the Novartis Agreement in connection with the grant of a license for the rights to commercialize Fovista outside the United States. In each of November 2014 and April 2015 we received payments of $50.0 million upon the achievement of two patient enrollment-based milestones, and in August 2016, $30.0 million upon the achievement of a third, and final, enrollment-based milestone, for an aggregate total of $130.0 million. In connection with the receipt of the upfront payment from Novartis, we made a milestone payment in June 2014 of approximately $19.8 million to Nektar Therapeutics, or Nektar, pursuant to a license, manufacturing and supply agreement that we agreed to terminate with Nektar in October 2017.\nCash Flows\nAs of December 31, 2017, we had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling $167.0 million and no debt. We primarily invest our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities in U.S. Treasury securities, money market funds and certain investment-grade corporate debt securities.\nThe following table shows a summary of our cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015:\nTable 302: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash (used in) provided by:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating Activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(121,821\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(108,596\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(78,531\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investing Activities\n</td> <td>154,792\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13,731\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>247,803\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Financing Activities\n</td> <td>71\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,934\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12,775\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net change in cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>33,042\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(87,931\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>182,047\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\nNet cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $121.8 million and relates primarily to net cash used for the wind-down of OPH1002 and OPH1003 and the Fovista Expansion Studies, implementation of a previously announced reduction in personnel and related costs, and cancellation fees related to manufacturing commitments, as well as continuation of our OPH1004 trial through initial, top-line data in August 2017 and wind-down thereafter and general and administrative and corporate infrastructure expense.\nNet cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $108.6 million and related primarily to net cash used to fund our Fovista Phase 3 program, our Fovista Expansion Studies, Fovista manufacturing activities, as well as manufacturing and clinical trial costs for our Zimura program and expenditures related to general and administrative expenses.\nSee \"-Funding Requirements\" below for a description of how we expect to use our cash for operating activities in future periods.\nCash Flows from Investing Activities\nNet cash provided by investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $154.8 million and relates primarily to proceeds from the maturities of marketable securities totaling $166.8 million offset by purchases of marketable securities totaling $12.0 million. Net cash provided by investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $13.7 million and relates primarily to proceeds from the maturity of marketable securities totaling $86.5 million offset by purchases of marketable securities totaling $72.2 million.\nCash Flows from Financing Activities\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $0.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 and $6.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 and related to the proceeds from stock option plan exercises and purchases made under our employee stock purchase plan.\nFunding Requirements\nOur product candidate Zimura is in clinical development. We expect to continue to incur significant research and development expenses as we pursue the development of Zimura as currently planned. We could also incur additional research and development expenses if we conclude that there is a scientific rationale for potentially developing, or if we undertake the development of Zimura in additional indications, beyond those already in development, and as we evaluate and potentially in-license or acquire, and undertake development of, additional product candidates, including any promising product candidates that emerge from our collaborative gene therapy research programs. Furthermore, if we successfully develop and obtain marketing approval for any of our product candidates, we expect to incur significant commercialization expenses related to product sales, marketing, distribution and manufacturing. We are party to an agreement with Archemix that imposes significant milestone payment obligations on us in connection with our achievement of specific clinical, regulatory and commercial milestones with respect to Zimura. It is likely that any future in-licensing or acquisition agreements that we enter into with respect to additional products, product candidates or technologies would include similar obligations.\nWe expect that we will continue to incur significant expenses as we:\n \u2022 continue the clinical development of Zimura as currently planned or potentially in other indications if we believe there is a sufficient scientific rationale to pursue such development; \n \u2022 in-license or acquire the rights to, and pursue the development of, other products, product candidates or technologies; \n \u2022 pursue our collaborative gene therapy research programs; \n \u2022 maintain, expand and protect our intellectual property portfolio; \n \u2022 hire additional clinical, manufacturing, quality control, quality assurance and scientific personnel, especially if we are successful in acquiring or in-licensing rights to additional products, product candidates or technologies or progressing the clinical development of any of our product candidates or if we decide to establish internal gene therapy capabilities; \n \u2022 seek marketing approval for any product candidates that successfully complete clinical trials; \n \u2022 expand our outsourced manufacturing activities or establish commercial operations or sales, marketing and distribution capabilities, if we receive, or expect to receive, marketing approval for any of our product candidates; and \n \u2022 expand our general and administrative functions to support future growth of the company.  As of December 31, 2017, we had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $167.0 million, of which approximately $2.0 million is committed to satisfying our remaining financial obligations with respect to the wind-down of the Fovista Phase 3 trials and obligations incurred in connection with our reduction in personnel substantially completed during 2017. For 2018, we expect the cash required to fund our operations and capital expenditures, including our Zimura development programs and collaborative gene therapy research programs, as currently planned will range between $50.0 million and $55.0 million. We also had $137.5 million in total liabilities as of December 31, 2017, of which $125.0 million related to the Novo Agreement, which we are required to show as a liability on our balance sheets under generally accepted accounting principles but which does not correspond to any contractual repayment obligation.\nWe believe that our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities will be sufficient to fund our operations and capital expenditure requirements as currently planned for at least the next 12 months. This estimate does not reflect any additional expenditures resulting from additional sponsored research or the in-licensing or acquisition of additional product candidates or technologies or associated development that we may pursue following any such transactions. We have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could use our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect. Our capital requirements will depend on several factors, including the scope of any additional collaborative research programs, the success of our pursuit, by acquisition, in-licensing or otherwise, and subsequent development of additional product candidates or technologies, and the success of our ongoing development programs. We believe that we may need additional funding in the event that we acquire or in-license one or more additional product candidates and undertake development. In addition, our expenses may exceed our expectations if we experience delays in enrollment or with the availability of drug supply for our clinical trials, if we experience any unforeseen issues in our ongoing clinical trials or if we further expand the scope or size of our clinical trials and programs. Our costs may also exceed our expectations for other reasons, for example, if we experience issues with manufacturing or process development, or if we are required by the FDA, the EMA, or regulatory authorities in other jurisdictions to perform clinical or nonclinical trials or other studies in addition to those we currently expect to conduct. As a result, we may need or may seek to obtain additional funding in connection with our continuing operations sooner than expected.\nThe future development of our product candidates is highly uncertain. We expect the clinical development for Zimura will continue for at least the next several years. At this time, we cannot reasonably estimate the remaining costs necessary to complete clinical development, to complete process development and manufacturing scale-up and validation activities or to potentially seek marketing approval with respect to our product candidates.\nOur future capital requirements, therefore, will depend on many factors, including:\n \u2022 the scope, costs and results of our ongoing Zimura clinical"}
