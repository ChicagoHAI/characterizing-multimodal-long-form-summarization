MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our accompanying consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included in this Annual Report. Also refer to Forward Looking Statements\u201d preceding Part I.\nAs used herein, the terms we,\u201d our,\u201d us,\u201d and Company\u201d refer to Strategic Realty Trust, Inc., formerly TNP Strategic Retail Trust, Inc., and, as required by context, Strategic Realty Operating Partnership, L.P., formerly TNP Strategic Retail Operating Partnership, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership, which we refer to as our operating partnership\u201d or OP\u201d, and to their respective subsidiaries. References to shares\u201d and our common stock\u201d refer to the shares of our common stock.\nOverview\nWe are a Maryland corporation that was formed on September 18, 2008, to invest in and manage a portfolio of income-producing retail properties, located in the United States, real estate-owning entities and real estate-related assets, including the investment in or origination of mortgage, mezzanine, bridge and other loans related to commercial real estate. During the first quarter of 2016, we also invested, through joint ventures, in two significant retail projects under development. We have elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust ( REIT\u201d) for federal income tax purposes, commencing with the taxable year ended December 31, 2009, and we intend to operate in such a manner. We own substantially all of our assets and conduct our operations through our operating partnership, of which we are the sole general partner. We also own a majority of the outstanding limited partner interests in the operating partnership.\nOn November 4, 2008, we filed a registration statement on Form S-11 with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC\u201d) for our initial public offering of up to 100,000,000 shares of our common stock at $10.00 per share in our primary offering and up to 10,526,316 shares of our common stock to our stockholders at $9.50 per share pursuant to our distribution reinvestment plan ( DRIP\u201d). On August 7, 2009, the SEC declared our registration statement effective and we commenced our initial public offering. On February 7, 2013, we terminated our initial public offering and ceased offering shares of our common stock in our primary offering and under our DRIP.\nAs of February 2013 when we terminated the initial public offering, we had accepted subscriptions for, and issued, 10,688,940 shares of common stock in the initial public offering for gross offering proceeds of approximately $104.7 million, and 391,182 shares of common stock pursuant to the DRIP for gross offering proceeds of approximately $3.6 million. We have also granted 50,000 shares of restricted stock and we issued 273,729 shares of common stock to pay a portion of a special distribution. Refer to Part II, Item 5. Market for Registrant's Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities\u201d for details regarding the special distribution.\nOn April 1, 2015, our board of directors approved the reinstatement of the share redemption program and adopted the Amended and Restated Share Redemption Program (the SRP\u201d). The program was previously suspended, effective as of January 15, 2013. For more information regarding our share redemption program, refer to Part II, Item 5, Market for Registrant's Common Equity, Related Shareholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities - Share Redemption Program.\u201d Cumulatively, through December 31, 2016, we have redeemed 475,194 shares of common stock sold in the Offering for approximately $3.7 million.\nSince our inception, our business has been managed by an external advisor. We no longer have direct employees and all management and administrative personnel responsible for conducting our business are employed by our advisor. Currently we are externally managed and advised by SRT Advisor, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (the Advisor\u201d) pursuant to an advisory agreement with the Advisor (the Advisory Agreement\u201d) initially executed on August 10, 2013, and subsequently renewed in August 2014, August 2015 and August 2016. The current term of the Advisory Agreement terminates on August 10, 2017. The Advisor is an affiliate of Glenborough, LLC (together with its affiliates, Glenborough\u201d), a privately held full-service real estate investment and management company focused on the acquisition, management and leasing of commercial properties.\nBeginning in December 2012 and ending upon execution of the Advisory Agreement, Glenborough performed certain services for us pursuant to a consulting agreement ( Consulting Agreement\u201d). We entered the Consulting Agreement to assist us with the process of transitioning to a new external advisor, as well as to provide other services.\nMarket Outlook - Real Estate and Real Estate Finance Markets\nThe investment market for retail property slowed in 2016 while occupancy and rental fundamentals continued to improve. According to data from Jones Lang LaSalle ( JLL\u201d), sales of retail investment properties totaled $64.3 billion in 2016, down 18.7% from 2015. While sales volumes decreased, pricing increased with average cap rates of 4.4% down by 37 basis points from 2015. New supply remained in check, based on data from CoStar which saw deliveries of new space for the year of 52.1 million square feet which continues to track below the absorption of 88.5 million square feet helping to push down the vacancy rate approximately 50 basis points in 2016. The U.S retail vacancy rate at year end was 5.3% down from 5.8% at the end of 2015 according to CoStar. Solid rent growth for 2016 was reported with rents up 2.8% from a year ago according to JLL data and up 2.6% according to CoStar.\n2016 Significant Events\nProperty Acquisitions\nTable 82: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>On June 14, 2016, we, through an indirect subsidiary, purchased a 100% ownership interest in two retail properties located in the Hayes Valley neighborhood at 400 Grove Street and 8 Octavia Street in San Francisco, California (the San Francisco Properties\u201d). The San Francisco Properties encompass four retail condominiums with an aggregate of 5,640 square feet of retail space. The aggregate purchase price of the San Francisco Properties was approximately $5.6 million subject to customary closing costs and proration adjustments.

Under the Second A&R SRP, a person is deemed to be disabled and therefore eligible to redeem shares pursuant to the Second A&R SRP if they are disabled pursuant to the definition of disability\u201d in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, at the time that the person's written redemption request is received by us. The other material terms of the Second A&R SRP are consistent with the terms of the First A&R SRP.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 90: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>On October 5, 2016, the board of directors approved, pursuant to Section 3(a) of SRP, an additional $0.5 million of funds available for the redemption of shares in connection with the death of a stockholder.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 91: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>During the year ended December 31, 2016, we redeemed 109,291 shares of common stock for $0.7 million under the SRP at an average price of $6.44 per share.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nReview of our Policies\nOur board of directors, including our independent directors, has reviewed our policies described in this Annual Report and determined that they are in the best interest of our stockholders because: (1) they increase the likelihood that we will be able to successfully maintain and manage our current portfolio of investments and acquire additional income-producing properties and other real estate-related investments in the future; (2) our executive officers, directors and affiliates of our Advisor have expertise with the type of properties in our current portfolio; and (3) to the extent that we acquire additional real properties or other real estate-related investments in the future, the use of leverage should enable us to acquire assets and earn rental income more quickly, thereby increasing the likelihood of generating income for our stockholders.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nBelow is a discussion of the accounting policies and estimates that management considers critical in that they involve significant management judgments and assumptions, require estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain and because they are important for understanding and evaluating our reported financial results. These judgments affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and our disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the consolidated financial\nstatements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. With different estimates or assumptions, materially different amounts could be reported in our consolidated financial statements. Additionally, other companies may utilize different estimates that may impact the comparability of our results of operations to those of companies in similar businesses.\nRevenue Recognition\nRevenues include minimum rents, expense recoveries and percentage rental payments. Minimum rents are recognized on an accrual basis over the terms of the related leases on a straight-line basis when collectability is reasonably assured and the tenant has taken possession or controls the physical use of the leased property. If the lease provides for tenant improvements, we determine whether the tenant improvements, for accounting purposes, are owned by the tenant or us. When we are the owner of the tenant improvements, the tenant is not considered to have taken physical possession or have control of the physical use of the leased asset until the tenant improvements are substantially completed. When the tenant is the owner of the tenant improvements, any tenant improvement allowance that is funded is treated as a lease incentive and amortized as a reduction of revenue over the lease term. Tenant improvement ownership is determined based on various factors including, but not limited to:\nTable 92: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>whether the lease stipulates how a tenant improvement allowance may be spent;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 93: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>whether the amount of a tenant improvement allowance is in excess of market rates;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 94: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>whether the tenant or landlord retains legal title to the improvements at the end of the lease term;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 95: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>whether the tenant improvements are unique to the tenant or general-purpose in nature; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 96: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>whether the tenant improvements are expected to have any residual value at the end of the lease term.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> For leases with minimum scheduled rent increases, we recognize income on a straight-line basis over the lease term when collectability is reasonably assured. Recognizing rental income on a straight-line basis for leases results in reported revenue amounts which differ from those that are contractually due from tenants. If we determine that collectability of straight-line rents is not reasonably assured, we limit future recognition to amounts contractually owed and paid, and, when appropriate, establish an allowance for estimated losses.\nWe maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts, including an allowance for straight-line rent receivables, for estimated losses resulting from tenant defaults or the inability of tenants to make contractual rent and tenant recovery payments. We monitor the liquidity and creditworthiness of our tenants on an ongoing basis. For straight-line rent amounts, our assessment is based on amounts estimated to be recoverable over the term of the lease.\nCertain leases contain provisions that require the payment of additional rents based on the respective tenants' sales volume (contingent or percentage rent) and substantially all contain provisions that require reimbursement of the tenants' allocable real estate taxes, insurance and common area maintenance costs ( CAM\u201d). Revenue based on percentage of tenants' sales is recognized only after the tenant exceeds its sales breakpoint. Revenue from tenant reimbursements of taxes, CAM and insurance is recognized in the period that the applicable costs are incurred in accordance with the lease agreement.\nWe recognize gains or losses on sales of real estate in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC\u201d) 360, Property, Plant, and Equipment. Profits are not recognized until (1) a sale has been consummated; (2) the buyer's initial and continuing investments are adequate to demonstrate a commitment to pay for the property; (3) our receivable, if any, is not subject to future subordination; and (4) we have transferred to the buyer the usual risks and reward of ownership, and we do not have a substantial continuing involvement with the property.\nInvestment in Real Estate\nReal property is recorded at estimated fair value at time of acquisition with subsequent additions at cost, less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Costs include those related to acquisition, development and construction, including tenant improvements, interest incurred during development, costs of predevelopment and certain direct and indirect costs of development.\nDepreciation and amortization is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets as follows:\nTable 97: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Buildings and improvements\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5 - 30 years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tenant improvements\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1 - 36 years\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTenant improvement costs recorded as capital assets are depreciated over the tenant's remaining lease term which we determined approximates the remaining useful life of the improvement.\nExpenditures for ordinary maintenance and repairs are expensed to operations as they are incurred. Significant renovations and improvements that improve or extend the useful lives of assets are capitalized.\nBusiness Combinations\nWe record the acquisition of income-producing real estate or real estate that will be used for the production of income as a business combination when the acquired property meets the definition of a business. Assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination are generally measured at their acquisition date fair values. Tenant improvements recognized represent the tangible assets associated with the existing leases valued on a fair value basis at the acquisition date, are classified as an asset under investments in real estate and are depreciated over the remaining lease terms. Identifiable intangible assets and liabilities relate to the value of in-place operating leases which come in three forms: (1) leasing commissions and legal costs, which represent the value associated with cost avoidance\u201d of acquiring in-place leases, such as lease commissions paid under terms generally experienced in markets in which we operate; (2) value of in-place leases, which represents the estimated loss of revenue and of costs incurred for the period required to lease the assumed vacant\u201d property to the occupancy level when purchased; and (3) above or below market value of in-place leases, which represents the difference between the contractual rents and market rents at the time of the acquisition, discounted for tenant credit risks. The value of in-place leases are recorded in acquired lease intangibles, and amortized over the remaining lease term. Above or below market-rate leases are classified in acquired lease intangibles, or in acquired below market lease intangibles, depending on whether the contractual terms are above or below market. Above market leases are amortized as a decrease to rental revenue over the remaining non-cancelable terms of the respective leases and below market leases are amortized as an increase to rental revenue over the remaining initial lease term and any fixed rate renewal periods, if applicable.\nAcquisition costs are expensed as incurred. Also included in transaction expense in the consolidated statements of operations are costs incurred in pursuit of targeted properties for acquisitions not yet closed or those determined to no longer be viable.\nEstimates of the fair values of the tangible assets, identifiable intangibles and assumed liabilities require us to make significant assumptions to estimate market lease rates, property operating expenses, carrying costs during lease-up periods, discount rates, market absorption periods, and the number of years the property will be held for investment. The use of inappropriate assumptions would result in an incorrect valuation of our acquired tangible assets, identifiable intangibles and assumed liabilities which would impact the amount of our net income. These allocations also impact the amount of revenue we recognize, depreciation expense and gains or losses recorded on future sales of properties.\nImpairment of Long-lived Assets\nWe continually monitor events and changes in circumstances that could indicate that the carrying amounts of our investments in real estate and related intangible assets may not be recoverable. When indicators of potential impairment suggest that the carrying value of real estate and related intangible assets may not be recoverable, we assess the recoverability by estimating whether we will recover the carrying value of the real estate and related intangible assets through its undiscounted future cash flows (excluding interest) and its eventual disposition. If, based on this analysis, we do not believe that we will be able to recover the carrying value of the real estate and related intangible assets and liabilities, we would record an impairment loss to the extent that the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of the investments in real estate and related intangible assets. Key inputs that we estimate in this analysis include projected rental rates, capital expenditures, property sales capitalization rates and expected holding period of the property.\nWe evaluate our equity investments for impairment in accordance with ASC 320, Investments - Debt and Securities ( ASC 320\u201d). ASC 320 provides guidance for determining when an investment is considered impaired, whether impairment is other-than-temporary, and measurement of an impairment loss.\nWe did not record any impairment loss on our investments in real estate and related intangible assets during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015. Refer to Part II, Item 5. Market for Registrant's Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities\u201d for more information regarding the methodologies used to estimate fair value of the investments in real estate.\nAssets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations\nWhen certain criteria are met, long-lived assets are classified as held for sale and are reported at the lower of their carrying value or their fair value less costs to sell and are no longer depreciated. With the adoption of Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-08, Presentation of Financial Statements and Property, Plant, and Equipment on April 30, 2014, only disposed properties that represent a strategic shift that has (or will have) a major effect on our operations and financial results are reported as discontinued operations.\nFair Value Measurements\nUnder generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP\u201d), we are required to measure or disclose certain financial instruments at fair value on a recurring basis. In addition, we are required to measure other financial instruments and balances at fair value on a non-recurring basis (e.g., carrying value of impaired real estate loans receivable and long-lived assets). Fair value is defined as the price that would be received upon the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The GAAP fair value framework uses a three-tiered approach. Fair value measurements are classified and disclosed in one of the following three categories:\nTable 98: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Level 1: unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical assets or liabilities;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 99: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Level 2: quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active, and model-derived valuations in which significant inputs and significant value drivers are observable in active markets; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 100: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Level 3: prices or valuation techniques where little or no market data is available for inputs that are significant to the fair value measurement.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> When available, we utilize quoted market prices or other observable inputs (Level 2 inputs), such as interest rates or yield curves, from independent third-party sources to determine fair value and classify such items in Level 1 or Level 2. In instances where the market for a financial instrument is not active, regardless of the availability of a non-binding quoted market price, observable inputs might not be relevant and could require us to use significant judgment to derive a fair value measurement. Additionally, in an inactive market, a market price quoted from an independent third-party may rely more on models with inputs based on information available only to that independent third-party. When we determine the market for an asset owned by us to be illiquid or when market transactions for similar instruments do not appear orderly, we use several valuation sources (including internal valuations, discounted cash flow analysis and quoted market prices) and establish a fair value by assigning weights to the various valuation sources. Additionally, when determining the fair value of liabilities in circumstances in which a quoted price in an active market for an identical liability is not available, we measure fair value using (i) a valuation technique that uses the quoted price of the identical liability when traded as an asset or quoted prices for similar liabilities when traded as assets; or (ii) a present value technique that considers the future cash flows based on contractual obligations discounted by an observed or estimated market rates of comparable liabilities. The use of contractual cash flows with regard to amount and timing significantly reduces the judgment applied in arriving at fair value.\nChanges in assumptions or estimation methodologies can have a material effect on these estimated fair values. In this regard, the derived fair value estimates cannot be substantiated by comparison to independent markets and, in many cases, may not be realized in an immediate settlement of the instrument.\nWe consider the following factors to be indicators of an inactive market (1) there are few recent transactions; (2) price quotations are not based on current information; (3) price quotations vary substantially either over time or among market makers (for example, some brokered markets); (4) indexes that previously were highly correlated with the fair values of the asset or liability are demonstrably uncorrelated with recent indications of fair value for that asset or liability; (5) there is a significant increase in implied liquidity risk premiums, yields, or performance indicators (such as delinquency rates or loss severities) for observed transactions or quoted prices when compared with our estimate of expected cash flows, considering all available market data about credit and other nonperformance risk for the asset or liability; (6) there is a wide bid-ask spread or significant increase in the bid-ask spread; (7) there is a significant decline or absence of a market for new issuances (that is, a primary market) for the asset or liability or similar assets or liabilities; and (8) little information is released publicly (for example, a principal-to-principal market).\nWe consider the following factors to be indicators of non-orderly transactions (1) there was not adequate exposure to the market for a period before the measurement date to allow for marketing activities that are usual and customary for transactions involving such assets or liabilities under current market conditions; (2) there was a usual and customary marketing period, but the seller marketed the asset or liability to a single market participant; (3) the seller is in or near bankruptcy or receivership (that is, distressed), or the seller was required to sell to meet regulatory or legal requirements (that is, forced); and (4) the transaction price is an outlier when compared with other recent transactions for the same or similar assets or liabilities.\nIncome Taxes\nWe have elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code. To qualify as a REIT, we must meet certain organizational and operational requirements, including a requirement to distribute at least 90% of our annual REIT taxable income to stockholders (which is computed without regard to the dividends paid deduction or net capital gain and which does not necessarily equal results of operations as calculated in accordance with GAAP). As a REIT, we generally will not be subject to federal income tax on income that we distribute as dividends to our stockholders. If we fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, we will be subject to federal income tax on our taxable income at regular corporate income tax rates and generally\nwill not be permitted to qualify for treatment as a REIT for federal income tax purposes for the four taxable years following the year during which qualification is lost, unless the Internal Revenue Service grants us relief under certain statutory provisions. Such an event could materially and adversely affect our net income and net cash available for distribution to stockholders. However, we believe that we are organized and operate in such a manner as to qualify for treatment as a REIT. Even if we qualify as a REIT, we may be subject to certain state or local income taxes and to U.S. Federal income and excise taxes on our undistributed income.\nWe evaluate tax positions taken in the consolidated financial statements under the interpretation for accounting for uncertainty in income taxes. As a result of this evaluation, we may recognize a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more-likely-than-not\u201d that the tax position will be sustained on examination by taxing authorities.\nWhen necessary, deferred income taxes are recognized in certain taxable entities. Deferred income tax is generally a function of the period's temporary differences (items that are treated differently for tax purposes than for financial reporting purposes). A valuation allowance for deferred income tax assets is provided if all or some portion of the deferred income tax asset may not be realized. Any increase or decrease in the valuation allowance is generally included in deferred income tax expense.\nOur tax returns remain subject to examination and consequently, the taxability of our distributions is subject to change. During the year ended December 31 2015, we were subject to alternative minimum state/federal taxes totaling approximately $0.2 million. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we finalized our calculation of taxes owed for 2015, which was less than the recorded accrual, resulting in a reversal of approximately $0.1 million and payment of approximately $0.1 million. The amount of over accrual was immaterial. Also, in 2016, income taxes were estimated and accrued to represent taxes on our share, through the TRS, of the gains from the sales of certain SGO MN Joint Venture properties.\nPortfolio Investments\nAs of December 31, 2016, our portfolio included:\nTable 101: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Investments in two joint ventures, which own property under development in Los Angeles, California that are expected to comprise 49,500 square feet upon completion.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 102: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Investments in two joint ventures, which own, in aggregate, 13 retail centers, including 4 centers classified as held for sale, comprising an aggregate of approximately 742,000 square feet and located in five states.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 103: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td> Twelve retail properties, including two properties classified as held for sale, comprising an aggregate of approximately 701,000 square feet of single- and multi-tenant, commercial retail space located in six states.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Results of Operations\nAs of December 31, 2016 and 2015, approximately 91% and 90% of our 12 retail properties was leased (based on rentable square footage), respectively, with weighted-average remaining lease terms of approximately four years and five years, respectively. In 2016, there were three property acquisitions and one property disposition. In 2015, there were no property acquisitions and six property dispositions.\nLeasing Information\nCommitted tenant improvement costs and leasing commissions for new leases during the year ended December 31, 2016 were $20.00 per square foot and $8.25 per square foot, respectively. Committed tenant improvement costs and leasing commissions for new leases during the year ended December 31, 2015 were $8.22 per square foot and $4.05 per square foot, respectively.

The sale of the three properties in March 2015 was completed in connection with the formation of the SGO Joint Venture (as described in Note 4. Investments in Unconsolidated Joint Ventures\u201d to the consolidated financial statements contained within this Annual Report on Form 10-K). The decrease was partially offset by revenue from the 2016 acquisitions of the San Francisco Properties, Fulton Shops and 450 Hayes.\nOperating and maintenance expenses\nThe decrease in operating and maintenance expenses during the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to the same period in 2015, was primarily the result of the sales of properties, partially offset by acquisitions of new properties, as discussed above.\nGeneral and administrative expenses\nThe decrease in general and administrative expenses during the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to the same period in 2015 was primarily due to reduced legal costs of $0.3 million with the resolution in 2015 of the class action lawsuit and the corresponding $0.3 million write-off of the remaining unamortized directors and officers insurance policy that covered the settlement. Additionally, asset management fees declined by approximately $76 thousand in 2016 due to the 2015 and 2016 sales of properties, partially offset by acquisitions of new properties in 2016.\nDepreciation and amortization expenses\nThe decrease in depreciation and amortization expenses during the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to the same period in 2015 was also attributed to the 2015 and 2016 sales of properties, partially offset by the acquisitions of new properties in 2016. The classification of Pinehurst and Woodland as held for sale during the fourth quarter of 2016 also contributed to the decrease in depreciation and amortization expenses.\nTransaction expense\nThe increase in transaction expenses during the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to the same period in 2015 is primarily due to acquisition costs related to our investments in the San Francisco Properties, Fulton Shops and 450 Hayes. Refer to Note 3. Real Estate Investments\u201d to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our portion of disposition fees related to sales of certain SGO MN Joint Venture properties also contributed to the increase in transaction expenses.\nInterest expense\nThe decrease in interest expense during the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to the same period in 2015 was primarily due to loan pay-offs using the proceeds from the sales of Aurora Commons, Constitution Trail, and Osceola Village in March 2015, the sales of Northgate Plaza, Moreno Marketplace and Summit Point in October 2015, and the sale of Bloomingdale Hills in April 2016.\nOther income (loss), net\nOther loss, net for the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily consisted of approximately $1.0 million related to prepayment penalties on extinguishment of debt, as well as the write-off of unamortized loan fees related to the sale of Bloomingdale Hills in April 2016. This was partially offset by the gain on sale of Bloomingdale Hills of approximately $0.6 million. Other income, net for the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily consisted of the net gain of approximately $20.9 million gain resulting from the disposal of properties and was partially offset by an approximately $3.4 million loss resulting from the early extinguishment of debt associated with the disposed properties.\nIncome taxes\nWe have elected to treat one of our subsidiaries as a taxable REIT subsidiary ( TRS\u201d). In general, a TRS may engage in any real estate business and certain non-real estate businesses, subject to certain limitations under the Internal Revenue Code. A TRS is subject to federal and state income taxes. For the year ended December 31, 2016, income taxes primarily include taxes on our share of the net gains from sales of certain SGO MN Joint Venture properties. This is partially offset by the reversal of an over accrual of estimated alternative minimum state/federal taxes, which was accrued and included in expenses as of December 31, 2015. The over accrual was determined to be immaterial and was the result of finalizing, in 2016, the calculation of taxes owed for 2015.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nSince our inception, our principal demand for funds has been for the acquisition of real estate, the payment of operating expenses and interest on our outstanding indebtedness, the payment of distributions to our stockholders and investments in unconsolidated joint ventures and development properties. On February 7, 2013, we ceased offering shares of our common stock in our primary offering and under our distribution reinvestment plan. As a result of the termination of our initial public offering, offering proceeds from the sale of our securities are not currently available to fund our cash needs. We have used and expect to continue to use debt financing, net sales proceeds and cash flow from operations to fund our cash needs.\nAs of December 31, 2016, our cash and cash equivalents were approximately $3.1 million and our restricted cash (funds held by the lenders for property taxes, insurance, tenant improvements, leasing commissions, capital expenditures, rollover reserves and other financing needs) was approximately $4.7 million. For properties with lender reserves, we may draw upon such reserves to fund the specific needs for which the funds were established.\nOur aggregate borrowings, secured and unsecured, are reviewed by our board of directors at least quarterly. Under our Articles of Amendment and Restatement, as amended, which we refer to as our charter,\u201d we are prohibited from borrowing in excess of 300% of the value of our net assets. Net assets for purposes of this calculation is defined to be our total assets (other than intangibles), valued at cost prior to deducting depreciation, reserves for bad debts and other non-cash reserves, less total liabilities. The preceding calculation is generally expected to approximate 75% of the aggregate cost of our assets before non-cash reserves and depreciation. However, we may temporarily borrow in excess of these amounts if such excess is approved by a majority of the independent directors and disclosed to stockholders in our next quarterly report, along with an explanation for such excess. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, our borrowings were approximately 105.2% and 65.3%, respectively, of the carrying value of our net assets.\nThe following table summarizes, for the periods indicated, selected items in our consolidated statements of cash flows (amounts in thousands):\nTable 106: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$ Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by (used in):\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,391\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,764\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(373\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investing activities\n</td> <td>(38,585\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>96,189\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(134,774\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Financing activities\n</td> <td>31,531\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(92,371\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>123,902\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(5,663\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,582\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\nThe decrease in cash flows from operating activities was primarily due to a decrease in operating losses combined with adjustments for non-cash items aggregating approximately $0.7 million, as well as an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses in 2016 as compared to 2015 due to the consolidation of the variable interest entities ( VIEs\u201d).\nCash Flows from Investing Activities\nThe change in cash flows from investing activities was primarily due to our investments in the Wilshire and Gelson's Joint Ventures during the first quarter of 2016, consisting of land and building under development and development costs, of approximately $29.4 million, as well as our acquisitions of the San Francisco Properties in June 2016, our acquisition of the Fulton Shops in July 2016 and our acquisition of 450 Hayes in December 2016, which, in aggregate, consisted of land and buildings totaling $17.8 million. Cash flows from investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2015 consisted of proceeds of $103.1 million, before the pay down of debt, from the sale of Aurora Commons, Constitution Trail, Osceola Village, Moreno Marketplace, Northgate Plaza and Summit Point.\nCash Flows from Financing Activities\nThe change in cash flows from financing activities was primarily due to loan proceeds during the year ended December 31, 2016, of approximately $47.6 million in connection with our investments in the Wilshire and Gelson's Joint Ventures and additional draws under Key Bank Credit Facility, compared to the pay down of debt in the amount of $86.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2015 resulting from the sales of Aurora Commons, Constitution Trail, Osceola Village, Moreno Marketplace, Northgate Plaza and Summit Point.\nShort-term Liquidity and Capital Resources\nOur principal short-term demand for funds is for the payment of operating expenses, the payment of principal and interest on our outstanding indebtedness and distributions. To date, our cash needs for operations have been covered from cash provided by property operations, the sales of properties and the sale of shares of our common stock. Due to the termination of our initial public offering on February 7, 2013, we may fund our short-term operating cash needs from operations, from the sales of properties and from debt.\nLong-term Liquidity and Capital Resources\nOn a long-term basis, our principal demand for funds will be for real estate and real estate-related investments and the payment of acquisition-related expenses, operating expenses, distributions to stockholders, future redemptions of shares and interest and principal payments on current and future indebtedness. Generally, we intend to meet cash needs for items other than acquisitions and acquisition-related expenses from our cash flow from operations, debt and sales of properties. Until the termination of our initial public offering on February 7, 2013, our cash needs for acquisitions were satisfied from the net proceeds of the public offering and from debt financings. On a long-term basis, we expect that substantially all cash generated from operations will be used to pay distributions to our stockholders after satisfying our operating expenses including interest and principal payments. We may consider future public offerings or private placements of equity. Refer to Note 8. Notes Payable, Net\u201d to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information on the maturity dates and terms of our outstanding indebtedness.\nRecent Financing Transactions\nKeyBank Credit Facility\nThe KeyBank Credit Facility was scheduled to mature on August 4, 2017. Effective February 15, 2017, the KeyBank Credit Facility was refinanced and the new maturity date is February 15, 2020. Refer to Subsequent Events\u201d for further details.We have the right to prepay the Credit Facility in whole at any time or in part from time to time, subject to the payment of certain expenses, costs or liabilities potentially incurred by the lenders as a result of the prepayment and subject to certain other conditions contained in the loan documents.\nEach loan made pursuant to the Credit Facility is either a LIBOR rate loan or a base rate loan, at our election, plus an applicable margin, as defined. Monthly payments are interest only with the entire principal balance and all outstanding interest due at maturity. We pay KeyBank an unused commitment fee, quarterly in arrears, which accrues at 0.30% per annum if the usage under the Credit Facility is less than or equal to 50% of the Facility Amount, and 0.20% per annum if the usage under the Amended and Restated Credit Facility is greater than 50% of the Facility Amount.\nWe are responsible for all of our obligations under the Credit Facility and all other loan documents in connection with the Credit Facility. We also paid Glenborough a financing coordination fee of approximately $0.3 million in connection with the KeyBank Credit Facility.\nOn August 4, 2014, as required by the Amended and Restated Credit Facility, the OP contributed 100% of its sole membership interest in SRT Constitution Trail, LLC, which owns the Constitution Trail property, to SRT Secured Holdings, LLC ( Secured Holdings\u201d) (the Constitution Transaction\u201d). At the time, Secured Holdings was jointly owned by the OP and SRT Secured Holdings Manager, LLC ( SRT Manager\u201d), an affiliate of Glenborough. Prior to the Constitution Transaction, the OP owned 88% of the membership interests in Secured Holdings and SRT Manager owned 12% of the membership interests in Secured Holdings. Following the Constitution Transaction, the OP owned 91.67% of the membership interests in Secured Holdings and SRT Manager owned 8.33% of the membership interests in Secured Holdings, which was derived based on the fair value of the properties as of the date of the contribution. In March 2015, Secured Holdings paid SRT Manager $2.1 million in full redemption of SRT Manager's 8.33% membership interest in Secured Holdings.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, the following transactions occurred under the KeyBank Credit Facility:\nTable 107: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>In connection with the sale of Constitution Trail and Aurora Commons to the SGO Joint Venture on March 11, 2015 (refer to Note 4.

The Wilshire Loan bears interest at a rate of 10.0% per annum, payable monthly commencing on April 1, 2016. The loan matures on March 7, 2017, with an option to extend for two additional six-month periods, subject to certain conditions as stated in the loan agreement. All conditions to extensions were met, and on March 7, 2017, we exercised the option to extend the loan for six months. The new maturity date is September 7, 2017. The loan is secured by, among other things, a lien on the Wilshire development project and other collateral as defined in the loan agreement.\nIn connection with our investment in the Gelson's Joint Venture (as defined in Note 5, Variable Interest Entities\u201d to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K) and the acquisition of the Gelson's Property, we have consolidated borrowings of $10.7 million (the Gelson's Loan\u201d) from Buchanan Mortgage Holdings, LLC (as the lender) and Sunset and Gardner Investors, LLC (as the borrower). The Gelson's Loan bears interest at a rate of 9.5% per annum, payable monthly commencing on April 1, 2016. The loan matures on January 27, 2017, with an option to extend for an additional six-month period, subject to certain conditions as stated in the loan agreement. Those conditions were not met but we\nnegotiated a six month extension of the term on January 27, 2017. The new maturity date is July 27, 2017. The loan is secured by, among other things, a lien on the Gelson's development project and other collateral as defined in the loan agreement.\nGuidelines on Total Operating Expenses\nWe reimburse our Advisor for some expenses paid or incurred by our Advisor in connection with the services provided to us, except that we will not reimburse our Advisor for any amount by which our total operating expenses at the end of the four preceding fiscal quarters exceed the greater of (1) 2% of our average invested assets, as defined in our charter; and (2) 25% of our net income, as defined in our charter, or the 2%/25% Guidelines\u201d unless a majority of our independent directors determines that such excess expenses are justified based on unusual and non-recurring factors. For the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, our total operating expenses did not exceed the 2%/25% Guidelines.\nInflation\nThe majority of our leases at our properties contain inflation protection provisions applicable to reimbursement billings for common area maintenance charges, real estate tax and insurance reimbursements on a per square foot basis, or in some cases, annual reimbursement of operating expenses above a certain per square foot allowance. We expect to include similar provisions in our future tenant leases designed to protect us from the impact of inflation. Due to the generally long-term nature of these leases, annual rent increases, as well as rents received from acquired leases, may not be sufficient to cover inflation and rent may be below market rates.\nREIT Compliance\nTo qualify as a REIT for tax purposes, we are required to annually distribute at least 90% of our REIT taxable income, subject to certain adjustments, to our stockholders. We must also meet certain asset and income tests, as well as other requirements. If we fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, we will be subject to federal income tax (including any applicable alternative minimum tax) on our taxable income at regular corporate rates and generally will not be permitted to qualify for treatment as a REIT for federal income tax purposes for the four taxable years following the year during which our REIT qualification is lost unless the IRS grants us relief under certain statutory provisions. Such an event could materially adversely affect our net income and net cash available for distribution to our stockholders. In 2015, we made a special distribution to stockholders to preserve our REIT status based on underreporting of federal taxable income in 2011 (the Special Distribution\u201d).\nQuarterly Distributions\nAs set forth above, in order to qualify as a REIT, we are required to distribute at least 90% of our annual REIT taxable income, subject to certain adjustments, to our stockholders.\nUnder the terms of the Key Bank Credit Facility, we may pay distributions to our stockholders so long as the total amount paid does not exceed certain thresholds specified in the Key Bank Credit Facility provided; however, that we are not restricted from making any distributions necessary in order to maintain our status as a REIT. Our board of directors will continue to evaluate the amount of future quarterly distributions based on our operational cash needs.\nSome or all of our distributions have been paid, and in the future may continue to be paid, from sources other than cash flows from operations.\nFor a presentation of our quarterly distributions, not including Special Distributions, declared and paid to our common stockholders and holders of our common units and for information concerning the tax composition of our distributions paid, refer to Item 5. Market for Registrant's Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities.\u201d\nSpecial Distribution\nIn June 2011, we acquired a debt obligation (the Distressed Debt\u201d) for $18 million under our prior advisor, TNP Strategic Retail Advisor, LLC. In October 2011, we received the underlying collateral (the Collateral\u201d) with respect to the Distressed Debt in full settlement of our debt claim (the Settlement\u201d). At the time of the Settlement, we received an independent valuation of the Collateral's fair market value ( FMV\u201d) of $27.6 million. The Settlement resulted in taxable income to us in an amount equal to the FMV of the Collateral less our adjusted basis for tax purposes in the Distressed Debt. Such income was not properly reported on our 2011 federal income tax return, and we did not make a sufficient distribution of taxable income for purposes of the REIT qualification rules (the 2011 Underreporting\u201d). We believe that we were able to rectify the 2011 Underreporting by making a special distribution (the Special Distribution\u201d) to our stockholders.\nOn August 7, 2015, the board of directors authorized the Special Distribution of approximately $2.3 million on our common stock as of the close of business on August 10, 2015 (the Record Date\u201d). The Special Distribution was payable in cash, common stock or a combination of cash and common stock to, and at the election of, the stockholders of record as of the Record Date, provided, however, that the total amount of cash payable to all stockholders in the Special Distribution was\napproximately $0.5 million (the Cash Amount\u201d), with the balance of the Special Distribution, or approximately $1.8 million (the Share Amount\u201d), payable in the form of shares of common stock. Stockholders who did not return an election form, or who otherwise failed to properly complete an election form, before the deadline, received their pro rata portion of the Special Dividend entirely in shares of common stock.\nOn November 4, 2015, we paid approximately $0.5 million in cash and issued 273,729 shares of common stock having a value of approximately $1.8 million pursuant to the Special Distribution. On December 30, 2015, we paid an additional $0.1 million in cash to correct errors made by the third party transfer agent in connection with the November 4, 2015 payment pursuant to the Special Distribution. Although we believe the Special Distribution allowed us to maintain our qualification as a REIT, there can be no complete assurance in this regard.\nFunds From Operations\nFunds from operations ( FFO\u201d) is a supplemental non-GAAP financial measure of a real estate company's operating performance. The National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, or NAREIT\u201d, an industry trade group, has promulgated this supplemental performance measure and defines FFO as net income, computed in accordance with GAAP, plus real estate related depreciation and amortization and excluding extraordinary items and gains and losses on the sale of real estate, and after adjustments for unconsolidated joint ventures (adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures are calculated to reflect FFO.) It is important to note that not only is FFO not equivalent to our net income or loss as determined under GAAP, it also does not represent cash flows from operating activities in accordance with GAAP. FFO should not be considered an alternative to net income as an indication of our performance, nor is FFO necessarily indicative of cash flow as a measure of liquidity or our ability to fund cash needs, including the payment of distributions.\nWe consider FFO to be a meaningful, additional measure of operating performance and one that is an appropriate supplemental disclosure for an equity REIT due to its widespread acceptance and use within the REIT and analyst communities. Comparison of our presentation of FFO to similarly titled measures for other REITs may not necessarily be meaningful due to possible differences in the application of the NAREIT definition used by such REITs.\nOur calculation of FFO attributable to common shares and Common Units and the reconciliation of net income (loss) to FFO is as follows (amounts in thousands, except shares and per share amounts):\nTable 117: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>FFO\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015 (2)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income (loss) (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(1,991\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>13,991\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjustments:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income related to membership interest\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(173\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain on disposal of assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(640\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(20,764\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjustment to reflect FFO of unconsolidated joint ventures\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>322\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>480\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation of real estate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,516\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,482\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of in-place leases and other intangibles\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>857\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,332\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>FFO attributable to common shares and Common Units\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,064\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(1,652\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>FFO per share and Common Unit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.09\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(0.15\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Weighted average common shares and units outstanding\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11,433,573\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11,392,509\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 118: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>Our Common Units have the right to convert a unit into common stock for a one-to-one conversion.

Related Party Transactions\u201d to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of the Advisory Agreement and other related party transactions, agreements and fees.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nOur off-balance sheet arrangements consist primarily of our investments in joint ventures and are described in Note 4. Investments in Unconsolidated Joint Ventures\u201d in the notes to the consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our joint ventures typically fund their cash needs through secured debt financings obtained by and in the name of the joint venture entity. The joint ventures' debts are secured by a first mortgage, are without recourse to the joint venture partners, and do not represent a liability of the partners other than carve-out guarantees for certain matters such as environmental conditions, misuse of funds and material misrepresentations. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, we have provided carve-out guarantees in connection with our two unconsolidated joint ventures; in connection with those carve-out guarantees we have certain rights of recovery from our joint venture partners.\nSubsequent Events\nKeyBank Credit Facility\nEffective February 15, 2017, we entered into a Second Amended and Restated Revolving Credit Agreement (the Amended and Restated Credit Facility\u201d) with KeyBank to increase the maximum aggregate commitment under the Credit Facility from $30.0 million to $60.0 million. The Amended and Restated Credit Facility matures on February 15, 2020.\nOn February 28, 2017, we paid off the $9.8 million mortgage loan related to Woodland West Marketplace with proceeds from the Amended and Restated Credit Facility.\nMortgage Loans Secured by Properties Under Development\nOn March 7, 2017, we exercised the option to extend the maturity date of the Wilshire loan for six months. The new maturity date is September 7, 2017.\nOn January 27, 2017, we exercised the option to extend the maturity date of the Gelson's loan for six months. The new maturity date is July 27, 2017.\nDistributions\nOn January 31, 2017, we paid a fourth quarter distribution in the amount of $0.06 per share/unit to common stockholders and holders of common units of record as of December 31, 2016, totaling approximately $0.7 million.\nSale of Held for Sale Properties\nOn January 6, 2017, we consummated the disposition of Pinehurst Square East for a sales price of approximately $19.2 million in cash. We used the net proceeds from the sale of Pinehurst Square East to repay a portion of the outstanding balance on the KeyBank Credit Facility.\nOn February 1, 2017, we, through an indirect subsidiary, entered into a Purchase and Sale Agreement with an unrelated third party purchaser (the Purchaser\u201d) for the sale of Woodland West Marketplace. The contractual sale price of Woodland West Marketplace is $14.6 million. Pursuant to the Purchase and Sale Agreement, the Purchaser would be obligated to purchase the property and we would be obligated to sell the property only after satisfaction of agreed upon closing conditions. There can be no assurance that we will complete the sale.\nAcquisitions\nOn January 11, 2017, we purchased 100% ownership interest in certain property located in Los Angeles, California, in the Silver Lake neighborhood ( Silver Lake\u201d). The seller was not affiliated with us or our Advisor. Silver Lake is comprised of two boutique retail buildings totaling approximately 10,497 square feet of retail space. The aggregate purchase price of Silver Lake was approximately $13.3 million subject to customary closing costs and proration adjustments. We drew down $11.0 million on the KeyBank Credit Facility to fund this acquisition.\nOn January 4, 2017, we purchased a 100% ownership interest in 388 Fulton, located in the Hayes Valley neighborhood of San Francisco, California. The seller was not affiliated with us or our Advisor. 388 Fulton is comprised of two leased commercial condominiums with an aggregate of 3,110 square feet of retail space. The aggregate purchase price of 388 Fulton was approximately $4.5 million subject to customary closing costs and proration adjustments.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our accompanying consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included in this Annual Report. Also refer to Forward Looking Statements\u201d preceding Part I.\nAs used herein, the terms we,\u201d our,\u201d us,\u201d and Company\u201d refer to Strategic Realty Trust, Inc., formerly TNP Strategic Retail Trust, Inc., and, as required by context, Strategic Realty Operating Partnership, L.P., formerly TNP Strategic Retail Operating Partnership, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership, which we refer to as our operating partnership\u201d or OP\u201d, and to their respective subsidiaries. References to shares\u201d and our common stock\u201d refer to the shares of our common stock.\nOverview\nWe are a Maryland corporation that was formed on September 18, 2008, to invest in and manage a portfolio of income-producing retail properties, located in the United States, real estate-owning entities and real estate-related assets, including the investment in or origination of mortgage, mezzanine, bridge and other loans related to commercial real estate. During the first quarter of 2016, we also invested, through joint ventures, in two significant retail projects under development. We have elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust ( REIT\u201d) for federal income tax purposes, commencing with the taxable year ended December 31, 2009, and we intend to operate in such a manner. We own substantially all of our assets and conduct our operations through our operating partnership, of which we are the sole general partner. We also own a majority of the outstanding limited partner interests in the operating partnership.\nOn November 4, 2008, we filed a registration statement on Form S-11 with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC\u201d) for our initial public offering of up to 100,000,000 shares of our common stock at $10.00 per share in our primary offering and up to 10,526,316 shares of our common stock to our stockholders at $9.50 per share pursuant to our distribution reinvestment plan ( DRIP\u201d). On August 7, 2009, the SEC declared our registration statement effective and we commenced our initial public offering. On February 7, 2013, we terminated our initial public offering and ceased offering shares of our common stock in our primary offering and under our DRIP.\nAs of February 2013 when we terminated the initial public offering, we had accepted subscriptions for, and issued, 10,688,940 shares of common stock in the initial public offering for gross offering proceeds of approximately $104.7 million, and 391,182 shares of common stock pursuant to the DRIP for gross offering proceeds of approximately $3.6 million. We have also granted 50,000 shares of restricted stock and we issued 273,729 shares of common stock to pay a portion of a special distribution. Refer to Part II, Item 5. Market for Registrant's Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities\u201d for details regarding the special distribution.\nOn April 1, 2015, our board of directors approved the reinstatement of the share redemption program and adopted the Amended and Restated Share Redemption Program (the SRP\u201d). The program was previously suspended, effective as of January 15, 2013. For more information regarding our share redemption program, refer to Part II, Item 5, Market for Registrant's Common Equity, Related Shareholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities - Share Redemption Program.\u201d Cumulatively, through December 31, 2016, we have redeemed 475,194 shares of common stock sold in the Offering for approximately $3.7 million.\nSince our inception, our business has been managed by an external advisor. We no longer have direct employees and all management and administrative personnel responsible for conducting our business are employed by our advisor. Currently we are externally managed and advised by SRT Advisor, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (the Advisor\u201d) pursuant to an advisory agreement with the Advisor (the Advisory Agreement\u201d) initially executed on August 10, 2013, and subsequently renewed in August 2014, August 2015 and August 2016. The current term of the Advisory Agreement terminates on August 10, 2017. The Advisor is an affiliate of Glenborough, LLC (together with its affiliates, Glenborough\u201d), a privately held full-service real estate investment and management company focused on the acquisition, management and leasing of commercial properties.\nBeginning in December 2012 and ending upon execution of the Advisory Agreement, Glenborough performed certain services for us pursuant to a consulting agreement ( Consulting Agreement\u201d). We entered the Consulting Agreement to assist us with the process of transitioning to a new external advisor, as well as to provide other services.\nMarket Outlook - Real Estate and Real Estate Finance Markets\nThe investment market for retail property slowed in 2016 while occupancy and rental fundamentals continued to improve. According to data from Jones Lang LaSalle ( JLL\u201d), sales of retail investment properties totaled $64.3 billion in 2016, down 18.7% from 2015. While sales volumes decreased, pricing increased with average cap rates of 4.4% down by 37 basis points from 2015. New supply remained in check, based on data from CoStar which saw deliveries of new space for the year of 52.1 million square feet which continues to track below the absorption of 88.5 million square feet helping to push down the vacancy rate approximately 50 basis points in 2016. The U.S retail vacancy rate at year end was 5.3% down from 5.8% at the end of 2015 according to CoStar. Solid rent growth for 2016 was reported with rents up 2.8% from a year ago according to JLL data and up 2.6% according to CoStar.\n2016 Significant Events\nProperty Acquisitions\n \u2022 On June 14, 2016, we, through an indirect subsidiary, purchased a 100% ownership interest in two retail properties located in the Hayes Valley neighborhood at 400 Grove Street and 8 Octavia Street in San Francisco, California (the San Francisco Properties\u201d). The San Francisco Properties encompass four retail condominiums with an aggregate of 5,640 square feet of retail space. The aggregate purchase price of the San Francisco Properties was approximately $5.6 million subject to customary closing costs and proration adjustments. We funded the purchase price using borrowings under the KeyBank Credit Facility. Refer to Note 8. Notes Payable, Net\u201d to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for details regarding the KeyBank Credit Facility. \n \u2022 On July 27, 2016, we purchased a 100% ownership interest in Fulton Street Shops located in San Francisco, California ( Fulton Shops\u201d). Fulton Shops is comprised of five high-quality street retail condominiums with an aggregate of 3,758 square feet of retail space. The aggregate purchase price of Fulton Shops was approximately $4.6 million subject to customary closing costs and proration adjustments. We drew down $4.7 million on the KeyBank Credit Facility to fund this acquisition. \n \u2022 On September 8, 2016, we paid a deposit in the amount of approximately $0.2 million toward the acquisition of a 100% ownership interest in certain property located in the Hayes Valley neighborhood at 388 Fulton Street in San Francisco, California ( 388 Fulton\u201d). The deposit was included in prepaid expenses and other assets, net on the consolidated balance sheets. 388 Fulton is comprised of two leased commercial condominiums with an aggregate of 3,110 square feet of retail space. The purchase of this retail property closed on January 4, 2017. Refer to Part II, Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Subsequent Events\u201d for details. \n \u2022 On December 22, 2016, in conjunction with the acquisition of the San Francisco Properties, we, through an indirect subsidiary, purchased a 100% ownership interest in certain property located in the Hayes Valley neighborhood at 450 Hayes Street in San Francisco, California ( 450 Hayes\u201d). 450 Hayes is comprised of two high-quality street retail condominiums with an aggregate of 3,724 square feet of retail space. The aggregate consideration of 450 Hayes was approximately $7.6 million subject to customary closing costs and proration adjustments. We drew down $7.2 million on the KeyBank credit facility to fund this acquisition. Refer to Note 8. Notes Payable, Net\u201d to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for details.  Property Disposition and Loan Pay-off\n \u2022 On April 4, 2016, we consummated the disposition of Bloomingdale Hills, located in Riverside, Florida, for a sales price of approximately $9.2 million in cash, a portion of which was used to pay off the related $5.3 million mortgage loan and $3.0 million of which was used to pay down the line of credit under our KeyBank Credit Facility.  Investments in Joint Ventures\n \u2022 On December 21, 2015, we, through wholly-owned subsidiaries, entered into the Limited Liability Company Agreement of 3032 Wilshire Investors, LLC (the Wilshire Joint Venture Agreement\u201d) to form a joint venture (the Wilshire Joint Venture\u201d) with an institutional investor in order to purchase property for redevelopment.The purchase of the property took place on March 8, 2016. \n \u2022 On January 7, 2016, we, through wholly-owned subsidiaries, entered into the Limited Liability Company Agreement of Sunset & Gardner Investors, LLC (the Gelson's Joint Venture Agreement\u201d) to form a joint venture (the Gelson's Joint Venture\u201d) with an institutional investor in order to purchase property for a build-to-suit grocery store. The purchase of the property took place in January 28, 2016.  Share Redemption under the Share Redemption Program\n \u2022 On August 10, 2016, the board of directors authorized our management to prepare and implement an amendment and restatement of the SRP (the Second A&R SRP\u201d) to revise the definition of disability under the SRP. The Second A&R SRP became effective August 26, 2016. Under the Second A&R SRP, a person is deemed to be disabled and therefore eligible to redeem shares pursuant to the Second A&R SRP if they are disabled pursuant to the definition of disability\u201d in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, at the time that the person's written redemption request is received by us. The other material terms of the Second A&R SRP are consistent with the terms of the First A&R SRP. \n \u2022 On October 5, 2016, the board of directors approved, pursuant to Section 3(a) of SRP, an additional $0.5 million of funds available for the redemption of shares in connection with the death of a stockholder. \n \u2022 During the year ended December 31, 2016, we redeemed 109,291 shares of common stock for $0.7 million under the SRP at an average price of $6.44 per share. \nReview of our Policies\nOur board of directors, including our independent directors, has reviewed our policies described in this Annual Report and determined that they are in the best interest of our stockholders because: (1) they increase the likelihood that we will be able to successfully maintain and manage our current portfolio of investments and acquire additional income-producing properties and other real estate-related investments in the future; (2) our executive officers, directors and affiliates of our Advisor have expertise with the type of properties in our current portfolio; and (3) to the extent that we acquire additional real properties or other real estate-related investments in the future, the use of leverage should enable us to acquire assets and earn rental income more quickly, thereby increasing the likelihood of generating income for our stockholders.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nBelow is a discussion of the accounting policies and estimates that management considers critical in that they involve significant management judgments and assumptions, require estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain and because they are important for understanding and evaluating our reported financial results. These judgments affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and our disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the consolidated financial\nstatements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. With different estimates or assumptions, materially different amounts could be reported in our consolidated financial statements. Additionally, other companies may utilize different estimates that may impact the comparability of our results of operations to those of companies in similar businesses.\nRevenue Recognition\nRevenues include minimum rents, expense recoveries and percentage rental payments. Minimum rents are recognized on an accrual basis over the terms of the related leases on a straight-line basis when collectability is reasonably assured and the tenant has taken possession or controls the physical use of the leased property. If the lease provides for tenant improvements, we determine whether the tenant improvements, for accounting purposes, are owned by the tenant or us. When we are the owner of the tenant improvements, the tenant is not considered to have taken physical possession or have control of the physical use of the leased asset until the tenant improvements are substantially completed. When the tenant is the owner of the tenant improvements, any tenant improvement allowance that is funded is treated as a lease incentive and amortized as a reduction of revenue over the lease term. Tenant improvement ownership is determined based on various factors including, but not limited to:\n \u2022 whether the lease stipulates how a tenant improvement allowance may be spent; \n \u2022 whether the amount of a tenant improvement allowance is in excess of market rates; \n \u2022 whether the tenant or landlord retains legal title to the improvements at the end of the lease term; \n \u2022 whether the tenant improvements are unique to the tenant or general-purpose in nature; and \n \u2022 whether the tenant improvements are expected to have any residual value at the end of the lease term.  For leases with minimum scheduled rent increases, we recognize income on a straight-line basis over the lease term when collectability is reasonably assured. Recognizing rental income on a straight-line basis for leases results in reported revenue amounts which differ from those that are contractually due from tenants. If we determine that collectability of straight-line rents is not reasonably assured, we limit future recognition to amounts contractually owed and paid, and, when appropriate, establish an allowance for estimated losses.\nWe maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts, including an allowance for straight-line rent receivables, for estimated losses resulting from tenant defaults or the inability of tenants to make contractual rent and tenant recovery payments. We monitor the liquidity and creditworthiness of our tenants on an ongoing basis. For straight-line rent amounts, our assessment is based on amounts estimated to be recoverable over the term of the lease.\nCertain leases contain provisions that require the payment of additional rents based on the respective tenants' sales volume (contingent or percentage rent) and substantially all contain provisions that require reimbursement of the tenants' allocable real estate taxes, insurance and common area maintenance costs ( CAM\u201d). Revenue based on percentage of tenants' sales is recognized only after the tenant exceeds its sales breakpoint. Revenue from tenant reimbursements of taxes, CAM and insurance is recognized in the period that the applicable costs are incurred in accordance with the lease agreement.\nWe recognize gains or losses on sales of real estate in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC\u201d) 360, Property, Plant, and Equipment. Profits are not recognized until (1) a sale has been consummated; (2) the buyer's initial and continuing investments are adequate to demonstrate a commitment to pay for the property; (3) our receivable, if any, is not subject to future subordination; and (4) we have transferred to the buyer the usual risks and reward of ownership, and we do not have a substantial continuing involvement with the property.\nInvestment in Real Estate\nReal property is recorded at estimated fair value at time of acquisition with subsequent additions at cost, less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Costs include those related to acquisition, development and construction, including tenant improvements, interest incurred during development, costs of predevelopment and certain direct and indirect costs of development.\nDepreciation and amortization is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets as follows:\n\nTenant improvement costs recorded as capital assets are depreciated over the tenant's remaining lease term which we determined approximates the remaining useful life of the improvement.\nExpenditures for ordinary maintenance and repairs are expensed to operations as they are incurred. Significant renovations and improvements that improve or extend the useful lives of assets are capitalized.\nBusiness Combinations\nWe record the acquisition of income-producing real estate or real estate that will be used for the production of income as a business combination when the acquired property meets the definition of a business. Assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination are generally measured at their acquisition date fair values. Tenant improvements recognized represent the tangible assets associated with the existing leases valued on a fair value basis at the acquisition date, are classified as an asset under investments in real estate and are depreciated over the remaining lease terms. Identifiable intangible assets and liabilities relate to the value of in-place operating leases which come in three forms: (1) leasing commissions and legal costs, which represent the value associated with cost avoidance\u201d of acquiring in-place leases, such as lease commissions paid under terms generally experienced in markets in which we operate; (2) value of in-place leases, which represents the estimated loss of revenue and of costs incurred for the period required to lease the assumed vacant\u201d property to the occupancy level when purchased; and (3) above or below market value of in-place leases, which represents the difference between the contractual rents and market rents at the time of the acquisition, discounted for tenant credit risks. The value of in-place leases are recorded in acquired lease intangibles, and amortized over the remaining lease term. Above or below market-rate leases are classified in acquired lease intangibles, or in acquired below market lease intangibles, depending on whether the contractual terms are above or below market. Above market leases are amortized as a decrease to rental revenue over the remaining non-cancelable terms of the respective leases and below market leases are amortized as an increase to rental revenue over the remaining initial lease term and any fixed rate renewal periods, if applicable.\nAcquisition costs are expensed as incurred. Also included in transaction expense in the consolidated statements of operations are costs incurred in pursuit of targeted properties for acquisitions not yet closed or those determined to no longer be viable.\nEstimates of the fair values of the tangible assets, identifiable intangibles and assumed liabilities require us to make significant assumptions to estimate market lease rates, property operating expenses, carrying costs during lease-up periods, discount rates, market absorption periods, and the number of years the property will be held for investment. The use of inappropriate assumptions would result in an incorrect valuation of our acquired tangible assets, identifiable intangibles and assumed liabilities which would impact the amount of our net income. These allocations also impact the amount of revenue we recognize, depreciation expense and gains or losses recorded on future sales of properties.\nImpairment of Long-lived Assets\nWe continually monitor events and changes in circumstances that could indicate that the carrying amounts of our investments in real estate and related intangible assets may not be recoverable. When indicators of potential impairment suggest that the carrying value of real estate and related intangible assets may not be recoverable, we assess the recoverability by estimating whether we will recover the carrying value of the real estate and related intangible assets through its undiscounted future cash flows (excluding interest) and its eventual disposition. If, based on this analysis, we do not believe that we will be able to recover the carrying value of the real estate and related intangible assets and liabilities, we would record an impairment loss to the extent that the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of the investments in real estate and related intangible assets. Key inputs that we estimate in this analysis include projected rental rates, capital expenditures, property sales capitalization rates and expected holding period of the property.\nWe evaluate our equity investments for impairment in accordance with ASC 320, Investments - Debt and Securities ( ASC 320\u201d). ASC 320 provides guidance for determining when an investment is considered impaired, whether impairment is other-than-temporary, and measurement of an impairment loss.\nWe did not record any impairment loss on our investments in real estate and related intangible assets during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015. Refer to Part II, Item 5. Market for Registrant's Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities\u201d for more information regarding the methodologies used to estimate fair value of the investments in real estate.\nAssets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations\nWhen certain criteria are met, long-lived assets are classified as held for sale and are reported at the lower of their carrying value or their fair value less costs to sell and are no longer depreciated. With the adoption of Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-08, Presentation of Financial Statements and Property, Plant, and Equipment on April 30, 2014, only disposed properties that represent a strategic shift that has (or will have) a major effect on our operations and financial results are reported as discontinued operations.\nFair Value Measurements\nUnder generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP\u201d), we are required to measure or disclose certain financial instruments at fair value on a recurring basis. In addition, we are required to measure other financial instruments and balances at fair value on a non-recurring basis (e.g., carrying value of impaired real estate loans receivable and long-lived assets). Fair value is defined as the price that would be received upon the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The GAAP fair value framework uses a three-tiered approach. Fair value measurements are classified and disclosed in one of the following three categories:\n \u2022 Level 1: unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical assets or liabilities; \n \u2022 Level 2: quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active, and model-derived valuations in which significant inputs and significant value drivers are observable in active markets; and \n \u2022 Level 3: prices or valuation techniques where little or no market data is available for inputs that are significant to the fair value measurement.  When available, we utilize quoted market prices or other observable inputs (Level 2 inputs), such as interest rates or yield curves, from independent third-party sources to determine fair value and classify such items in Level 1 or Level 2. In instances where the market for a financial instrument is not active, regardless of the availability of a non-binding quoted market price, observable inputs might not be relevant and could require us to use significant judgment to derive a fair value measurement. Additionally, in an inactive market, a market price quoted from an independent third-party may rely more on models with inputs based on information available only to that independent third-party. When we determine the market for an asset owned by us to be illiquid or when market transactions for similar instruments do not appear orderly, we use several valuation sources (including internal valuations, discounted cash flow analysis and quoted market prices) and establish a fair value by assigning weights to the various valuation sources. Additionally, when determining the fair value of liabilities in circumstances in which a quoted price in an active market for an identical liability is not available, we measure fair value using (i) a valuation technique that uses the quoted price of the identical liability when traded as an asset or quoted prices for similar liabilities when traded as assets; or (ii) a present value technique that considers the future cash flows based on contractual obligations discounted by an observed or estimated market rates of comparable liabilities. The use of contractual cash flows with regard to amount and timing significantly reduces the judgment applied in arriving at fair value.\nChanges in assumptions or estimation methodologies can have a material effect on these estimated fair values. In this regard, the derived fair value estimates cannot be substantiated by comparison to independent markets and, in many cases, may not be realized in an immediate settlement of the instrument.\nWe consider the following factors to be indicators of an inactive market (1) there are few recent transactions; (2) price quotations are not based on current information; (3) price quotations vary substantially either over time or among market makers (for example, some brokered markets); (4) indexes that previously were highly correlated with the fair values of the asset or liability are demonstrably uncorrelated with recent indications of fair value for that asset or liability; (5) there is a significant increase in implied liquidity risk premiums, yields, or performance indicators (such as delinquency rates or loss severities) for observed transactions or quoted prices when compared with our estimate of expected cash flows, considering all available market data about credit and other nonperformance risk for the asset or liability; (6) there is a wide bid-ask spread or significant increase in the bid-ask spread; (7) there is a significant decline or absence of a market for new issuances (that is, a primary market) for the asset or liability or similar assets or liabilities; and (8) little information is released publicly (for example, a principal-to-principal market).\nWe consider the following factors to be indicators of non-orderly transactions (1) there was not adequate exposure to the market for a period before the measurement date to allow for marketing activities that are usual and customary for transactions involving such assets or liabilities under current market conditions; (2) there was a usual and customary marketing period, but the seller marketed the asset or liability to a single market participant; (3) the seller is in or near bankruptcy or receivership (that is, distressed), or the seller was required to sell to meet regulatory or legal requirements (that is, forced); and (4) the transaction price is an outlier when compared with other recent transactions for the same or similar assets or liabilities.\nIncome Taxes\nWe have elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code. To qualify as a REIT, we must meet certain organizational and operational requirements, including a requirement to distribute at least 90% of our annual REIT taxable income to stockholders (which is computed without regard to the dividends paid deduction or net capital gain and which does not necessarily equal results of operations as calculated in accordance with GAAP). As a REIT, we generally will not be subject to federal income tax on income that we distribute as dividends to our stockholders. If we fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, we will be subject to federal income tax on our taxable income at regular corporate income tax rates and generally\nwill not be permitted to qualify for treatment as a REIT for federal income tax purposes for the four taxable years following the year during which qualification is lost, unless the Internal Revenue Service grants us relief under certain statutory provisions. Such an event could materially and adversely affect our net income and net cash available for distribution to stockholders. However, we believe that we are organized and operate in such a manner as to qualify for treatment as a REIT. Even if we qualify as a REIT, we may be subject to certain state or local income taxes and to U.S. Federal income and excise taxes on our undistributed income.\nWe evaluate tax positions taken in the consolidated financial statements under the interpretation for accounting for uncertainty in income taxes. As a result of this evaluation, we may recognize a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more-likely-than-not\u201d that the tax position will be sustained on examination by taxing authorities.\nWhen necessary, deferred income taxes are recognized in certain taxable entities. Deferred income tax is generally a function of the period's temporary differences (items that are treated differently for tax purposes than for financial reporting purposes). A valuation allowance for deferred income tax assets is provided if all or some portion of the deferred income tax asset may not be realized. Any increase or decrease in the valuation allowance is generally included in deferred income tax expense.\nOur tax returns remain subject to examination and consequently, the taxability of our distributions is subject to change. During the year ended December 31 2015, we were subject to alternative minimum state/federal taxes totaling approximately $0.2 million. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we finalized our calculation of taxes owed for 2015, which was less than the recorded accrual, resulting in a reversal of approximately $0.1 million and payment of approximately $0.1 million. The amount of over accrual was immaterial. Also, in 2016, income taxes were estimated and accrued to represent taxes on our share, through the TRS, of the gains from the sales of certain SGO MN Joint Venture properties.\nPortfolio Investments\nAs of December 31, 2016, our portfolio included:\n \u2022 Investments in two joint ventures, which own property under development in Los Angeles, California that are expected to comprise 49,500 square feet upon completion. \n \u2022 Investments in two joint ventures, which own, in aggregate, 13 retail centers, including 4 centers classified as held for sale, comprising an aggregate of approximately 742,000 square feet and located in five states. \n \u2022 Twelve retail properties, including two properties classified as held for sale, comprising an aggregate of approximately 701,000 square feet of single- and multi-tenant, commercial retail space located in six states.  Results of Operations\nAs of December 31, 2016 and 2015, approximately 91% and 90% of our 12 retail properties was leased (based on rentable square footage), respectively, with weighted-average remaining lease terms of approximately four years and five years, respectively. In 2016, there were three property acquisitions and one property disposition. In 2015, there were no property acquisitions and six property dispositions.\nLeasing Information\nCommitted tenant improvement costs and leasing commissions for new leases during the year ended December 31, 2016 were $20.00 per square foot and $8.25 per square foot, respectively. Committed tenant improvement costs and leasing commissions for new leases during the year ended December 31, 2015 were $8.22 per square foot and $4.05 per square foot, respectively. The following table provides information regarding our leasing activity, excluding leasing activity in held for sale properties, for the year ended December 31, 2016.\n\nComparison of the year ended December 31, 2016, versus the year ended December 31, 2015.\nThe following table provides summary information about our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 (amounts in thousands):\n\nOur results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2016, are not necessarily indicative of those expected in future periods.\nRevenue\nThe decrease in revenue during the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to the same period in 2015, was primarily due to the sale of Aurora Commons, Constitution Trail, and Osceola Village in March 2015, Northgate Plaza, Moreno Marketplace and Summit Point in October 2015 and Bloomingdale Hills in April 2016. The sale of the three properties in March 2015 was completed in connection with the formation of the SGO Joint Venture (as described in Note 4. Investments in Unconsolidated Joint Ventures\u201d to the consolidated financial statements contained within this Annual Report on Form 10-K). The decrease was partially offset by revenue from the 2016 acquisitions of the San Francisco Properties, Fulton Shops and 450 Hayes.\nOperating and maintenance expenses\nThe decrease in operating and maintenance expenses during the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to the same period in 2015, was primarily the result of the sales of properties, partially offset by acquisitions of new properties, as discussed above.\nGeneral and administrative expenses\nThe decrease in general and administrative expenses during the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to the same period in 2015 was primarily due to reduced legal costs of $0.3 million with the resolution in 2015 of the class action lawsuit and the corresponding $0.3 million write-off of the remaining unamortized directors and officers insurance policy that covered the settlement. Additionally, asset management fees declined by approximately $76 thousand in 2016 due to the 2015 and 2016 sales of properties, partially offset by acquisitions of new properties in 2016.\nDepreciation and amortization expenses\nThe decrease in depreciation and amortization expenses during the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to the same period in 2015 was also attributed to the 2015 and 2016 sales of properties, partially offset by the acquisitions of new properties in 2016. The classification of Pinehurst and Woodland as held for sale during the fourth quarter of 2016 also contributed to the decrease in depreciation and amortization expenses.\nTransaction expense\nThe increase in transaction expenses during the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to the same period in 2015 is primarily due to acquisition costs related to our investments in the San Francisco Properties, Fulton Shops and 450 Hayes. Refer to Note 3. Real Estate Investments\u201d to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our portion of disposition fees related to sales of certain SGO MN Joint Venture properties also contributed to the increase in transaction expenses.\nInterest expense\nThe decrease in interest expense during the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to the same period in 2015 was primarily due to loan pay-offs using the proceeds from the sales of Aurora Commons, Constitution Trail, and Osceola Village in March 2015, the sales of Northgate Plaza, Moreno Marketplace and Summit Point in October 2015, and the sale of Bloomingdale Hills in April 2016.\nOther income (loss), net\nOther loss, net for the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily consisted of approximately $1.0 million related to prepayment penalties on extinguishment of debt, as well as the write-off of unamortized loan fees related to the sale of Bloomingdale Hills in April 2016. This was partially offset by the gain on sale of Bloomingdale Hills of approximately $0.6 million. Other income, net for the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily consisted of the net gain of approximately $20.9 million gain resulting from the disposal of properties and was partially offset by an approximately $3.4 million loss resulting from the early extinguishment of debt associated with the disposed properties.\nIncome taxes\nWe have elected to treat one of our subsidiaries as a taxable REIT subsidiary ( TRS\u201d). In general, a TRS may engage in any real estate business and certain non-real estate businesses, subject to certain limitations under the Internal Revenue Code. A TRS is subject to federal and state income taxes. For the year ended December 31, 2016, income taxes primarily include taxes on our share of the net gains from sales of certain SGO MN Joint Venture properties. This is partially offset by the reversal of an over accrual of estimated alternative minimum state/federal taxes, which was accrued and included in expenses as of December 31, 2015. The over accrual was determined to be immaterial and was the result of finalizing, in 2016, the calculation of taxes owed for 2015.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nSince our inception, our principal demand for funds has been for the acquisition of real estate, the payment of operating expenses and interest on our outstanding indebtedness, the payment of distributions to our stockholders and investments in unconsolidated joint ventures and development properties. On February 7, 2013, we ceased offering shares of our common stock in our primary offering and under our distribution reinvestment plan. As a result of the termination of our initial public offering, offering proceeds from the sale of our securities are not currently available to fund our cash needs. We have used and expect to continue to use debt financing, net sales proceeds and cash flow from operations to fund our cash needs.\nAs of December 31, 2016, our cash and cash equivalents were approximately $3.1 million and our restricted cash (funds held by the lenders for property taxes, insurance, tenant improvements, leasing commissions, capital expenditures, rollover reserves and other financing needs) was approximately $4.7 million. For properties with lender reserves, we may draw upon such reserves to fund the specific needs for which the funds were established.\nOur aggregate borrowings, secured and unsecured, are reviewed by our board of directors at least quarterly. Under our Articles of Amendment and Restatement, as amended, which we refer to as our charter,\u201d we are prohibited from borrowing in excess of 300% of the value of our net assets. Net assets for purposes of this calculation is defined to be our total assets (other than intangibles), valued at cost prior to deducting depreciation, reserves for bad debts and other non-cash reserves, less total liabilities. The preceding calculation is generally expected to approximate 75% of the aggregate cost of our assets before non-cash reserves and depreciation. However, we may temporarily borrow in excess of these amounts if such excess is approved by a majority of the independent directors and disclosed to stockholders in our next quarterly report, along with an explanation for such excess. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, our borrowings were approximately 105.2% and 65.3%, respectively, of the carrying value of our net assets.\nThe following table summarizes, for the periods indicated, selected items in our consolidated statements of cash flows (amounts in thousands):\n\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\nThe decrease in cash flows from operating activities was primarily due to a decrease in operating losses combined with adjustments for non-cash items aggregating approximately $0.7 million, as well as an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses in 2016 as compared to 2015 due to the consolidation of the variable interest entities ( VIEs\u201d).\nCash Flows from Investing Activities\nThe change in cash flows from investing activities was primarily due to our investments in the Wilshire and Gelson's Joint Ventures during the first quarter of 2016, consisting of land and building under development and development costs, of approximately $29.4 million, as well as our acquisitions of the San Francisco Properties in June 2016, our acquisition of the Fulton Shops in July 2016 and our acquisition of 450 Hayes in December 2016, which, in aggregate, consisted of land and buildings totaling $17.8 million. Cash flows from investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2015 consisted of proceeds of $103.1 million, before the pay down of debt, from the sale of Aurora Commons, Constitution Trail, Osceola Village, Moreno Marketplace, Northgate Plaza and Summit Point.\nCash Flows from Financing Activities\nThe change in cash flows from financing activities was primarily due to loan proceeds during the year ended December 31, 2016, of approximately $47.6 million in connection with our investments in the Wilshire and Gelson's Joint Ventures and additional draws under Key Bank Credit Facility, compared to the pay down of debt in the amount of $86.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2015 resulting from the sales of Aurora Commons, Constitution Trail, Osceola Village, Moreno Marketplace, Northgate Plaza and Summit Point.\nShort-term Liquidity and Capital Resources\nOur principal short-term demand for funds is for the payment of operating expenses, the payment of principal and interest on our outstanding indebtedness and distributions. To date, our cash needs for operations have been covered from cash provided by property operations, the sales of properties and the sale of shares of our common stock. Due to the termination of our initial public offering on February 7, 2013, we may fund our short-term operating cash needs from operations, from the sales of properties and from debt.\nLong-term Liquidity and Capital Resources\nOn a long-term basis, our principal demand for funds will be for real estate and real estate-related investments and the payment of acquisition-related expenses, operating expenses, distributions to stockholders, future redemptions of shares and interest and principal payments on current and future indebtedness. Generally, we intend to meet cash needs for items other than acquisitions and acquisition-related expenses from our cash flow from operations, debt and sales of properties. Until the termination of our initial public offering on February 7, 2013, our cash needs for acquisitions were satisfied from the net proceeds of the public offering and from debt financings. On a long-term basis, we expect that substantially all cash generated from operations will be used to pay distributions to our stockholders after satisfying our operating expenses including interest and principal payments. We may consider future public offerings or private placements of equity. Refer to Note 8. Notes Payable, Net\u201d to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information on the maturity dates and terms of our outstanding indebtedness.\nRecent Financing Transactions\nKeyBank Credit Facility\nThe KeyBank Credit Facility was scheduled to mature on August 4, 2017. Effective February 15, 2017, the KeyBank Credit Facility was refinanced and the new maturity date is February 15, 2020. Refer to Subsequent Events\u201d for further details.We have the right to prepay the Credit Facility in whole at any time or in part from time to time, subject to the payment of certain expenses, costs or liabilities potentially incurred by the lenders as a result of the prepayment and subject to certain other conditions contained in the loan documents.\nEach loan made pursuant to the Credit Facility is either a LIBOR rate loan or a base rate loan, at our election, plus an applicable margin, as defined. Monthly payments are interest only with the entire principal balance and all outstanding interest due at maturity. We pay KeyBank an unused commitment fee, quarterly in arrears, which accrues at 0.30% per annum if the usage under the Credit Facility is less than or equal to 50% of the Facility Amount, and 0.20% per annum if the usage under the Amended and Restated Credit Facility is greater than 50% of the Facility Amount.\nWe are responsible for all of our obligations under the Credit Facility and all other loan documents in connection with the Credit Facility. We also paid Glenborough a financing coordination fee of approximately $0.3 million in connection with the KeyBank Credit Facility.\nOn August 4, 2014, as required by the Amended and Restated Credit Facility, the OP contributed 100% of its sole membership interest in SRT Constitution Trail, LLC, which owns the Constitution Trail property, to SRT Secured Holdings, LLC ( Secured Holdings\u201d) (the Constitution Transaction\u201d). At the time, Secured Holdings was jointly owned by the OP and SRT Secured Holdings Manager, LLC ( SRT Manager\u201d), an affiliate of Glenborough. Prior to the Constitution Transaction, the OP owned 88% of the membership interests in Secured Holdings and SRT Manager owned 12% of the membership interests in Secured Holdings. Following the Constitution Transaction, the OP owned 91.67% of the membership interests in Secured Holdings and SRT Manager owned 8.33% of the membership interests in Secured Holdings, which was derived based on the fair value of the properties as of the date of the contribution. In March 2015, Secured Holdings paid SRT Manager $2.1 million in full redemption of SRT Manager's 8.33% membership interest in Secured Holdings.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, the following transactions occurred under the KeyBank Credit Facility:\n \u2022 In connection with the sale of Constitution Trail and Aurora Commons to the SGO Joint Venture on March 11, 2015 (refer to Note 4. Investment in Unconsolidated Joint Ventures\u201d to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report), we used a portion of the net proceeds from the sale of Constitution Trail to pay off the entire $19.0 million outstanding balance. \n \u2022 On October 29, 2015, we drew $4.0 million and used the loan proceeds, along with the proceeds from the sale of Moreno Marketplace and Northgate Plaza, to pay off a portion of the outstanding secured term loans. On November 2, 2015, we paid off the entire $4.0 million draw. \n \u2022 On March 7, 2016, we drew $6.0 million and used the proceeds to invest in the Wilshire Joint Venture. Refer to Note 5. Variable Interest Entities\u201d to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information. \n \u2022 On April 4, 2016, we consummated the disposition of Bloomingdale Hills, located in Riverside, Florida, for a sales price of approximately $9.2 million in cash, $3.0 million of which was used to pay down the line of credit. \n \u2022 On June 9, 2016, we drew approximately $7.5 million, the majority of which was used to fund the purchase of the San Francisco Properties. Refer to Note 3. Real Estate Investments\u201d to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information. \n \u2022 On July 25, 2016, we drew $4.7 million and used the majority of the proceeds to acquire the Fulton Shops. Refer to Note 3. Real Estate Investments\u201d to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information. \n \u2022 On September 29, 2016, we drew $1.0 million to be used for working capital. \n \u2022 On October 7, 2016, we paid down $2.0 million. \n \u2022 On December 22, 2016, we drew $7.2 million and used the proceeds to acquire 450 Hayes. Refer to Note 3. Real Estate Investments\u201d to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information. \n \u2022 On December 27, 2016, we drew $2.0 million to be used for working capital.  Mortgage Loans Secured by Properties Under Development\nIn connection with our investment in the Wilshire Joint Venture and the acquisition of the Wilshire Property (as defined in Note 5, Variable Interest Entities\u201d to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K), we have consolidated borrowings of $8.5 million (the Wilshire Loan\u201d) from Buchanan Mortgage Holdings, LLC (as the lender) and 3032 Wilshire Investors, LLC (as the borrower). The Wilshire Loan bears interest at a rate of 10.0% per annum, payable monthly commencing on April 1, 2016. The loan matures on March 7, 2017, with an option to extend for two additional six-month periods, subject to certain conditions as stated in the loan agreement. All conditions to extensions were met, and on March 7, 2017, we exercised the option to extend the loan for six months. The new maturity date is September 7, 2017. The loan is secured by, among other things, a lien on the Wilshire development project and other collateral as defined in the loan agreement.\nIn connection with our investment in the Gelson's Joint Venture (as defined in Note 5, Variable Interest Entities\u201d to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K) and the acquisition of the Gelson's Property, we have consolidated borrowings of $10.7 million (the Gelson's Loan\u201d) from Buchanan Mortgage Holdings, LLC (as the lender) and Sunset and Gardner Investors, LLC (as the borrower). The Gelson's Loan bears interest at a rate of 9.5% per annum, payable monthly commencing on April 1, 2016. The loan matures on January 27, 2017, with an option to extend for an additional six-month period, subject to certain conditions as stated in the loan agreement. Those conditions were not met but we\nnegotiated a six month extension of the term on January 27, 2017. The new maturity date is July 27, 2017. The loan is secured by, among other things, a lien on the Gelson's development project and other collateral as defined in the loan agreement.\nGuidelines on Total Operating Expenses\nWe reimburse our Advisor for some expenses paid or incurred by our Advisor in connection with the services provided to us, except that we will not reimburse our Advisor for any amount by which our total operating expenses at the end of the four preceding fiscal quarters exceed the greater of (1) 2% of our average invested assets, as defined in our charter; and (2) 25% of our net income, as defined in our charter, or the 2%/25% Guidelines\u201d unless a majority of our independent directors determines that such excess expenses are justified based on unusual and non-recurring factors. For the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, our total operating expenses did not exceed the 2%/25% Guidelines.\nInflation\nThe majority of our leases at our properties contain inflation protection provisions applicable to reimbursement billings for common area maintenance charges, real estate tax and insurance reimbursements on a per square foot basis, or in some cases, annual reimbursement of operating expenses above a certain per square foot allowance. We expect to include similar provisions in our future tenant leases designed to protect us from the impact of inflation. Due to the generally long-term nature of these leases, annual rent increases, as well as rents received from acquired leases, may not be sufficient to cover inflation and rent may be below market rates.\nREIT Compliance\nTo qualify as a REIT for tax purposes, we are required to annually distribute at least 90% of our REIT taxable income, subject to certain adjustments, to our stockholders. We must also meet certain asset and income tests, as well as other requirements. If we fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, we will be subject to federal income tax (including any applicable alternative minimum tax) on our taxable income at regular corporate rates and generally will not be permitted to qualify for treatment as a REIT for federal income tax purposes for the four taxable years following the year during which our REIT qualification is lost unless the IRS grants us relief under certain statutory provisions. Such an event could materially adversely affect our net income and net cash available for distribution to our stockholders. In 2015, we made a special distribution to stockholders to preserve our REIT status based on underreporting of federal taxable income in 2011 (the Special Distribution\u201d).\nQuarterly Distributions\nAs set forth above, in order to qualify as a REIT, we are required to distribute at least 90% of our annual REIT taxable income, subject to certain adjustments, to our stockholders.\nUnder the terms of the Key Bank Credit Facility, we may pay distributions to our stockholders so long as the total amount paid does not exceed certain thresholds specified in the Key Bank Credit Facility provided; however, that we are not restricted from making any distributions necessary in order to maintain our status as a REIT. Our board of directors will continue to evaluate the amount of future quarterly distributions based on our operational cash needs.\nSome or all of our distributions have been paid, and in the future may continue to be paid, from sources other than cash flows from operations.\nFor a presentation of our quarterly distributions, not including Special Distributions, declared and paid to our common stockholders and holders of our common units and for information concerning the tax composition of our distributions paid, refer to Item 5. Market for Registrant's Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities.\u201d\nSpecial Distribution\nIn June 2011, we acquired a debt obligation (the Distressed Debt\u201d) for $18 million under our prior advisor, TNP Strategic Retail Advisor, LLC. In October 2011, we received the underlying collateral (the Collateral\u201d) with respect to the Distressed Debt in full settlement of our debt claim (the Settlement\u201d). At the time of the Settlement, we received an independent valuation of the Collateral's fair market value ( FMV\u201d) of $27.6 million. The Settlement resulted in taxable income to us in an amount equal to the FMV of the Collateral less our adjusted basis for tax purposes in the Distressed Debt. Such income was not properly reported on our 2011 federal income tax return, and we did not make a sufficient distribution of taxable income for purposes of the REIT qualification rules (the 2011 Underreporting\u201d). We believe that we were able to rectify the 2011 Underreporting by making a special distribution (the Special Distribution\u201d) to our stockholders.\nOn August 7, 2015, the board of directors authorized the Special Distribution of approximately $2.3 million on our common stock as of the close of business on August 10, 2015 (the Record Date\u201d). The Special Distribution was payable in cash, common stock or a combination of cash and common stock to, and at the election of, the stockholders of record as of the Record Date, provided, however, that the total amount of cash payable to all stockholders in the Special Distribution was\napproximately $0.5 million (the Cash Amount\u201d), with the balance of the Special Distribution, or approximately $1.8 million (the Share Amount\u201d), payable in the form of shares of common stock. Stockholders who did not return an election form, or who otherwise failed to properly complete an election form, before the deadline, received their pro rata portion of the Special Dividend entirely in shares of common stock.\nOn November 4, 2015, we paid approximately $0.5 million in cash and issued 273,729 shares of common stock having a value of approximately $1.8 million pursuant to the Special Distribution. On December 30, 2015, we paid an additional $0.1 million in cash to correct errors made by the third party transfer agent in connection with the November 4, 2015 payment pursuant to the Special Distribution. Although we believe the Special Distribution allowed us to maintain our qualification as a REIT, there can be no complete assurance in this regard.\nFunds From Operations\nFunds from operations ( FFO\u201d) is a supplemental non-GAAP financial measure of a real estate company's operating performance. The National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, or NAREIT\u201d, an industry trade group, has promulgated this supplemental performance measure and defines FFO as net income, computed in accordance with GAAP, plus real estate related depreciation and amortization and excluding extraordinary items and gains and losses on the sale of real estate, and after adjustments for unconsolidated joint ventures (adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures are calculated to reflect FFO.) It is important to note that not only is FFO not equivalent to our net income or loss as determined under GAAP, it also does not represent cash flows from operating activities in accordance with GAAP. FFO should not be considered an alternative to net income as an indication of our performance, nor is FFO necessarily indicative of cash flow as a measure of liquidity or our ability to fund cash needs, including the payment of distributions.\nWe consider FFO to be a meaningful, additional measure of operating performance and one that is an appropriate supplemental disclosure for an equity REIT due to its widespread acceptance and use within the REIT and analyst communities. Comparison of our presentation of FFO to similarly titled measures for other REITs may not necessarily be meaningful due to possible differences in the application of the NAREIT definition used by such REITs.\nOur calculation of FFO attributable to common shares and Common Units and the reconciliation of net income (loss) to FFO is as follows (amounts in thousands, except shares and per share amounts):\n\n (1) Our Common Units have the right to convert a unit into common stock for a one-to-one conversion. Therefore, we are including the related non-controlling interest income/loss attributable to Common Units in the computation of FFO and including the Common Units together with weighted average shares outstanding for the computation of FFO per share and Common Unit. \n (2) Where applicable, adjustments exclude amounts attributable to membership interest. \nRelated Party Transactions and Agreements\nWe are currently party to the Advisory Agreement, pursuant to which the Advisor manages our business in exchange for specified fees paid for services related to the investment of funds in real estate and real estate-related investments, management of our investments and for other services. Refer to Note 12. Related Party Transactions\u201d to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of the Advisory Agreement and other related party transactions, agreements and fees.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nOur off-balance sheet arrangements consist primarily of our investments in joint ventures and are described in Note 4. Investments in Unconsolidated Joint Ventures\u201d in the notes to the consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our joint ventures typically fund their cash needs through secured debt financings obtained by and in the name of the joint venture entity. The joint ventures' debts are secured by a first mortgage, are without recourse to the joint venture partners, and do not represent a liability of the partners other than carve-out guarantees for", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our accompanying consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included in this Annual Report. Also refer to Forward Looking Statements\u201d preceding Part I.\nAs used herein, the terms we,\u201d our,\u201d us,\u201d and Company\u201d refer to Strategic Realty Trust, Inc., formerly TNP Strategic Retail Trust, Inc., and, as required by context, Strategic Realty Operating Partnership, L.P., formerly TNP Strategic Retail Operating Partnership, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership, which we refer to as our operating partnership\u201d or OP\u201d, and to their respective subsidiaries. References to shares\u201d and our common stock\u201d refer to the shares of our common stock.\nOverview\nWe are a Maryland corporation that was formed on September 18, 2008, to invest in and manage a portfolio of income-producing retail properties, located in the United States, real estate-owning entities and real estate-related assets, including the investment in or origination of mortgage, mezzanine, bridge and other loans related to commercial real estate. During the first quarter of 2016, we also invested, through joint ventures, in two significant retail projects under development. We have elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust ( REIT\u201d) for federal income tax purposes, commencing with the taxable year ended December 31, 2009, and we intend to operate in such a manner. We own substantially all of our assets and conduct our operations through our operating partnership, of which we are the sole general partner. We also own a majority of the outstanding limited partner interests in the operating partnership.\nOn November 4, 2008, we filed a registration statement on Form S-11 with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC\u201d) for our initial public offering of up to 100,000,000 shares of our common stock at $10.00 per share in our primary offering and up to 10,526,316 shares of our common stock to our stockholders at $9.50 per share pursuant to our distribution reinvestment plan ( DRIP\u201d). On August 7, 2009, the SEC declared our registration statement effective and we commenced our initial public offering. On February 7, 2013, we terminated our initial public offering and ceased offering shares of our common stock in our primary offering and under our DRIP.\nAs of February 2013 when we terminated the initial public offering, we had accepted subscriptions for, and issued, 10,688,940 shares of common stock in the initial public offering for gross offering proceeds of approximately $104.7 million, and 391,182 shares of common stock pursuant to the DRIP for gross offering proceeds of approximately $3.6 million. We have also granted 50,000 shares of restricted stock and we issued 273,729 shares of common stock to pay a portion of a special distribution. Refer to Part II, Item 5. Market for Registrant's Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities\u201d for details regarding the special distribution.\nOn April 1, 2015, our board of directors approved the reinstatement of the share redemption program and adopted the Amended and Restated Share Redemption Program (the SRP\u201d). The program was previously suspended, effective as of January 15, 2013. For more information regarding our share redemption program, refer to Part II, Item 5, Market for Registrant's Common Equity, Related Shareholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities - Share Redemption Program.\u201d Cumulatively, through December 31, 2016, we have redeemed 475,194 shares of common stock sold in the Offering for approximately $3.7 million.\nSince our inception, our business has been managed by an external advisor. We no longer have direct employees and all management and administrative personnel responsible for conducting our business are employed by our advisor. Currently we are externally managed and advised by SRT Advisor, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (the Advisor\u201d) pursuant to an advisory agreement with the Advisor (the Advisory Agreement\u201d) initially executed on August 10, 2013, and subsequently renewed in August 2014, August 2015 and August 2016. The current term of the Advisory Agreement terminates on August 10, 2017. The Advisor is an affiliate of Glenborough, LLC (together with its affiliates, Glenborough\u201d), a privately held full-service real estate investment and management company focused on the acquisition, management and leasing of commercial properties.\nBeginning in December 2012 and ending upon execution of the Advisory Agreement, Glenborough performed certain services for us pursuant to a consulting agreement ( Consulting Agreement\u201d). We entered the Consulting Agreement to assist us with the process of transitioning to a new external advisor, as well as to provide other services.\nMarket Outlook - Real Estate and Real Estate Finance Markets\nThe investment market for retail property slowed in 2016 while occupancy and rental fundamentals continued to improve. According to data from Jones Lang LaSalle ( JLL\u201d), sales of retail investment properties totaled $64.3 billion in 2016, down 18.7% from 2015. While sales volumes decreased, pricing increased with average cap rates of 4.4% down by 37 basis points from 2015. New supply remained in check, based on data from CoStar which saw deliveries of new space for the year of 52.1 million square feet which continues to track below the absorption of 88.5 million square feet helping to push down the vacancy rate approximately 50 basis points in 2016. The U.S retail vacancy rate at year end was 5.3% down from 5.8% at the end of 2015 according to CoStar. Solid rent growth for 2016 was reported with rents up 2.8% from a year ago according to JLL data and up 2.6% according to CoStar.\n2016 Significant Events\nProperty Acquisitions\n \u2022 On June 14, 2016, we, through an indirect subsidiary, purchased a 100% ownership interest in two retail properties located in the Hayes Valley neighborhood at 400 Grove Street and 8 Octavia Street in San Francisco, California (the San Francisco Properties\u201d). The San Francisco Properties encompass four retail condominiums with an aggregate of 5,640 square feet of retail space. The aggregate purchase price of the San Francisco Properties was approximately $5.6 million subject to customary closing costs and proration adjustments. We funded the purchase price using borrowings under the KeyBank Credit Facility. Refer to Note 8. Notes Payable, Net\u201d to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for details regarding the KeyBank Credit Facility. \n \u2022 On July 27, 2016, we purchased a 100% ownership interest in Fulton Street Shops located in San Francisco, California ( Fulton Shops\u201d). Fulton Shops is comprised of five high-quality street retail condominiums with an aggregate of 3,758 square feet of retail space. The aggregate purchase price of Fulton Shops was approximately $4.6 million subject to customary closing costs and proration adjustments. We drew down $4.7 million on the KeyBank Credit Facility to fund this acquisition. \n \u2022 On September 8, 2016, we paid a deposit in the amount of approximately $0.2 million toward the acquisition of a 100% ownership interest in certain property located in the Hayes Valley neighborhood at 388 Fulton Street in San Francisco, California ( 388 Fulton\u201d). The deposit was included in prepaid expenses and other assets, net on the consolidated balance sheets. 388 Fulton is comprised of two leased commercial condominiums with an aggregate of 3,110 square feet of retail space. The purchase of this retail property closed on January 4, 2017. Refer to Part II, Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Subsequent Events\u201d for details. \n \u2022 On December 22, 2016, in conjunction with the acquisition of the San Francisco Properties, we, through an indirect subsidiary, purchased a 100% ownership interest in certain property located in the Hayes Valley neighborhood at 450 Hayes Street in San Francisco, California ( 450 Hayes\u201d). 450 Hayes is comprised of two high-quality street retail condominiums with an aggregate of 3,724 square feet of retail space. The aggregate consideration of 450 Hayes was approximately $7.6 million subject to customary closing costs and proration adjustments. We drew down $7.2 million on the KeyBank credit facility to fund this acquisition. Refer to Note 8. Notes Payable, Net\u201d to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for details.  Property Disposition and Loan Pay-off\n \u2022 On April 4, 2016, we consummated the disposition of Bloomingdale Hills, located in Riverside, Florida, for a sales price of approximately $9.2 million in cash, a portion of which was used to pay off the related $5.3 million mortgage loan and $3.0 million of which was used to pay down the line of credit under our KeyBank Credit Facility.  Investments in Joint Ventures\n \u2022 On December 21, 2015, we, through wholly-owned subsidiaries, entered into the Limited Liability Company Agreement of 3032 Wilshire Investors, LLC (the Wilshire Joint Venture Agreement\u201d) to form a joint venture (the Wilshire Joint Venture\u201d) with an institutional investor in order to purchase property for redevelopment.The purchase of the property took place on March 8, 2016. \n \u2022 On January 7, 2016, we, through wholly-owned subsidiaries, entered into the Limited Liability Company Agreement of Sunset & Gardner Investors, LLC (the Gelson's Joint Venture Agreement\u201d) to form a joint venture (the Gelson's Joint Venture\u201d) with an institutional investor in order to purchase property for a build-to-suit grocery store. The purchase of the property took place in January 28, 2016.  Share Redemption under the Share Redemption Program\n \u2022 On August 10, 2016, the board of directors authorized our management to prepare and implement an amendment and restatement of the SRP (the Second A&R SRP\u201d) to revise the definition of disability under the SRP. The Second A&R SRP became effective August 26, 2016. Under the Second A&R SRP, a person is deemed to be disabled and therefore eligible to redeem shares pursuant to the Second A&R SRP if they are disabled pursuant to the definition of disability\u201d in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, at the time that the person's written redemption request is received by us. The other material terms of the Second A&R SRP are consistent with the terms of the First A&R SRP. \n \u2022 On October 5, 2016, the board of directors approved, pursuant to Section 3(a) of SRP, an additional $0.5 million of funds available for the redemption of shares in connection with the death of a stockholder. \n \u2022 During the year ended December 31, 2016, we redeemed 109,291 shares of common stock for $0.7 million under the SRP at an average price of $6.44 per share. \nReview of our Policies\nOur board of directors, including our independent directors, has reviewed our policies described in this Annual Report and determined that they are in the best interest of our stockholders because: (1) they increase the likelihood that we will be able to successfully maintain and manage our current portfolio of investments and acquire additional income-producing properties and other real estate-related investments in the future; (2) our executive officers, directors and affiliates of our Advisor have expertise with the type of properties in our current portfolio; and (3) to the extent that we acquire additional real properties or other real estate-related investments in the future, the use of leverage should enable us to acquire assets and earn rental income more quickly, thereby increasing the likelihood of generating income for our stockholders.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nBelow is a discussion of the accounting policies and estimates that management considers critical in that they involve significant management judgments and assumptions, require estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain and because they are important for understanding and evaluating our reported financial results. These judgments affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and our disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the consolidated financial\nstatements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. With different estimates or assumptions, materially different amounts could be reported in our consolidated financial statements. Additionally, other companies may utilize different estimates that may impact the comparability of our results of operations to those of companies in similar businesses.\nRevenue Recognition\nRevenues include minimum rents, expense recoveries and percentage rental payments. Minimum rents are recognized on an accrual basis over the terms of the related leases on a straight-line basis when collectability is reasonably assured and the tenant has taken possession or controls the physical use of the leased property. If the lease provides for tenant improvements, we determine whether the tenant improvements, for accounting purposes, are owned by the tenant or us. When we are the owner of the tenant improvements, the tenant is not considered to have taken physical possession or have control of the physical use of the leased asset until the tenant improvements are substantially completed. When the tenant is the owner of the tenant improvements, any tenant improvement allowance that is funded is treated as a lease incentive and amortized as a reduction of revenue over the lease term. Tenant improvement ownership is determined based on various factors including, but not limited to:\n \u2022 whether the lease stipulates how a tenant improvement allowance may be spent; \n \u2022 whether the amount of a tenant improvement allowance is in excess of market rates; \n \u2022 whether the tenant or landlord retains legal title to the improvements at the end of the lease term; \n \u2022 whether the tenant improvements are unique to the tenant or general-purpose in nature; and \n \u2022 whether the tenant improvements are expected to have any residual value at the end of the lease term.  For leases with minimum scheduled rent increases, we recognize income on a straight-line basis over the lease term when collectability is reasonably assured. Recognizing rental income on a straight-line basis for leases results in reported revenue amounts which differ from those that are contractually due from tenants. If we determine that collectability of straight-line rents is not reasonably assured, we limit future recognition to amounts contractually owed and paid, and, when appropriate, establish an allowance for estimated losses.\nWe maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts, including an allowance for straight-line rent receivables, for estimated losses resulting from tenant defaults or the inability of tenants to make contractual rent and tenant recovery payments. We monitor the liquidity and creditworthiness of our tenants on an ongoing basis. For straight-line rent amounts, our assessment is based on amounts estimated to be recoverable over the term of the lease.\nCertain leases contain provisions that require the payment of additional rents based on the respective tenants' sales volume (contingent or percentage rent) and substantially all contain provisions that require reimbursement of the tenants' allocable real estate taxes, insurance and common area maintenance costs ( CAM\u201d). Revenue based on percentage of tenants' sales is recognized only after the tenant exceeds its sales breakpoint. Revenue from tenant reimbursements of taxes, CAM and insurance is recognized in the period that the applicable costs are incurred in accordance with the lease agreement.\nWe recognize gains or losses on sales of real estate in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC\u201d) 360, Property, Plant, and Equipment. Profits are not recognized until (1) a sale has been consummated; (2) the buyer's initial and continuing investments are adequate to demonstrate a commitment to pay for the property; (3) our receivable, if any, is not subject to future subordination; and (4) we have transferred to the buyer the usual risks and reward of ownership, and we do not have a substantial continuing involvement with the property.\nInvestment in Real Estate\nReal property is recorded at estimated fair value at time of acquisition with subsequent additions at cost, less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Costs include those related to acquisition, development and construction, including tenant improvements, interest incurred during development, costs of predevelopment and certain direct and indirect costs of development.\nDepreciation and amortization is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets as follows:\nTable 97: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Buildings and improvements\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5 - 30 years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tenant improvements\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1 - 36 years\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTenant improvement costs recorded as capital assets are depreciated over the tenant's remaining lease term which we determined approximates the remaining useful life of the improvement.\nExpenditures for ordinary maintenance and repairs are expensed to operations as they are incurred. Significant renovations and improvements that improve or extend the useful lives of assets are capitalized.\nBusiness Combinations\nWe record the acquisition of income-producing real estate or real estate that will be used for the production of income as a business combination when the acquired property meets the definition of a business. Assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination are generally measured at their acquisition date fair values. Tenant improvements recognized represent the tangible assets associated with the existing leases valued on a fair value basis at the acquisition date, are classified as an asset under investments in real estate and are depreciated over the remaining lease terms. Identifiable intangible assets and liabilities relate to the value of in-place operating leases which come in three forms: (1) leasing commissions and legal costs, which represent the value associated with cost avoidance\u201d of acquiring in-place leases, such as lease commissions paid under terms generally experienced in markets in which we operate; (2) value of in-place leases, which represents the estimated loss of revenue and of costs incurred for the period required to lease the assumed vacant\u201d property to the occupancy level when purchased; and (3) above or below market value of in-place leases, which represents the difference between the contractual rents and market rents at the time of the acquisition, discounted for tenant credit risks. The value of in-place leases are recorded in acquired lease intangibles, and amortized over the remaining lease term. Above or below market-rate leases are classified in acquired lease intangibles, or in acquired below market lease intangibles, depending on whether the contractual terms are above or below market. Above market leases are amortized as a decrease to rental revenue over the remaining non-cancelable terms of the respective leases and below market leases are amortized as an increase to rental revenue over the remaining initial lease term and any fixed rate renewal periods, if applicable.\nAcquisition costs are expensed as incurred. Also included in transaction expense in the consolidated statements of operations are costs incurred in pursuit of targeted properties for acquisitions not yet closed or those determined to no longer be viable.\nEstimates of the fair values of the tangible assets, identifiable intangibles and assumed liabilities require us to make significant assumptions to estimate market lease rates, property operating expenses, carrying costs during lease-up periods, discount rates, market absorption periods, and the number of years the property will be held for investment. The use of inappropriate assumptions would result in an incorrect valuation of our acquired tangible assets, identifiable intangibles and assumed liabilities which would impact the amount of our net income. These allocations also impact the amount of revenue we recognize, depreciation expense and gains or losses recorded on future sales of properties.\nImpairment of Long-lived Assets\nWe continually monitor events and changes in circumstances that could indicate that the carrying amounts of our investments in real estate and related intangible assets may not be recoverable. When indicators of potential impairment suggest that the carrying value of real estate and related intangible assets may not be recoverable, we assess the recoverability by estimating whether we will recover the carrying value of the real estate and related intangible assets through its undiscounted future cash flows (excluding interest) and its eventual disposition. If, based on this analysis, we do not believe that we will be able to recover the carrying value of the real estate and related intangible assets and liabilities, we would record an impairment loss to the extent that the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of the investments in real estate and related intangible assets. Key inputs that we estimate in this analysis include projected rental rates, capital expenditures, property sales capitalization rates and expected holding period of the property.\nWe evaluate our equity investments for impairment in accordance with ASC 320, Investments - Debt and Securities ( ASC 320\u201d). ASC 320 provides guidance for determining when an investment is considered impaired, whether impairment is other-than-temporary, and measurement of an impairment loss.\nWe did not record any impairment loss on our investments in real estate and related intangible assets during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015. Refer to Part II, Item 5. Market for Registrant's Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities\u201d for more information regarding the methodologies used to estimate fair value of the investments in real estate.\nAssets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations\nWhen certain criteria are met, long-lived assets are classified as held for sale and are reported at the lower of their carrying value or their fair value less costs to sell and are no longer depreciated. With the adoption of Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-08, Presentation of Financial Statements and Property, Plant, and Equipment on April 30, 2014, only disposed properties that represent a strategic shift that has (or will have) a major effect on our operations and financial results are reported as discontinued operations.\nFair Value Measurements\nUnder generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP\u201d), we are required to measure or disclose certain financial instruments at fair value on a recurring basis. In addition, we are required to measure other financial instruments and balances at fair value on a non-recurring basis (e.g., carrying value of impaired real estate loans receivable and long-lived assets). Fair value is defined as the price that would be received upon the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The GAAP fair value framework uses a three-tiered approach. Fair value measurements are classified and disclosed in one of the following three categories:\n \u2022 Level 1: unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical assets or liabilities; \n \u2022 Level 2: quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active, and model-derived valuations in which significant inputs and significant value drivers are observable in active markets; and \n \u2022 Level 3: prices or valuation techniques where little or no market data is available for inputs that are significant to the fair value measurement.  When available, we utilize quoted market prices or other observable inputs (Level 2 inputs), such as interest rates or yield curves, from independent third-party sources to determine fair value and classify such items in Level 1 or Level 2. In instances where the market for a financial instrument is not active, regardless of the availability of a non-binding quoted market price, observable inputs might not be relevant and could require us to use significant judgment to derive a fair value measurement. Additionally, in an inactive market, a market price quoted from an independent third-party may rely more on models with inputs based on information available only to that independent third-party. When we determine the market for an asset owned by us to be illiquid or when market transactions for similar instruments do not appear orderly, we use several valuation sources (including internal valuations, discounted cash flow analysis and quoted market prices) and establish a fair value by assigning weights to the various valuation sources. Additionally, when determining the fair value of liabilities in circumstances in which a quoted price in an active market for an identical liability is not available, we measure fair value using (i) a valuation technique that uses the quoted price of the identical liability when traded as an asset or quoted prices for similar liabilities when traded as assets; or (ii) a present value technique that considers the future cash flows based on contractual obligations discounted by an observed or estimated market rates of comparable liabilities. The use of contractual cash flows with regard to amount and timing significantly reduces the judgment applied in arriving at fair value.\nChanges in assumptions or estimation methodologies can have a material effect on these estimated fair values. In this regard, the derived fair value estimates cannot be substantiated by comparison to independent markets and, in many cases, may not be realized in an immediate settlement of the instrument.\nWe consider the following factors to be indicators of an inactive market (1) there are few recent transactions; (2) price quotations are not based on current information; (3) price quotations vary substantially either over time or among market makers (for example, some brokered markets); (4) indexes that previously were highly correlated with the fair values of the asset or liability are demonstrably uncorrelated with recent indications of fair value for that asset or liability; (5) there is a significant increase in implied liquidity risk premiums, yields, or performance indicators (such as delinquency rates or loss severities) for observed transactions or quoted prices when compared with our estimate of expected cash flows, considering all available market data about credit and other nonperformance risk for the asset or liability; (6) there is a wide bid-ask spread or significant increase in the bid-ask spread; (7) there is a significant decline or absence of a market for new issuances (that is, a primary market) for the asset or liability or similar assets or liabilities; and (8) little information is released publicly (for example, a principal-to-principal market).\nWe consider the following factors to be indicators of non-orderly transactions (1) there was not adequate exposure to the market for a period before the measurement date to allow for marketing activities that are usual and customary for transactions involving such assets or liabilities under current market conditions; (2) there was a usual and customary marketing period, but the seller marketed the asset or liability to a single market participant; (3) the seller is in or near bankruptcy or receivership (that is, distressed), or the seller was required to sell to meet regulatory or legal requirements (that is, forced); and (4) the transaction price is an outlier when compared with other recent transactions for the same or similar assets or liabilities.\nIncome Taxes\nWe have elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code. To qualify as a REIT, we must meet certain organizational and operational requirements, including a requirement to distribute at least 90% of our annual REIT taxable income to stockholders (which is computed without regard to the dividends paid deduction or net capital gain and which does not necessarily equal results of operations as calculated in accordance with GAAP). As a REIT, we generally will not be subject to federal income tax on income that we distribute as dividends to our stockholders. If we fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, we will be subject to federal income tax on our taxable income at regular corporate income tax rates and generally\nwill not be permitted to qualify for treatment as a REIT for federal income tax purposes for the four taxable years following the year during which qualification is lost, unless the Internal Revenue Service grants us relief under certain statutory provisions. Such an event could materially and adversely affect our net income and net cash available for distribution to stockholders. However, we believe that we are organized and operate in such a manner as to qualify for treatment as a REIT. Even if we qualify as a REIT, we may be subject to certain state or local income taxes and to U.S. Federal income and excise taxes on our undistributed income.\nWe evaluate tax positions taken in the consolidated financial statements under the interpretation for accounting for uncertainty in income taxes. As a result of this evaluation, we may recognize a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more-likely-than-not\u201d that the tax position will be sustained on examination by taxing authorities.\nWhen necessary, deferred income taxes are recognized in certain taxable entities. Deferred income tax is generally a function of the period's temporary differences (items that are treated differently for tax purposes than for financial reporting purposes). A valuation allowance for deferred income tax assets is provided if all or some portion of the deferred income tax asset may not be realized. Any increase or decrease in the valuation allowance is generally included in deferred income tax expense.\nOur tax returns remain subject to examination and consequently, the taxability of our distributions is subject to change. During the year ended December 31 2015, we were subject to alternative minimum state/federal taxes totaling approximately $0.2 million. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we finalized our calculation of taxes owed for 2015, which was less than the recorded accrual, resulting in a reversal of approximately $0.1 million and payment of approximately $0.1 million. The amount of over accrual was immaterial. Also, in 2016, income taxes were estimated and accrued to represent taxes on our share, through the TRS, of the gains from the sales of certain SGO MN Joint Venture properties.\nPortfolio Investments\nAs of December 31, 2016, our portfolio included:\n \u2022 Investments in two joint ventures, which own property under development in Los Angeles, California that are expected to comprise 49,500 square feet upon completion. \n \u2022 Investments in two joint ventures, which own, in aggregate, 13 retail centers, including 4 centers classified as held for sale, comprising an aggregate of approximately 742,000 square feet and located in five states. \n \u2022 Twelve retail properties, including two properties classified as held for sale, comprising an aggregate of approximately 701,000 square feet of single- and multi-tenant, commercial retail space located in six states.  Results of Operations\nAs of December 31, 2016 and 2015, approximately 91% and 90% of our 12 retail properties was leased (based on rentable square footage), respectively, with weighted-average remaining lease terms of approximately four years and five years, respectively. In 2016, there were three property acquisitions and one property disposition. In 2015, there were no property acquisitions and six property dispositions.\nLeasing Information\nCommitted tenant improvement costs and leasing commissions for new leases during the year ended December 31, 2016 were $20.00 per square foot and $8.25 per square foot, respectively. Committed tenant improvement costs and leasing commissions for new leases during the year ended December 31, 2015 were $8.22 per square foot and $4.05 per square foot, respectively. The following table provides information regarding our leasing activity, excluding leasing activity in held for sale properties, for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nTable 104: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Vacant\nRentable\nSq.

The sale of the three properties in March 2015 was completed in connection with the formation of the SGO Joint Venture (as described in Note 4. Investments in Unconsolidated Joint Ventures\u201d to the consolidated financial statements contained within this Annual Report on Form 10-K). The decrease was partially offset by revenue from the 2016 acquisitions of the San Francisco Properties, Fulton Shops and 450 Hayes.\nOperating and maintenance expenses\nThe decrease in operating and maintenance expenses during the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to the same period in 2015, was primarily the result of the sales of properties, partially offset by acquisitions of new properties, as discussed above.\nGeneral and administrative expenses\nThe decrease in general and administrative expenses during the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to the same period in 2015 was primarily due to reduced legal costs of $0.3 million with the resolution in 2015 of the class action lawsuit and the corresponding $0.3 million write-off of the remaining unamortized directors and officers insurance policy that covered the settlement. Additionally, asset management fees declined by approximately $76 thousand in 2016 due to the 2015 and 2016 sales of properties, partially offset by acquisitions of new properties in 2016.\nDepreciation and amortization expenses\nThe decrease in depreciation and amortization expenses during the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to the same period in 2015 was also attributed to the 2015 and 2016 sales of properties, partially offset by the acquisitions of new properties in 2016. The classification of Pinehurst and Woodland as held for sale during the fourth quarter of 2016 also contributed to the decrease in depreciation and amortization expenses.\nTransaction expense\nThe increase in transaction expenses during the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to the same period in 2015 is primarily due to acquisition costs related to our investments in the San Francisco Properties, Fulton Shops and 450 Hayes. Refer to Note 3. Real Estate Investments\u201d to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our portion of disposition fees related to sales of certain SGO MN Joint Venture properties also contributed to the increase in transaction expenses.\nInterest expense\nThe decrease in interest expense during the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to the same period in 2015 was primarily due to loan pay-offs using the proceeds from the sales of Aurora Commons, Constitution Trail, and Osceola Village in March 2015, the sales of Northgate Plaza, Moreno Marketplace and Summit Point in October 2015, and the sale of Bloomingdale Hills in April 2016.\nOther income (loss), net\nOther loss, net for the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily consisted of approximately $1.0 million related to prepayment penalties on extinguishment of debt, as well as the write-off of unamortized loan fees related to the sale of Bloomingdale Hills in April 2016. This was partially offset by the gain on sale of Bloomingdale Hills of approximately $0.6 million. Other income, net for the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily consisted of the net gain of approximately $20.9 million gain resulting from the disposal of properties and was partially offset by an approximately $3.4 million loss resulting from the early extinguishment of debt associated with the disposed properties.\nIncome taxes\nWe have elected to treat one of our subsidiaries as a taxable REIT subsidiary ( TRS\u201d). In general, a TRS may engage in any real estate business and certain non-real estate businesses, subject to certain limitations under the Internal Revenue Code. A TRS is subject to federal and state income taxes. For the year ended December 31, 2016, income taxes primarily include taxes on our share of the net gains from sales of certain SGO MN Joint Venture properties. This is partially offset by the reversal of an over accrual of estimated alternative minimum state/federal taxes, which was accrued and included in expenses as of December 31, 2015. The over accrual was determined to be immaterial and was the result of finalizing, in 2016, the calculation of taxes owed for 2015.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nSince our inception, our principal demand for funds has been for the acquisition of real estate, the payment of operating expenses and interest on our outstanding indebtedness, the payment of distributions to our stockholders and investments in unconsolidated joint ventures and development properties. On February 7, 2013, we ceased offering shares of our common stock in our primary offering and under our distribution reinvestment plan. As a result of the termination of our initial public offering, offering proceeds from the sale of our securities are not currently available to fund our cash needs. We have used and expect to continue to use debt financing, net sales proceeds and cash flow from operations to fund our cash needs.\nAs of December 31, 2016, our cash and cash equivalents were approximately $3.1 million and our restricted cash (funds held by the lenders for property taxes, insurance, tenant improvements, leasing commissions, capital expenditures, rollover reserves and other financing needs) was approximately $4.7 million. For properties with lender reserves, we may draw upon such reserves to fund the specific needs for which the funds were established.\nOur aggregate borrowings, secured and unsecured, are reviewed by our board of directors at least quarterly. Under our Articles of Amendment and Restatement, as amended, which we refer to as our charter,\u201d we are prohibited from borrowing in excess of 300% of the value of our net assets. Net assets for purposes of this calculation is defined to be our total assets (other than intangibles), valued at cost prior to deducting depreciation, reserves for bad debts and other non-cash reserves, less total liabilities. The preceding calculation is generally expected to approximate 75% of the aggregate cost of our assets before non-cash reserves and depreciation. However, we may temporarily borrow in excess of these amounts if such excess is approved by a majority of the independent directors and disclosed to stockholders in our next quarterly report, along with an explanation for such excess. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, our borrowings were approximately 105.2% and 65.3%, respectively, of the carrying value of our net assets.\nThe following table summarizes, for the periods indicated, selected items in our consolidated statements of cash flows (amounts in thousands):\nTable 106: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$ Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by (used in):\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,391\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,764\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(373\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investing activities\n</td> <td>(38,585\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>96,189\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(134,774\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Financing activities\n</td> <td>31,531\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(92,371\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>123,902\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(5,663\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,582\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\nThe decrease in cash flows from operating activities was primarily due to a decrease in operating losses combined with adjustments for non-cash items aggregating approximately $0.7 million, as well as an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses in 2016 as compared to 2015 due to the consolidation of the variable interest entities ( VIEs\u201d).\nCash Flows from Investing Activities\nThe change in cash flows from investing activities was primarily due to our investments in the Wilshire and Gelson's Joint Ventures during the first quarter of 2016, consisting of land and building under development and development costs, of approximately $29.4 million, as well as our acquisitions of the San Francisco Properties in June 2016, our acquisition of the Fulton Shops in July 2016 and our acquisition of 450 Hayes in December 2016, which, in aggregate, consisted of land and buildings totaling $17.8 million. Cash flows from investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2015 consisted of proceeds of $103.1 million, before the pay down of debt, from the sale of Aurora Commons, Constitution Trail, Osceola Village, Moreno Marketplace, Northgate Plaza and Summit Point.\nCash Flows from Financing Activities\nThe change in cash flows from financing activities was primarily due to loan proceeds during the year ended December 31, 2016, of approximately $47.6 million in connection with our investments in the Wilshire and Gelson's Joint Ventures and additional draws under Key Bank Credit Facility, compared to the pay down of debt in the amount of $86.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2015 resulting from the sales of Aurora Commons, Constitution Trail, Osceola Village, Moreno Marketplace, Northgate Plaza and Summit Point.\nShort-term Liquidity and Capital Resources\nOur principal short-term demand for funds is for the payment of operating expenses, the payment of principal and interest on our outstanding indebtedness and distributions. To date, our cash needs for operations have been covered from cash provided by property operations, the sales of properties and the sale of shares of our common stock. Due to the termination of our initial public offering on February 7, 2013, we may fund our short-term operating cash needs from operations, from the sales of properties and from debt.\nLong-term Liquidity and Capital Resources\nOn a long-term basis, our principal demand for funds will be for real estate and real estate-related investments and the payment of acquisition-related expenses, operating expenses, distributions to stockholders, future redemptions of shares and interest and principal payments on current and future indebtedness. Generally, we intend to meet cash needs for items other than acquisitions and acquisition-related expenses from our cash flow from operations, debt and sales of properties. Until the termination of our initial public offering on February 7, 2013, our cash needs for acquisitions were satisfied from the net proceeds of the public offering and from debt financings. On a long-term basis, we expect that substantially all cash generated from operations will be used to pay distributions to our stockholders after satisfying our operating expenses including interest and principal payments. We may consider future public offerings or private placements of equity. Refer to Note 8. Notes Payable, Net\u201d to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information on the maturity dates and terms of our outstanding indebtedness.\nRecent Financing Transactions\nKeyBank Credit Facility\nThe KeyBank Credit Facility was scheduled to mature on August 4, 2017. Effective February 15, 2017, the KeyBank Credit Facility was refinanced and the new maturity date is February 15, 2020. Refer to Subsequent Events\u201d for further details.We have the right to prepay the Credit Facility in whole at any time or in part from time to time, subject to the payment of certain expenses, costs or liabilities potentially incurred by the lenders as a result of the prepayment and subject to certain other conditions contained in the loan documents.\nEach loan made pursuant to the Credit Facility is either a LIBOR rate loan or a base rate loan, at our election, plus an applicable margin, as defined. Monthly payments are interest only with the entire principal balance and all outstanding interest due at maturity. We pay KeyBank an unused commitment fee, quarterly in arrears, which accrues at 0.30% per annum if the usage under the Credit Facility is less than or equal to 50% of the Facility Amount, and 0.20% per annum if the usage under the Amended and Restated Credit Facility is greater than 50% of the Facility Amount.\nWe are responsible for all of our obligations under the Credit Facility and all other loan documents in connection with the Credit Facility. We also paid Glenborough a financing coordination fee of approximately $0.3 million in connection with the KeyBank Credit Facility.\nOn August 4, 2014, as required by the Amended and Restated Credit Facility, the OP contributed 100% of its sole membership interest in SRT Constitution Trail, LLC, which owns the Constitution Trail property, to SRT Secured Holdings, LLC ( Secured Holdings\u201d) (the Constitution Transaction\u201d). At the time, Secured Holdings was jointly owned by the OP and SRT Secured Holdings Manager, LLC ( SRT Manager\u201d), an affiliate of Glenborough. Prior to the Constitution Transaction, the OP owned 88% of the membership interests in Secured Holdings and SRT Manager owned 12% of the membership interests in Secured Holdings. Following the Constitution Transaction, the OP owned 91.67% of the membership interests in Secured Holdings and SRT Manager owned 8.33% of the membership interests in Secured Holdings, which was derived based on the fair value of the properties as of the date of the contribution. In March 2015, Secured Holdings paid SRT Manager $2.1 million in full redemption of SRT Manager's 8.33% membership interest in Secured Holdings.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, the following transactions occurred under the KeyBank Credit Facility:\n \u2022 In connection with the sale of Constitution Trail and Aurora Commons to the SGO Joint Venture on March 11, 2015 (refer to Note 4. Investment in Unconsolidated Joint Ventures\u201d to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report), we used a portion of the net proceeds from the sale of Constitution Trail to pay off the entire $19.0 million outstanding balance. \n \u2022 On October 29, 2015, we drew $4.0 million and used the loan proceeds, along with the proceeds from the sale of Moreno Marketplace and Northgate Plaza, to pay off a portion of the outstanding secured term loans. On November 2, 2015, we paid off the entire $4.0 million draw. \n \u2022 On March 7, 2016, we drew $6.0 million and used the proceeds to invest in the Wilshire Joint Venture. Refer to Note 5. Variable Interest Entities\u201d to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information. \n \u2022 On April 4, 2016, we consummated the disposition of Bloomingdale Hills, located in Riverside, Florida, for a sales price of approximately $9.2 million in cash, $3.0 million of which was used to pay down the line of credit. \n \u2022 On June 9, 2016, we drew approximately $7.5 million, the majority of which was used to fund the purchase of the San Francisco Properties. Refer to Note 3.

Mortgage Loans Secured by Properties Under Development\nIn connection with our investment in the Wilshire Joint Venture and the acquisition of the Wilshire Property (as defined in Note 5, Variable Interest Entities\u201d to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K), we have consolidated borrowings of $8.5 million (the Wilshire Loan\u201d) from Buchanan Mortgage Holdings, LLC (as the lender) and 3032 Wilshire Investors, LLC (as the borrower). The Wilshire Loan bears interest at a rate of 10.0% per annum, payable monthly commencing on April 1, 2016. The loan matures on March 7, 2017, with an option to extend for two additional six-month periods, subject to certain conditions as stated in the loan agreement. All conditions to extensions were met, and on March 7, 2017, we exercised the option to extend the loan for six months. The new maturity date is September 7, 2017. The loan is secured by, among other things, a lien on the Wilshire development project and other collateral as defined in the loan agreement.\nIn connection with our investment in the Gelson's Joint Venture (as defined in Note 5, Variable Interest Entities\u201d to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K) and the acquisition of the Gelson's Property, we have consolidated borrowings of $10.7 million (the Gelson's Loan\u201d) from Buchanan Mortgage Holdings, LLC (as the lender) and Sunset and Gardner Investors, LLC (as the borrower). The Gelson's Loan bears interest at a rate of 9.5% per annum, payable monthly commencing on April 1, 2016. The loan matures on January 27, 2017, with an option to extend for an additional six-month period, subject to certain conditions as stated in the loan agreement. Those conditions were not met but we\nnegotiated a six month extension of the term on January 27, 2017. The new maturity date is July 27, 2017. The loan is secured by, among other things, a lien on the Gelson's development project and other collateral as defined in the loan agreement.\nGuidelines on Total Operating Expenses\nWe reimburse our Advisor for some expenses paid or incurred by our Advisor in connection with the services provided to us, except that we will not reimburse our Advisor for any amount by which our total operating expenses at the end of the four preceding fiscal quarters exceed the greater of (1) 2% of our average invested assets, as defined in our charter; and (2) 25% of our net income, as defined in our charter, or the 2%/25% Guidelines\u201d unless a majority of our independent directors determines that such excess expenses are justified based on unusual and non-recurring factors. For the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, our total operating expenses did not exceed the 2%/25% Guidelines.\nInflation\nThe majority of our leases at our properties contain inflation protection provisions applicable to reimbursement billings for common area maintenance charges, real estate tax and insurance reimbursements on a per square foot basis, or in some cases, annual reimbursement of operating expenses above a certain per square foot allowance. We expect to include similar provisions in our future tenant leases designed to protect us from the impact of inflation. Due to the generally long-term nature of these leases, annual rent increases, as well as rents received from acquired leases, may not be sufficient to cover inflation and rent may be below market rates.\nREIT Compliance\nTo qualify as a REIT for tax purposes, we are required to annually distribute at least 90% of our REIT taxable income, subject to certain adjustments, to our stockholders. We must also meet certain asset and income tests, as well as other requirements. If we fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, we will be subject to federal income tax (including any applicable alternative minimum tax) on our taxable income at regular corporate rates and generally will not be permitted to qualify for treatment as a REIT for federal income tax purposes for the four taxable years following the year during which our REIT qualification is lost unless the IRS grants us relief under certain statutory provisions. Such an event could materially adversely affect our net income and net cash available for distribution to our stockholders. In 2015, we made a special distribution to stockholders to preserve our REIT status based on underreporting of federal taxable income in 2011 (the Special Distribution\u201d).\nQuarterly Distributions\nAs set forth above, in order to qualify as a REIT, we are required to distribute at least 90% of our annual REIT taxable income, subject to certain adjustments, to our stockholders.\nUnder the terms of the Key Bank Credit Facility, we may pay distributions to our stockholders so long as the total amount paid does not exceed certain thresholds specified in the Key Bank Credit Facility provided; however, that we are not restricted from making any distributions necessary in order to maintain our status as a REIT. Our board of directors will continue to evaluate the amount of future quarterly distributions based on our operational cash needs.\nSome or all of our distributions have been paid, and in the future may continue to be paid, from sources other than cash flows from operations.\nFor a presentation of our quarterly distributions, not including Special Distributions, declared and paid to our common stockholders and holders of our common units and for information concerning the tax composition of our distributions paid, refer to Item 5. Market for Registrant's Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities.\u201d\nSpecial Distribution\nIn June 2011, we acquired a debt obligation (the Distressed Debt\u201d) for $18 million under our prior advisor, TNP Strategic Retail Advisor, LLC. In October 2011, we received the underlying collateral (the Collateral\u201d) with respect to the Distressed Debt in full settlement of our debt claim (the Settlement\u201d). At the time of the Settlement, we received an independent valuation of the Collateral's fair market value ( FMV\u201d) of $27.6 million. The Settlement resulted in taxable income to us in an amount equal to the FMV of the Collateral less our adjusted basis for tax purposes in the Distressed Debt. Such income was not properly reported on our 2011 federal income tax return, and we did not make a sufficient distribution of taxable income for purposes of the REIT qualification rules (the 2011 Underreporting\u201d). We believe that we were able to rectify the 2011 Underreporting by making a special distribution (the Special Distribution\u201d) to our stockholders.\nOn August 7, 2015, the board of directors authorized the Special Distribution of approximately $2.3 million on our common stock as of the close of business on August 10, 2015 (the Record Date\u201d). The Special Distribution was payable in cash, common stock or a combination of cash and common stock to, and at the election of, the stockholders of record as of the Record Date, provided, however, that the total amount of cash payable to all stockholders in the Special Distribution was\napproximately $0.5 million (the Cash Amount\u201d), with the balance of the Special Distribution, or approximately $1.8 million (the Share Amount\u201d), payable in the form of shares of common stock. Stockholders who did not return an election form, or who otherwise failed to properly complete an election form, before the deadline, received their pro rata portion of the Special Dividend entirely in shares of common stock.\nOn November 4, 2015, we paid approximately $0.5 million in cash and issued 273,729 shares of common stock having a value of approximately $1.8 million pursuant to the Special Distribution. On December 30, 2015, we paid an additional $0.1 million in cash to correct errors made by the third party transfer agent in connection with the November 4, 2015 payment pursuant to the Special Distribution. Although we believe the Special Distribution allowed us to maintain our qualification as a REIT, there can be no complete assurance in this regard.\nFunds From Operations\nFunds from operations ( FFO\u201d) is a supplemental non-GAAP financial measure of a real estate company's operating performance. The National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, or NAREIT\u201d, an industry trade group, has promulgated this supplemental performance measure and defines FFO as net income, computed in accordance with GAAP, plus real estate related depreciation and amortization and excluding extraordinary items and gains and losses on the sale of real estate, and after adjustments for unconsolidated joint ventures (adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures are calculated to reflect FFO.) It is important to note that not only is FFO not equivalent to our net income or loss as determined under GAAP, it also does not represent cash flows from operating activities in accordance with GAAP. FFO should not be considered an alternative to net income as an indication of our performance, nor is FFO necessarily indicative of cash flow as a measure of liquidity or our ability to fund cash needs, including the payment of distributions.\nWe consider FFO to be a meaningful, additional measure of operating performance and one that is an appropriate supplemental disclosure for an equity REIT due to its widespread acceptance and use within the REIT and analyst communities. Comparison of our presentation of FFO to similarly titled measures for other REITs may not necessarily be meaningful due to possible differences in the application of the NAREIT definition used by such REITs.\nOur calculation of FFO attributable to common shares and Common Units and the reconciliation of net income (loss) to FFO is as follows (amounts in thousands, except shares and per share amounts):\nTable 117: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>FFO\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015 (2)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income (loss) (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(1,991\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>13,991\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjustments:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income related to membership interest\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(173\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain on disposal of assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(640\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(20,764\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjustment to reflect FFO of unconsolidated joint ventures\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>322\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>480\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation of real estate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,516\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,482\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of in-place leases and other intangibles\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>857\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,332\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>FFO attributable to common shares and Common Units\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,064\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(1,652\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>FFO per share and Common Unit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>0.09\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(0.15\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Weighted average common shares and units outstanding\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11,433,573\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11,392,509\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) Our Common Units have the right to convert a unit into common stock for a one-to-one conversion. Therefore, we are including the related non-controlling interest income/loss attributable to Common Units in the computation of FFO and including the Common Units together with weighted average shares outstanding for the computation of FFO per share and Common Unit. \n (2) Where applicable, adjustments exclude amounts attributable to membership interest. \nRelated Party Transactions and Agreements\nWe are currently party to the Advisory Agreement, pursuant to which the Advisor manages our business in exchange for specified fees paid for services related to the investment of funds in real estate and real estate-related investments, management of our investments and for other services. Refer to Note 12. Related Party Transactions\u201d to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of the Advisory Agreement and other related party transactions, agreements and fees.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nOur off-balance sheet arrangements consist primarily of our investments in joint ventures and are described in Note 4. Investments in Unconsolidated Joint Ventures\u201d in the notes to the consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our joint ventures typically fund their cash needs through secured debt financings obtained by and in the name of the joint venture entity. The joint ventures' debts are secured by a first mortgage, are without recourse to the joint venture partners, and do not represent a liability of the partners other than carve-out guarantees for"}
