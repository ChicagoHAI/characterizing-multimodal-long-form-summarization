MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nCertain matters discussed in Management's Discussion and Analysis are forward-looking statements.\u201d The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 has established that these statements qualify for safe harbors from liability. Forward-looking statements may include words like we believe,\u201d anticipate,\u201d target,\u201d expect,\u201d estimate,\u201d intend\u201d and words of similar meaning. Forward-looking statements describe our future plans, objectives, expectations or goals. See Forward-Looking Statements\u201d above for additional information.\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nDescription of Business\nWe are the largest electric utility in Kansas. We produce, transmit and sell electricity at retail to approximately 704,000 customers in Kansas under the regulation of the KCC. We also supply electric energy at wholesale to municipalities and electric cooperatives in Kansas under the regulation of FERC. We have contracts for the sale or purchase of wholesale electricity with other utilities.\nProposed Merger with Great Plains Energy\nOn May 29, 2016, we entered into an agreement and plan of merger with Great Plains Energy, providing for the merger of a wholly-owned subsidiary of Great Plains Energy with and into Westar Energy, with Westar Energy surviving as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Great Plains Energy. At the closing of the merger, our shareholders will receive cash and shares of Great Plains Energy. Each issued and outstanding share of our common stock, other than certain restricted shares, will be canceled and automatically converted into $51.00 in cash, without interest, and a number of shares of Great Plains Energy common stock equal to an exchange ratio that may vary between 0.2709 and 0.3148, based upon the volume-weighted average share price of Great Plains Energy common stock on the New York Stock Exchange for the 20 consecutive full trading days ending on (and including) the third trading day immediately prior to the closing date of the transaction. Based on the closing price per share of Great Plains Energy common stock on the trading day prior to announcement of the merger, our shareholders would receive an implied $60.00 for each share of Westar Energy common stock. The closing of the merger is subject to customary closing conditions, including receipt of regulatory approvals. For more information, see Notes 3, 14 and 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Pending Merger,\u201d Commitments and Contingencies\u201d and Legal Proceedings,\u201d respectively, and Item 1A. Risk Factors.\u201d\nEarnings Per Share\nFollowing is a summary of our net income and basic earnings per share (EPS) for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015.\nTable 94: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(Dollars In Thousands, Except Per Share Amounts)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income attributable to Westar Energy, Inc.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>346,577\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>291,929\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>54,648\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Earnings per common share, basic\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.43\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.11\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.32\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet income attributed to Westar Energy, Inc. and basic EPS for the year ended December 31, 2016, increased due primarily to higher retail prices and corporate-owned life insurance (COLI) proceeds. Partially offsetting these increases was higher operating and maintenance costs at our coal fired plants due to scheduled outages and higher depreciation and amortization due to air quality control additions at La Cygne.\nKey Factors Affecting Our Performance\nThe principal business, economic and other factors that affect our operations and financial performance include:\nTable 95: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>weather conditions;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 96: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the economy;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 97: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>customer conservation efforts;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 98: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the performance, operation and maintenance of our electric generating facilities and network;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 99: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>conditions in the fuel, wholesale electricity and energy markets;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 100: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>rate and other regulations and costs of addressing public policy initiatives including environmental laws and regulations;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 101: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the availability of and our access to liquidity and capital resources; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 102: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>capital market conditions.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nStrategy\nWe expect to continue operating as a vertically integrated, regulated electric utility. Significant elements of our strategy include maintaining a flexible, clean and diverse energy supply portfolio. In doing so, we continue to expand renewable generation, build and upgrade our energy infrastructure and develop systems and programs with regard to how our customers use energy and interact with us. In addition, we have entered into an agreement and plan of merger with Great Plains Energy pursuant to which, at closing, we would become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Great Plains Energy. The closing of the merger is subject to customary closing conditions, including receipt of regulatory approvals. See Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d and Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Pending Merger,\u201d for additional information.\nCurrent Trends and Uncertainties\nEnvironmental Regulation\nWe are subject to various federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations. Environmental laws and regulations affecting our operations are overlapping, complex, subject to changes, have become more stringent over time and are expensive to implement. There are a variety of final and proposed laws and regulations that could have a material adverse effect on our operations and consolidated financial results, including those relating to:\nTable 103: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>further regulation of GHGs by the EPA, including regulations pursuant to the CPP, and future legislation that could be proposed by the U.S. Congress;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 104: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>various proposed and expected regulations governing air emissions including those relating to National Ambient Air Quality Standards (particularly those relating to particulate matter, nitrogen oxide, ozone, carbon monoxide and sulfur dioxide); and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 105: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>the regulation of CCR.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSee Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Commitments and Contingencies-Environmental Matters,\u201d for a discussion of environmental costs, laws, regulations and other contingencies.\nAllowance for Funds Used During Construction\nAFUDC represents the allowed cost of capital used to finance utility construction activity. We compute AFUDC by applying a composite rate to qualified construction work in progress (CWIP). We credit other income (for equity funds) and interest expense (for borrowed funds) for the amount of AFUDC capitalized as construction cost on the accompanying consolidated statements of income as follows:\nTable 106: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In Thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Borrowed funds\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>9,964\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,505\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>12,044\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Equity funds\n</td> <td>11,630\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,075\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17,029\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>21,594\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,580\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>29,073\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average AFUDC Rates\n</td> <td>4.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe expect AFUDC for both borrowed funds and equity funds to fluctuate based on the timing and manner in which we finance our capital expenditures.\nInterest Expense\nWe expect interest expense to modestly increase over the next several years as we issue new debt securities to fund our capital expenditure program. We continue to believe this increase will be reflected in the prices we are permitted to charge customers, as cost of capital will be a component of future rate proceedings and is also recognized in some of the other rate adjustments we are permitted to make. In addition, short-term interest rates are low by historical standards. We cannot predict to what extent these conditions will continue. See Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Long-Term Debt\u201d for additional information regarding the issuance of long-term debt.\nCustomer Growth and Usage\nRetail customer additions have been growing approximately 0.5% the past few years. Additionally, weather normalized retail sales growth has largely grown in line with customer growth. With the numerous energy efficiency policy initiatives promulgated through federal, state and local governments, as well as industry initiatives, environmental regulations and the need to strengthen and modernize the grid, which will increase our prices, we believe customers will continue to adopt more energy efficiency and conservation measures, which will slow or possibly suppress the growth of demand for electricity.\n2017 Outlook\nIn 2017, we expect to maintain our current business strategy and regulatory approach. Assuming normal weather, we expect 2017 retail electricity sales to be in line with our projected retail customer growth of about 0.5%.\nAbsent increases in SPP transmission expense and property tax expense, which are increasing at a much higher rate than inflation and are offset with higher revenues pursuant to our regulatory mechanisms and absent incremental merger-related expenses, we anticipate operating and maintenance and selling, general and administrative expenses to be relatively flat in 2017 as compared to 2016. To help fund our capital spending as provided under -Future Cash Requirements\u201d below, in 2017 we may issue long-term debt, and utilize short-term borrowings by issuing commercial paper until permanent financing is in place.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\nOur discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in conformity with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,\u201d contains a summary of our significant accounting policies, many of which require the use of estimates and assumptions by management. The policies highlighted below have an impact on our reported results that may be material due to the levels of judgment and subjectivity necessary to account for uncertain matters or their susceptibility to change.\nRegulatory Accounting\nWe apply accounting standards that recognize the economic effects of rate regulation. Accordingly, we have recorded regulatory assets and liabilities when required by a regulatory order or based on regulatory precedent. Regulatory assets represent incurred costs that have been deferred because they are probable of future recovery in our prices. Regulatory liabilities represent probable future reductions in revenue or refunds to customers.\nThe deferral of costs as regulatory assets is appropriate only when the future recovery of such costs is probable. In assessing probability, we consider such factors as specific regulatory orders, regulatory precedent and the current regulatory environment. If we deem it no longer probable that we would recover such costs, we would record a charge against income in the amount of the related regulatory assets.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had recorded regulatory assets currently subject to recovery in future prices of approximately $879.9 million and regulatory liabilities of $239.5 million, as discussed in greater detail in Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Rate Matters and Regulation.\u201d\nPension and Post-Retirement Benefit Plans Actuarial Assumptions\nWe and Wolf Creek calculate our pension benefit and post-retirement medical benefit obligations and related costs using actuarial concepts within the guidance provided by GAAP.\nIn accounting for our retirement plans and post-retirement benefits, we make assumptions regarding the valuation of benefit obligations and the performance of plan assets. The reported costs of our pension plans are impacted by estimates regarding earnings on plan assets, contributions to the plan, discount rates used to determine our projected benefit obligation and pension costs and employee demographics including age, life expectancy and compensation levels and employment periods. Changes in these assumptions result primarily in changes to regulatory assets, regulatory liabilities or the amount of related pension and post-retirement benefit liabilities reflected on our consolidated balance sheets. Such changes may also require cash contributions.\nThe following table shows the impact of a 0.5% change in our pension plan discount rate, salary scale and rate of return on plan assets.\nTable 107: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Actuarial Assumption\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change in\nAssumption\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\nin Projected\nBenefit\nObligation (a)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Annual\nChange in\nProjected\nPension\nCosts (a)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(Dollars In Thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Discount rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.5% decrease\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>94,763\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8,390\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.5% increase\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(84,504\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7,585\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Compensation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.5% decrease\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(18,439\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3,561\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.5% increase\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19,717\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,822\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Rate of return on plan assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.5% decrease\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,041\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.5% increase\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4,041\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n_______________\nTable 108: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(a)\n</td> <td>Increases or decreases due to changes in actuarial assumptions result primarily in changes to regulatory assets and liabilities.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following table shows the impact of a 0.5% change in the discount rate and rate of return on plan assets and a 1% change in the annual medical trend on our post-retirement benefit plans.\nTable 109: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Actuarial Assumption\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change in\nAssumption\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change in\nProjected\nBenefit\nObligation (a)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Annual\nChange in\nProjected\nPost-retirement\nCosts (a)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(Dollars In Thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Discount rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.5% decrease\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,823\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>325\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.5% increase\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7,094\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(309\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Rate of return on plan assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.5% decrease\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>573\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.5% increase\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(573\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Annual medical trend\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.0% decrease\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>133\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.0% increase\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(125\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(19\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n_______________\nTable 110: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(a)\n</td> <td>Increases or decreases due to changes in actuarial assumptions result primarily in changes to regulatory assets and liabilities.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenue Recognition\nWe record revenue at the time we deliver electricity to customers. We determine the amounts delivered to individual customers through systematic monthly readings of customer meters. At the end of each month, we estimate how much electricity we have delivered since the prior meter reading and record the corresponding unbilled revenue.\nOur unbilled revenue estimate is affected by factors including fluctuations in energy demand, weather, line losses and changes in the composition of customer classes. We recorded estimated unbilled revenue of $74.4 million as of December 31, 2016 and $66.0 million as of December 31, 2015.\nIncome Taxes\nWe use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of existing assets and liabilities. We recognize the future tax benefits to the extent that realization of such benefits is more likely than not. We amortize deferred investment tax credits over the lives of the related properties as required by tax laws and regulatory practices. We recognize production tax credits in the year that electricity is generated to the extent that realization of such benefits is more likely than not.\nWe record deferred tax assets to the extent capital losses, operating losses or tax credits will be carried forward to future periods. However, when we believe based on available evidence that we do not, or will not, have sufficient future capital gains or taxable income in the appropriate taxing jurisdiction to realize the entire benefit during the applicable carryforward period, we record a valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset.\nThe application of income tax law is complex. Laws and regulations in this area are voluminous and often ambiguous. Accordingly, we must make judgments regarding income tax exposure. Interpretations of and guidance surrounding income tax laws and regulations change over time. As a result, changes in our judgments can materially affect amounts we recognize in our consolidated financial statements. See Note 11of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Taxes,\u201d for additional detail on our accounting for income taxes.\nAsset Retirement Obligations\nLegal Liability\nWe have recognized legal obligations associated with the disposal of long-lived assets that result from the acquisition, construction, development or normal operation of such assets. Concurrent with the recognition of the liability, the estimated cost of the ARO is capitalized and depreciated over the remaining life of the asset. We estimate our AROs based on the fair value of the AROs we incurred at the time the related long-lived assets were either acquired, placed in service or when regulations establishing the obligation became effective. The recording of AROs for regulated operations has no income statement impact due to the deferral of the adjustments through the establishment of a regulatory asset or an offset to a regulatory liability.\nWe initially recorded AROs at fair value for the estimated cost to decommission Wolf Creek (our 47% share), retire our wind generating facilities, dispose of asbestos insulating material at our power plants, remediate ash disposal ponds, close ash landfills and dispose of polychlorinated biphenyl contaminated oil. ARO refers to a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing and/or method of settlement may be conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the entity. In determining our AROs, we make assumptions regarding probable future disposal costs. A change in these assumptions could have a significant impact on the AROs reflected on our consolidated balance sheets.\nAs of December 31, 2016 and 2015, we have recorded AROs of $324.0 million and $275.3 million, respectively. For additional information on our legal AROs, see Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Asset Retirement Obligations.\u201d\nContingencies and Litigation\nWe and our subsidiaries are involved in various legal, environmental and regulatory proceedings, and we have estimated the probable cost for the resolution of these proceedings. These estimates are based on an analysis of potential results, assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies. It is possible that our future consolidated financial results could be materially affected by changes in our assumptions. See Notes 4, 14 and 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Rate Matters and Regulations,\u201d Commitments and Contingencies\u201d and Legal Proceedings,\u201d respectively, for additional information.\nOPERATING RESULTS\nWe evaluate operating results based on EPS. We have various classifications of revenues, defined as follows:\nRetail: Sales of electricity to residential, commercial and industrial customers. Classification of customers as residential, commercial or industrial requires judgment and our classifications may be different from other companies. Assignment of tariffs is not dependent on classification. Other retail sales of electricity include lighting for public streets and highways, net of revenue subject to refund.\nWholesale: Sales of electricity to electric cooperatives, municipalities, other electric utilities and RTOs, the prices for which are either based on cost or prevailing market prices as prescribed by FERC authority. Revenues from these sales are either included in the retail energy cost adjustment or used in the determinations of base rates at the time of our next general rate review.\nTransmission: Reflects transmission revenues, including those based on tariffs with the SPP.\nOther: Miscellaneous electric revenues including ancillary service revenues and rent from electric property leased to others. This category also includes transactions unrelated to the production of our generating assets and fees we earn for services that we provide for third parties.\nElectric utility revenues are impacted by things such as rate regulation, fuel costs, technology, customer behavior, the economy and competitive forces. Changing weather also affects the amount of electricity our customers use as electricity sales are seasonal. As a summer peaking utility, the third quarter typically accounts for our greatest electricity sales. Hot summer temperatures and cold winter temperatures prompt more demand, especially among residential and commercial customers, and to a lesser extent, industrial customers. Mild weather reduces customer demand. Our wholesale revenues are impacted by, among other factors, demand, cost and availability of fuel and purchased power, price volatility, available generation capacity, transmission availability and weather.\n2016 Compared to 2015\nBelow we discuss our operating results for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to the results for the year ended December 31, 2015. Significant changes in results of operations shown in the table immediately below are further explained in the descriptions that follow.\nTable 111: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>

order in our state general rate review allowing us to adjust our prices to include, among other things, additional investment in La Cygne environmental upgrades and investment to extend the life of Wolf Creek. The new prices were effective late October 2015 and are expected to increase our annual retail revenues by approximately $78.3 million.\nGross Margin\nFuel and purchased power costs fluctuate with electricity sales and unit costs. As permitted by regulators, we adjust our retail prices to reflect changes in the costs of fuel and purchased power. Fuel and purchased power costs for wholesale customers are recovered at prevailing market prices or based on a predetermined formula with a price adjustment approved by FERC. As a result, changes in fuel and purchased power costs are offset in revenues with minimal impact on net income. In addition, SPP network transmission costs fluctuate due primarily to investments by us and other members of the SPP for upgrades to the transmission grid within the SPP RTO. As with fuel and purchased power costs, changes in SPP network transmission costs are mostly reflected in the prices we charge customers with minimal impact on net income. For these reasons, we believe gross margin is useful for understanding and analyzing changes in our operating performance from one period to the next. We calculate gross margin as total revenues, including transmission revenues, less the sum of fuel and purchased power costs and amounts billed by the SPP for network transmission costs. Accordingly, gross margin reflects transmission revenues and costs on a net basis. The following table summarizes our gross margin for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015.\nTable 112: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(Dollars In Thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenues\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,562,087\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,459,164\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>102,923\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less: Fuel and purchased power expense\n</td> <td>509,496\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>561,065\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(51,569\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(9.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>SPP network transmission costs\n</td> <td>232,763\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>229,043\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,720\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross Margin\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,819,828\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,669,056\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>150,772\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following table reflects changes in electricity sales for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015.

Energy marketing margin decreased $11.2 million due to greater volatility in 2014 of wholesale power prices. Also contributing to the decrease in gross margin was lower retail electricity sales. The lower residential and commercial electric sales were due to warm winter weather. During 2015, there were approximately 19% fewer heating degree days compared to 2014. The lower industrial sales were due to a few of our larger customers who experienced weaker global demand for their products.\nIncome from operations, which is calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP in our consolidated statements of income, is the most directly comparable measure to our presentation of gross margin, which is a non-GAAP measure. Our presentation of gross margin should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for income from operations.

We expect to meet our day-to-day cash requirements including, among other items, fuel and purchased power, dividends, interest payments, income taxes and pension contributions, using primarily internally generated cash and short-term borrowings. To meet the cash requirements for our capital investments, we expect to use internally generated cash, short-term borrowings and proceeds from the issuance of debt and equity securities in the capital markets. When such balances are of sufficient size and it makes economic sense to do so, we also use proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt and equity securities to repay short-term borrowings, which are principally related to investments in capital equipment and the redemption of bonds and for working capital and general corporate purposes. In 2017, we expect to continue our significant capital spending program and plan to contribute to our pension trust. We continue to believe that we will have the ability to pay dividends. Although the agreement and plan of merger with Great Plains Energy contains customary restrictions on our ability to raise capital and pay dividends, we do not believe these restrictions will materially adversely impact our liquidity or ability to pay dividends in 2017. Uncertainties affecting our ability to meet cash requirements include, among others, factors affecting revenues described in Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d and -Operating Results\u201d above, economic conditions, regulatory actions, compliance with environmental regulations and conditions in the capital markets. For additional information on our future cash requirements, see -Future Cash Requirements\u201d below.\nCapital Structure\nAs of December 31, 2016 and 2015, our capital structure, excluding short-term debt, was as follows:\nTable 161: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>As of December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Common equity\n</td> <td>51%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>52%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Noncontrolling interests\n</td> <td><1%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td><1%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term debt, including VIEs\n</td> <td>49%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>48%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nShort-Term Borrowings\nWestar Energy maintains a commercial paper program pursuant to which it may issue commercial paper up to a maximum aggregate amount outstanding at any one time of $1.0 billion. This program is supported by Westar Energy's revolving credit facilities. Maturities of commercial paper issuances may not exceed 365 days from the date of issuance and proceeds from such issuances will be used to temporarily fund capital expenditures, to redeem debt on an interim basis, for working capital and/or for other general corporate purposes. As of February 15, 2017, Westar Energy had $498.3 million of commercial paper issued and outstanding.\nWestar Energy has two revolving credit facilities in the amounts of $730.0 million and $270.0 million. The $730.0 million facility will expire in September 2019, $20.7 million of which will expire in September 2017. In December 2016, Westar Energy extended the term of the $270.0 million facility by one year to terminate in February 2018. As long as there is no default under the facilities, the $730.0 million and $270.0 million facilities may be extended an additional year and the aggregate amount of borrowings under the $730.0 million and $270.0 million facilities may be increased to $1.0 billion and $400.0 million, respectively, subject to lender participation. All borrowings under the facilities are secured by KGE first mortgage bonds. Total combined borrowings under the revolving credit facilities and the commercial paper program may not exceed $1.0 billion at any given time. As of February 15, 2017, no amounts were borrowed and $12.3 million of letters of credit had been issued under the $730.0 million facility. No amounts were borrowed and no letters of credit were issued under the $270.0 million facility as of the same date.\nA default by Westar Energy or KGE under other indebtedness totaling more than $25.0 million would be a default under both revolving credit facilities. Westar Energy is required to maintain a consolidated indebtedness to consolidated capitalization ratio of 65% or less at all times. At December 31, 2016, our ratio was 51%. See Note 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Short-Term Debt,\u201d for additional information regarding our short-term borrowings.\nLong-Term Debt Financing\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had $121.9 million of variable rate, tax-exempt bonds outstanding. While the interest rates for these bonds have been low, we continue to monitor the credit markets and evaluate our options with respect to these bonds.\nIn January 2017, Westar Energy retired $125.0 million in principal amount of first mortgage bonds bearing a stated interest at 5.15% maturing January 2017.\nIn June 2016, Westar Energy issued $350.0 million in principal amount of first mortgage bonds bearing a stated interest at 2.55% and maturing July 2026. The bonds were issued as Green Bonds,\u201d and all proceeds from the bonds will be used in renewable energy projects, primarily the construction of the Western Plains Wind Farm.\nAlso in June 2016, KGE redeemed and reissued $50.0 million in principal amount pollution control bonds maturing June 2031. The stated rate of the bonds was reduced from 4.85% to 2.50%.\nIn February 2016, KGE, as lessee to the La Cygne sale-leaseback, effected a redemption and reissuance of $162.1 million in outstanding bonds held by the trustee of the lease maturing March 2021. The stated interest rate of the bonds was reduced from 5.647% to 2.398%. See Note 18 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Variable Interest Entities,\u201d for additional information regarding our La Cygne sale-leaseback.\nThe Westar Energy and KGE mortgages each contain provisions restricting the amount of first mortgage bonds that can be issued by each entity. We must comply with such restrictions prior to the issuance of additional first mortgage bonds or other secured indebtedness.\nUnder the Westar Energy mortgage, the issuance of bonds is subject to limitations based on the amount of bondable property additions. In addition, so long as any bonds issued prior to January 1, 1997, remain outstanding, the mortgage prohibits additional first mortgage bonds from being issued, except in connection with certain refundings, unless Westar Energy's unconsolidated net earnings available for interest, depreciation and property retirement (which as defined, does not include earnings or losses attributable to the ownership of securities of subsidiaries), for a period of 12 consecutive months within 15 months preceding the issuance, are not less than the greater of twice the annual interest charges on or 10% of the principal amount of all first mortgage bonds outstanding after giving effect to the proposed issuance. As of December 31, 2016, approximately $931.6 million principal amount of additional first mortgage bonds could be issued under the most restrictive provisions in the mortgage, except in connection with certain refundings.\nUnder the KGE mortgage, the amount of first mortgage bonds authorized is limited to a maximum of $3.5 billion and the issuance of bonds is subject to limitations based on the amount of bondable property additions. In addition, the mortgage prohibits additional first mortgage bonds from being issued, except in connection with certain refundings, unless KGE's net earnings before income taxes and before provision for retirement and depreciation of property for a period of 12 consecutive months within 15 months preceding the issuance are not less than either two and one-half times the annual interest charges on or 10% of the principal amount of all KGE first mortgage bonds outstanding after giving effect to the proposed issuance. As of December 31, 2016, approximately $1.5 billion principal amount of additional KGE first mortgage bonds could be issued under the most restrictive provisions in the mortgage, except in connection with certain refundings.\nSome of our debt instruments contain restrictions that require us to maintain leverage ratios as defined in the credit agreements. We calculate these ratios in accordance with the agreements and they are used to determine compliance with our various debt covenants. We were in compliance with these covenants as of December 31, 2016.\nImpact of Credit Ratings on Debt Financing\nMoody's Investors Service (Moody's) and Standard & Poor's Ratings Services (S&P) are independent credit-rating agencies that rate our debt securities. These ratings indicate each agency's assessment of our ability to pay interest and principal when due on our securities.\nIn general, more favorable credit ratings increase borrowing opportunities and reduce the cost of borrowing. Under Westar Energy's revolving credit facilities and commercial paper program, our cost of borrowings is determined in part by credit ratings. However, Westar Energy's ability to borrow under the credit facilities and commercial paper program are not conditioned on maintaining a particular credit rating. We may enter into new credit agreements that contain credit rating conditions, which could affect our liquidity and/or our borrowing costs.\nFactors that impact our credit ratings include a combination of objective and subjective criteria.

Partially offsetting these increases was our having received $32.7 million less for wholesale power sales and transmission services, while having paid $20.2 million more for purchase power and transmission services and $13.5 million more in income tax payments.\nCash flows from operating activities decreased $109.4 million in 2015 compared to 2014 due principally to our having received $62.8 million less for wholesale power sales and transmission services, $51.8 million less from retail customers and$10.0 million less for energy marketing activities, while having paid $25.2 million more for the Wolf Creek refueling outage. Partially offsetting these decreases was our having paid $40.1 million less for coal and natural gas.\nCash Flows used in Investing Activities\nCash flows used in investing activities increased $363.1 million in 2016 compared to 2015 due primarily to our having invested $386.7 million more in additions to property, plant and equipment primarily related to the construction of Western Plains Wind Farm. Partially offsetting these increase was our having received $25.9 million more from our investment in COLI.\nCash flows used in investing activities decreased $189.0 million in 2015 compared to 2014 due primarily to our having invested $151.8 million less in additions to property, plant and equipment and our having received $23.6 million more from our investment in COLI.\nCash Flows from (used in) Financing Activities\nCash flows from financing activities increased $257.6 million in 2016 compared to 2015. The increase was due principally to our having redeemed $585.9 million less in long-term debt, issued $162.0 million more in long-term debt of VIEs and issued $123.5 million more in commercial paper. Partially offsetting these increases was our having issued $255.6 million less in common stock, redeemed $162.4 million more in long-term debt of VIEs, issued $147.6 million less in long-term debt, repaid $24.7 million more for borrowings against the cash surrender value of COLI and paid $18.2 million more in dividends.\nCash flows from financing activities decreased $81.1 million in 2015 compared to 2014. The decrease was due primarily to our having redeemed $208.4 million more in long-term debt, issuing $129.7 million less in commercial paper, and repaying $23.3 million more for borrowings against the cash surrender value of COLI. Partially offsetting these decreases was our having issued $170.3 million more in common stock and issuing $125.9 million more in long-term debt.\nFuture Cash Requirements\nOur business requires significant capital investments. Through 2019, we expect to need cash primarily for utility construction programs designed to improve and expand facilities related to providing electric service, which include, but are not limited to, expenditures to develop new transmission lines and other improvements to our power plants, transmission and distribution lines and equipment. We expect to meet these cash needs with internally generated cash, short-term borrowings and the issuance of securities in the capital markets.\nCapital expenditures for 2016 and anticipated capital expenditures, including costs of removal, for 2017 through 2019 are shown in the following table.\nTable 165: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Actual\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Projected\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In Thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Generation:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Replacements and other\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>151,083\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>173,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>187,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>148,900\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Environmental\n</td> <td>62,307\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28,300\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18,600\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Wind development\n</td> <td>340,535\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,800\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,900\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,300\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Nuclear fuel\n</td> <td>20,021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>45,300\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>21,100\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24,800\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Transmission\n</td> <td>212,168\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>253,300\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>246,300\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>243,700\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Distribution\n</td> <td>237,107\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>206,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>184,100\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>236,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other\n</td> <td>63,749\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>88,600\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>87,300\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>75,200\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total capital expenditures\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,086,970\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>803,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>760,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>754,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe prepare these estimates for planning purposes and revise them from time to time.

We must also meet minimum funding requirements under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, as amended by the Pension Protection Act. We may contribute additional amounts from time to time as deemed appropriate.\nWe contributed $20.2 million to our pension trust in 2016 and $41.0 million in 2015. We expect to contribute approximately $25.2 million in 2017. In 2016 and 2015, we also funded $14.8 million and $5.8 million, respectively, of Wolf Creek's pension plan contributions. In 2017, we plan to contribute $10.8 million to fund Wolf Creek's pension plan contributions.

As authorized by our regulators, incremental maintenance costs of planned refueling and maintenance outages are deferred and amortized ratably over the period between planned refueling and maintenance outages. In fall of 2016, Wolf Creek underwent a planned refueling and maintenance outage. Our share of the outage costs was approximately $24.2 million. The next refueling and maintenance outage is planned for the spring of 2018.\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe use two types of restricted share units (RSUs) for our stock-based compensation awards; those with service requirements and those with performance measures. See Note 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Employee Benefit Plans,\u201d for additional information. Total unrecognized compensation cost related to RSU awards with only service requirements was $5.0 million as of December 31, 2016, and we expect to recognize these costs over a remaining weighted-average period of 1.8 years. Total unrecognized compensation cost related to RSU awards with performance measures was $4.5 million as of December 31, 2016, and we expect to recognize these costs over a remaining weighted-average period of 1.7 years. Upon consummation of the merger, all unrecognized compensation costs for outstanding RSU awards will be expensed on our income statement.",

    "item_7_text": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nCertain matters discussed in Management's Discussion and Analysis are forward-looking statements.\u201d The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 has established that these statements qualify for safe harbors from liability. Forward-looking statements may include words like we believe,\u201d anticipate,\u201d target,\u201d expect,\u201d estimate,\u201d intend\u201d and words of similar meaning. Forward-looking statements describe our future plans, objectives, expectations or goals. See Forward-Looking Statements\u201d above for additional information.\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nDescription of Business\nWe are the largest electric utility in Kansas. We produce, transmit and sell electricity at retail to approximately 704,000 customers in Kansas under the regulation of the KCC. We also supply electric energy at wholesale to municipalities and electric cooperatives in Kansas under the regulation of FERC. We have contracts for the sale or purchase of wholesale electricity with other utilities.\nProposed Merger with Great Plains Energy\nOn May 29, 2016, we entered into an agreement and plan of merger with Great Plains Energy, providing for the merger of a wholly-owned subsidiary of Great Plains Energy with and into Westar Energy, with Westar Energy surviving as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Great Plains Energy. At the closing of the merger, our shareholders will receive cash and shares of Great Plains Energy. Each issued and outstanding share of our common stock, other than certain restricted shares, will be canceled and automatically converted into $51.00 in cash, without interest, and a number of shares of Great Plains Energy common stock equal to an exchange ratio that may vary between 0.2709 and 0.3148, based upon the volume-weighted average share price of Great Plains Energy common stock on the New York Stock Exchange for the 20 consecutive full trading days ending on (and including) the third trading day immediately prior to the closing date of the transaction. Based on the closing price per share of Great Plains Energy common stock on the trading day prior to announcement of the merger, our shareholders would receive an implied $60.00 for each share of Westar Energy common stock. The closing of the merger is subject to customary closing conditions, including receipt of regulatory approvals. For more information, see Notes 3, 14 and 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Pending Merger,\u201d Commitments and Contingencies\u201d and Legal Proceedings,\u201d respectively, and Item 1A. Risk Factors.\u201d\nEarnings Per Share\nFollowing is a summary of our net income and basic earnings per share (EPS) for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015.\n\nNet income attributed to Westar Energy, Inc. and basic EPS for the year ended December 31, 2016, increased due primarily to higher retail prices and corporate-owned life insurance (COLI) proceeds. Partially offsetting these increases was higher operating and maintenance costs at our coal fired plants due to scheduled outages and higher depreciation and amortization due to air quality control additions at La Cygne.\nKey Factors Affecting Our Performance\nThe principal business, economic and other factors that affect our operations and financial performance include:\n \u2022 weather conditions; \n \u2022 the economy; \n \u2022 customer conservation efforts; \n \u2022 the performance, operation and maintenance of our electric generating facilities and network; \n \u2022 conditions in the fuel, wholesale electricity and energy markets; \n \u2022 rate and other regulations and costs of addressing public policy initiatives including environmental laws and regulations; \n \u2022 the availability of and our access to liquidity and capital resources; and \n \u2022 capital market conditions. \nStrategy\nWe expect to continue operating as a vertically integrated, regulated electric utility. Significant elements of our strategy include maintaining a flexible, clean and diverse energy supply portfolio. In doing so, we continue to expand renewable generation, build and upgrade our energy infrastructure and develop systems and programs with regard to how our customers use energy and interact with us. In addition, we have entered into an agreement and plan of merger with Great Plains Energy pursuant to which, at closing, we would become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Great Plains Energy. The closing of the merger is subject to customary closing conditions, including receipt of regulatory approvals. See Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d and Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Pending Merger,\u201d for additional information.\nCurrent Trends and Uncertainties\nEnvironmental Regulation\nWe are subject to various federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations. Environmental laws and regulations affecting our operations are overlapping, complex, subject to changes, have become more stringent over time and are expensive to implement. There are a variety of final and proposed laws and regulations that could have a material adverse effect on our operations and consolidated financial results, including those relating to:\n \u2022 further regulation of GHGs by the EPA, including regulations pursuant to the CPP, and future legislation that could be proposed by the U.S. Congress; \n \u2022 various proposed and expected regulations governing air emissions including those relating to National Ambient Air Quality Standards (particularly those relating to particulate matter, nitrogen oxide, ozone, carbon monoxide and sulfur dioxide); and \n \u2022 the regulation of CCR. \nSee Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Commitments and Contingencies-Environmental Matters,\u201d for a discussion of environmental costs, laws, regulations and other contingencies.\nAllowance for Funds Used During Construction\nAFUDC represents the allowed cost of capital used to finance utility construction activity. We compute AFUDC by applying a composite rate to qualified construction work in progress (CWIP). We credit other income (for equity funds) and interest expense (for borrowed funds) for the amount of AFUDC capitalized as construction cost on the accompanying consolidated statements of income as follows:\n\nWe expect AFUDC for both borrowed funds and equity funds to fluctuate based on the timing and manner in which we finance our capital expenditures.\nInterest Expense\nWe expect interest expense to modestly increase over the next several years as we issue new debt securities to fund our capital expenditure program. We continue to believe this increase will be reflected in the prices we are permitted to charge customers, as cost of capital will be a component of future rate proceedings and is also recognized in some of the other rate adjustments we are permitted to make. In addition, short-term interest rates are low by historical standards. We cannot predict to what extent these conditions will continue. See Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Long-Term Debt\u201d for additional information regarding the issuance of long-term debt.\nCustomer Growth and Usage\nRetail customer additions have been growing approximately 0.5% the past few years. Additionally, weather normalized retail sales growth has largely grown in line with customer growth. With the numerous energy efficiency policy initiatives promulgated through federal, state and local governments, as well as industry initiatives, environmental regulations and the need to strengthen and modernize the grid, which will increase our prices, we believe customers will continue to adopt more energy efficiency and conservation measures, which will slow or possibly suppress the growth of demand for electricity.\n2017 Outlook\nIn 2017, we expect to maintain our current business strategy and regulatory approach. Assuming normal weather, we expect 2017 retail electricity sales to be in line with our projected retail customer growth of about 0.5%.\nAbsent increases in SPP transmission expense and property tax expense, which are increasing at a much higher rate than inflation and are offset with higher revenues pursuant to our regulatory mechanisms and absent incremental merger-related expenses, we anticipate operating and maintenance and selling, general and administrative expenses to be relatively flat in 2017 as compared to 2016. To help fund our capital spending as provided under -Future Cash Requirements\u201d below, in 2017 we may issue long-term debt, and utilize short-term borrowings by issuing commercial paper until permanent financing is in place.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\nOur discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in conformity with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,\u201d contains a summary of our significant accounting policies, many of which require the use of estimates and assumptions by management. The policies highlighted below have an impact on our reported results that may be material due to the levels of judgment and subjectivity necessary to account for uncertain matters or their susceptibility to change.\nRegulatory Accounting\nWe apply accounting standards that recognize the economic effects of rate regulation. Accordingly, we have recorded regulatory assets and liabilities when required by a regulatory order or based on regulatory precedent. Regulatory assets represent incurred costs that have been deferred because they are probable of future recovery in our prices. Regulatory liabilities represent probable future reductions in revenue or refunds to customers.\nThe deferral of costs as regulatory assets is appropriate only when the future recovery of such costs is probable. In assessing probability, we consider such factors as specific regulatory orders, regulatory precedent and the current regulatory environment. If we deem it no longer probable that we would recover such costs, we would record a charge against income in the amount of the related regulatory assets.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had recorded regulatory assets currently subject to recovery in future prices of approximately $879.9 million and regulatory liabilities of $239.5 million, as discussed in greater detail in Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Rate Matters and Regulation.\u201d\nPension and Post-Retirement Benefit Plans Actuarial Assumptions\nWe and Wolf Creek calculate our pension benefit and post-retirement medical benefit obligations and related costs using actuarial concepts within the guidance provided by GAAP.\nIn accounting for our retirement plans and post-retirement benefits, we make assumptions regarding the valuation of benefit obligations and the performance of plan assets. The reported costs of our pension plans are impacted by estimates regarding earnings on plan assets, contributions to the plan, discount rates used to determine our projected benefit obligation and pension costs and employee demographics including age, life expectancy and compensation levels and employment periods. Changes in these assumptions result primarily in changes to regulatory assets, regulatory liabilities or the amount of related pension and post-retirement benefit liabilities reflected on our consolidated balance sheets. Such changes may also require cash contributions.\nThe following table shows the impact of a 0.5% change in our pension plan discount rate, salary scale and rate of return on plan assets.\n\n_______________\n (a) Increases or decreases due to changes in actuarial assumptions result primarily in changes to regulatory assets and liabilities. \nThe following table shows the impact of a 0.5% change in the discount rate and rate of return on plan assets and a 1% change in the annual medical trend on our post-retirement benefit plans.\n\n_______________\n (a) Increases or decreases due to changes in actuarial assumptions result primarily in changes to regulatory assets and liabilities. \nRevenue Recognition\nWe record revenue at the time we deliver electricity to customers. We determine the amounts delivered to individual customers through systematic monthly readings of customer meters. At the end of each month, we estimate how much electricity we have delivered since the prior meter reading and record the corresponding unbilled revenue.\nOur unbilled revenue estimate is affected by factors including fluctuations in energy demand, weather, line losses and changes in the composition of customer classes. We recorded estimated unbilled revenue of $74.4 million as of December 31, 2016 and $66.0 million as of December 31, 2015.\nIncome Taxes\nWe use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of existing assets and liabilities. We recognize the future tax benefits to the extent that realization of such benefits is more likely than not. We amortize deferred investment tax credits over the lives of the related properties as required by tax laws and regulatory practices. We recognize production tax credits in the year that electricity is generated to the extent that realization of such benefits is more likely than not.\nWe record deferred tax assets to the extent capital losses, operating losses or tax credits will be carried forward to future periods. However, when we believe based on available evidence that we do not, or will not, have sufficient future capital gains or taxable income in the appropriate taxing jurisdiction to realize the entire benefit during the applicable carryforward period, we record a valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset.\nThe application of income tax law is complex. Laws and regulations in this area are voluminous and often ambiguous. Accordingly, we must make judgments regarding income tax exposure. Interpretations of and guidance surrounding income tax laws and regulations change over time. As a result, changes in our judgments can materially affect amounts we recognize in our consolidated financial statements. See Note 11of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Taxes,\u201d for additional detail on our accounting for income taxes.\nAsset Retirement Obligations\nLegal Liability\nWe have recognized legal obligations associated with the disposal of long-lived assets that result from the acquisition, construction, development or normal operation of such assets. Concurrent with the recognition of the liability, the estimated cost of the ARO is capitalized and depreciated over the remaining life of the asset. We estimate our AROs based on the fair value of the AROs we incurred at the time the related long-lived assets were either acquired, placed in service or when regulations establishing the obligation became effective. The recording of AROs for regulated operations has no income statement impact due to the deferral of the adjustments through the establishment of a regulatory asset or an offset to a regulatory liability.\nWe initially recorded AROs at fair value for the estimated cost to decommission Wolf Creek (our 47% share), retire our wind generating facilities, dispose of asbestos insulating material at our power plants, remediate ash disposal ponds, close ash landfills and dispose of polychlorinated biphenyl contaminated oil. ARO refers to a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing and/or method of settlement may be conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the entity. In determining our AROs, we make assumptions regarding probable future disposal costs. A change in these assumptions could have a significant impact on the AROs reflected on our consolidated balance sheets.\nAs of December 31, 2016 and 2015, we have recorded AROs of $324.0 million and $275.3 million, respectively. For additional information on our legal AROs, see Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Asset Retirement Obligations.\u201d\nContingencies and Litigation\nWe and our subsidiaries are involved in various legal, environmental and regulatory proceedings, and we have estimated the probable cost for the resolution of these proceedings. These estimates are based on an analysis of potential results, assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies. It is possible that our future consolidated financial results could be materially affected by changes in our assumptions. See Notes 4, 14 and 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Rate Matters and Regulations,\u201d Commitments and Contingencies\u201d and Legal Proceedings,\u201d respectively, for additional information.\nOPERATING RESULTS\nWe evaluate operating results based on EPS. We have various classifications of revenues, defined as follows:\nRetail: Sales of electricity to residential, commercial and industrial customers. Classification of customers as residential, commercial or industrial requires judgment and our classifications may be different from other companies. Assignment of tariffs is not dependent on classification. Other retail sales of electricity include lighting for public streets and highways, net of revenue subject to refund.\nWholesale: Sales of electricity to electric cooperatives, municipalities, other electric utilities and RTOs, the prices for which are either based on cost or prevailing market prices as prescribed by FERC authority. Revenues from these sales are either included in the retail energy cost adjustment or used in the determinations of base rates at the time of our next general rate review.\nTransmission: Reflects transmission revenues, including those based on tariffs with the SPP.\nOther: Miscellaneous electric revenues including ancillary service revenues and rent from electric property leased to others. This category also includes transactions unrelated to the production of our generating assets and fees we earn for services that we provide for third parties.\nElectric utility revenues are impacted by things such as rate regulation, fuel costs, technology, customer behavior, the economy and competitive forces. Changing weather also affects the amount of electricity our customers use as electricity sales are seasonal. As a summer peaking utility, the third quarter typically accounts for our greatest electricity sales. Hot summer temperatures and cold winter temperatures prompt more demand, especially among residential and commercial customers, and to a lesser extent, industrial customers. Mild weather reduces customer demand. Our wholesale revenues are impacted by, among other factors, demand, cost and availability of fuel and purchased power, price volatility, available generation capacity, transmission availability and weather.\n2016 Compared to 2015\nBelow we discuss our operating results for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to the results for the year ended December 31, 2015. Significant changes in results of operations shown in the table immediately below are further explained in the descriptions that follow.\n\nRate Review Agreement\nIn September 2015, the KCC issued an order in our state general rate review allowing us to adjust our prices to include, among other things, additional investment in La Cygne environmental upgrades and investment to extend the life of Wolf Creek. The new prices were effective late October 2015 and are expected to increase our annual retail revenues by approximately $78.3 million.\nGross Margin\nFuel and purchased power costs fluctuate with electricity sales and unit costs. As permitted by regulators, we adjust our retail prices to reflect changes in the costs of fuel and purchased power. Fuel and purchased power costs for wholesale customers are recovered at prevailing market prices or based on a predetermined formula with a price adjustment approved by FERC. As a result, changes in fuel and purchased power costs are offset in revenues with minimal impact on net income. In addition, SPP network transmission costs fluctuate due primarily to investments by us and other members of the SPP for upgrades to the transmission grid within the SPP RTO. As with fuel and purchased power costs, changes in SPP network transmission costs are mostly reflected in the prices we charge customers with minimal impact on net income. For these reasons, we believe gross margin is useful for understanding and analyzing changes in our operating performance from one period to the next. We calculate gross margin as total revenues, including transmission revenues, less the sum of fuel and purchased power costs and amounts billed by the SPP for network transmission costs. Accordingly, gross margin reflects transmission revenues and costs on a net basis. The following table summarizes our gross margin for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015.\n\nThe following table reflects changes in electricity sales for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015. No electricity sales are shown for transmission or other as they are not directly related to the amount of electricity we sell.\n\nGross margin increased due primarily to higher retail prices, which increased approximately 6%. Gross margin also increased slightly due to weather that was modestly favorable relative to 2015. During 2016, there were approximately 10% more cooling degree days compared to 2015.\nIncome from operations, which is calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP in our consolidated statements of income, is the most directly comparable measure to our presentation of gross margin, which is a non-GAAP measure. Our presentation of gross margin should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for income from operations. Additionally, our presentation of gross margin may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. The following table reconciles income from operations with gross margin for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015.\n\nOperating Expenses and Other Income and Expense Items\n\nOperating and maintenance expense increased due primarily to:\n \u2022 higher operating and maintenance costs at our coal fired plants of $14.1 million, due primarily to scheduled outages; \n \u2022 higher transmission and distribution operating and maintenance costs of $4.3 million due partially to improving long-term reliability; and \n \u2022 higher decommissioning costs of $3.0 million for Wolf Creek which is offset in retail revenues; however, \n \u2022 partially offsetting these increases was a $9.8 million decrease in operating and maintenance costs related to our having retired three generating units in late 2015. \n\nDepreciation and amortization expense increased due primarily to air quality control additions at La Cygne.\n\nSelling, general and administrative expense increased due primarily to:\n \u2022 incurring $10.2 million of merger-related expenses in 2016; \n \u2022 an increase in the allowance for uncollectible accounts of $3.5 million; and \n \u2022 an increase of $2.7 million in outside services related principally to technology services; however, \n \u2022 partially offsetting these increases was lower employee benefit costs of $7.6 million due primarily to reduced post-retirement medical costs. \n\nTaxes other than income tax increased due primarily to a $36.1 million increase in property tax expense, which is mostly offset in retail revenues.\n\nOther income increased due primarily to an increase in equity AFUDC of $9.6 million and our having recorded $7.2 million more in COLI benefits.\n\nInterest expense decreased due primarily to a $6.5 million increase in debt AFUDC, a $5.7 million decrease in interest on long-term debt of VIEs due to refinancing long-term debt of the La Cygne VIE and a $4.8 million decrease in interest expense on long-term debt due to refinancing long-term debt at lower rates.\n\nIncome tax expense increased due principally to higher income before income taxes.\n2015 Compared to 2014\nBelow we discuss our operating results for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the results for the year ended December 31, 2014. Significant changes in results of operations shown in the table immediately below are further explained in the descriptions that follow.\n\nGross Margin\nThe following table summarizes our gross margin for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014.\n\nThe following table reflects changes in electricity sales for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014. No electricity sales are shown for transmission or other as they are not directly related to the amount of electricity we sell.\n\nGross margin decreased due primarily to an estimated $13.8 million transmission revenues refund obligation associated with a FERC proceeding. Energy marketing margin decreased $11.2 million due to greater volatility in 2014 of wholesale power prices. Also contributing to the decrease in gross margin was lower retail electricity sales. The lower residential and commercial electric sales were due to warm winter weather. During 2015, there were approximately 19% fewer heating degree days compared to 2014. The lower industrial sales were due to a few of our larger customers who experienced weaker global demand for their products.\nIncome from operations, which is calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP in our consolidated statements of income, is the most directly comparable measure to our presentation of gross margin, which is a non-GAAP measure. Our presentation of gross margin should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for income from operations. Additionally, our presentation of gross margin may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. The following table reconciles income from operations with gross margin for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014.\n\nOperating Expenses and Other Income and Expense Items\n\nOperating and maintenance expense decreased due principally to:\n \u2022 lower transmission and distribution operations and maintenance expense of $14.8 million due partially to focus on capital replacement for longer term grid resiliency; \n \u2022 lower costs at our coal fired plants of $10.5 million, which were principally the result of higher operating and maintenance costs incurred during a 2014 scheduled outage at JEC; and \n \u2022 lower costs at Wolf Creek of $10.3 million, which were principally the result of higher operating and maintenance costs incurred during a 2014 scheduled outage. \n\nDepreciation and amortization expense increased due to additions at our power plants, including air quality controls, additions at Wolf Creek to enhance reliability and the addition of transmission facilities. Depreciation related to environmental equipment placed in-service at La Cygne, as approved by the KCC, was deferred until new retail prices became effective in late October 2015.\n\nSelling, general and administrative expense decreased due primarily to a reduction of $4.2 million in amortization for previously deferred amounts with various energy efficiency programs; however, partially offsetting this decrease was higher labor and employee benefit costs of $5.1 million partially related to restructuring charges.\n\nTaxes other than income tax increased due primarily to an increase of $16.9 million in property tax expense. This increase is mostly offset in retail revenue.\n\nInvestment earnings decreased due primarily to recording a $2.2 million lower gain on a trust to secure certain retirement benefit obligations.\n\nOther income decreased due primarily to our having recorded about $15.0 million less in equity AFUDC due primarily to completion of major construction projects. The decrease was partially offset by our having recorded $2.7 million more in COLI benefits.\n\nInterest expense decreased due primarily to a decrease in long-term interest expense of $14.7 million due to refinancing debt. However, partially offsetting this decrease was a reduction in debt AFUDC of $8.5 million primarily due to reduced CWIP.\nFinancial Condition\nA number of factors affected amounts recorded on our balance sheet as of December 31, 2016, compared to December 31, 2015.\n\nProperty, plant and equipment, net of accumulated depreciation, increased due primarily to the construction of Western Plains Wind Farm and plant additions for capital improvements to improve long-term reliability.\n\nTotal regulatory assets increased due primarily to the following items:\n \u2022 a $32.5 million increase in amounts to be collected from our customers for the deferred cost of fuel and purchased power; \n \u2022 a $27.3 million increase in deferred employee benefit costs; and \n \u2022 a $7.0 million increase in unrecovered amounts related to the retirement of analog meters prior to the end of their remaining useful lives due to modernization of meter technology; however, \n \u2022 partially offsetting these decreases was a $26.8 million decrease in amounts deferred for property taxes; and \n \u2022 a $20.1 million decrease in amounts due from customers for future income taxes. \nTotal regulatory liabilities decreased due primarily to the following items:\n \u2022 spending $48.2 million more than collected for the cost to remove retired plant assets; and \n \u2022 a $12.7 million decrease in our refund obligations related to amounts we have collected from our customers in excess of our actual cost of fuel and purchased power; however, \n \u2022 partially offsetting these decreases was a $5.0 million increase in amounts recognized in setting our prices in excess of actual pension and post-retirement expense; and \n \u2022 a $1.2 million increase for the FERC settlement refund obligation and a $1.3 million increase for the KCC approved refund obligation related to the reduced return on equity in our transmission formula rate. See Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Rate Matters and Regulation,\u201d for a discussion of these refund obligations. \n\nShort-term debt increased due to increased issuances of commercial paper primarily used to fund capital expenditures, such as the construction of Western Plains Wind Farm.\n\nTotal long-term debt increased due to Westar Energy issuing $350.0 million in principal amount of first mortgage bonds. For more information on our long-term debt, see Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Long-term Debt.\u201d\n\nTotal long-term debt of VIEs decreased due principally to the VIEs that hold the JEC and La Cygne leasehold interests having made principal payments totaling $28.3 million.\n\nLong-term deferred income tax liabilities increased due primarily to the utilization of accelerated depreciation methods as well as the utilization of previously deferred net operating losses during the period.\n\nAccrued employee benefits increased due primarily to higher pension and post-retirement benefit obligations as a result of a decrease in the discount rates used to calculate our and Wolf Creek's pension benefit obligations.\n\nAROs increased due primarily to a $39.9 million revision in our AROs related to the regulation of CCRs. See Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Commitments and Contingencies.\u201d and Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Asset Retirement Obligations,\u201d for additional information.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nOverview\nAvailable sources of funds to operate our business include internally generated cash, short-term borrowings under Westar Energy's commercial paper program and revolving credit facilities and access to capital markets. We expect to meet our day-to-day cash requirements including, among other items, fuel and purchased power, dividends, interest payments, income taxes and pension contributions, using primarily internally generated cash and short-term borrowings. To meet the cash requirements for our capital investments, we expect to use internally generated cash, short-term borrowings and proceeds from the issuance of debt and equity securities in the capital markets. When such balances are of sufficient size and it makes economic sense to do so, we also use proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt and equity securities to repay short-term borrowings, which are principally related to investments in capital equipment and the redemption of bonds and for working capital and general corporate purposes. In 2017, we expect to continue our significant capital spending program and plan to contribute to our pension trust. We continue to believe that we will have the ability to pay dividends. Although the agreement and plan of merger with Great Plains Energy contains customary restrictions on our ability to raise capital and pay dividends, we do not believe these restrictions will materially adversely impact our liquidity or ability to pay dividends in 2017. Uncertainties affecting our ability to meet cash requirements include, among others, factors affecting revenues described in Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d and -Operating Results\u201d above, economic conditions, regulatory actions, compliance with environmental regulations and conditions in the capital markets. For additional information on our future cash requirements, see -Future Cash Requirements\u201d below.\nCapital Structure\nAs of December 31, 2016 and 2015, our capital structure, excluding short-term debt, was as follows:\n\nShort-Term Borrowings\nWestar Energy maintains a commercial paper program pursuant to which it may issue commercial paper up to a maximum aggregate amount outstanding at any one time of $1.0 billion. This program is supported by Westar Energy's revolving credit facilities. Maturities of commercial paper issuances may not exceed 365 days from the date of issuance and proceeds from such issuances will be used to temporarily fund capital expenditures, to redeem debt on an interim basis, for working capital and/or for other general corporate purposes. As of February 15, 2017, Westar Energy had $498.3 million of commercial paper issued and outstanding.\nWestar Energy has two revolving credit facilities in the amounts of $730.0 million and $270.0 million. The $730.0 million facility will expire in September 2019, $20.7 million of which will expire in September 2017. In December 2016, Westar Energy extended the term of the $270.0 million facility by one year to terminate in February 2018. As long as there is no default under the facilities, the $730.0 million and $270.0 million facilities may be extended an additional year and the aggregate amount of borrowings under the $730.0 million and $270.0 million facilities may be increased to $1.0 billion and $400.0 million, respectively, subject to lender participation. All borrowings under the facilities are secured by KGE first mortgage bonds. Total combined borrowings under the revolving credit facilities and the commercial paper program may not exceed $1.0 billion at any given time. As of February 15, 2017, no amounts were borrowed and $12.3 million of letters of credit had been issued under the $730.0 million facility. No amounts were borrowed and no letters of credit were issued under the $270.0 million facility as of the same date.\nA default by Westar Energy or KGE under other indebtedness totaling more than $25.0 million would be a default under both revolving credit facilities. Westar Energy is required to maintain a consolidated indebtedness to consolidated capitalization ratio of 65% or less at all times. At December 31, 2016, our ratio was 51%. See Note 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Short-Term Debt,\u201d for additional information regarding our short-term borrowings.\nLong-Term Debt Financing\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had $121.9 million of variable rate, tax-exempt bonds outstanding. While the interest rates for these bonds have been low, we continue to monitor the credit markets and evaluate our options with respect to these bonds.\nIn January 2017, Westar Energy retired $125.0 million in principal amount of first mortgage bonds bearing a stated interest at 5.15% maturing January 2017.\nIn June 2016, Westar Energy issued $350.0 million in principal amount of first mortgage bonds bearing a stated interest at 2.55% and maturing July 2026. The bonds were issued as Green Bonds,\u201d and all proceeds from the bonds will be used in renewable energy projects, primarily the construction of the Western Plains Wind Farm.\nAlso in June 2016, KGE redeemed and reissued $50.0 million in principal amount pollution control bonds maturing June 2031. The stated rate of the bonds was reduced from 4.85% to 2.50%.\nIn February 2016, KGE, as lessee to the La Cygne sale-leaseback, effected a redemption and reissuance of $162.1 million in outstanding bonds held by the trustee of the lease maturing March 2021. The stated interest rate of the bonds was reduced from 5.647% to 2.398%. See Note 18 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Variable Interest Entities,\u201d for additional information regarding our La Cygne sale-leaseback.\nThe Westar Energy and KGE mortgages each contain provisions restricting the amount of first mortgage bonds that can be issued by each entity. We must comply with such restrictions prior to the issuance of additional first mortgage bonds or other secured indebtedness.\nUnder the Westar Energy mortgage, the issuance of bonds is subject to limitations based on the amount of bondable property additions. In addition, so long as any bonds issued prior to January 1, 1997, remain outstanding, the mortgage prohibits additional first mortgage bonds from being issued, except in connection with certain refundings, unless Westar Energy's unconsolidated net earnings available for interest, depreciation and property retirement (which as defined, does not include earnings or losses attributable to the ownership of securities of subsidiaries), for a period of 12 consecutive months within 15 months preceding the issuance, are not less than the greater of twice the annual interest charges on or 10% of the principal amount of all first mortgage bonds outstanding after giving effect to the proposed issuance. As of December 31, 2016, approximately $931.6 million principal amount of additional first mortgage bonds could be issued under the most restrictive provisions in the mortgage, except in connection with certain refundings.\nUnder the KGE mortgage, the amount of first mortgage bonds authorized is limited to a maximum of $3.5 billion and the issuance of bonds is subject to limitations based on the amount of bondable property additions. In addition, the mortgage prohibits additional first mortgage bonds from being issued, except in connection with certain refundings, unless KGE's net earnings before income taxes and before provision for retirement and depreciation of property for a period of 12 consecutive months within 15 months preceding the issuance are not less than either two and one-half times the annual interest charges on or 10% of the principal amount of all KGE first mortgage bonds outstanding after giving effect to the proposed issuance. As of December 31, 2016, approximately $1.5 billion principal amount of additional KGE first mortgage bonds could be issued under the most restrictive provisions in the mortgage, except in connection with certain refundings.\nSome of our debt instruments contain restrictions that require us to maintain leverage ratios as defined in the credit agreements. We calculate these ratios in accordance with the agreements and they are used to determine compliance with our various debt covenants. We were in compliance with these covenants as of December 31, 2016.\nImpact of Credit Ratings on Debt Financing\nMoody's Investors Service (Moody's) and Standard & Poor's Ratings Services (S&P) are independent credit-rating agencies that rate our debt securities. These ratings indicate each agency's assessment of our ability to pay interest and principal when due on our securities.\nIn general, more favorable credit ratings increase borrowing opportunities and reduce the cost of borrowing.

We produce, transmit and sell electricity at retail to approximately 704,000 customers in Kansas under the regulation of the KCC. We also supply electric energy at wholesale to municipalities and electric cooperatives in Kansas under the regulation of FERC. We have contracts for the sale or purchase of wholesale electricity with other utilities.\nProposed Merger with Great Plains Energy\nOn May 29, 2016, we entered into an agreement and plan of merger with Great Plains Energy, providing for the merger of a wholly-owned subsidiary of Great Plains Energy with and into Westar Energy, with Westar Energy surviving as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Great Plains Energy. At the closing of the merger, our shareholders will receive cash and shares of Great Plains Energy. Each issued and outstanding share of our common stock, other than certain restricted shares, will be canceled and automatically converted into $51.00 in cash, without interest, and a number of shares of Great Plains Energy common stock equal to an exchange ratio that may vary between 0.2709 and 0.3148, based upon the volume-weighted average share price of Great Plains Energy common stock on the New York Stock Exchange for the 20 consecutive full trading days ending on (and including) the third trading day immediately prior to the closing date of the transaction. Based on the closing price per share of Great Plains Energy common stock on the trading day prior to announcement of the merger, our shareholders would receive an implied $60.00 for each share of Westar Energy common stock. The closing of the merger is subject to customary closing conditions, including receipt of regulatory approvals. For more information, see Notes 3, 14 and 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Pending Merger,\u201d Commitments and Contingencies\u201d and Legal Proceedings,\u201d respectively, and Item 1A. Risk Factors.\u201d\nEarnings Per Share\nFollowing is a summary of our net income and basic earnings per share (EPS) for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015.\nTable 94: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(Dollars In Thousands, Except Per Share Amounts)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income attributable to Westar Energy, Inc.\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>346,577\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>291,929\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>54,648\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Earnings per common share, basic\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.43\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.11\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.32\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet income attributed to Westar Energy, Inc. and basic EPS for the year ended December 31, 2016, increased due primarily to higher retail prices and corporate-owned life insurance (COLI) proceeds. Partially offsetting these increases was higher operating and maintenance costs at our coal fired plants due to scheduled outages and higher depreciation and amortization due to air quality control additions at La Cygne.\nKey Factors Affecting Our Performance\nThe principal business, economic and other factors that affect our operations and financial performance include:\n \u2022 weather conditions; \n \u2022 the economy; \n \u2022 customer conservation efforts; \n \u2022 the performance, operation and maintenance of our electric generating facilities and network; \n \u2022 conditions in the fuel, wholesale electricity and energy markets; \n \u2022 rate and other regulations and costs of addressing public policy initiatives including environmental laws and regulations; \n \u2022 the availability of and our access to liquidity and capital resources; and \n \u2022 capital market conditions. \nStrategy\nWe expect to continue operating as a vertically integrated, regulated electric utility. Significant elements of our strategy include maintaining a flexible, clean and diverse energy supply portfolio. In doing so, we continue to expand renewable generation, build and upgrade our energy infrastructure and develop systems and programs with regard to how our customers use energy and interact with us. In addition, we have entered into an agreement and plan of merger with Great Plains Energy pursuant to which, at closing, we would become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Great Plains Energy. The closing of the merger is subject to customary closing conditions, including receipt of regulatory approvals. See Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d and Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Pending Merger,\u201d for additional information.\nCurrent Trends and Uncertainties\nEnvironmental Regulation\nWe are subject to various federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations. Environmental laws and regulations affecting our operations are overlapping, complex, subject to changes, have become more stringent over time and are expensive to implement. There are a variety of final and proposed laws and regulations that could have a material adverse effect on our operations and consolidated financial results, including those relating to:\n \u2022 further regulation of GHGs by the EPA, including regulations pursuant to the CPP, and future legislation that could be proposed by the U.S. Congress; \n \u2022 various proposed and expected regulations governing air emissions including those relating to National Ambient Air Quality Standards (particularly those relating to particulate matter, nitrogen oxide, ozone, carbon monoxide and sulfur dioxide); and \n \u2022 the regulation of CCR. \nSee Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Commitments and Contingencies-Environmental Matters,\u201d for a discussion of environmental costs, laws, regulations and other contingencies.\nAllowance for Funds Used During Construction\nAFUDC represents the allowed cost of capital used to finance utility construction activity. We compute AFUDC by applying a composite rate to qualified construction work in progress (CWIP). We credit other income (for equity funds) and interest expense (for borrowed funds) for the amount of AFUDC capitalized as construction cost on the accompanying consolidated statements of income as follows:\nTable 106: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In Thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Borrowed funds\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>9,964\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,505\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>12,044\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Equity funds\n</td> <td>11,630\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,075\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17,029\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>21,594\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,580\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>29,073\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average AFUDC Rates\n</td> <td>4.2\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe expect AFUDC for both borrowed funds and equity funds to fluctuate based on the timing and manner in which we finance our capital expenditures.\nInterest Expense\nWe expect interest expense to modestly increase over the next several years as we issue new debt securities to fund our capital expenditure program. We continue to believe this increase will be reflected in the prices we are permitted to charge customers, as cost of capital will be a component of future rate proceedings and is also recognized in some of the other rate adjustments we are permitted to make. In addition, short-term interest rates are low by historical standards. We cannot predict to what extent these conditions will continue. See Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Long-Term Debt\u201d for additional information regarding the issuance of long-term debt.\nCustomer Growth and Usage\nRetail customer additions have been growing approximately 0.5% the past few years. Additionally, weather normalized retail sales growth has largely grown in line with customer growth. With the numerous energy efficiency policy initiatives promulgated through federal, state and local governments, as well as industry initiatives, environmental regulations and the need to strengthen and modernize the grid, which will increase our prices, we believe customers will continue to adopt more energy efficiency and conservation measures, which will slow or possibly suppress the growth of demand for electricity.\n2017 Outlook\nIn 2017, we expect to maintain our current business strategy and regulatory approach. Assuming normal weather, we expect 2017 retail electricity sales to be in line with our projected retail customer growth of about 0.5%.\nAbsent increases in SPP transmission expense and property tax expense, which are increasing at a much higher rate than inflation and are offset with higher revenues pursuant to our regulatory mechanisms and absent incremental merger-related expenses, we anticipate operating and maintenance and selling, general and administrative expenses to be relatively flat in 2017 as compared to 2016. To help fund our capital spending as provided under -Future Cash Requirements\u201d below, in 2017 we may issue long-term debt, and utilize short-term borrowings by issuing commercial paper until permanent financing is in place.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\nOur discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in conformity with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,\u201d contains a summary of our significant accounting policies, many of which require the use of estimates and assumptions by management. The policies highlighted below have an impact on our reported results that may be material due to the levels of judgment and subjectivity necessary to account for uncertain matters or their susceptibility to change.\nRegulatory Accounting\nWe apply accounting standards that recognize the economic effects of rate regulation. Accordingly, we have recorded regulatory assets and liabilities when required by a regulatory order or based on regulatory precedent. Regulatory assets represent incurred costs that have been deferred because they are probable of future recovery in our prices. Regulatory liabilities represent probable future reductions in revenue or refunds to customers.\nThe deferral of costs as regulatory assets is appropriate only when the future recovery of such costs is probable. In assessing probability, we consider such factors as specific regulatory orders, regulatory precedent and the current regulatory environment. If we deem it no longer probable that we would recover such costs, we would record a charge against income in the amount of the related regulatory assets.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had recorded regulatory assets currently subject to recovery in future prices of approximately $879.9 million and regulatory liabilities of $239.5 million, as discussed in greater detail in Note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Rate Matters and Regulation.\u201d\nPension and Post-Retirement Benefit Plans Actuarial Assumptions\nWe and Wolf Creek calculate our pension benefit and post-retirement medical benefit obligations and related costs using actuarial concepts within the guidance provided by GAAP.\nIn accounting for our retirement plans and post-retirement benefits, we make assumptions regarding the valuation of benefit obligations and the performance of plan assets. The reported costs of our pension plans are impacted by estimates regarding earnings on plan assets, contributions to the plan, discount rates used to determine our projected benefit obligation and pension costs and employee demographics including age, life expectancy and compensation levels and employment periods. Changes in these assumptions result primarily in changes to regulatory assets, regulatory liabilities or the amount of related pension and post-retirement benefit liabilities reflected on our consolidated balance sheets. Such changes may also require cash contributions.\nThe following table shows the impact of a 0.5% change in our pension plan discount rate, salary scale and rate of return on plan assets.\nTable 107: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Actuarial Assumption\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change in\nAssumption\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\nin Projected\nBenefit\nObligation (a)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Annual\nChange in\nProjected\nPension\nCosts (a)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(Dollars In Thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Discount rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.5% decrease\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>94,763\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8,390\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.5% increase\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(84,504\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7,585\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Compensation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.5% decrease\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(18,439\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3,561\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.5% increase\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>19,717\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,822\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Rate of return on plan assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.5% decrease\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,041\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.5% increase\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4,041\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n_______________\n (a) Increases or decreases due to changes in actuarial assumptions result primarily in changes to regulatory assets and liabilities. \nThe following table shows the impact of a 0.5% change in the discount rate and rate of return on plan assets and a 1% change in the annual medical trend on our post-retirement benefit plans.\nTable 109: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Actuarial Assumption\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change in\nAssumption\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change in\nProjected\nBenefit\nObligation (a)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Annual\nChange in\nProjected\nPost-retirement\nCosts (a)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(Dollars In Thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Discount rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.5% decrease\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,823\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>325\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.5% increase\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(7,094\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(309\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Rate of return on plan assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.5% decrease\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>573\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>0.5% increase\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(573\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Annual medical trend\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.0% decrease\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>133\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.0% increase\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(125\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(19\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n_______________\n (a) Increases or decreases due to changes in actuarial assumptions result primarily in changes to regulatory assets and liabilities. \nRevenue Recognition\nWe record revenue at the time we deliver electricity to customers. We determine the amounts delivered to individual customers through systematic monthly readings of customer meters. At the end of each month, we estimate how much electricity we have delivered since the prior meter reading and record the corresponding unbilled revenue.\nOur unbilled revenue estimate is affected by factors including fluctuations in energy demand, weather, line losses and changes in the composition of customer classes. We recorded estimated unbilled revenue of $74.4 million as of December 31, 2016 and $66.0 million as of December 31, 2015.\nIncome Taxes\nWe use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of existing assets and liabilities. We recognize the future tax benefits to the extent that realization of such benefits is more likely than not. We amortize deferred investment tax credits over the lives of the related properties as required by tax laws and regulatory practices. We recognize production tax credits in the year that electricity is generated to the extent that realization of such benefits is more likely than not.\nWe record deferred tax assets to the extent capital losses, operating losses or tax credits will be carried forward to future periods. However, when we believe based on available evidence that we do not, or will not, have sufficient future capital gains or taxable income in the appropriate taxing jurisdiction to realize the entire benefit during the applicable carryforward period, we record a valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset.\nThe application of income tax law is complex. Laws and regulations in this area are voluminous and often ambiguous. Accordingly, we must make judgments regarding income tax exposure. Interpretations of and guidance surrounding income tax laws and regulations change over time. As a result, changes in our judgments can materially affect amounts we recognize in our consolidated financial statements. See Note 11of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Taxes,\u201d for additional detail on our accounting for income taxes.\nAsset Retirement Obligations\nLegal Liability\nWe have recognized legal obligations associated with the disposal of long-lived assets that result from the acquisition, construction, development or normal operation of such assets. Concurrent with the recognition of the liability, the estimated cost of the ARO is capitalized and depreciated over the remaining life of the asset. We estimate our AROs based on the fair value of the AROs we incurred at the time the related long-lived assets were either acquired, placed in service or when regulations establishing the obligation became effective. The recording of AROs for regulated operations has no income statement impact due to the deferral of the adjustments through the establishment of a regulatory asset or an offset to a regulatory liability.\nWe initially recorded AROs at fair value for the estimated cost to decommission Wolf Creek (our 47% share), retire our wind generating facilities, dispose of asbestos insulating material at our power plants, remediate ash disposal ponds, close ash landfills and dispose of polychlorinated biphenyl contaminated oil. ARO refers to a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing and/or method of settlement may be conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the entity. In determining our AROs, we make assumptions regarding probable future disposal costs. A change in these assumptions could have a significant impact on the AROs reflected on our consolidated balance sheets.\nAs of December 31, 2016 and 2015, we have recorded AROs of $324.0 million and $275.3 million, respectively. For additional information on our legal AROs, see Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Asset Retirement Obligations.\u201d\nContingencies and Litigation\nWe and our subsidiaries are involved in various legal, environmental and regulatory proceedings, and we have estimated the probable cost for the resolution of these proceedings. These estimates are based on an analysis of potential results, assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies. It is possible that our future consolidated financial results could be materially affected by changes in our assumptions. See Notes 4, 14 and 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Rate Matters and Regulations,\u201d Commitments and Contingencies\u201d and Legal Proceedings,\u201d respectively, for additional information.\nOPERATING RESULTS\nWe evaluate operating results based on EPS. We have various classifications of revenues, defined as follows:\nRetail: Sales of electricity to residential, commercial and industrial customers. Classification of customers as residential, commercial or industrial requires judgment and our classifications may be different from other companies. Assignment of tariffs is not dependent on classification. Other retail sales of electricity include lighting for public streets and highways, net of revenue subject to refund.\nWholesale: Sales of electricity to electric cooperatives, municipalities, other electric utilities and RTOs, the prices for which are either based on cost or prevailing market prices as prescribed by FERC authority. Revenues from these sales are either included in the retail energy cost adjustment or used in the determinations of base rates at the time of our next general rate review.\nTransmission: Reflects transmission revenues, including those based on tariffs with the SPP.\nOther: Miscellaneous electric revenues including ancillary service revenues and rent from electric property leased to others. This category also includes transactions unrelated to the production of our generating assets and fees we earn for services that we provide for third parties.\nElectric utility revenues are impacted by things such as rate regulation, fuel costs, technology, customer behavior, the economy and competitive forces. Changing weather also affects the amount of electricity our customers use as electricity sales are seasonal. As a summer peaking utility, the third quarter typically accounts for our greatest electricity sales. Hot summer temperatures and cold winter temperatures prompt more demand, especially among residential and commercial customers, and to a lesser extent, industrial customers. Mild weather reduces customer demand. Our wholesale revenues are impacted by, among other factors, demand, cost and availability of fuel and purchased power, price volatility, available generation capacity, transmission availability and weather.\n2016 Compared to 2015\nBelow we discuss our operating results for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to the results for the year ended December 31, 2015.

order in our state general rate review allowing us to adjust our prices to include, among other things, additional investment in La Cygne environmental upgrades and investment to extend the life of Wolf Creek. The new prices were effective late October 2015 and are expected to increase our annual retail revenues by approximately $78.3 million.\nGross Margin\nFuel and purchased power costs fluctuate with electricity sales and unit costs. As permitted by regulators, we adjust our retail prices to reflect changes in the costs of fuel and purchased power. Fuel and purchased power costs for wholesale customers are recovered at prevailing market prices or based on a predetermined formula with a price adjustment approved by FERC. As a result, changes in fuel and purchased power costs are offset in revenues with minimal impact on net income. In addition, SPP network transmission costs fluctuate due primarily to investments by us and other members of the SPP for upgrades to the transmission grid within the SPP RTO. As with fuel and purchased power costs, changes in SPP network transmission costs are mostly reflected in the prices we charge customers with minimal impact on net income. For these reasons, we believe gross margin is useful for understanding and analyzing changes in our operating performance from one period to the next. We calculate gross margin as total revenues, including transmission revenues, less the sum of fuel and purchased power costs and amounts billed by the SPP for network transmission costs. Accordingly, gross margin reflects transmission revenues and costs on a net basis. The following table summarizes our gross margin for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015.\nTable 112: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(Dollars In Thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenues\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,562,087\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,459,164\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>102,923\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less: Fuel and purchased power expense\n</td> <td>509,496\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>561,065\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(51,569\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(9.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>SPP network transmission costs\n</td> <td>232,763\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>229,043\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,720\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross Margin\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,819,828\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,669,056\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>150,772\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following table reflects changes in electricity sales for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015.

Gross margin also increased slightly due to weather that was modestly favorable relative to 2015. During 2016, there were approximately 10% more cooling degree days compared to 2015.\nIncome from operations, which is calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP in our consolidated statements of income, is the most directly comparable measure to our presentation of gross margin, which is a non-GAAP measure. Our presentation of gross margin should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for income from operations.

Energy marketing margin decreased $11.2 million due to greater volatility in 2014 of wholesale power prices. Also contributing to the decrease in gross margin was lower retail electricity sales. The lower residential and commercial electric sales were due to warm winter weather. During 2015, there were approximately 19% fewer heating degree days compared to 2014. The lower industrial sales were due to a few of our larger customers who experienced weaker global demand for their products.\nIncome from operations, which is calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP in our consolidated statements of income, is the most directly comparable measure to our presentation of gross margin, which is a non-GAAP measure. Our presentation of gross margin should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for income from operations. Additionally, our presentation of gross margin may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. The following table reconciles income from operations with gross margin for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014.\nTable 133: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(Dollars In Thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income from operations\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>620,997\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>632,958\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(11,961\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.9\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Plus: Operating and maintenance expense\n</td> <td>330,289\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>367,188\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(36,899\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(10.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization expense\n</td> <td>310,591\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>286,442\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>24,149\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling, general and administrative expense\n</td> <td>250,278\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>250,439\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(161\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Taxes other than income tax\n</td> <td>156,901\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>140,302\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16,599\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross margin\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,669,056\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,677,329\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(8,273\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating Expenses and Other Income and Expense Items\nTable 134: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(Dollars in Thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating and maintenance expense\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>330,289\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>367,188\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(36,899\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(10.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating and maintenance expense decreased due principally to:\n \u2022 lower transmission and distribution operations and maintenance expense of $14.8 million due partially to focus on capital replacement for longer term grid resiliency; \n \u2022 lower costs at our coal fired plants of $10.5 million, which were principally the result of higher operating and maintenance costs incurred during a 2014 scheduled outage at JEC; and \n \u2022 lower costs at Wolf Creek of $10.3 million, which were principally the result of higher operating and maintenance costs incurred during a 2014 scheduled outage. \nTable 138: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(Dollars in Thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization expense\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>310,591\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>286,442\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>24,149\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8.4\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDepreciation and amortization expense increased due to additions at our power plants, including air quality controls, additions at Wolf Creek to enhance reliability and the addition of transmission facilities.

We expect to meet our day-to-day cash requirements including, among other items, fuel and purchased power, dividends, interest payments, income taxes and pension contributions, using primarily internally generated cash and short-term borrowings. To meet the cash requirements for our capital investments, we expect to use internally generated cash, short-term borrowings and proceeds from the issuance of debt and equity securities in the capital markets. When such balances are of sufficient size and it makes economic sense to do so, we also use proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt and equity securities to repay short-term borrowings, which are principally related to investments in capital equipment and the redemption of bonds and for working capital and general corporate purposes. In 2017, we expect to continue our significant capital spending program and plan to contribute to our pension trust. We continue to believe that we will have the ability to pay dividends. Although the agreement and plan of merger with Great Plains Energy contains customary restrictions on our ability to raise capital and pay dividends, we do not believe these restrictions will materially adversely impact our liquidity or ability to pay dividends in 2017. Uncertainties affecting our ability to meet cash requirements include, among others, factors affecting revenues described in Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d and -Operating Results\u201d above, economic conditions, regulatory actions, compliance with environmental regulations and conditions in the capital markets. For additional information on our future cash requirements, see -Future Cash Requirements\u201d below.\nCapital Structure\nAs of December 31, 2016 and 2015, our capital structure, excluding short-term debt, was as follows:\nTable 161: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>As of December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Common equity\n</td> <td>51%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>52%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Noncontrolling interests\n</td> <td><1%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td><1%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term debt, including VIEs\n</td> <td>49%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>48%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nShort-Term Borrowings\nWestar Energy maintains a commercial paper program pursuant to which it may issue commercial paper up to a maximum aggregate amount outstanding at any one time of $1.0 billion. This program is supported by Westar Energy's revolving credit facilities. Maturities of commercial paper issuances may not exceed 365 days from the date of issuance and proceeds from such issuances will be used to temporarily fund capital expenditures, to redeem debt on an interim basis, for working capital and/or for other general corporate purposes. As of February 15, 2017, Westar Energy had $498.3 million of commercial paper issued and outstanding.\nWestar Energy has two revolving credit facilities in the amounts of $730.0 million and $270.0 million. The $730.0 million facility will expire in September 2019, $20.7 million of which will expire in September 2017. In December 2016, Westar Energy extended the term of the $270.0 million facility by one year to terminate in February 2018. As long as there is no default under the facilities, the $730.0 million and $270.0 million facilities may be extended an additional year and the aggregate amount of borrowings under the $730.0 million and $270.0 million facilities may be increased to $1.0 billion and $400.0 million, respectively, subject to lender participation. All borrowings under the facilities are secured by KGE first mortgage bonds. Total combined borrowings under the revolving credit facilities and the commercial paper program may not exceed $1.0 billion at any given time. As of February 15, 2017, no amounts were borrowed and $12.3 million of letters of credit had been issued under the $730.0 million facility. No amounts were borrowed and no letters of credit were issued under the $270.0 million facility as of the same date.\nA default by Westar Energy or KGE under other indebtedness totaling more than $25.0 million would be a default under both revolving credit facilities. Westar Energy is required to maintain a consolidated indebtedness to consolidated capitalization ratio of 65% or less at all times. At December 31, 2016, our ratio was 51%. See Note 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Short-Term Debt,\u201d for additional information regarding our short-term borrowings.\nLong-Term Debt Financing\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had $121.9 million of variable rate, tax-exempt bonds outstanding. While the interest rates for these bonds have been low, we continue to monitor the credit markets and evaluate our options with respect to these bonds.\nIn January 2017, Westar Energy retired $125.0 million in principal amount of first mortgage bonds bearing a stated interest at 5.15% maturing January 2017.\nIn June 2016, Westar Energy issued $350.0 million in principal amount of first mortgage bonds bearing a stated interest at 2.55% and maturing July 2026. The bonds were issued as Green Bonds,\u201d and all proceeds from the bonds will be used in renewable energy projects, primarily the construction of the Western Plains Wind Farm.\nAlso in June 2016, KGE redeemed and reissued $50.0 million in principal amount pollution control bonds maturing June 2031. The stated rate of the bonds was reduced from 4.85% to 2.50%.\nIn February 2016, KGE, as lessee to the La Cygne sale-leaseback, effected a redemption and reissuance of $162.1 million in outstanding bonds held by the trustee of the lease maturing March 2021. The stated interest rate of the bonds was reduced from 5.647% to 2.398%. See Note 18 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Variable Interest Entities,\u201d for additional information regarding our La Cygne sale-leaseback.\nThe Westar Energy and KGE mortgages each contain provisions restricting the amount of first mortgage bonds that can be issued by each entity. We must comply with such restrictions prior to the issuance of additional first mortgage bonds or other secured indebtedness.\nUnder the Westar Energy mortgage, the issuance of bonds is subject to limitations based on the amount of bondable property additions. In addition, so long as any bonds issued prior to January 1, 1997, remain outstanding, the mortgage prohibits additional first mortgage bonds from being issued, except in connection with certain refundings, unless Westar Energy's unconsolidated net earnings available for interest, depreciation and property retirement (which as defined, does not include earnings or losses attributable to the ownership of securities of subsidiaries), for a period of 12 consecutive months within 15 months preceding the issuance, are not less than the greater of twice the annual interest charges on or 10% of the principal amount of all first mortgage bonds outstanding after giving effect to the proposed issuance. As of December 31, 2016, approximately $931.6 million principal amount of additional first mortgage bonds could be issued under the most restrictive provisions in the mortgage, except in connection with certain refundings.\nUnder the KGE mortgage, the amount of first mortgage bonds authorized is limited to a maximum of $3.5 billion and the issuance of bonds is subject to limitations based on the amount of bondable property additions. In addition, the mortgage prohibits additional first mortgage bonds from being issued, except in connection with certain refundings, unless KGE's net earnings before income taxes and before provision for retirement and depreciation of property for a period of 12 consecutive months within 15 months preceding the issuance are not less than either two and one-half times the annual interest charges on or 10% of the principal amount of all KGE first mortgage bonds outstanding after giving effect to the proposed issuance. As of December 31, 2016, approximately $1.5 billion principal amount of additional KGE first mortgage bonds could be issued under the most restrictive provisions in the mortgage, except in connection with certain refundings.\nSome of our debt instruments contain restrictions that require us to maintain leverage ratios as defined in the credit agreements. We calculate these ratios in accordance with the agreements and they are used to determine compliance with our various debt covenants. We were in compliance with these covenants as of December 31, 2016.\nImpact of Credit Ratings on Debt Financing\nMoody's Investors Service (Moody's) and Standard & Poor's Ratings Services (S&P) are independent credit-rating agencies that rate our debt securities. These ratings indicate each agency's assessment of our ability to pay interest and principal when due on our securities.\nIn general, more favorable credit ratings increase borrowing opportunities and reduce the cost of borrowing.
