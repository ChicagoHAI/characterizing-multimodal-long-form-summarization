The content, distributed through our broadcast platform and third-party platforms, consists of programming provided by third-party networks and syndicators, local news, college and professional sports, and other original programming produced by us. Additionally, we own digital media products that are complementary to our extensive portfolio of television station and regional sports network related digital properties. Outside of our media related businesses, we operate technical services companies focused on supply and maintenance of broadcast transmission systems as well as research and development for the advancement of broadcast technology, and we manage other non-media related investments.\nWe have two reportable segments: broadcast and local sports. Our broadcast segment is comprised of our television stations. Our local sports segment is comprised of our RSNs and the YES Network. We also earn revenues from our owned networks, original content, digital and internet services, technical services, and non-media investments. These businesses are included within other. Corporate and unallocated expenses primarily include our costs to operate as a public company and to operate our corporate headquarters location. Other and corporate are not reportable segments.\nSTG, for which certain assets and results of operations are included in the broadcast segment and which is one of our wholly owned subsidiaries, is the primary obligor under the STG Bank Credit Agreement, the STG 5.125% unsecured notes due 2027, the STG 5.875% unsecured notes due 2026, the STG 5.500% unsecured notes due 2030, and the STG 4.125% secured notes due 2030 (the STG notes are collectively referred to as the STG Notes). We and substantially all of STG's subsidiaries (and not DSG nor any of its subsidiaries) are guarantors under the STG debt instruments. DSG, for which certain assets and results of operations are included in the local sports segment and which is one of our subsidiaries, is the primary obligor under the DSG Bank Credit Agreement, the DSG 5.375% secured notes due 2026 and the DSG 12.750% secured notes due 2026 (collectively, the DSG Existing Secured Notes), and the DSG 6.625% unsecured notes due 2027 (collectively with the DSG Existing Secured Notes, the DSG Notes). DSG's wholly-owned subsidiaries (and not us, STG, or any of STG's subsidiaries) are guarantors under the DSG debt instruments. Our Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock remain securities of SBG and not obligations or securities of STG or DSG.\nFor more information about our business, reportable segments, and our operating strategy, see Item 1.

For the year ended December 31, 2021, distribution revenue from the Distributor under this agreement accounted for 28.8% of our local sports segment distribution revenues.\nNEXTGEN TV\n\u2022In April 2021, CAST.ERA, a media technology joint venture between us and SK Telecom, announced it will launch a next generation broadcast solution this year that boosts television content quality utilizing SK Telecom's 5G cloud and AI technology.\n\u2022In January 2022, the NextGen Video Information Systems Alliance (NVISA) published new consumer-facing research, sponsored by our subsidiary, ONE Media 3.0, that offered the first insight into which features American consumers want most in a NextGen Broadcast-enabled emergency information service. These include a desire for geo-targeted alerts, the ability to screen for only selected alerts, options for updated alerts, and importantly, a robust/dependable system that does not crash when the Internet or cell system goes down. All of these features are embedded in the NextGen Broadcast service.\n\u2022In January 2022, MPEG LA, a pioneer in the formation and management of patent pools, completed the formation of the ATSC 3.0 Patent Pool, dramatically simplifying the efficient licensing of the new ATSC 3.0 broadcast technology in multiple-receive devices, easing the distribution and deployment process. Included in the ATSC 3.0 Patent Pool are various patents owned by our subsidiary, ONE Media.\n\u2022In 2021 and to date in 2022, we, in coordination with other broadcasters, and led by our joint venture, BitPath, have deployed NEXTGEN TV, powered by ATSC 3.0, in the twelve additional markets below.

We provide programming, sales, operational, and administrative services to this station pursuant to certain service agreements, such as LMAs.\nFinancing, Capital Allocation, and Shareholder Returns\n\u2022In April 2021, we amended the STG Bank Credit Agreement to raise the STG Term Loan B-3 in an aggregate principal amount of $740 million which matures in April 1, 2028, the proceeds of which were used to refinance a portion of STG's term loan.\n\u2022In November 2021, we purchased and assumed the lenders' and the administrative agent's rights and obligations under the existing A/R Facility of DSG's indirect subsidiary, Diamond Sports Finance SPV, LLC. We purchased the lenders' outstanding loans and commitments under the A/R Facility by making a payment to the lenders as consideration for the purchase of the lenders' respective rights and obligations under the A/R Facility equal to approximately $184.4 million, representing 101% of the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the loans under the A/R Facility, plus any accrued interest and outstanding fees and expenses, amended certain terms of the facility, and extended the maturity to September 2024.\n\u2022In January 2022, we entered into a Transaction Support Agreement with various lenders holding term loans under DSG's existing credit facilities and various holders of DSG's outstanding 5.375% Senior Secured Notes due 2026 (the \"Existing DSG 5.375% Notes\") and 12.750% Senior Secured Notes due 2026 (the \"DSG 12.750% Notes\"), on the principal terms of a new first lien money financing and recapitalization, whereby DSG intends to raise $635 million in new capital pursuant to a first-priority term loan (the \"New DSG First Lien Term Loan\") and to defer the cash payment of a portion of its management fee to STG over the next five years, which together are expected to provide approximately $1 billion of liquidity enhancement over the next five years to DSG and enable DSG to strengthen its balance sheet, fund the launch of its DTC product, and provide for future liquidity. See Note 20. Subsequent Events within the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\u2022In February 2022, pursuant to the Transaction Support Agreement, DSG commenced a private exchange offer of new second-priority lien 5.375% Senior Secured Notes due 2026 (the DSG 5.375% Second Lien Secured Notes\u201d) to eligible holders of its outstanding first-priority lien 5.375% Senior Secured Notes due 2026. At the same time, DSG commenced a private exchange offer of new second-priority lien term loans to its lenders holding existing first-priority lien term loans. The note exchange expires on March 10, 2022, with an early tender deadline of February 28, 2022, while the loan exchange expires on February 28, 2022. The exchanges are conditioned on receiving requisite consent of the noteholders and lenders.

Subsequent Events within the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\u2022For the year ended December 31, 2021, we repurchased approximately 2.4 million shares of Class A Common Stock for $61 million.

The shares were repurchased under a 10b5-1 plan.\n\u2022For the year ended December 31, 2021, we paid dividends of $0.80 per share. In February 2022, we declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.25 per share, an increase in our quarterly cash dividend of 25%.\nOther Events\n\u2022In January 2021, we announced the hiring of Jeffrey Lewis as our Chief Compliance Officer, a newly-created position to supervise corporate compliance functions, including regulatory, code of conduct, competition, and privacy.\n\u2022 In January 2021, we jointly revealed, with Bally's, the new Bally Sports logo and Bally Sports regional monikers for our owned and operated RSNs.\n\u2022 In March 2021, we announced an enterprise-wide workforce reduction involving the termination of approximately 500 employees and incurred approximately $7 million of restructuring and related charges.\n\u2022 In April 2021, we increased the size of our Board of Directors and named Laurie R. Beyer to serve as its newest independent board member.\n\u2022 In April 2021, we announced that Bally Sports, Tennis Channel, and its High School Sports Division collectively, won nine Cynopsis Sports Media Awards, including \"RSN of the Year.\"\n\u2022In April 2021, we signed a multi-year enterprise partnership agreement with Operative Media to enable us to consolidate all our sellable advertising assets across our platforms into a single ad sales system. The framework enables us to offer our customers a simplified and optimized solution to buying from our extensive ad inventory across all of our platforms.\n\u2022 In May 2021, we announced the retirement of Barry Faber, President of Distribution and Network Relations, effective June 25, 2021.\n\u2022 In June 2021, Fortune Magazine named the Company to the Fortune 500 for the first time, ranking it 465 on the list.\n\u2022 In June 2021, at the Company's Annual Shareholders' Meeting, the Company's shareholders re-elected all ten Directors, ratified the appointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2021, approved the amended and restated Employee Stock Purchase Plan, and approved an amendment to the Company's 1996 Long-Term Incentive Plan to increase the number of shares authorized for issuance thereunder.\n\u2022In June 2021, we selected seven winning applicants for our Broadcast Diversity Scholarship, awarding tuition assistance to students demonstrating a promising future in the broadcast industry.\n\u2022 In June and July 2021, we partnered with the American Red Cross for the Sinclair Cares: Roll Up Your Sleeves\u201d campaign, to urge our viewers to help increase U.S. blood supplies by making a blood donation appointment, volunteering time, or providing financial contributions for the cause.\n\u2022 In July 2021, we hired John McClure to the newly created role of Vice President and Chief Information Security Officer.\n\u2022In August 2021, we appointed William Bell as Head of Distribution and Network Relations.\n\u2022In September 2021, our television stations collectively raised nearly $0.7 million for local charities through regional back-to-school fundraising and supply donation initiatives. Our stations also donated over $0.6 million in promotional air time to support these initiatives.\n\u2022On October 17, 2021, we identified the following: (i) certain servers and workstations in our environment were encrypted with ransomware, (ii) disruption of certain office and operational networks as a result of the encryption, and (iii) indications that data was taken from our network. Promptly upon detection of the security event, senior management was notified and we began to implement incident response measures to contain the incident, conduct an investigation, and plan for restoring operations. Legal counsel, a cybersecurity forensic firm, and other incident response professionals were engaged, and law enforcement and other governmental agencies were notified. The investigation into the incident remains ongoing. The cybersecurity incident resulted in the loss in the fourth quarter of 2021 of approximately $63 million of advertising revenue, primarily related to our broadcast segment, as well as approximately $11 million through the date of filing this Form 10-K in costs and expenses related to mitigation efforts, our ongoing investigation and the security improvements resulting therefrom, however we paid no ransom. These amounts exceed the limits under our insurance policies and thus, based on the known effects of the cyber incident, the Company estimates that the cyber incident has resulted in approximately $24 million of unrecoverable net loss through the date of filing this Form 10-K.\n\u2022In October 2021, we partnered with the Disabled American Veterans for the \"Sinclair Cares: Supporting American Veterans\" campaign, encouraging our employees and viewers to volunteer or donate to help support veterans in their communities.\n\u2022In December 2021, we partnered with the American Red Cross for the Sinclair Cares: Tornado Relief\u201d campaign, raising $175,000 in total from viewers and Sinclair corporate donations to assist those affected by the devastating tornadoes in the South and Midwest.\n\u2022In December 2021, our television stations and RSNs collected 140,000 toys, tens of thousands pounds of food and several truckloads of clothing, sleeping bags, blankets and monetary donations for local charities through regional holiday drives. Regional recipients across the country include local community food banks, Toys for Tots, The Salvation Army, Bikes for Kids, The Forgotten Child Fund, Neediest Kids, Habitat for Humanity, The United Way and Central Arizona Shelter Services, among others.\n\u2022In January 2022, we began taking applications for our 2022 Diversity Scholarship, which has awarded more than $100,000 in scholarships over the last six years.\n\u2022In February 2022, we announced the promotion of Rob Weisbord to Chief Operating Officer and President of Broadcast.\nIndustry Trends\n\u2022During the last few years, the number of subscribers to Distributor services in the United States has generally been declining, as technological advancements have driven changes in consumer behavior and have empowered consumers to seek more control over when, where and how they consume news, sports and other entertainment, including through the so-called cutting the cord\u201d and other consumption strategies.\n\u2022The Distributor industry has continued to undergo significant consolidation, which gives top Distributors purchase power.\n\u2022Distributors have introduced, marketed and/or modified tiers or bundles of programming that have impacted the number of subscribers that receive our RSNs, including tiers or bundles of programming that exclude our RSNs. We expect these trends to continue for the foreseeable future. We believe the emergence of DTC and OTT offerings will provide us the opportunity to compete with these products and services offered by Distributors\n\u2022The vMVPDs have continued to gain increasing importance and have quickly become a critical segment of the market. These vMVPDs offer a limited number of networks at a lower price point as compared to the traditional cable offering.\n\u2022Political spending is significantly higher in the even-numbered years due to the cyclicality of political elections. In addition, every four years, political spending is typically elevated further due to the advertising related to the presidential election. 2020 proved to be a record year in political advertising.\n\u2022The FCC has permitted broadcast television stations to use their digital spectrum for a wide variety of services including multi-channel broadcasts. The FCC must-carry\u201d rules only apply to a station's primary digital stream.\n\u2022Seasonal advertising increases within our broadcast segment occur in the second and fourth quarters due to the anticipation of certain seasonal and holiday spending by consumers.\n\u2022Seasonal advertising increases within our local sports segment occur in the second and third quarters due to a higher volume of sports games being played during this time, particularly the MLB season.\n\u2022Broadcasters have found ways to increase returns on their news programming initiatives while continuing to maintain locally produced content through the use of news sharing arrangements.\n\u2022Broadcasters have begun to expand their own DTC platforms.\n\u2022Advertising revenue related to the Summer Olympics occurs in even numbered years, with the exception of 2020 which was postponed due to COVID-19 and took place in Summer 2021, and the Super Bowl is aired on a different network each year. Both of these popularly viewed events can have an impact on our advertising revenues.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nThis discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates including those related to revenue recognition, goodwill and intangible assets, program contract costs, sports programming rights, income taxes and variable interest entities. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. These estimates have been consistently applied for all years presented in this report and in the past we have not experienced material differences between these estimates and actual results. However, because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty, actual results could differ from our estimates and such differences could be material.\nWe consider the following accounting policies to be the most critical as they are important to our financial condition and results of operations, and require significant judgment and estimates on the part of management in their application. For a detailed discussion of the application of these and other accounting policies, see Note 1. Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies within the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic continues to create significant uncertainty and disruption in the global economy and financial markets. It is reasonably possible that these uncertainties continue to impact our estimates related to, but not limited to, revenue recognition, goodwill and intangible assets, sports programming rights, and income taxes. As a result, many of our estimates and assumptions require increased judgment and carry a higher degree of variability and volatility. See Distribution Revenue in Revenue Recognition, Sports Programming Rights, and Impairment of Goodwill, Intangibles, and Other Assets under Note 1. Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies within the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on how COVID-19 has impacted distribution revenue, sports rights expense, and the value of goodwill and definite-lived intangible assets, respectively. Our estimates may further change in the future as the COVID-19 pandemic continues, new events occur, and additional information emerges, and such changes are recognized or disclosed in the consolidated financial statements.\nRevenue Recognition. As discussed in Revenue Recognition under Note 1. Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies within the Consolidated Financial Statements, we generate advertising revenue primarily from the sale of advertising spots/impressions on our broadcast television, RSNs, and digital platforms. Advertising revenue is recognized in the period in which the advertising spots/impressions are delivered. In arrangements where we provide audience ratings guarantees; to the extent that there is a ratings shortfall, we will defer a proportionate amount of revenue until the ratings shortfall is settled through the delivery of additional advertising. The term of our advertising arrangements is generally less than one year and the timing between when an advertisement is aired and when payment is realized is not significant. In certain circumstances, we require customers to pay in advance; payments received in advance of satisfying our performance obligations are reflected as deferred revenue.\nWe generate distribution revenue through fees received from Distributors and other OTT providers for the right to distribute our broadcast channels and cable networks on their distribution platforms. Distribution arrangements are generally governed by multi-year contracts and the underlying fees are based upon a contractual monthly rate per subscriber. These arrangements represent licenses of intellectual property; revenue is recognized as the signal is provided to our customers (as usage occurs) which corresponds with the satisfaction of our performance obligation. Revenue is calculated based upon the contractual rate multiplied by an estimated number of subscribers. Our customers will remit payments based upon actual subscribers a short time after the conclusion of a month, which generally does not exceed 120 days. Historical adjustments to subscriber estimates have not been material.\nCertain of our distribution arrangements contain provisions that require the Company to deliver a minimum number of live professional sports games or tournaments during a defined period which usually corresponds with a calendar year. If the minimum threshold is not met, we may be obligated to refund a portion of the distribution fees received if shortfalls are not cured within a specified period of time. If we are unable to meet these minimum requirements, we reduce revenue based upon estimated rebates due to our distribution customers over the measurement period of the rebate. See Revenue Recognition within Note 1. Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.\nImpairment of Goodwill, Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets, and Other Long-Lived Assets. We evaluate our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually, or more frequently, if events or changes in circumstances indicate an impairment may exist. As of December 31, 2021, our consolidated balance sheet includes $2,088 million and $150 million of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, respectively. We evaluate long-lived assets, including definite-lived intangible assets, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of our asset groups may not be recoverable.\nIn the performance of our annual goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment assessments we have the option to qualitatively assess whether it is more likely-than-not that the respective asset has been impaired. If we conclude that it is more-likely-than-not that a reporting unit or an indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired, we apply the quantitative assessment, which involves comparing the estimated fair value of the reporting unit or indefinite-lived intangible asset to its respective carrying value. See Impairment of Goodwill, Intangibles and Other Assets under Note 1. Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 5. Goodwill, Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets, and Other Intangible Assets within the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the significant judgments and estimates inherent in both qualitatively assessing whether impairment may exist and estimating the fair values of the reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets if a quantitative assessment is deemed necessary.\nWe are required to analyze our long-lived assets, including definite-lived intangible assets, for impairment. We evaluate our definite-lived intangible assets for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. In the event we identify indicators that these assets are not recoverable, we evaluate the recoverability of definite-lived intangible assets by comparing the carrying amount of the assets within an asset group to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows associated with the asset group. An asset group represents the lowest level of cash flows generated by a group of assets that are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets. At the time that such evaluations indicate that the future undiscounted cash flows are not sufficient to recover the carrying value of the asset group, an impairment loss is determined by comparing the estimated fair value of the asset group to the carrying value. We estimate fair value using an income approach involving the performance of a discounted cash flow analysis.\nOur RSNs included in the local sports segment were negatively impacted by the loss of three Distributors in 2020. In addition, our existing Distributors experienced elevated levels of subscriber erosion which we believe was influenced, in part, by shifting consumer behaviors resulting from media fragmentation, the current economic environment, the COVID 19 pandemic and related uncertainties. Most of these factors are also expected to have a negative impact on future projected revenue and margins of our RSNs. As a result of these factors, we performed an impairment test of the RSN reporting units' goodwill and long-lived asset groups during the third quarter of 2020 which resulted in a non-cash impairment charge on goodwill of $2,615 million, customer relationships of $1,218 million, and other definite-lived intangible assets of $431 million, included within impairment of goodwill and definite-lived intangible assets in our consolidated statements of operations within the Consolidated Financial Statements. See Note 5. Goodwill, Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets, and Other Intangible Assets within the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. During the year ended December 31, 2021, we did not identify any indicators that our definite-lived intangible assets may not be recoverable. For our annual goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles impairment tests related to our broadcast and other reporting units in 2021, 2020, and 2019, we concluded that it was more-likely-than-not that goodwill was not impaired based on our qualitative assessments. For one reporting unit in 2019, we elected to perform a quantitative assessment and concluded that its fair value significantly exceeded the carrying value.\nWe believe we have made reasonable estimates and utilized appropriate assumptions in the performance of our impairment assessments. If future results are not consistent with our assumptions and estimates, including future events such as a deterioration of market conditions, loss of significant customers, failure to execute on DSG's DTC strategy, and significant increases in discount rates, among other factors, we could be exposed to impairment charges in the future. Any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated balance sheets, consolidated statements of operations and consolidated statements of cash flows.\nProgram Contract Costs. As discussed in Broadcast Television Programming under Note 1. Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies within the Consolidated Financial Statements, we record an asset and corresponding liability for programming rights when the program is available for its first showing or telecast. These costs are expensed over the period in which an economic benefit is expected to be derived. To ensure the related assets for the programming rights are reflected in our consolidated balance sheets at the lower of unamortized cost or fair value, management estimates future advertising revenue to be generated by the remaining program material available under the contract terms. Management's judgment is required in determining the timing of expense for these costs, which is dependent on the economic benefit expected to be generated from the program and may significantly differ from the timing of related payments under the contractual obligation. If our estimates of future advertising revenues decline, amortization expense could be accelerated or fair value adjustments may be required.\nSports Programming Rights. As discussed in Sports Programming Rights under Note 1. Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies within the Consolidated Financial Statements, we have multi-year program rights agreements that provide us with the right to produce and telecast professional sports games within a specified territory in exchange for an annual rights fee. A prepaid asset is recorded for rights acquired related to future games upon payment of the contracted fee. The assets recorded for the acquired rights are classified as current or non-current based on the period when the games are expected to be aired. Liabilities are recorded for any program rights obligations that have been incurred but not yet paid at period end. We amortize these programming rights as an expense over each season based upon contractually stated rates. Amortization is accelerated in the event that the stated contractual rates over the term of the rights agreement results in an expense recognition pattern that is inconsistent with the projected growth of revenue over the contractual term.\nFair Value Measurements of Investments in Bally's Securities. As discussed in Note 6. Other Assets and Note 18. Fair Value Measurements within the Consolidated Financial Statements, we entered into a commercial agreement with Bally's Corporation on November 18, 2020. As part of this arrangement, the Company received warrants and options to acquire common equity in the business. These financial instruments are measured each period at fair value. The fair value of the options are derived utilizing a Black Scholes valuation model which utilizes a number of inputs which most significantly includes the trading price of the underlying common stock, the exercise price of the options and a discount for lack of marketability. The fair value of the warrants are primarily derived from the trading price of the underlying common stock, the exercise price of the warrants and a discount for lack of marketability. The determination of the fair value of these financial instruments requires the Company to exercise judgment.\nIncome Tax. As discussed in Income Taxes under Note 1. Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies within the Consolidated Financial Statements, we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities. We provide a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets if we determine that it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. In evaluating our ability to realize net deferred tax assets, we consider all available evidence, both positive and negative, including our past operating results, tax planning strategies, current and cumulative losses, and forecasts of future taxable income. In considering these sources of taxable income, we must make certain judgments that are based on the plans and estimates used to manage our underlying businesses on a long-term basis. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, a valuation allowance has been provided for deferred tax assets related to certain temporary basis differences, interest expense carryforwards under the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) Section 163(j) and a substantial amount of our available state net operating loss carryforwards based on past operating results, including the RSN impairment, expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary basis differences, alternative tax strategies and projected future taxable income. Future changes in operating and/or taxable income or other changes in facts and circumstances could significantly impact the ability to realize our deferred tax assets which could have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.\nManagement periodically performs a comprehensive review of our tax positions, and we record a liability for unrecognized tax benefits if such tax positions are more likely than not to be sustained upon examination based on their technical merits, including the resolution of any appeals or litigation processes. Significant judgment is required in determining whether positions taken are more likely than not to be sustained, and it is based on a variety of facts and circumstances, including interpretation of the relevant federal and state income tax codes, regulations, case law and other authoritative pronouncements. Based on this analysis, the status of ongoing audits and the expiration of applicable statute of limitations, liabilities are adjusted as necessary. The resolution of audits is unpredictable and could result in tax liabilities that are significantly higher or lower than for what we have provided. See Note 12. Income Taxes within the Consolidated Financial Statements, for further discussion of accrued unrecognized tax benefits.\nVariable Interest Entities (VIEs). As discussed in Note 14. Variable Interest Entities within the Consolidated Financial Statements, we have determined that certain third-party licensees of stations for which we perform services pursuant to arrangements, including LMAs, JSAs, and SSAs, are VIEs and we are the primary beneficiary of those variable interests because, subject to the ultimate control of the licensees, we have the power to direct the activities which significantly impact the economic performance of the VIE through the services we provide and because we absorb losses and returns that would be considered significant to the VIEs. We have determined that certain RSN joint ventures are VIEs. We are the primary beneficiary of those RSN joint ventures because we have the power to direct the activities which significantly impact the economic performance of certain regional sports networks, including sales and certain operational services and because we absorb losses and returns that would be considered significant to the VIEs.\nTransactions with Related Parties. We have determined that we conduct certain business-related transactions with related persons or entities. See Note 15. Related Person Transactions within the Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion of these transactions.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Recent Accounting Pronouncements under Note 1. Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies within the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of recent accounting policies and their impact on our financial statements.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nAny references to the first, second, third or fourth quarters are to the three months ended March 31, June 30, September 30, or December 31, respectively, for the year being discussed. We have two reportable segments, broadcast and local sports, that are disclosed separately from our other and corporate activities.\nSeasonality / Cyclicality\nThe operating results of our broadcast segment are usually subject to cyclical fluctuations from political advertising. In even numbered years, political spending is usually significantly higher than in odd numbered years due to advertising expenditures preceding local and national elections. Additionally, every four years, political spending is usually elevated further due to advertising expenditures preceding the presidential election (as was the case in 2020). Also, the second and fourth quarter operating results are usually higher than the first and third quarter operating results because advertising expenditures are increased in anticipation of certain seasonal and holiday spending by consumers.\nThe operating results of our local sports segment are usually subject to cyclical fluctuations based on the timing and overlap of the MLB, NBA, and NHL seasons. Usually, the second and third quarter operating results are higher than the first and fourth quarter operating results.\nConsolidated Operating Data\nThe following table sets forth certain of our consolidated operating data for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019 (in millions).\nTable 21: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Years Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Media revenues (a) </td> <td>$ </td> <td>6,083 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,843 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,046 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-media revenues </td> <td>51 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>194 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total revenues </td> <td>6,134 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,943 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,240 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Media programming and production expenses </td> <td>4,291 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,735 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,073 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Media selling, general and administrative expenses </td> <td>908 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>832 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>732 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization expenses (b) </td> <td>591 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>674 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>424 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of program contract costs </td> <td>93 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>86 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>90 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-media expenses </td> <td>57 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>91 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>156 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Corporate general and administrative expenses </td> <td>170 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>148 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>387 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impairment of goodwill and definite-lived intangible assets </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,264 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain on asset dispositions and other, net of impairment </td> <td>(71) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(115) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(92) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income (loss) </td> <td>$ </td> <td>95 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(2,772) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>470 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net (loss) income attributable to Sinclair Broadcast Group </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(414) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(2,414) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>47 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 22: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(a)Media revenues include distribution revenue, advertising revenue, and other media related revenues.\n(b)Depreciation and amortization includes depreciation and amortization of property and equipment and amortization of definite-lived intangible assets and other assets.\nThe Impact of COVID-19 on our Results of Operations\nOverview\nOn March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic, and by the end of the following day, each of the MLB, NBA, and NHL had suspended their seasons. On March 13, 2020, the United States declared a national state of emergency. As of December 31, 2021, the national state of emergency is still in effect, however substantially all states have reopened their economies, COVID-19 vaccinations are being distributed in mass quantities and all professional sports leagues are currently playing live games. However, with new variants of COVID-19 being detected across multiple countries, including the United States, there is still a heightened level of uncertainty of what the overall impact of COVID-19 will be on our business.\nBroadcast segment\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, as compared to the prior year, we experienced a decrease in advertising revenue primarily due to a decrease in political revenue as 2021 was a non-political year. See Revenues under the Broadcast Segment section below for further discussion.\nLocal sports segment\nIn March 2020, the NBA and NHL each postponed their 2019-2020 season and the MLB postponed the start of its 2020 season, however all leagues' returned to operation under reduced game counts and were able to complete these modified seasons during the early part of the fourth quarter of 2020. The NBA and NHL began their modified 2020-2021 seasons during the fourth quarter of 2020 and the first quarter of 2021, respectively, and the MLB began its 2021 season on April 1, 2021. Advertising revenue increased in the year ended December 31, 2021, as compared to the prior year, largely driven by an increased number of games played in 2021 when compared to 2020. Distribution revenue increased in the year ended December 31, 2021, as compared to 2020, primarily related to 2020 revenue being reduced due to the accrual of rebates to our Distributors resulting from the cancellation of professional sports games due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The MLB began their season on time in April 2021 and completed their full game schedule and the NBA and NHL began their 2021-2022 seasons in October 2021 under full game schedules. However, in light of the fourth quarter 2021 spike in COVID-19 cases, both the NHL and NBA have had to postpone and reschedule some of their games during their 2021-22 seasons. Of the total 11 NBA games postponed in the fourth quarter of 2021, 2 of which related to the RSNs, have been rescheduled for the first quarter 2022. Of the total 104 NHL games postponed during the 2021-22 season, 38 of which related to the RSNs, the majority were shifted from the fourth quarter 2021 to the first quarter 2022. The shift in these games to 2022 resulted in an increase in the estimated rebates to our Distributors of $8 million during the fourth quarter of 2021. Both leagues currently expect to finish their regular seasons on schedule, although there can be no assurance that the NBA or NHL will complete full seasons in the future. On December 2, 2021, MLB owners locked out players following the expiration of its prior collective bargaining agreement with its players. While negotiations towards a new collective bargaining agreement have commenced, there can be no assurance that an agreement will be reached prior to the commencement of the 2022 MLB season or at all, therefore there can be no assurance that the MLB will complete a full season in 2022 or in future years. Any reduction in the actual number of games played by the leagues may have an adverse impact on our operations and the cash flows of our local sports segment. See Distribution Revenue in Revenue Recognition and Sports Programming Rights under Note 1. Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies within the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on how COVID-19 has impacted distribution revenue and sports rights expense, respectively, including the need for us to provide rebates to our Distributors as well as seek rebate from or reduce future payments to certain of the sports teams.\nBusiness continuity\nWithin the United States, our business has been designated an essential business, which allows us to continue to serve our customers, however, the COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted our operations. Certain of our facilities have experienced temporary disruptions as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, and we cannot predict whether our facilities will experience more significant disruptions in the future and how long these disruptions will last. The COVID-19 pandemic has heightened the risk that a significant portion of our workforce will suffer illness or otherwise be unable to work. Furthermore, reductions in our workforce may become necessary as a result of declines in our business caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. If we take such actions, we cannot assure that we will be able to rehire our workforce once our business has recovered.\nA discussion regarding our financial results and operations for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020 is presented below. A discussion of the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 can be found under Item 7 of Part II of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020, filed with the SEC on March 1, 2021 (our \"2020 Annual Report\"), which is available free of charge on the SEC's website at www.sec.gov and our Investor Relations website at www.sbgi.net/investor-relations.\nBROADCAST SEGMENT\nThe following table sets forth our revenue and expenses for our broadcast segment, previously referred to as our local news and marketing services segment, for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019 (in millions):\nTable 23: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Percent Change\nIncrease / (Decrease) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>\u201821 vs.\u201820 </td> <td> </td> <td>\u201820 vs.\u201819 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenue: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Distribution revenue </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,475 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,414 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,341 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4% </td> <td> </td> <td>5% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Advertising revenue </td> <td>1,106 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,364 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,268 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(19)% </td> <td> </td> <td>8% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other media revenue (a) </td> <td>176 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>144 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>81 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>22% </td> <td> </td> <td>78% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Media revenues </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,757 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,922 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,690 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(6)% </td> <td> </td> <td>9% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating Expenses: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Media programming and production expenses </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,344 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,257 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,173 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7% </td> <td> </td> <td>7% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Media selling, general and administrative expenses </td> <td>593 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>553 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>553 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7% </td> <td> </td> <td>-% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of program contract costs </td> <td>76 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>83 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>90 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(8)% </td> <td> </td> <td>(8)% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Corporate general and administrative expenses </td> <td>147 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>119 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>144 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>24% </td> <td> </td> <td>(17)% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization expenses </td> <td>247 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>239 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>246 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3% </td> <td> </td> <td>(3)% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain on asset dispositions and other, net of impairment </td> <td>(24) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(118) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(62) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(80)% </td> <td> </td> <td>90% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income </td> <td>$ </td> <td>374 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>789 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>546 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(53)% </td> <td> </td> <td>45% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 24: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(a)Includes $111 million, $100 million, and $35 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, of intercompany revenue related to certain services provided to the local sports segment and other under management services agreements, which is eliminated in consolidation.\nRevenues\nDistribution revenue. Distribution revenue, which includes payments from Distributors for our broadcast signals, increased $61 million in 2021, when compared to the same period in 2020, primarily due to an increase in rates, partially offset by a decrease in subscribers.\nAdvertising revenue. Advertising revenue decreased $258 million in 2021, when compared to the same period in 2020, primarily due to a decrease in political advertising revenue of $329 million, as 2020 was a political and presidential election year, and due to the effects of the cybersecurity incident that occurred during the fourth quarter of 2021, which we currently estimate resulted in a decrease in revenue of approximately $63 million. The decrease is partially offset by increases in various non-political advertising categories due to improved macroeconomic conditions, as the economy began to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic in 2021.\nFor the year ending December 31, 2022 we expect an increase in advertising revenue, when compared to 2021, primarily related to an increase in political revenue, as 2022 is a political election year.\nThe following table sets forth our affiliate percentages of advertising revenue for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019:\nTable 25: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td># of </td> <td> </td> <td>Percent of Advertising Revenue for the\nTwelve Months Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Channels (a) </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>ABC </td> <td>40 </td> <td> </td> <td>31% </td> <td> </td> <td>28% </td> <td> </td> <td>30% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>FOX </td> <td>56 </td> <td> </td> <td>24% </td> <td> </td> <td>25% </td> <td> </td> <td>25% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>CBS </td> <td>31 </td> <td> </td> <td>20% </td> <td> </td> <td>22% </td> <td> </td> <td>20% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>NBC </td> <td>25 </td> <td> </td> <td>14% </td> <td> </td> <td>15% </td> <td> </td> <td>13% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>CW </td> <td>46 </td> <td> </td> <td>5% </td> <td> </td> <td>5% </td> <td> </td> <td>6% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>MNT </td> <td>40 </td> <td> </td> <td>4% </td> <td> </td> <td>4% </td> <td> </td> <td>4% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other </td> <td>396 </td> <td> </td> <td>2% </td> <td> </td> <td>1% </td> <td> </td> <td>2% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total </td> <td>634 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 26: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(a)We broadcast other programming from the following providers on our channels including: Antenna TV, Azteca, Bounce, CHARGE!, Comet, Dabl, Decades, Estrella TV, GetTV, Grit, MeTV, Rewind, Stadium, TBD, Telemundo, This TV, UniMas, Univision, and Weather.\nOther Media Revenue. Other media revenue increased $32 million in 2021, when compared to the same period in 2020. The increase is primarily due to an $11 million increase in intercompany revenue from the local sports and other segments related to providing certain services under a management services agreement, which are eliminated in our consolidated results.\nExpenses\nMedia programming and production expenses. Media programming and production expenses increased $87 million during 2021, when compared to the same period in 2020, primarily related to an increase in fees pursuant to network affiliation agreements of $99 million, partially offset by a $19 million decrease in employee compensation costs.\nMedia selling, general and administrative expenses. Media selling, general and administrative expenses increased $40 million during 2021, when compared to the same period in 2020, primarily due a $17 million increase in employee compensation costs, a portion of which is related to severance and other termination benefits related to a reduction-in-force completed in the first quarter of 2021, a $13 million increase in technology costs, and $7 million primarily related to FCC penalties incurred by several consolidated VIEs, as discussed in Note 13. Commitments and Contingencies within the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nAmortization of program contract costs. The amortization of program contract costs decreased $7 million during 2021, when compared to the same period in 2020, primarily related to the timing of amortization on long-term contracts and reduced renewal costs, partially offset by amortization related to new programming.\nCorporate general and administrative expenses. See explanation under Corporate and Unallocated Expenses.\nDepreciation and amortization expenses. Depreciation of property and equipment and amortization of definite-lived intangibles and other assets increased $8 million during 2021, when compared to the same period in 2020, primarily due to an increase in assets placed in-service.\nGain on asset dispositions and other, net of impairments. During 2021 and 2020, we recorded a gain of $24 million and $90 million, respectively, related to reimbursements from the FCC's National Broadband Plan spectrum repack process. For the year ended 2021, we recorded a gain on asset disposition of $12 million, related to the WDKA-TV/KBSI-TV transaction, and a loss of $12 million, related to the sale of our radio stations, primarily related to the write-down of the carrying value of the assets to estimate the selling price. For the year ended 2020, we recorded a gain of $29 million related to the sale of KGBT-TV and WDKY-TV. See Dispositions within Note 2. Acquisitions and Dispositions of Assets within the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.\nLOCAL SPORTS SEGMENT\nOur local sports segment, previously referred to as our sports segment, reflects the results of our RSNs and a minority equity interest in the YES Network. The RSNs and YES Network own the exclusive rights to air, among other sporting events, the games of professional sports teams.\nThe following table sets forth our revenue and expenses for our local sports segment for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019 (in millions):\nTable 27: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Percent Change\nIncrease / (Decrease) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 (b) </td> <td> </td> <td>\u201821 vs.\u201820 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenue: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(c) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Distribution revenue </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,620 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,472 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,029 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Advertising revenue </td> <td>409 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>196 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>103 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>109% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other media revenue </td> <td>27 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>50% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Media revenue </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,056 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,686 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,139 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating Expenses: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Media programming and production expenses </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,793 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,361 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>769 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>105% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Media selling, general and administrative expenses (a) </td> <td>297 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>243 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>90 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>22% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization expenses </td> <td>316 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>410 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>157 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(23)% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Corporate general and administrative </td> <td>10 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>93 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>-% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain on asset dispositions and other, net of impairment </td> <td>(43) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>n/m </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impairment of goodwill and definite-lived intangible assets </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,264 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>n/m </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating (loss) income (a) </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(317) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(3,602) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>30 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(91)% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income from equity method investments </td> <td>$ </td> <td>49 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>18 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>717% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other income, net </td> <td>$ </td> <td>15 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>160 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>200 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(91)% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 28: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nn/m - not meaningful\n(a)Includes $109 million, $98 million and $35 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, of intercompany expense related to certain services provided by the broadcast segment under a management services agreement, which is eliminated in consolidation.\n(b)Represents the activity from the closing date of the acquisition of the Acquired RSNs of August 23, 2019 through December 31, 2019.\n(c)Marquee was launched in late February 2020, therefore although not called out in each section below, is a driver of the changes between the periods due to a full year of activity being included in the current period, versus only 10 months of activity in the prior period.\nDistribution revenue. Distribution revenue, which is generated through fees received from Distributors for the right to distribute our RSNs, increased $148 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, when compared to the same period in 2020. During the year ended 2020, distribution revenue was reduced by $420 million, related to the accrual of rebates to our Distributors resulting from the cancellation of professional sports games due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Distribution revenue was increased during the year ended December 31, 2021 by $8 million, primarily related to a reduction of accrued rebates due to an increase in estimated games related to the NBA. See discussion under Revenue Recognition within Note 1. Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies within the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. Excluding the effect of these accrued rebates and related adjustments, distribution revenue declined by $280 million in 2021 when compared to the same period in 2020, and was primarily driven by the loss of three Distributors in 2020 and subscriber churn with remaining Distributors, partially offset by increases in rates. We expect distribution revenue to decrease for the year ending December 31, 2022 when compared to 2021 due to continued subscriber churn.\nAdvertising revenue. Advertising revenue is primarily generated from sales of commercial time within the RSNs' programming. Advertising revenue increased $213 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, when compared to the same period in 2020, primarily due to a higher number of games being played in 2021, when compared to 2020, due to the suspension of the league seasons in March 2020 and the resulting reduction of the number of games played in 2020. We expect advertising revenue for the year ending December 31, 2022 to increase when compared to 2021.\nMedia programming and production expenses. Media programming and production expenses are primarily related to amortization of our sports programming rights with MLB, NBA, and NHL teams, and the costs of producing and distributing content for our brands including live games, pre-game and post-game shows, and backdrop programming.\nMedia programming and production expenses increased $1,432 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, when compared to the same period in 2020, primarily driven by a $1,272 million increase in sports rights amortization expense, a $91 million increase in employee compensation cost related to freelance talent, and a $67 million increase in production expenses, all of which increased as a result of an increase in the number of games played compared to the same period in the prior year.\nThe increases in the number of games played in 2021, when compared to the same period in 2020, are primarily driven by the suspension of the 2019-2020 NBA and NHL seasons and the 2020 MLB season in early March 2020. The changes to the seasons were in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and resulted in a higher number of games during 2021, as compared to the prior year. We expect media programming and production expenses for the year ending December 31, 2022 to decrease when compared to 2021. See The Impact of COVID-19 on our Results of Operations for further discussion.\nMedia selling, general, and administrative expenses. Media selling, general, and administrative expenses increased $54 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, when compared to the same period in 2020, primarily related to a $22 million increase in information technology expenses, a $13 million increase in national sales commissions, an $11 million increase of management services agreement fees, and a $5 million increase in third-party fulfillment costs from our digital business.\nDepreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization expense decreased $94 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, when compared to the same period in 2020, primarily due to a decrease in amortization expense due to lower intangible asset values as a result of an impairment in 2020.\nCorporate general and administrative expenses. See explanation under Corporate and Unallocated Expenses.\nOther income, net. See explanation under Corporate and Unallocated Expenses.\nGain on asset dispositions and other, net of impairments. For the year ended December 31, 2021, we recognized a gain of $43 million, related to the fair value of equipment that we received as part of an agreement with a communications provider in connection with the C-Band repack process in which we received equipment with a fair value of $58 million, at maximum cost to us of $15 million.\nIncome from equity method investments. For the year ended December 31, 2021 we recognized income from equity method investments of $49 million, which is primarily related to our minority ownership interest in the YES Network. The increase in the amount of income recognized when compared to the year ended December 31, 2020 was primarily due to an increase in the number of games played compared to the same period in the prior year.\nOTHER\nThe following table sets forth our revenues and expenses for our owned networks and content, non-broadcast digital and internet solutions, technical services, and non-media investments (collectively, other) for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019 (in millions):\nTable 29: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Percent Change\nIncrease / (Decrease) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>\u201821 vs.\u201820 </td> <td> </td> <td>\u201820 vs.\u201819 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenue: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Distribution revenue </td> <td>$ </td> <td>193 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>199 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>130 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(3)% </td> <td> </td> <td>53% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Advertising revenue </td> <td>217 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>131 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>110 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>66% </td> <td> </td> <td>19% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other media revenues </td> <td>13 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>86% </td> <td> </td> <td>(46)% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Media revenues (a) </td> <td>$ </td> <td>423 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>337 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>253 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>26% </td> <td> </td> <td>33% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-media revenues (b) </td> <td>$ </td> <td>58 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>114 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>217 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(49)% </td> <td> </td> <td>(47)% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating Expenses: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Media expenses (c) </td> <td>$ </td> <td>325 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>254 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>257 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>28% </td> <td> </td> <td>(1)% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-media expenses (d) </td> <td>$ </td> <td>60 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>98 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>168 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(39)% </td> <td> </td> <td>(42)% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of program contract costs </td> <td>$ </td> <td>17 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>467% </td> <td> </td> <td>n/m </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Corporate general and administrative expenses </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>-% </td> <td> </td> <td>-% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Gain) loss on asset dispositions and other, net of impairments </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(4) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(4) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>n/m </td> <td> </td> <td>n/m </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income </td> <td>$ </td> <td>51 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>65 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>26 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(22)% </td> <td> </td> <td>150% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss from equity method investments </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(4) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(42) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(53) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(90)% </td> <td> </td> <td>(21)% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 30: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nn/m -

Media revenue increased $86 million during 2021, when compared to the same period in 2020, primarily due to an increase in advertising revenue related to our owned networks and digital initiatives. Non-media revenue decreased $56 million during 2021, when compared to the same period in 2020, primarily due to a decrease in broadcast equipment sales due to the winding down of the FCC's National Broadband Plan repack process and the sale of Triangle in the second quarter of 2021.\nExpenses. Media expenses increased $71 million during 2021,when compared to the same period in 2020, primarily related to expenses associated with the increased sales within our owned networks and our digital initiatives, as well as increased content costs. Non-media expenses decreased $38 million during 2021, when compared to the same period in 2020, primarily due to a decrease in the costs of goods associated with our lower broadcast equipment sales and the sale of Triangle in the second quarter of 2021.\nAmortization of program contract costs. The amortization of program contract costs increased $14 million during 2021,when compared to the same period in 2020, primarily related to increases in costs of the programming content related to our owned networks.\nCorporate general and administrative expenses. See explanation under Corporate and Unallocated Expenses.\nGain on asset dispositions and other, net of impairments. During the year ended December 31, 2021, we sold our controlling interest in Triangle for $12 million.

Corporate general and administrative expenses increased in total by $22 million during 2021, when compared to the same period in 2020, primarily due to $16 million in employee compensation cost, a portion of which is related to severance and other termination benefits related to the reduction-in-force completed in the first quarter of 2021, and a $6 million increase to technology costs primarily related to the cyber security ransomware attack in the fourth quarter of 2021.\nWe expect corporate general and administrative expenses to decrease in 2022 when compared to 2021.\nInterest expense. The table above and explanations that follows cover total consolidated interest expense. Interest expense decreased by $38 million during 2021 compared to 2020. The decrease is primarily due to a $24 million decrease in DSG interest expense and a $12 million decrease in STG interest expense, each related to decreases in LIBOR and refinancing of STG existing indebtedness that occurred in 2021.\nWe expect interest expense to increase in 2022 when compared to 2021.\nOther income, net. Other income, net decreased by $339 million during 2021, when compared to the same period in 2020, primarily due to a measurement adjustment gain related to certain variable payment obligations of $159 million and an increase in the value of investments recorded at fair value of $158 million, both recorded in 2020. See Note 13. Commitments and Contingencies and Note 6. Other Assets within the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.\nIncome tax benefit. The 2021 income tax benefit for our pre-tax loss of $499 million resulted in an effective tax rate of 34.7%. The 2020 income tax benefit for our pre-tax loss of $3,149 million resulted in an effective tax rate of 22.9%. The increase in the effective tax rate from 2020 to 2021 is primarily due to the greater benefit impact in 2021 from federal tax credits related to investments in sustainability initiatives.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had a net deferred tax asset of $293 million as compared to a net deferred tax asset of $197 million as of December 31, 2020. The increase in net deferred tax asset primarily relates to the 2021 changes in fair value of certain equity securities and items related to fixed assets.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had $15 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits, all of which, if recognized, would favorably affect our effective tax rate. We recognized $1 million of income tax expense for interest related to uncertain tax positions for the year ended December 31, 2021. See Note 12. Income Taxes within the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.\nNet income attributable to the redeemable noncontrolling interests. For the year ended December 31, 2021, net income attributable to the redeemable noncontrolling interests decreased $38 million, when compared to the same period in 2020, primarily due to a lower average preferred equity balance outstanding in 2021 compared to 2020, as a result of redemptions that occurred in 2020.\nNet (income) loss attributable to the noncontrolling interests. For the year ended December 31, 2021, net income attributable to the noncontrolling interests increased $141 million, when compared to the same period in 2020, primarily as a result of the portion of the non-cash impairment charge on customer relationships, other definite-lived intangible assets and goodwill recorded in 2020 that was attributable to the noncontrolling interests.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had net working capital of approximately $1,269 million, including $816 million in cash and cash equivalent balances. Cash on hand, cash generated by our operations, and borrowing capacity under the Bank Credit Agreements are used as our primary sources of liquidity.\nThe Bank Credit Agreements each include a financial maintenance covenant, the first lien leverage ratio (as defined in the respective Bank Credit Agreements), which requires such applicable ratio not to exceed 4.5x and 6.25x, measured as of the end of each fiscal quarter, for STG and DSG, respectively. The respective financial maintenance covenant is only applicable if 35% or more of the capacity (as a percentage of total commitments) under the respective Revolving Credit Facility, measured as of the last day of each quarter, is utilized under such Revolving Credit Facility as of such date. Since there was no utilization under either of the Revolving Credit Facilities as of December 31, 2021, neither STG nor DSG was subject to the respective financial maintenance covenant under their applicable Bank Credit Agreement. As of December 31, 2021, the STG first lien leverage ratio was below 4.5x and the DSG first lien leverage ratio exceeded 6.25x. We expect that DSG's first lien leverage ratio will remain above 6.25x for at least the next 12 months, which will restrict our ability to fully utilize the DSG Revolving Credit Facility. We do not currently expect to have more than the 35% of the capacity of the DSG Revolving Credit Facility outstanding as of any quarterly measurement date during the next 12 months, therefore we do not expect DSG will be subject to the financial maintenance covenant. The Bank Credit Agreements contain other restrictions and covenants which the respective entities were in compliance with as of December 31, 2021 and expect to be over the next 12 months. See Note 20. Subsequent Events within the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nOn April 1, 2021, STG amended the STG Bank Credit Agreement to raise the STG Term Loan B-3 in an aggregate principal amount of $740 million, the proceeds of which were used to refinance a portion of STG's term loan maturing in January 2024. The STG Term Loan B-3 matures in April 2028 and bears interest at LIBOR (or successor rate) plus 3.00%.\nThe A/R Facility enables DSG to raise incremental funding for the ongoing business needs of the local sports segment. Prior to November 5, 2021, the maximum funding availability under the A/R Facility was the lesser of $250 million and the sum of the lowest aggregate loan balance since November 1, 2020 plus $50 million. On November 5, 2021, the Company purchased and assumed the lenders' and the administrative agent's rights and obligations under the A/R Facility by making a payment to the lenders equal to approximately $184.4 million, representing 101% of the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the loans under the A/R Facility, plus any accrued interest and outstanding fees and expenses. In connection therewith, the Company and Diamond Sports Finance SPV, LLC (DSPV) entered into an omnibus amendment to the A/R Facility to provide greater flexibility to DSG, including (i) increasing the maximum facility limit availability from up to $250 million to up to $400 million; (ii) eliminating the early amortization event related to DSG's earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA), as defined in the agreement governing the A/R Facility, less interest expense covenant; (iii) extending the stated maturity date by one year from September 23, 2023 to September 23, 2024; and (iv) relaxing certain concentration limits thereby increasing the amounts of certain accounts receivable eligible to be sold. The other material terms of the A/R Facility remain unchanged. Transactions related to the A/R Facility are now intercompany transactions and, therefore, are eliminated in consolidation.\nFor the year ending December 31, 2022, we expect capital expenditures to be within the range of $131 million to $141 million, primarily related to technical, maintenance, and building projects at our stations and RSNs.\nWe have various contractual obligations which are recorded as liabilities in our consolidated financial statements, such as notes payable, finance leases, and commercial bank financing; operating leases; active television program contracts; and fixed and variable payment obligations. Certain other contractual obligations have not been recognized as liabilities in our consolidated financial statements, such as certain sports programming rights, future television program contracts, and network programming rights. Active television program contracts are included in the balance sheet as an asset and liability while future television program contracts are excluded until the cost is known, the program is available for its first showing or telecast, and the licensee has accepted the program. Industry protocol typically enables us to make payments for television program contracts on a three-month lag, which differs from the contractual timing. As of December 31, 2021, our significant contractual obligations include:\n\u2022Total debt, defined as current and long-term notes payable, finance leases, and commercial bank financing, including finance leases of affiliates, of $12,340 million, including current debt, due within the next 12 months, of $69 million.\n\u2022Interest due on our total debt in the next twelve months of $554 million, including interest estimated on our variable rate debt calculated at an effective weighted average interest rate of 3.08% as of December 31, 2021.\n\u2022Contractual amounts owed through the expiration date of the underlying agreement for sports programming rights, active and future television program contracts, and network programming rights of $16,210 million, including $2,816 million due within the next 12 months. Network programming agreements may include variable fee components such as subscriber levels, which in certain circumstances have been estimated and reflected in the previous amounts based on current subscriber amounts.\nSee Note 7. Notes Payable and Commercial Bank Financing, Note 8. Leases, Note 9. Program Contracts, and Note 13. Commitments and Contingencies within the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.\nWe anticipate that existing cash and cash equivalents, cash flow from our operations, and borrowing capacity under the Bank Credit Agreements will be sufficient to satisfy our debt service obligations, capital expenditure requirements, and working capital needs for the next 12 months. However, certain factors, including but not limited to, the severity and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic and resulting effect on the economy, our advertisers, Distributors, and their subscribers, could affect our liquidity and our first lien leverage ratio which could affect our ability to access the full borrowing capacity under the Bank Credit Agreements. For our long-term liquidity needs, in addition to the sources described above, we may rely upon various sources, such as but not limited to, the issuance of long-term debt, the issuance of equity or other instruments convertible into or exchangeable for equity, or the sale of Company assets. However, there can be no assurance that additional financing or capital or buyers of our Company assets will be available, or that the terms of any transactions will be acceptable or advantageous to us.\nDSG's ability to make scheduled payments on its debt obligations depends on its financial condition and operating performance, which are subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial, business, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors beyond its control. The impact of the outbreak of COVID-19 continues to create significant uncertainty and disruption in the global economy and financial markets. Further, DSG's success is dependent upon, among other things, the terms of its agreements with Distributors, OTT and other streaming providers and the successful execution of its DTC strategy. Primarily as a result of losses of Distributors, increased subscriber churn and the COVID-19 pandemic, DSG has experienced operating losses since the second quarter of 2020 and we expect it will continue to incur operating losses in future periods. DSG has taken steps to mitigate the impacts of this uncertainty, including managing its controllable costs, amending its A/R Facility and entering into a Transaction Support Agreement with Sinclair and certain lenders holding term loans under the DSG Bank Credit Agreement and certain holders of, or investment advisors, sub-advisors, or managers of funds or accounts that hold, the existing DSG Notes which contemplates that, among other things, DSG would obtain the New DSG First Lien Term Loan which would mature in May 2026 and would rank first in lien priority on shared collateral ahead of DSG's loans and/or commitments under the DSG Bank Credit Agreement and the Existing DSG 5.375% Notes.

ended December 31, 2021, when compared to the same period in 2020. The decrease is primarily related to higher payments for production and overhead costs, Distributor rebate payments, and payments for sports rights, partially offset by an increase in cash collections from Distributors.\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash flows used in investing activities increased during the year ended December 31, 2021, when compared to the same period in 2020. The increase is primarily related to lower spectrum repack reimbursements and higher purchases of investments, offset by lower capital expenditures, the sale of WDKA and KBSI during the first quarter of 2021 and the sale of Triangle during the second quarter of 2021.\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash flows used in financing activities decreased during the year ended December 31, 2021, when compared to the same period in 2020. The decrease is primarily related to lower repurchases of Class A Common Stock during 2021 as compared to 2020, as well as the redemption of the Redeemable Subsidiary Preferred Equity and distributions to the redeemable noncontrolling interests during 2020.", "summary": "- We are a diversified media company with national reach and a strong focus on providing high-quality content on our

These amounts exceed the limits under our insurance policies and thus, based on the known effects of the cyber incident, the Company estimates that the cyber incident has resulted in approximately $24 million of unrecoverable net loss through the date of filing this Form 10-K.\n\u2022In October 2021, we partnered with the Disabled American Veterans for the \"Sinclair Cares: Supporting American Veterans\" campaign, encouraging our employees and viewers to volunteer or donate to help support veterans in their communities.\n\u2022In December 2021, we partnered with the American Red Cross for the Sinclair Cares: Tornado Relief\u201d campaign, raising $175,000 in total from viewers and Sinclair corporate donations to assist those affected by the devastating tornadoes in the South and Midwest.\n\u2022In December 2021, our television stations and RSNs collected 140,000 toys, tens of thousands pounds of food and several truckloads of clothing, sleeping bags, blankets and monetary donations for local charities through regional holiday drives. Regional recipients across the country include local community food banks, Toys for Tots, The Salvation Army, Bikes for Kids, The Forgotten Child Fund, Neediest Kids, Habitat for Humanity, The United Way and Central Arizona Shelter Services, among others.\n\u2022In January 2022, we began taking applications for our 2022 Diversity Scholarship, which has awarded more than $100,000 in scholarships over the last six years.\n\u2022In February 2022, we announced the promotion of Rob Weisbord to Chief Operating Officer and President of Broadcast.\nIndustry Trends\n\u2022During the last few years, the number of subscribers to Distributor services in the United States has generally been declining, as technological advancements have driven changes in consumer behavior and have empowered consumers to seek more control over when, where and how they consume news, sports and other entertainment, including through the so-called cutting the cord\u201d and other consumption strategies.\n\u2022The Distributor industry has continued to undergo significant consolidation, which gives top Distributors purchase power.\n\u2022Distributors have introduced, marketed and/or modified tiers or bundles of programming that have impacted the number of subscribers that receive our RSNs, including tiers or bundles of programming that exclude our RSNs. We expect these trends to continue for the foreseeable future. We believe the emergence of DTC and OTT offerings will provide us the opportunity to compete with these products and services offered by Distributors\n\u2022The vMVPDs have continued to gain increasing importance and have quickly become a critical segment of the market. These vMVPDs offer a limited number of networks at a lower price point as compared to the traditional cable offering.\n\u2022Political spending is significantly higher in the even-numbered years due to the cyclicality of political elections. In addition, every four years, political spending is typically elevated further due to the advertising related to the presidential election. 2020 proved to be a record year in political advertising.\n\u2022The FCC has permitted broadcast television stations to use their digital spectrum for a wide variety of services including multi-channel broadcasts. The FCC must-carry\u201d rules only apply to a station's primary digital stream.\n\u2022Seasonal advertising increases within our broadcast segment occur in the second and fourth quarters due to the anticipation of certain seasonal and holiday spending by consumers.\n\u2022Seasonal advertising increases within our local sports segment occur in the second and third quarters due to a higher volume of sports games being played during this time, particularly the MLB season.\n\u2022Broadcasters have found ways to increase returns on their news programming initiatives while continuing to maintain locally produced content through the use of news sharing arrangements.\n\u2022Broadcasters have begun to expand their own DTC platforms.\n\u2022Advertising revenue related to the Summer Olympics occurs in even numbered years, with the exception of 2020 which was postponed due to COVID-19 and took place in Summer 2021, and the Super Bowl is aired on a different network each year. Both of these popularly viewed events can have an impact on our advertising revenues.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nThis discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates including those related to revenue recognition, goodwill and intangible assets, program contract costs, sports programming rights, income taxes and variable interest entities. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. These estimates have been consistently applied for all years presented in this report and in the past we have not experienced material differences between these estimates and actual results. However, because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty, actual results could differ from our estimates and such differences could be material.\nWe consider the following accounting policies to be the most critical as they are important to our financial condition and results of operations, and require significant judgment and estimates on the part of management in their application. For a detailed discussion of the application of these and other accounting policies, see Note 1. Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies within the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic continues to create significant uncertainty and disruption in the global economy and financial markets. It is reasonably possible that these uncertainties continue to impact our estimates related to, but not limited to, revenue recognition, goodwill and intangible assets, sports programming rights, and income taxes. As a result, many of our estimates and assumptions require increased judgment and carry a higher degree of variability and volatility. See Distribution Revenue in Revenue Recognition, Sports Programming Rights, and Impairment of Goodwill, Intangibles, and Other Assets under Note 1. Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies within the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on how COVID-19 has impacted distribution revenue, sports rights expense, and the value of goodwill and definite-lived intangible assets, respectively. Our estimates may further change in the future as the COVID-19 pandemic continues, new events occur, and additional information emerges, and such changes are recognized or disclosed in the consolidated financial statements.\nRevenue Recognition. As discussed in Revenue Recognition under Note 1. Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies within the Consolidated Financial Statements, we generate advertising revenue primarily from the sale of advertising spots/impressions on our broadcast television, RSNs, and digital platforms. Advertising revenue is recognized in the period in which the advertising spots/impressions are delivered. In arrangements where we provide audience ratings guarantees; to the extent that there is a ratings shortfall, we will defer a proportionate amount of revenue until the ratings shortfall is settled through the delivery of additional advertising. The term of our advertising arrangements is generally less than one year and the timing between when an advertisement is aired and when payment is realized is not significant. In certain circumstances, we require customers to pay in advance; payments received in advance of satisfying our performance obligations are reflected as deferred revenue.\nWe generate distribution revenue through fees received from Distributors and other OTT providers for the right to distribute our broadcast channels and cable networks on their distribution platforms. Distribution arrangements are generally governed by multi-year contracts and the underlying fees are based upon a contractual monthly rate per subscriber. These arrangements represent licenses of intellectual property; revenue is recognized as the signal is provided to our customers (as usage occurs) which corresponds with the satisfaction of our performance obligation. Revenue is calculated based upon the contractual rate multiplied by an estimated number of subscribers. Our customers will remit payments based upon actual subscribers a short time after the conclusion of a month, which generally does not exceed 120 days. Historical adjustments to subscriber estimates have not been material.\nCertain of our distribution arrangements contain provisions that require the Company to deliver a minimum number of live professional sports games or tournaments during a defined period which usually corresponds with a calendar year. If the minimum threshold is not met, we may be obligated to refund a portion of the distribution fees received if shortfalls are not cured within a specified period of time. If we are unable to meet these minimum requirements, we reduce revenue based upon estimated rebates due to our distribution customers over the measurement period of the rebate. See Revenue Recognition within Note 1. Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.\nImpairment of Goodwill, Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets, and Other Long-Lived Assets. We evaluate our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually, or more frequently, if events or changes in circumstances indicate an impairment may exist. As of December 31, 2021, our consolidated balance sheet includes $2,088 million and $150 million of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, respectively. We evaluate long-lived assets, including definite-lived intangible assets, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of our asset groups may not be recoverable.\nIn the performance of our annual goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment assessments we have the option to qualitatively assess whether it is more likely-than-not that the respective asset has been impaired. If we conclude that it is more-likely-than-not that a reporting unit or an indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired, we apply the quantitative assessment, which involves comparing the estimated fair value of the reporting unit or indefinite-lived intangible asset to its respective carrying value. See Impairment of Goodwill, Intangibles and Other Assets under Note 1. Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 5. Goodwill, Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets, and Other Intangible Assets within the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the significant judgments and estimates inherent in both qualitatively assessing whether impairment may exist and estimating the fair values of the reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets if a quantitative assessment is deemed necessary.\nWe are required to analyze our long-lived assets, including definite-lived intangible assets, for impairment. We evaluate our definite-lived intangible assets for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. In the event we identify indicators that these assets are not recoverable, we evaluate the recoverability of definite-lived intangible assets by comparing the carrying amount of the assets within an asset group to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows associated with the asset group. An asset group represents the lowest level of cash flows generated by a group of assets that are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets. At the time that such evaluations indicate that the future undiscounted cash flows are not sufficient to recover the carrying value of the asset group, an impairment loss is determined by comparing the estimated fair value of the asset group to the carrying value. We estimate fair value using an income approach involving the performance of a discounted cash flow analysis.\nOur RSNs included in the local sports segment were negatively impacted by the loss of three Distributors in 2020. In addition, our existing Distributors experienced elevated levels of subscriber erosion which we believe was influenced, in part, by shifting consumer behaviors resulting from media fragmentation, the current economic environment, the COVID 19 pandemic and related uncertainties. Most of these factors are also expected to have a negative impact on future projected revenue and margins of our RSNs. As a result of these factors, we performed an impairment test of the RSN reporting units' goodwill and long-lived asset groups during the third quarter of 2020 which resulted in a non-cash impairment charge on goodwill of $2,615 million, customer relationships of $1,218 million, and other definite-lived intangible assets of $431 million, included within impairment of goodwill and definite-lived intangible assets in our consolidated statements of operations within the Consolidated Financial Statements. See Note 5. Goodwill, Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets, and Other Intangible Assets within the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. During the year ended December 31, 2021, we did not identify any indicators that our definite-lived intangible assets may not be recoverable. For our annual goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles impairment tests related to our broadcast and other reporting units in 2021, 2020, and 2019, we concluded that it was more-likely-than-not that goodwill was not impaired based on our qualitative assessments. For one reporting unit in 2019, we elected to perform a quantitative assessment and concluded that its fair value significantly exceeded the carrying value.\nWe believe we have made reasonable estimates and utilized appropriate assumptions in the performance of our impairment assessments. If future results are not consistent with our assumptions and estimates, including future events such as a deterioration of market conditions, loss of significant customers, failure to execute on DSG's DTC strategy, and significant increases in discount rates, among other factors, we could be exposed to impairment charges in the future. Any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated balance sheets, consolidated statements of operations and consolidated statements of cash flows.\nProgram Contract Costs. As discussed in Broadcast Television Programming under Note 1. Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies within the Consolidated Financial Statements, we record an asset and corresponding liability for programming rights when the program is available for its first showing or telecast. These costs are expensed over the period in which an economic benefit is expected to be derived. To ensure the related assets for the programming rights are reflected in our consolidated balance sheets at the lower of unamortized cost or fair value, management estimates future advertising revenue to be generated by the remaining program material available under the contract terms. Management's judgment is required in determining the timing of expense for these costs, which is dependent on the economic benefit expected to be generated from the program and may significantly differ from the timing of related payments under the contractual obligation. If our estimates of future advertising revenues decline, amortization expense could be accelerated or fair value adjustments may be required.\nSports Programming Rights. As discussed in Sports Programming Rights under Note 1. Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies within the Consolidated Financial Statements, we have multi-year program rights agreements that provide us with the right to produce and telecast professional sports games within a specified territory in exchange for an annual rights fee. A prepaid asset is recorded for rights acquired related to future games upon payment of the contracted fee. The assets recorded for the acquired rights are classified as current or non-current based on the period when the games are expected to be aired. Liabilities are recorded for any program rights obligations that have been incurred but not yet paid at period end. We amortize these programming rights as an expense over each season based upon contractually stated rates. Amortization is accelerated in the event that the stated contractual rates over the term of the rights agreement results in an expense recognition pattern that is inconsistent with the projected growth of revenue over the contractual term.\nFair Value Measurements of Investments in Bally's Securities. As discussed in Note 6. Other Assets and Note 18. Fair Value Measurements within the Consolidated Financial Statements, we entered into a commercial agreement with Bally's Corporation on November 18, 2020. As part of this arrangement, the Company received warrants and options to acquire common equity in the business. These financial instruments are measured each period at fair value. The fair value of the options are derived utilizing a Black Scholes valuation model which utilizes a number of inputs which most significantly includes the trading price of the underlying common stock, the exercise price of the options and a discount for lack of marketability. The fair value of the warrants are primarily derived from the trading price of the underlying common stock, the exercise price of the warrants and a discount for lack of marketability. The determination of the fair value of these financial instruments requires the Company to exercise judgment.\nIncome Tax. As discussed in Income Taxes under Note 1. Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies within the Consolidated Financial Statements, we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities. We provide a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets if we determine that it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. In evaluating our ability to realize net deferred tax assets, we consider all available evidence, both positive and negative, including our past operating results, tax planning strategies, current and cumulative losses, and forecasts of future taxable income. In considering these sources of taxable income, we must make certain judgments that are based on the plans and estimates used to manage our underlying businesses on a long-term basis. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, a valuation allowance has been provided for deferred tax assets related to certain temporary basis differences, interest expense carryforwards under the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) Section 163(j) and a substantial amount of our available state net operating loss carryforwards based on past operating results, including the RSN impairment, expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary basis differences, alternative tax strategies and projected future taxable income. Future changes in operating and/or taxable income or other changes in facts and circumstances could significantly impact the ability to realize our deferred tax assets which could have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.\nManagement periodically performs a comprehensive review of our tax positions, and we record a liability for unrecognized tax benefits if such tax positions are more likely than not to be sustained upon examination based on their technical merits, including the resolution of any appeals or litigation processes. Significant judgment is required in determining whether positions taken are more likely than not to be sustained, and it is based on a variety of facts and circumstances, including interpretation of the relevant federal and state income tax codes, regulations, case law and other authoritative pronouncements. Based on this analysis, the status of ongoing audits and the expiration of applicable statute of limitations, liabilities are adjusted as necessary. The resolution of audits is unpredictable and could result in tax liabilities that are significantly higher or lower than for what we have provided. See Note 12. Income Taxes within the Consolidated Financial Statements, for further discussion of accrued unrecognized tax benefits.\nVariable Interest Entities (VIEs). As discussed in Note 14. Variable Interest Entities within the Consolidated Financial Statements, we have determined that certain third-party licensees of stations for which we perform services pursuant to arrangements, including LMAs, JSAs, and SSAs, are VIEs and we are the primary beneficiary of those variable interests because, subject to the ultimate control of the licensees, we have the power to direct the activities which significantly impact the economic performance of the VIE through the services we provide and because we absorb losses and returns that would be considered significant to the VIEs. We have determined that certain RSN joint ventures are VIEs. We are the primary beneficiary of those RSN joint ventures because we have the power to direct the activities which significantly impact the economic performance of certain regional sports networks, including sales and certain operational services and because we absorb losses and returns that would be considered significant to the VIEs.\nTransactions with Related Parties. We have determined that we conduct certain business-related transactions with related persons or entities. See Note 15. Related Person Transactions within the Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion of these transactions.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Recent Accounting Pronouncements under Note 1. Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies within the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of recent accounting policies and their impact on our financial statements.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nAny references to the first, second, third or fourth quarters are to the three months ended March 31, June 30, September 30, or December 31, respectively, for the year being discussed. We have two reportable segments, broadcast and local sports, that are disclosed separately from our other and corporate activities.\nSeasonality / Cyclicality\nThe operating results of our broadcast segment are usually subject to cyclical fluctuations from political advertising. In even numbered years, political spending is usually significantly higher than in odd numbered years due to advertising expenditures preceding local and national elections. Additionally, every four years, political spending is usually elevated further due to advertising expenditures preceding the presidential election (as was the case in 2020). Also, the second and fourth quarter operating results are usually higher than the first and third quarter operating results because advertising expenditures are increased in anticipation of certain seasonal and holiday spending by consumers.\nThe operating results of our local sports segment are usually subject to cyclical fluctuations based on the timing and overlap of the MLB, NBA, and NHL seasons. Usually, the second and third quarter operating results are higher than the first and fourth quarter operating results.\nConsolidated Operating Data\nThe following table sets forth certain of our consolidated operating data for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019 (in millions).\n\n \n(a)Media revenues include distribution revenue, advertising revenue, and other media related revenues.\n(b)Depreciation and amortization includes depreciation and amortization of property and equipment and amortization of definite-lived intangible assets and other assets.\nThe Impact of COVID-19 on our Results of Operations\nOverview\nOn March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic, and by the end of the following day, each of the MLB, NBA, and NHL had suspended their seasons. On March 13, 2020, the United States declared a national state of emergency. As of December 31, 2021, the national state of emergency is still in effect, however substantially all states have reopened their economies, COVID-19 vaccinations are being distributed in mass quantities and all professional sports leagues are currently playing live games. However, with new variants of COVID-19 being detected across multiple countries, including the United States, there is still a heightened level of uncertainty of what the overall impact of COVID-19 will be on our business.\nBroadcast segment\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, as compared to the prior year, we experienced a decrease in advertising revenue primarily due to a decrease in political revenue as 2021 was a non-political year. See Revenues under the Broadcast Segment section below for further discussion.\nLocal sports segment\nIn March 2020, the NBA and NHL each postponed their 2019-2020 season and the MLB postponed the start of its 2020 season, however all leagues' returned to operation under reduced game counts and were able to complete these modified seasons during the early part of the fourth quarter of 2020. The NBA and NHL began their modified 2020-2021 seasons during the fourth quarter of 2020 and the first quarter of 2021, respectively, and the MLB began its 2021 season on April 1, 2021. Advertising revenue increased in the year ended December 31, 2021, as compared to the prior year, largely driven by an increased number of games played in 2021 when compared to 2020. Distribution revenue increased in the year ended December 31, 2021, as compared to 2020, primarily related to 2020 revenue being reduced due to the accrual of rebates to our Distributors resulting from the cancellation of professional sports games due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The MLB began their season on time in April 2021 and completed their full game schedule and the NBA and NHL began their 2021-2022 seasons in October 2021 under full game schedules. However, in light of the fourth quarter 2021 spike in COVID-19 cases, both the NHL and NBA have had to postpone and reschedule some of their games during their 2021-22 seasons. Of the total 11 NBA games postponed in the fourth quarter of 2021, 2 of which related to the RSNs, have been rescheduled for the first quarter 2022. Of the total 104 NHL games postponed during the 2021-22 season, 38 of which related to the RSNs, the majority were shifted from the fourth quarter 2021 to the first quarter 2022. The shift in these games to 2022 resulted in an increase in the estimated rebates to our Distributors of $8 million during the fourth quarter of 2021. Both leagues currently expect to finish their regular seasons on schedule, although there can be no assurance that the NBA or NHL will complete full seasons in the future. On December 2, 2021, MLB owners locked out players following the expiration of its prior collective bargaining agreement with its players. While negotiations towards a new collective bargaining agreement have commenced, there can be no assurance that an agreement will be reached prior to the commencement of the 2022 MLB season or at all, therefore there can be no assurance that the MLB will complete a full season in 2022 or in future years. Any reduction in the actual number of games played by the leagues may have an adverse impact on our operations and the cash flows of our local sports segment. See Distribution Revenue in Revenue Recognition and Sports Programming Rights under Note 1. Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies within the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on how COVID-19 has impacted distribution revenue and sports rights expense, respectively, including the need for us to provide rebates to our Distributors as well as seek rebate from or reduce future payments to certain of the sports teams.\nBusiness continuity\nWithin the United States, our business has been designated an essential business, which allows us to continue to serve our customers, however, the COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted our operations. Certain of our facilities have experienced temporary disruptions as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, and we cannot predict whether our facilities will experience more significant disruptions in the future and how long these disruptions will last. The COVID-19 pandemic has heightened the risk that a significant portion of our workforce will suffer illness or otherwise be unable to work. Furthermore, reductions in our workforce may become necessary as a result of declines in our business caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. If we take such actions, we cannot assure that we will be able to rehire our workforce once our business has recovered.\nA discussion regarding our financial results and operations for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020 is presented below. A discussion of the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 can be found under Item 7 of Part II of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020, filed with the SEC on March 1, 2021 (our \"2020 Annual Report\"), which is available free of charge on the SEC's website at www.sec.gov and our Investor Relations website at www.sbgi.net/investor-relations.\nBROADCAST SEGMENT\nThe following table sets forth our revenue and expenses for our broadcast segment, previously referred to as our local news and marketing services segment, for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019 (in millions):\n\n \n(a)Includes $111 million, $100 million, and $35 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, of intercompany revenue related to certain services provided to the local sports segment and other under management services agreements, which is eliminated in consolidation.\nRevenues\nDistribution revenue. Distribution revenue, which includes payments from Distributors for our broadcast signals, increased $61 million in 2021, when compared to the same period in 2020, primarily due to an increase in rates, partially offset by a decrease in subscribers.\nAdvertising revenue. Advertising revenue decreased $258 million in 2021, when compared to the same period in 2020, primarily due to a decrease in political advertising revenue of $329 million, as 2020 was a political and presidential election year, and due to the effects of the cybersecurity incident that occurred during the fourth quarter of 2021, which we currently estimate resulted in a decrease in revenue of approximately $63 million. The decrease is partially offset by increases in various non-political advertising categories due to improved macroeconomic conditions, as the economy began to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic in 2021.\nFor the year ending December 31, 2022 we expect an increase in advertising revenue, when compared to 2021, primarily related to an increase in political revenue, as 2022 is a political election year.\nThe following table sets forth our affiliate percentages of advertising revenue for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019:\n\n \n(a)We broadcast other programming from the following providers on our channels including: Antenna TV, Azteca, Bounce, CHARGE!, Comet, Dabl, Decades, Estrella TV, GetTV, Grit, MeTV, Rewind, Stadium, TBD, Telemundo, This TV, UniMas, Univision, and Weather.\nOther Media Revenue. Other media revenue increased $32 million in 2021, when compared to the same period in 2020. The increase is primarily due to an $11 million increase in intercompany revenue from the local sports and other segments related to providing certain services under a management services agreement, which are eliminated in our consolidated results.\nExpenses\nMedia programming and production expenses. Media programming and production expenses increased $87 million during 2021, when compared to the same period in 2020, primarily related to an increase in fees pursuant to network affiliation agreements of $99 million, partially offset by a $19 million decrease in employee compensation costs.\nMedia selling, general and administrative expenses.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nForward Looking Statements\nWe make statements in this section that are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. For a complete discussion of forward-looking statements, see the section in this report entitled Forward-Looking Statements.\u201d Certain risks may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially from those expressed or implied by the following discussion. For a discussion of such risk factors, see Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nOverview\nThe following Management's Discussion and Analysis provides qualitative and quantitative information about our financial performance and condition and should be read in conjunction with the other sections in this annual report, including Item 1. Business and the Consolidated Financial Statements, including the accompanying notes to those statements. This discussion consists of the following sections:\nExecutive Overview - a description of our business, summary of significant events and financial highlights from 2021 and so far in 2022, and information about industry trends;\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates - a discussion of the accounting policies that are most important in understanding the assumptions and judgments incorporated in the consolidated financial statements and a summary of recent accounting pronouncements;\nResults of Operations - a summary of the components of our revenues by category and by network affiliation and a summary of other operating data and an analysis of our revenues and expenses for 2021, 2020, and 2019, including a comparison between 2021 and 2020 and certain expectations for 2022; and\nLiquidity and Capital Resources - a discussion of our primary sources of liquidity and contractual cash obligations and an analysis of our cash flows from or used in operating activities, investing activities and financing activities.\nEXECUTIVE OVERVIEW\nWe are a diversified media company with national reach and a strong focus on providing high-quality content on our local television stations, regional and national sports networks, and digital platforms. The content, distributed through our broadcast platform and third-party platforms, consists of programming provided by third-party networks and syndicators, local news, college and professional sports, and other original programming produced by us. Additionally, we own digital media products that are complementary to our extensive portfolio of television station and regional sports network related digital properties. Outside of our media related businesses, we operate technical services companies focused on supply and maintenance of broadcast transmission systems as well as research and development for the advancement of broadcast technology, and we manage other non-media related investments.\nWe have two reportable segments: broadcast and local sports. Our broadcast segment is comprised of our television stations. Our local sports segment is comprised of our RSNs and the YES Network. We also earn revenues from our owned networks, original content, digital and internet services, technical services, and non-media investments. These businesses are included within other. Corporate and unallocated expenses primarily include our costs to operate as a public company and to operate our corporate headquarters location. Other and corporate are not reportable segments.\nSTG, for which certain assets and results of operations are included in the broadcast segment and which is one of our wholly owned subsidiaries, is the primary obligor under the STG Bank Credit Agreement, the STG 5.125% unsecured notes due 2027, the STG 5.875% unsecured notes due 2026, the STG 5.500% unsecured notes due 2030, and the STG 4.125% secured notes due 2030 (the STG notes are collectively referred to as the STG Notes). We and substantially all of STG's subsidiaries (and not DSG nor any of its subsidiaries) are guarantors under the STG debt instruments. DSG, for which certain assets and results of operations are included in the local sports segment and which is one of our subsidiaries, is the primary obligor under the DSG Bank Credit Agreement, the DSG 5.375% secured notes due 2026 and the DSG 12.750% secured notes due 2026 (collectively, the DSG Existing Secured Notes), and the DSG 6.625% unsecured notes due 2027 (collectively with the DSG Existing Secured Notes, the DSG Notes). DSG's wholly-owned subsidiaries (and not us, STG, or any of STG's subsidiaries) are guarantors under the DSG debt instruments.

For the year ended December 31, 2021, distribution revenue from the Distributor under this agreement accounted for 28.8% of our local sports segment distribution revenues.\nNEXTGEN TV\n\u2022In April 2021, CAST.ERA, a media technology joint venture between us and SK Telecom, announced it will launch a next generation broadcast solution this year that boosts television content quality utilizing SK Telecom's 5G cloud and AI technology.\n\u2022In January 2022, the NextGen Video Information Systems Alliance (NVISA) published new consumer-facing research, sponsored by our subsidiary, ONE Media 3.0, that offered the first insight into which features American consumers want most in a NextGen Broadcast-enabled emergency information service. These include a desire for geo-targeted alerts, the ability to screen for only selected alerts, options for updated alerts, and importantly, a robust/dependable system that does not crash when the Internet or cell system goes down. All of these features are embedded in the NextGen Broadcast service.\n\u2022In January 2022, MPEG LA, a pioneer in the formation and management of patent pools, completed the formation of the ATSC 3.0 Patent Pool, dramatically simplifying the efficient licensing of the new ATSC 3.0 broadcast technology in multiple-receive devices, easing the distribution and deployment process.

We provide programming, sales, operational, and administrative services to this station pursuant to certain service agreements, such as LMAs.\nFinancing, Capital Allocation, and Shareholder Returns\n\u2022In April 2021, we amended the STG Bank Credit Agreement to raise the STG Term Loan B-3 in an aggregate principal amount of $740 million which matures in April 1, 2028, the proceeds of which were used to refinance a portion of STG's term loan.\n\u2022In November 2021, we purchased and assumed the lenders' and the administrative agent's rights and obligations under the existing A/R Facility of DSG's indirect subsidiary, Diamond Sports Finance SPV, LLC. We purchased the lenders' outstanding loans and commitments under the A/R Facility by making a payment to the lenders as consideration for the purchase of the lenders' respective rights and obligations under the A/R Facility equal to approximately $184.4 million, representing 101% of the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the loans under the A/R Facility, plus any accrued interest and outstanding fees and expenses, amended certain terms of the facility, and extended the maturity to September 2024.\n\u2022In January 2022, we entered into a Transaction Support Agreement with various lenders holding term loans under DSG's existing credit facilities and various holders of DSG's outstanding 5.375% Senior Secured Notes due 2026 (the \"Existing DSG 5.375% Notes\") and 12.750% Senior Secured Notes due 2026 (the \"DSG 12.750% Notes\"), on the principal terms of a new first lien money financing and recapitalization, whereby DSG intends to raise $635 million in new capital pursuant to a first-priority term loan (the \"New DSG First Lien Term Loan\") and to defer the cash payment of a portion of its management fee to STG over the next five years, which together are expected to provide approximately $1 billion of liquidity enhancement over the next five years to DSG and enable DSG to strengthen its balance sheet, fund the launch of its DTC product, and provide for future liquidity. See Note 20. Subsequent Events within the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\u2022In February 2022, pursuant to the Transaction Support Agreement, DSG commenced a private exchange offer of new second-priority lien 5.375% Senior Secured Notes due 2026 (the DSG 5.375% Second Lien Secured Notes\u201d) to eligible holders of its outstanding first-priority lien 5.375% Senior Secured Notes due 2026. At the same time, DSG commenced a private exchange offer of new second-priority lien term loans to its lenders holding existing first-priority lien term loans. The note exchange expires on March 10, 2022, with an early tender deadline of February 28, 2022, while the loan exchange expires on February 28, 2022. The exchanges are conditioned on receiving requisite consent of the noteholders and lenders. The closing of the new $635 million first-priority lien term loan is conditioned on the successful completion of the exchanges and other customary closing conditions. See Note 20. Subsequent Events within the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\u2022For the year ended December 31, 2021, we repurchased approximately 2.4 million shares of Class A Common Stock for $61 million. As of February 23, 2022, we repurchased an additional 2 million shares of Class A Common Stock for $55 million since January 1, 2022. The shares were repurchased under a 10b5-1 plan.\n\u2022For the year ended December 31, 2021, we paid dividends of $0.80 per share. In February 2022, we declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.25 per share, an increase in our quarterly cash dividend of 25%.\nOther Events\n\u2022In January 2021, we announced the hiring of Jeffrey Lewis as our Chief Compliance Officer, a newly-created position to supervise corporate compliance functions, including regulatory, code of conduct, competition, and privacy.\n\u2022 In January 2021, we jointly revealed, with Bally's, the new Bally Sports logo and Bally Sports regional monikers for our owned and operated RSNs.\n\u2022 In March 2021, we announced an enterprise-wide workforce reduction involving the termination of approximately 500 employees and incurred approximately $7 million of restructuring and related charges.\n\u2022 In April 2021, we increased the size of our Board of Directors and named Laurie R. Beyer to serve as its newest independent board member.\n\u2022 In April 2021, we announced that Bally Sports, Tennis Channel, and its High School Sports Division collectively, won nine Cynopsis Sports Media Awards, including \"RSN of the Year.\"\n\u2022In April 2021, we signed a multi-year enterprise partnership agreement with Operative Media to enable us to consolidate all our sellable advertising assets across our platforms into a single ad sales system. The framework enables us to offer our customers a simplified and optimized solution to buying from our extensive ad inventory across all of our platforms.\n\u2022 In May 2021, we announced the retirement of Barry Faber, President of Distribution and Network Relations, effective June 25, 2021.\n\u2022 In June 2021, Fortune Magazine named the Company to the Fortune 500 for the first time, ranking it 465 on the list.\n\u2022 In June 2021, at the Company's Annual Shareholders' Meeting, the Company's shareholders re-elected all ten Directors, ratified the appointment of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2021, approved the amended and restated Employee Stock Purchase Plan, and approved an amendment to the Company's 1996 Long-Term Incentive Plan to increase the number of shares authorized for issuance thereunder.\n\u2022In June 2021, we selected seven winning applicants for our Broadcast Diversity Scholarship, awarding tuition assistance to students demonstrating a promising future in the broadcast industry.\n\u2022 In June and July 2021, we partnered with the American Red Cross for the Sinclair Cares: Roll Up Your Sleeves\u201d campaign, to urge our viewers to help increase U.S. blood supplies by making a blood donation appointment, volunteering time, or providing financial contributions for the cause.\n\u2022 In July 2021, we hired John McClure to the newly created role of Vice President and Chief Information Security Officer.\n\u2022In August 2021, we appointed William Bell as Head of Distribution and Network Relations.\n\u2022In September 2021, our television stations collectively raised nearly $0.7 million for local charities through regional back-to-school fundraising and supply donation initiatives. Our stations also donated over $0.6 million in promotional air time to support these initiatives.\n\u2022On October 17, 2021, we identified the following: (i) certain servers and workstations in our environment were encrypted with ransomware, (ii) disruption of certain office and operational networks as a result of the encryption, and (iii) indications that data was taken from our network. Promptly upon detection of the security event, senior management was notified and we began to implement incident response measures to contain the incident, conduct an investigation, and plan for restoring operations. Legal counsel, a cybersecurity forensic firm, and other incident response professionals were engaged, and law enforcement and other governmental agencies were notified. The investigation into the incident remains ongoing. The cybersecurity incident resulted in the loss in the fourth quarter of 2021 of approximately $63 million of advertising revenue, primarily related to our broadcast segment, as well as approximately $11 million through the date of filing this Form 10-K in costs and expenses related to mitigation efforts, our ongoing investigation and the security improvements resulting therefrom, however we paid no ransom. These amounts exceed the limits under our insurance policies and thus, based on the known effects of the cyber incident, the Company estimates that the cyber incident has resulted in approximately $24 million of unrecoverable net loss through the date of filing this Form 10-K.\n\u2022In October 2021, we partnered with the Disabled American Veterans for the \"Sinclair Cares: Supporting American Veterans\" campaign, encouraging our employees and viewers to volunteer or donate to help support veterans in their communities.\n\u2022In December 2021, we partnered with the American Red Cross for the Sinclair Cares: Tornado Relief\u201d campaign, raising $175,000 in total from viewers and Sinclair corporate donations to assist those affected by the devastating tornadoes in the South and Midwest.\n\u2022In December 2021, our television stations and RSNs collected 140,000 toys, tens of thousands pounds of food and several truckloads of clothing, sleeping bags, blankets and monetary donations for local charities through regional holiday drives. Regional recipients across the country include local community food banks, Toys for Tots, The Salvation Army, Bikes for Kids, The Forgotten Child Fund, Neediest Kids, Habitat for Humanity, The United Way and Central Arizona Shelter Services, among others.\n\u2022In January 2022, we began taking applications for our 2022 Diversity Scholarship, which has awarded more than $100,000 in scholarships over the last six years.\n\u2022In February 2022, we announced the promotion of Rob Weisbord to Chief Operating Officer and President of Broadcast.\nIndustry Trends\n\u2022During the last few years, the number of subscribers to Distributor services in the United States has generally been declining, as technological advancements have driven changes in consumer behavior and have empowered consumers to seek more control over when, where and how they consume news, sports and other entertainment, including through the so-called cutting the cord\u201d and other consumption strategies.\n\u2022The Distributor industry has continued to undergo significant consolidation, which gives top Distributors purchase power.\n\u2022Distributors have introduced, marketed and/or modified tiers or bundles of programming that have impacted the number of subscribers that receive our RSNs, including tiers or bundles of programming that exclude our RSNs. We expect these trends to continue for the foreseeable future. We believe the emergence of DTC and OTT offerings will provide us the opportunity to compete with these products and services offered by Distributors\n\u2022The vMVPDs have continued to gain increasing importance and have quickly become a critical segment of the market. These vMVPDs offer a limited number of networks at a lower price point as compared to the traditional cable offering.\n\u2022Political spending is significantly higher in the even-numbered years due to the cyclicality of political elections. In addition, every four years, political spending is typically elevated further due to the advertising related to the presidential election. 2020 proved to be a record year in political advertising.\n\u2022The FCC has permitted broadcast television stations to use their digital spectrum for a wide variety of services including multi-channel broadcasts. The FCC must-carry\u201d rules only apply to a station's primary digital stream.\n\u2022Seasonal advertising increases within our broadcast segment occur in the second and fourth quarters due to the anticipation of certain seasonal and holiday spending by consumers.\n\u2022Seasonal advertising increases within our local sports segment occur in the second and third quarters due to a higher volume of sports games being played during this time, particularly the MLB season.\n\u2022Broadcasters have found ways to increase returns on their news programming initiatives while continuing to maintain locally produced content through the use of news sharing arrangements.\n\u2022Broadcasters have begun to expand their own DTC platforms.\n\u2022Advertising revenue related to the Summer Olympics occurs in even numbered years, with the exception of 2020 which was postponed due to COVID-19 and took place in Summer 2021, and the Super Bowl is aired on a different network each year. Both of these popularly viewed events can have an impact on our advertising revenues.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nThis discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates including those related to revenue recognition, goodwill and intangible assets, program contract costs, sports programming rights, income taxes and variable interest entities. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. These estimates have been consistently applied for all years presented in this report and in the past we have not experienced material differences between these estimates and actual results. However, because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty, actual results could differ from our estimates and such differences could be material.\nWe consider the following accounting policies to be the most critical as they are important to our financial condition and results of operations, and require significant judgment and estimates on the part of management in their application. For a detailed discussion of the application of these and other accounting policies, see Note 1. Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies within the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic continues to create significant uncertainty and disruption in the global economy and financial markets. It is reasonably possible that these uncertainties continue to impact our estimates related to, but not limited to, revenue recognition, goodwill and intangible assets, sports programming rights, and income taxes. As a result, many of our estimates and assumptions require increased judgment and carry a higher degree of variability and volatility. See Distribution Revenue in Revenue Recognition, Sports Programming Rights, and Impairment of Goodwill, Intangibles, and Other Assets under Note 1. Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies within the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on how COVID-19 has impacted distribution revenue, sports rights expense, and the value of goodwill and definite-lived intangible assets, respectively. Our estimates may further change in the future as the COVID-19 pandemic continues, new events occur, and additional information emerges, and such changes are recognized or disclosed in the consolidated financial statements.\nRevenue Recognition. As discussed in Revenue Recognition under Note 1. Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies within the Consolidated Financial Statements, we generate advertising revenue primarily from the sale of advertising spots/impressions on our broadcast television, RSNs, and digital platforms. Advertising revenue is recognized in the period in which the advertising spots/impressions are delivered. In arrangements where we provide audience ratings guarantees; to the extent that there is a ratings shortfall, we will defer a proportionate amount of revenue until the ratings shortfall is settled through the delivery of additional advertising. The term of our advertising arrangements is generally less than one year and the timing between when an advertisement is aired and when payment is realized is not significant. In certain circumstances, we require customers to pay in advance; payments received in advance of satisfying our performance obligations are reflected as deferred revenue.\nWe generate distribution revenue through fees received from Distributors and other OTT providers for the right to distribute our broadcast channels and cable networks on their distribution platforms. Distribution arrangements are generally governed by multi-year contracts and the underlying fees are based upon a contractual monthly rate per subscriber. These arrangements represent licenses of intellectual property; revenue is recognized as the signal is provided to our customers (as usage occurs) which corresponds with the satisfaction of our performance obligation. Revenue is calculated based upon the contractual rate multiplied by an estimated number of subscribers. Our customers will remit payments based upon actual subscribers a short time after the conclusion of a month, which generally does not exceed 120 days. Historical adjustments to subscriber estimates have not been material.\nCertain of our distribution arrangements contain provisions that require the Company to deliver a minimum number of live professional sports games or tournaments during a defined period which usually corresponds with a calendar year. If the minimum threshold is not met, we may be obligated to refund a portion of the distribution fees received if shortfalls are not cured within a specified period of time. If we are unable to meet these minimum requirements, we reduce revenue based upon estimated rebates due to our distribution customers over the measurement period of the rebate. See Revenue Recognition within Note 1. Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.\nImpairment of Goodwill, Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets, and Other Long-Lived Assets. We evaluate our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually, or more frequently, if events or changes in circumstances indicate an impairment may exist. As of December 31, 2021, our consolidated balance sheet includes $2,088 million and $150 million of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, respectively. We evaluate long-lived assets, including definite-lived intangible assets, for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of our asset groups may not be recoverable.\nIn the performance of our annual goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment assessments we have the option to qualitatively assess whether it is more likely-than-not that the respective asset has been impaired. If we conclude that it is more-likely-than-not that a reporting unit or an indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired, we apply the quantitative assessment, which involves comparing the estimated fair value of the reporting unit or indefinite-lived intangible asset to its respective carrying value. See Impairment of Goodwill, Intangibles and Other Assets under Note 1. Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 5. Goodwill, Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets, and Other Intangible Assets within the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the significant judgments and estimates inherent in both qualitatively assessing whether impairment may exist and estimating the fair values of the reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets if a quantitative assessment is deemed necessary.\nWe are required to analyze our long-lived assets, including definite-lived intangible assets, for impairment. We evaluate our definite-lived intangible assets for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. In the event we identify indicators that these assets are not recoverable, we evaluate the recoverability of definite-lived intangible assets by comparing the carrying amount of the assets within an asset group to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows associated with the asset group. An asset group represents the lowest level of cash flows generated by a group of assets that are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets. At the time that such evaluations indicate that the future undiscounted cash flows are not sufficient to recover the carrying value of the asset group, an impairment loss is determined by comparing the estimated fair value of the asset group to the carrying value. We estimate fair value using an income approach involving the performance of a discounted cash flow analysis.\nOur RSNs included in the local sports segment were negatively impacted by the loss of three Distributors in 2020. In addition, our existing Distributors experienced elevated levels of subscriber erosion which we believe was influenced, in part, by shifting consumer behaviors resulting from media fragmentation, the current economic environment, the COVID 19 pandemic and related uncertainties. Most of these factors are also expected to have a negative impact on future projected revenue and margins of our RSNs. As a result of these factors, we performed an impairment test of the RSN reporting units' goodwill and long-lived asset groups during the third quarter of 2020 which resulted in a non-cash impairment charge on goodwill of $2,615 million, customer relationships of $1,218 million, and other definite-lived intangible assets of $431 million, included within impairment of goodwill and definite-lived intangible assets in our consolidated statements of operations within the Consolidated Financial Statements. See Note 5. Goodwill, Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets, and Other Intangible Assets within the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. During the year ended December 31, 2021, we did not identify any indicators that our definite-lived intangible assets may not be recoverable. For our annual goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles impairment tests related to our broadcast and other reporting units in 2021, 2020, and 2019, we concluded that it was more-likely-than-not that goodwill was not impaired based on our qualitative assessments. For one reporting unit in 2019, we elected to perform a quantitative assessment and concluded that its fair value significantly exceeded the carrying value.\nWe believe we have made reasonable estimates and utilized appropriate assumptions in the performance of our impairment assessments. If future results are not consistent with our assumptions and estimates, including future events such as a deterioration of market conditions, loss of significant customers, failure to execute on DSG's DTC strategy, and significant increases in discount rates, among other factors, we could be exposed to impairment charges in the future. Any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated balance sheets, consolidated statements of operations and consolidated statements of cash flows.\nProgram Contract Costs. As discussed in Broadcast Television Programming under Note 1. Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies within the Consolidated Financial Statements, we record an asset and corresponding liability for programming rights when the program is available for its first showing or telecast. These costs are expensed over the period in which an economic benefit is expected to be derived. To ensure the related assets for the programming rights are reflected in our consolidated balance sheets at the lower of unamortized cost or fair value, management estimates future advertising revenue to be generated by the remaining program material available under the contract terms. Management's judgment is required in determining the timing of expense for these costs, which is dependent on the economic benefit expected to be generated from the program and may significantly differ from the timing of related payments under the contractual obligation. If our estimates of future advertising revenues decline, amortization expense could be accelerated or fair value adjustments may be required.\nSports Programming Rights. As discussed in Sports Programming Rights under Note 1. Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies within the Consolidated Financial Statements, we have multi-year program rights agreements that provide us with the right to produce and telecast professional sports games within a specified territory in exchange for an annual rights fee. A prepaid asset is recorded for rights acquired related to future games upon payment of the contracted fee. The assets recorded for the acquired rights are classified as current or non-current based on the period when the games are expected to be aired. Liabilities are recorded for any program rights obligations that have been incurred but not yet paid at period end. We amortize these programming rights as an expense over each season based upon contractually stated rates. Amortization is accelerated in the event that the stated contractual rates over the term of the rights agreement results in an expense recognition pattern that is inconsistent with the projected growth of revenue over the contractual term.\nFair Value Measurements of Investments in Bally's Securities. As discussed in Note 6. Other Assets and Note 18. Fair Value Measurements within the Consolidated Financial Statements, we entered into a commercial agreement with Bally's Corporation on November 18, 2020. As part of this arrangement, the Company received warrants and options to acquire common equity in the business. These financial instruments are measured each period at fair value. The fair value of the options are derived utilizing a Black Scholes valuation model which utilizes a number of inputs which most significantly includes the trading price of the underlying common stock, the exercise price of the options and a discount for lack of marketability. The fair value of the warrants are primarily derived from the trading price of the underlying common stock, the exercise price of the warrants and a discount for lack of marketability. The determination of the fair value of these financial instruments requires the Company to exercise judgment.\nIncome Tax. As discussed in Income Taxes under Note 1. Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies within the Consolidated Financial Statements, we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities. We provide a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets if we determine that it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. In evaluating our ability to realize net deferred tax assets, we consider all available evidence, both positive and negative, including our past operating results, tax planning strategies, current and cumulative losses, and forecasts of future taxable income. In considering these sources of taxable income, we must make certain judgments that are based on the plans and estimates used to manage our underlying businesses on a long-term basis. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, a valuation allowance has been provided for deferred tax assets related to certain temporary basis differences, interest expense carryforwards under the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) Section 163(j) and a substantial amount of our available state net operating loss carryforwards based on past operating results, including the RSN impairment, expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary basis differences, alternative tax strategies and projected future taxable income. Future changes in operating and/or taxable income or other changes in facts and circumstances could significantly impact the ability to realize our deferred tax assets which could have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.\nManagement periodically performs a comprehensive review of our tax positions, and we record a liability for unrecognized tax benefits if such tax positions are more likely than not to be sustained upon examination based on their technical merits, including the resolution of any appeals or litigation processes. Significant judgment is required in determining whether positions taken are more likely than not to be sustained, and it is based on a variety of facts and circumstances, including interpretation of the relevant federal and state income tax codes, regulations, case law and other authoritative pronouncements. Based on this analysis, the status of ongoing audits and the expiration of applicable statute of limitations, liabilities are adjusted as necessary. The resolution of audits is unpredictable and could result in tax liabilities that are significantly higher or lower than for what we have provided. See Note 12. Income Taxes within the Consolidated Financial Statements, for further discussion of accrued unrecognized tax benefits.\nVariable Interest Entities (VIEs). As discussed in Note 14. Variable Interest Entities within the Consolidated Financial Statements, we have determined that certain third-party licensees of stations for which we perform services pursuant to arrangements, including LMAs, JSAs, and SSAs, are VIEs and we are the primary beneficiary of those variable interests because, subject to the ultimate control of the licensees, we have the power to direct the activities which significantly impact the economic performance of the VIE through the services we provide and because we absorb losses and returns that would be considered significant to the VIEs. We have determined that certain RSN joint ventures are VIEs. We are the primary beneficiary of those RSN joint ventures because we have the power to direct the activities which significantly impact the economic performance of certain regional sports networks, including sales and certain operational services and because we absorb losses and returns that would be considered significant to the VIEs.\nTransactions with Related Parties. We have determined that we conduct certain business-related transactions with related persons or entities. See Note 15. Related Person Transactions within the Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion of these transactions.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Recent Accounting Pronouncements under Note 1. Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies within the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of recent accounting policies and their impact on our financial statements.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nAny references to the first, second, third or fourth quarters are to the three months ended March 31, June 30, September 30, or December 31, respectively, for the year being discussed. We have two reportable segments, broadcast and local sports, that are disclosed separately from our other and corporate activities.\nSeasonality / Cyclicality\nThe operating results of our broadcast segment are usually subject to cyclical fluctuations from political advertising. In even numbered years, political spending is usually significantly higher than in odd numbered years due to advertising expenditures preceding local and national elections. Additionally, every four years, political spending is usually elevated further due to advertising expenditures preceding the presidential election (as was the case in 2020). Also, the second and fourth quarter operating results are usually higher than the first and third quarter operating results because advertising expenditures are increased in anticipation of certain seasonal and holiday spending by consumers.\nThe operating results of our local sports segment are usually subject to cyclical fluctuations based on the timing and overlap of the MLB, NBA, and NHL seasons. Usually, the second and third quarter operating results are higher than the first and fourth quarter operating results.\nConsolidated Operating Data\nThe following table sets forth certain of our consolidated operating data for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019 (in millions).\nTable 21: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Years Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Media revenues (a) </td> <td>$ </td> <td>6,083 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,843 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,046 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-media revenues </td> <td>51 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>194 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total revenues </td> <td>6,134 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,943 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,240 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Media programming and production expenses </td> <td>4,291 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,735 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,073 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Media selling, general and administrative expenses </td> <td>908 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>832 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>732 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization expenses (b) </td> <td>591 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>674 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>424 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of program contract costs </td> <td>93 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>86 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>90 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-media expenses </td> <td>57 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>91 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>156 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Corporate general and administrative expenses </td> <td>170 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>148 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>387 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impairment of goodwill and definite-lived intangible assets </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,264 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain on asset dispositions and other, net of impairment </td> <td>(71) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(115) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(92) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income (loss) </td> <td>$ </td> <td>95 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(2,772) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>470 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net (loss) income attributable to Sinclair Broadcast Group </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(414) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(2,414) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>47 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n \n(a)Media revenues include distribution revenue, advertising revenue, and other media related revenues.\n(b)Depreciation and amortization includes depreciation and amortization of property and equipment and amortization of definite-lived intangible assets and other assets.\nThe Impact of COVID-19 on our Results of Operations\nOverview\nOn March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic, and by the end of the following day, each of the MLB, NBA, and NHL had suspended their seasons. On March 13, 2020, the United States declared a national state of emergency. As of December 31, 2021, the national state of emergency is still in effect, however substantially all states have reopened their economies, COVID-19 vaccinations are being distributed in mass quantities and all professional sports leagues are currently playing live games. However, with new variants of COVID-19 being detected across multiple countries, including the United States, there is still a heightened level of uncertainty of what the overall impact of COVID-19 will be on our business.\nBroadcast segment\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, as compared to the prior year, we experienced a decrease in advertising revenue primarily due to a decrease in political revenue as 2021 was a non-political year. See Revenues under the Broadcast Segment section below for further discussion.\nLocal sports segment\nIn March 2020, the NBA and NHL each postponed their 2019-2020 season and the MLB postponed the start of its 2020 season, however all leagues' returned to operation under reduced game counts and were able to complete these modified seasons during the early part of the fourth quarter of 2020. The NBA and NHL began their modified 2020-2021 seasons during the fourth quarter of 2020 and the first quarter of 2021, respectively, and the MLB began its 2021 season on April 1, 2021. Advertising revenue increased in the year ended December 31, 2021, as compared to the prior year, largely driven by an increased number of games played in 2021 when compared to 2020. Distribution revenue increased in the year ended December 31, 2021, as compared to 2020, primarily related to 2020 revenue being reduced due to the accrual of rebates to our Distributors resulting from the cancellation of professional sports games due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The MLB began their season on time in April 2021 and completed their full game schedule and the NBA and NHL began their 2021-2022 seasons in October 2021 under full game schedules. However, in light of the fourth quarter 2021 spike in COVID-19 cases, both the NHL and NBA have had to postpone and reschedule some of their games during their 2021-22 seasons. Of the total 11 NBA games postponed in the fourth quarter of 2021, 2 of which related to the RSNs, have been rescheduled for the first quarter 2022. Of the total 104 NHL games postponed during the 2021-22 season, 38 of which related to the RSNs, the majority were shifted from the fourth quarter 2021 to the first quarter 2022. The shift in these games to 2022 resulted in an increase in the estimated rebates to our Distributors of $8 million during the fourth quarter of 2021. Both leagues currently expect to finish their regular seasons on schedule, although there can be no assurance that the NBA or NHL will complete full seasons in the future. On December 2, 2021, MLB owners locked out players following the expiration of its prior collective bargaining agreement with its players. While negotiations towards a new collective bargaining agreement have commenced, there can be no assurance that an agreement will be reached prior to the commencement of the 2022 MLB season or at all, therefore there can be no assurance that the MLB will complete a full season in 2022 or in future years. Any reduction in the actual number of games played by the leagues may have an adverse impact on our operations and the cash flows of our local sports segment. See Distribution Revenue in Revenue Recognition and Sports Programming Rights under Note 1. Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies within the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on how COVID-19 has impacted distribution revenue and sports rights expense, respectively, including the need for us to provide rebates to our Distributors as well as seek rebate from or reduce future payments to certain of the sports teams.\nBusiness continuity\nWithin the United States, our business has been designated an essential business, which allows us to continue to serve our customers, however, the COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted our operations. Certain of our facilities have experienced temporary disruptions as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, and we cannot predict whether our facilities will experience more significant disruptions in the future and how long these disruptions will last. The COVID-19 pandemic has heightened the risk that a significant portion of our workforce will suffer illness or otherwise be unable to work. Furthermore, reductions in our workforce may become necessary as a result of declines in our business caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. If we take such actions, we cannot assure that we will be able to rehire our workforce once our business has recovered.\nA discussion regarding our financial results and operations for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020 is presented below. A discussion of the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 can be found under Item 7 of Part II of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020, filed with the SEC on March 1, 2021 (our \"2020 Annual Report\"), which is available free of charge on the SEC's website at www.sec.gov and our Investor Relations website at www.sbgi.net/investor-relations.\nBROADCAST SEGMENT\nThe following table sets forth our revenue and expenses for our broadcast segment, previously referred to as our local news and marketing services segment, for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019 (in millions):\nTable 23: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Percent Change\nIncrease / (Decrease) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>\u201821 vs.\u201820 </td> <td> </td> <td>\u201820 vs.\u201819 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenue: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Distribution revenue </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,475 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,414 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,341 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4% </td> <td> </td> <td>5% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Advertising revenue </td> <td>1,106 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,364 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,268 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(19)% </td> <td> </td> <td>8% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other media revenue (a) </td> <td>176 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>144 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>81 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>22% </td> <td> </td> <td>78% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Media revenues </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,757 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,922 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,690 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(6)% </td> <td> </td> <td>9% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating Expenses: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Media programming and production expenses </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,344 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,257 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,173 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7% </td> <td> </td> <td>7% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Media selling, general and administrative expenses </td> <td>593 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>553 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>553 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7% </td> <td> </td> <td>-% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of program contract costs </td> <td>76 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>83 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>90 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(8)% </td> <td> </td> <td>(8)% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Corporate general and administrative expenses </td> <td>147 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>119 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>144 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>24% </td> <td> </td> <td>(17)% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization expenses </td> <td>247 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>239 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>246 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3% </td> <td> </td> <td>(3)% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain on asset dispositions and other, net of impairment </td> <td>(24) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(118) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(62) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(80)% </td> <td> </td> <td>90% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income </td> <td>$ </td> <td>374 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>789 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>546 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(53)% </td> <td> </td> <td>45% </td> </tr>\n</table>\n \n(a)Includes $111 million, $100 million, and $35 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, of intercompany revenue related to certain services provided to the local sports segment and other under management services agreements, which is eliminated in consolidation.\nRevenues\nDistribution revenue. Distribution revenue, which includes payments from Distributors for our broadcast signals, increased $61 million in 2021, when compared to the same period in 2020, primarily due to an increase in rates, partially offset by a decrease in subscribers.\nAdvertising revenue. Advertising revenue decreased $258 million in 2021, when compared to the same period in 2020, primarily due to a decrease in political advertising revenue of $329 million, as 2020 was a political and presidential election year, and due to the effects of the cybersecurity incident that occurred during the fourth quarter of 2021, which we currently estimate resulted in a decrease in revenue of approximately $63 million. The decrease is partially offset by increases in various non-political advertising categories due to improved macroeconomic conditions, as the economy began to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic in 2021.\nFor the year ending December 31, 2022 we expect an increase in advertising revenue, when compared to 2021, primarily related to an increase in political revenue, as 2022 is a political election year.\nThe following table sets forth our affiliate percentages of advertising revenue for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019:\nTable 25: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td># of </td> <td> </td> <td>Percent of Advertising Revenue for the\nTwelve Months Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Channels (a) </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>ABC </td> <td>40 </td> <td> </td> <td>31% </td> <td> </td> <td>28% </td> <td> </td> <td>30% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>FOX </td> <td>56 </td> <td> </td> <td>24% </td> <td> </td> <td>25% </td> <td> </td> <td>25% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>CBS </td> <td>31 </td> <td> </td> <td>20% </td> <td> </td> <td>22% </td> <td> </td> <td>20% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>NBC </td> <td>25 </td> <td> </td> <td>14% </td> <td> </td> <td>15% </td> <td> </td> <td>13% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>CW </td> <td>46 </td> <td> </td> <td>5% </td> <td> </td> <td>5% </td> <td> </td> <td>6% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>MNT </td> <td>40 </td> <td> </td> <td>4% </td> <td> </td> <td>4% </td> <td> </td> <td>4% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other </td> <td>396 </td> <td> </td> <td>2% </td> <td> </td> <td>1% </td> <td> </td> <td>2% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total </td> <td>634 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n \n(a)We broadcast other programming from the following providers on our channels including: Antenna TV, Azteca, Bounce, CHARGE!, Comet, Dabl, Decades, Estrella TV, GetTV, Grit, MeTV, Rewind, Stadium, TBD, Telemundo, This TV, UniMas, Univision, and Weather.\nOther Media Revenue. Other media revenue increased $32 million in 2021, when compared to the same period in 2020. The increase is primarily due to an $11 million increase in intercompany revenue from the local sports and other segments related to providing certain services under a management services agreement, which are eliminated in our consolidated results.\nExpenses\nMedia programming and production expenses. Media programming and production expenses increased $87 million during 2021, when compared to the same period in 2020, primarily related to an increase in fees pursuant to network affiliation agreements of $99 million, partially offset by a $19 million decrease in employee compensation costs.\nMedia selling, general and administrative expenses.
