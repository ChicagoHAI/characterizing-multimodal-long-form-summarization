MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nTHE FOLLOWING COMMENTARY SHOULD BE READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND RELATED NOTES CONTAINED ELSEWHERE IN THIS FORM 10-K. THE DISCUSSION CONTAINS FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS THAT INVOLVE RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES. THESE STATEMENTS RELATE TO FUTURE EVENTS OR OUR FUTURE FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE. IN SOME CASES, YOU CAN IDENTIFY THESE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS BY TERMINOLOGY SUCH AS MAY,\u201d WILL,\u201d SHOULD,\u201d EXPECT,\u201d PLAN,\u201d ANTICIPATE,\u201d BELIEVE,\u201d ESTIMATE,\u201d PREDICT,\u201d POTENTIAL,\u201d INTEND,\u201d OR CONTINUE,\u201d AND SIMILAR EXPRESSIONS. THESE STATEMENTS ARE ONLY PREDICTIONS. OUR ACTUAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THOSE ANTICIPATED IN THESE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS AS A RESULT OF A VARIETY OF FACTORS, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THOSE SET FORTH UNDER RISK FACTORS\u201d AND ELSEWHERE IN THIS FORM 10-K.\nOverview\nWe are an independent oil and natural gas company engaged in the exploration, development, and production of oil and natural gas properties located onshore in the United States and an owner of various royalty interests offshore Israel. Our properties are primarily located in Texas, New Mexico and Oklahoma. We act as the operator of most of our U.S. properties. Historically, we have grown through acquisitions, with a focus on properties within our core operating areas that we believe have significant development and exploration opportunities and where we can apply our technical experience and economies of scale to increase production and proved reserves while lowering lease operating costs. In August, 2011 we created a new production services subsidiary that began operations in October 2011. As of December 2017, the subsidiary had 33 deployed production services rigs and various trucks that operate primarily in Texas and New Mexico. The Company provides a full range of production services such as well completion and wellbore maintenance, workover, fluid transportation and plugging and abandonment services.\nOil and Gas Exploration and Production Segment\nOur financial results depend upon many factors, but are largely driven by the volume of our oil and natural gas production and the price that we receive for that production. Our production volumes will decline as reserves are depleted unless we expend capital in successful development and exploration activities or acquire additional properties with existing production. The amount we realize for our production depends predominantly upon commodity prices, which are affected by changes in market demand and supply, as impacted by overall economic activity, weather, pipeline capacity constraints, inventory storage levels, quality, basis differentials and other factors, and secondarily upon our commodity price hedging activities. Accordingly, finding and developing oil and natural gas reserves at economical costs is critical to our long-term success. Our future drilling plans are subject to change based upon various factors, some of which are beyond our control, including drilling results, oil and natural gas prices, the availability and cost of capital, drilling and production costs, availability of drilling services and equipment, gathering system and pipeline transportation constraints and regulatory approvals. To the extent these factors lead to reductions in our drilling plans and associated capital budgets in future periods, our financial position, cash flows and operating results could be adversely impacted.\nWe own all ownership units in Tamar Royalties, LLC, which owns an overriding royalty interest of 1.5375% before payout / 2.7375% after payout in the Tamar Field (collectively the Tamar Royalty\u201d). An overriding royalty interest is an ownership interest in the oil and gas leasehold estate equating to a certain percentage of production or production revenues, calculated free of the costs of production and development of the underlying lease(s), but subject to its proportionate share of certain post production costs. An overriding royalty interest is a non-possessory interest in the oil and gas leasehold estate and, accordingly, we have no control over the operations, drilling, expenses, timing, production, sales, or any other aspect of development or production of the Tamar Field.\nThe Tamar Field project began production in March 2013 and is now operational and delivering natural gas to Israel. The natural gas flows from the Tamar Field through the world's longest subsea tieback, more than 90 miles to the Tamar platform, and then to the Ashdod onshore terminal.\nAs noted above with regard to the payout of the Tamar Field, a disagreement between the Company and Isramco Negev 2 Limited Partnership has emerged as to what costs should be included in the calculation of payout. In addition to actual costs for the development of the Tamar Field, Isramco, Negev 2 Limited Partnership has asserted that the following costs should be included in the calculation of payout: (i) Isramco Negev 2 Limited Partnership's financing costs; (ii) the general and administrative expenses of Isramco Negev 2 Limited Partnership; (iii) the expected decommissioning costs of the Tamar Field; and (iv) expected future payments to be made in respect of the Sheshinsky Levy\u201d under Israeli law. The disagreement primarily stems from the fact that the agreements governing the creation of the Tamar Royalty were formulated in the 1980s and do not have a clear and unequivocal definition as to what costs should be included in the payout calculation. The Company currently believes that the total scope of the disagreement is approximately forty-five million dollars ($45,000,000). Under the terms of the agreements creating the Tamar Royalty, the dispute is subject to arbitration in Israel. The Company believes that the claims of Isramco Negev 2 Limited Partnership are erroneous and contrary to generally accepted industry practice. The Company expects that the matter will be favorably resolved through this arbitration process; however, the Company cannot be assured of a favorable result in this arbitration process.\nDuring year ended December 31, 2017, net sales from the Tamar Field attributable to the Company amounted to 5,343,000 Mcf of natural gas and 6,990 Bbl of condensate with prices of $5.35 per Mcf and $47.46 per Bbl of condensate. Total revenues net of marketing and transportation expenses were $28,781,000. The Israeli Tax Authority withheld $6,907,000 of this revenue.\nDuring year ended December 31, 2016, net sales from the Tamar Field attributable to Isramco amounted to 5,102,000 Mcf of natural gas and 6,882 Bbl of condensate with prices of $5.34 per Mcf and $37.48 per Bbl of condensate. Total revenues net of marketing and transportation expenses were $27,462,000. The Israeli Tax Authority withheld $6,866,000 of this revenue.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, net sales from the Tamar Field attributable to the Company amounted to 4,505,000 Mcf of natural gas and 6,074 Bbl of condensate with prices of $5.52 per Mcf and $46.53 per Bbl of condensate. Total revenues net of marketing and transportation expenses were $25,151,000. The Israeli Tax Authority withheld $6,665,000 of this revenue.\nAt December 31, 2017, our estimated total proved oil, natural gas reserves and natural gas liquids, as prepared by our independent reserve engineering firms, Netherland, Sewell & Associates, Inc. and Cawley, Gillespie & Associates, Inc., were approximately 38,653 thousand barrels of oil equivalent ( MBOE\u201d), consisting of 1,765 thousand barrels (MBbls) of oil, 216,451 million cubic feet (MMcf) of natural gas and 813 thousand barrels (MBbls) of natural gas liquids. Approximately 86.0% of our proved reserves were classified as proved developed (See Note 13, Supplemental Oil and Gas Information\u201d). Full year 2017 production averaged 3.78 MBOE/d compared to 3.80 MBOE/d in 2016. Tamar Field production share amounted to 2.46 MBOE/d out of total 3.78 MBOE/d compared to 2.35 MBOE/d in 2016.\nProduction Services Segment\nOur core businesses depend on our customers' willingness to make expenditures to produce, develop and explore for oil and natural gas in the United States. Industry conditions are influenced by numerous factors, such as the supply of and demand for oil and natural gas, domestic and worldwide economic conditions, political instability in oil producing countries and merger and divestiture activity among oil and natural gas producers. The volatility of the oil and natural gas industry, and the consequent impact on exploration and production activity, could adversely impact the level of workover activity by some of our customers. This volatility also affects the demand for our services and the price of our services. In addition, the discovery rate of new oil and natural gas reserves in our market areas also may have an impact on our business, even in an environment of stronger oil and natural gas prices.\nWe derive a majority of our revenues from services supporting production from existing oil and natural gas operations including in moderate oil and natural gas price environments, ongoing maintenance spending is generally required to sustain production. However, in a low commodity price environment our customers may reduce their budgets resulting in reduced demand for our services. As oil and natural gas prices reach higher levels, demand for all of our services generally increases as our customers engage in more well servicing activities relating to existing wells to maintain or increase oil and natural gas production from those wells. Because our services are required to support drilling and workover activities, our revenues will vary based on changes in capital spending by our customers as oil and natural gas prices increase or decrease.\nThe production services market is highly competitive. Competition is influenced by such factors as price, capacity, availability of work crews, and reputation and experience of the service provider. We believe that an important competitive factor in establishing and maintaining long-term customer relationships is having an experienced, skilled and well-trained work force. We believe many of our larger customers place increased emphasis on the safety, performance and quality of the crews, equipment and services provided by their contractors. Although we believe customers consider all of these factors, price is often the primary factor in determining which service provider is awarded the work. However, in numerous instances, we secure and maintain work from large customers for which efficiency, safety, technology, size of fleet and availability of other services are of equal importance to price.\nThe demand for our services fluctuates, primarily in relation to the price (or anticipated price) of oil and natural gas, which, in turn, is driven primarily by the supply of, and demand for, oil and natural gas. Generally, as supply of those commodities decreases and demand increases, service and maintenance requirements increase as oil and natural gas producers attempt to maximize the productivity of their wells in a higher priced environment. However, in a lower oil and natural gas price environment, demand for service and maintenance generally decreases as oil and natural gas producers decrease their activity. In particular, the demand for new or existing field drilling and completion work is driven by available investment capital for such work. Oil and natural gas producers generally tend to be less risk tolerant when commodity prices are low or volatile, we may experience a more rapid decline in demand for well maintenance services compared with demand for other types of oilfield services. Further, in a low commodity price environment, fewer production services rigs are needed for completions, as these activities are generally associated with drilling activity. The plugging and abandonment work is less affected by prices and generally driven by state regulations and have smaller variations in demand.\nThe level of our revenues, earnings and cash flows are substantially dependent upon, and affected by, the level of U.S. oil and natural gas exploration, development and production activity, as well as the equipment capacity in any particular region.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect our reported results of operations and the amount of reported assets, liabilities and proved oil and natural gas reserves. Some accounting policies involve judgments and uncertainties to such an extent that there is reasonable likelihood that materially different amounts could have been reported under different conditions, or if different assumptions had been used. Actual results may differ from the estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. Described below are the most significant policies we apply in preparing our consolidated financial statements, some of which are subject to alternative treatments under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. We also describe the most significant estimates and assumptions we make in applying these policies.\nOil and Natural Gas Activities\nAccounting for oil and natural gas activities is subject to unique rules. Two generally accepted methods of accounting for oil and natural gas activities are available - successful efforts and full cost. The most significant differences between these two methods are the treatment of unsuccessful exploration costs and the manner in which the carrying value of oil and natural gas properties are amortized and evaluated for impairment. The successful efforts method requires unsuccessful exploration costs to be expensed as they are incurred upon a determination that the well is uneconomical, while the full cost method provides for the capitalization of these costs. Both methods generally provide for the periodic amortization of capitalized costs based on proved reserve quantities. Impairment of oil and natural gas properties under the successful efforts method is based on an evaluation of the carrying value of individual oil and natural gas properties against their estimated fair value, while impairment under the full cost method requires an evaluation of the carrying value of oil and natural gas properties included in a cost center against the net present value of future cash flows from the related proved reserves, using period-end prices and costs and a 10% discount rate. We account for our natural gas and crude oil exploration and production activities under the successful efforts method of accounting.\nProved Oil and Natural Gas Reserves\nIsramco estimates its proved oil and gas reserves as defined by the SEC and the FASB. This definition includes crude oil, natural gas, and NGLs that geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be economically producible in future periods from known reservoirs under existing economic conditions, operating methods, government regulations, etc., i.e., at prices and costs as of the date the estimates are made. Prices include consideration of price changes provided only by contractual arrangements, and do not include adjustments based upon expected future conditions.\nThe Company's estimates of proved reserves are made using available geological and reservoir data, as well as production performance data. These estimates are reviewed annually by our independent reserve engineering firm, Cawley, Gillespie & Associates, Inc and Netherland, Sewell & Associates, Inc. and revised, either upward or downward, as warranted by additional data. Revisions are necessary due to changes in, among other things, reservoir performance, prices, economic conditions, and governmental restrictions, as well as changes in the expected recovery associated with infill drilling. Decreases in prices, for example, may cause a reduction in some proved reserves due to reaching economic limits earlier. A material adverse change in the estimated volumes of proved reserves could have a negative impact on depreciation, depletion and amortization expense (DD&A) and could result in property impairments.\nDepreciation, Depletion and Amortization\nOur rate of recording DD&A is primarily dependent upon our estimate of proved reserves, which is utilized in our unit-of-production method calculation. If the estimates of proved reserves were to be reduced, the rate at which we record DD&A expense would increase, reducing net income. Such a reduction in reserves may result from lower market prices, which may make it non-economic to drill for and produce higher cost reserves.\nOur production services equipment and tools are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is provided for our assets over the estimated depreciable lives of the assets using the straight-line method. We depreciate our operational assets over their depreciable lives to their salvage value, which is a fair value higher than the assets' value as scrap. When we scrap an asset, we accelerate the depreciation of the asset down to its salvage value. When we dispose of an asset, a gain or loss is recognized.\nImpairment\nWe review our property and equipment in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 360, Property, Plant, and Equipment (ASC 360). ASC 360 requires us to evaluate property and equipment as an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the property and equipment below the carrying amount. If the carrying amount of property and equipment is not recoverable from its undiscounted cash flows, then we would recognize an impairment loss for the difference between the carrying amount and the current fair value. Further, we evaluate the remaining useful lives of property and equipment at each reporting period to determine whether events and circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining depreciation periods.\nAsset Retirement Obligations\nWe have significant obligations to remove tangible equipment and facilities associated with our oil and gas wells and to restore land at the end of oil and gas production operations. Our removal and restoration obligations are most often associated with plugging and abandoning wells. Estimating the future restoration and removal costs is difficult and requires us to make estimates and judgments because most of the removal obligations we have will be take effect in the future. Additionally, these operations are subject to private contracts and government regulations that often have vague descriptions of what is required. Asset removal technologies and costs are constantly changing, as are regulatory, political, environmental, safety and public relations considerations. Inherent in the present value calculations are numerous assumptions and judgments including the ultimate removal cost amounts, inflation factors, credit adjusted discount rates, timing of obligations and changes in the legal, regulatory, environmental and political environments.\nAccounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities\nWe have and may utilize derivative contracts to hedge against the variability in cash flows associated with the forecasted sale of our anticipated future oil and natural gas production. We may generally hedge a substantial, but varying, portion of our anticipated oil and natural gas production for the next years. We do not use derivative instruments for trading purposes. We have elected not to apply hedge accounting to our derivative contracts, which would potentially allow us to not record the change in fair value of our derivative contracts in the consolidated statements of operations. We carry our derivatives at fair value on our consolidated balance sheets, with the changes in the fair value included in our consolidated statements of operations in the period in which the change occurs.\nEnvironmental Obligations, Litigation and Other Contingencies\nManagement makes judgments and estimates in accordance with applicable accounting rules when it establishes reserves for environmental remediation, litigation, and other contingent matters. Provisions for such matters are charged to expense when it is probable that a liability is incurred and reasonable estimates of the liability can be made. Estimates of environmental liabilities are based on a variety of matters, including, but not limited to, the stage of investigation, the stage of the remedial design, evaluation of existing remediation technologies, and presently enacted laws and regulations. In future periods, a number of factors could significantly change the Company's estimate of environmental-remediation costs, such as changes in laws and regulations, changes in the interpretation or administration of laws and regulations, revisions to the remedial design, unanticipated construction problems, identification of additional areas or volumes of contaminated soil and groundwater, and changes in costs of labor, equipment, and technology. Consequently, it is not possible for management to reliably estimate the amount and timing of all future expenditures related to environmental or other contingent matters and actual costs may vary significantly from the Company's estimates. The Company's in-house legal counsel regularly assesses these contingent liabilities and, in certain circumstances, consults with third-party legal counsel or consultants to assist in forming the Company's conclusion.\nIncome Taxes and Impact of Tax Reform Legislation\nThe Company follows ASC 740, Income Taxes, (ASC 740), which requires recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the consolidated financial statements or tax returns. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are computed using the liability method based on the differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse.\nA valuation allowance is provided, if necessary, to reserve the amount of net operating loss and net deferred tax assets which the Company may not be able to use because of the expiration of maximum carryover periods allowed under applicable tax codes.\nOn December 22, 2017, the US Congress enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (Tax Reform Legislation), which made significant changes to US federal income tax law affecting us. See Note 5. Income Taxes.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur primary source of cash during the year ended December 31, 2017, was net cash flow from operating activities. We continuously monitor our liquidity and evaluate our development plans in light of a variety of factors, including, but not limited to, our cash flows, capital resources and drilling success.\nOur future capital resources and liquidity may depend, in part, on our success in developing the leasehold interests that we have acquired. Cash is required to fund capital expenditures necessary to offset inherent declines in production and proven reserves, which is typical in the capital-intensive oil and gas industry. Future success in growing reserves and production will be highly dependent on the capital resources available and our success in finding and acquiring additional reserves. Our production services subsidiary also requires capital resources to acquire and maintain equipment. We expect to fund our future capital requirements through internally generated cash flows, and borrowings under loans and the credit facility described below. Long-term cash flows are subject to a number of variables, including the level of production, prices, amount of work orders received, and our commodity price hedging activities, as well as various economic conditions that have historically affected the oil and natural gas industry.\nOn May 18, 2015, Tamar Royalties LLC ( Tamar Royalties\u201d), a newly formed, wholly-owned, special purpose subsidiary of the Company entered into a term loan credit agreement (the DB Facility\u201d) with Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas ( Deutsche Bank\u201d) in the amount of $120,000,000 secured by the Company's interest in the Tamar field. Interest on the borrowing is subject to fluctuations in LIBOR. The Company entered into interest rate swap agreements in relation to this borrowing. The terms of the agreement and swaps are disclosed in Notes 3 and 4.\nOn June 30, 2015, the Company obtained a credit facility (the SG Facility\u201d) with The Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale. The SG facility provided for a commitment by The Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale of $150,000,000, subject to an initial borrowing base of $40,000,000. The tenure of the SG Facility was four (4) years and it was secured by certain onshore United States oil and gas properties. Interest on borrowing was variable as disclosed in Note 4 Long-Term Debt and Interest Expense\u201d. On February 28, 2017 the SG Facility was terminated.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, our cash increased by $3,919,000. Specifically, net cash from operating activities of $18,552,000, was offset by cash used in financing activities of $10,519,000 and cash used in investing activities of $4,114,000.\n(See Item 1A Risk Factors\u201d).\nCommitments and Contingencies\nAs is common within the oil and natural gas industry, we have entered into various commitments and operating agreements related to the exploration and development of and production from proved oil and natural gas properties. It is our belief that such commitments will be met without a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nContractual Obligations: Aggregate maturities of contractual obligations at December 31, 2017 are due in future years as follows (in thousands):\nPrincipal Payments on Long-term debt:\nTable 139: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> 18,900\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 21,900\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 17,100\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 14,700\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 14,400\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 11,400\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 98,400\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nDebt\nTable 140: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> As of December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> (In thousands except percentage)\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Long - term debt net of discount and bank fees\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 77,369\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 95,441\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 104,252\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Long - term debt - related party (1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Current maturities of long-term debt, short-term debt, net of current portion of discount and debt cost and bank overdraft\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 18,517\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 9,147\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 9,952\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total debt\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 95,886\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 104,588\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 114,204\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Stockholders' equity (deficit)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (23,818\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2,016\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (2,868\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Debt to capital ratio\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 141: <table> <tr> <td>(1) </td> <td> The amounts are exclusive of accrued interest.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAt year-end 2017, our total debt was $95,886,000 compared to total debt of $104,588,000 at year-end 2016 and $114,204,000 at year-end 2015.\nBank Loan and Credit Facility\nThe Deutsche Bank Facility\nOn May 18, 2015, Tamar Royalties LLC ( Tamar Royalties\u201d), a newly formed, wholly-owned, special purpose subsidiary of the Company, entered into a term loan credit agreement (the DB Facility\u201d) with Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas ( Deutsche Bank\u201d), as facility agent for the lenders and as collateral agent for the secured parties, and with the lenders party thereto. The DB Facility provides for borrowings in the amount of $120,000,000 on a committed basis and is secured by, among other things, an overriding royalty interest in the Tamar Field, a natural gas field in the Mediterranean Sea, equal to 1.5375% before payout / 2.7375% after payout in the Tamar Field (the Royalty Interest\u201d). In connection with the DB Facility, and pursuant to a royalties sale and contribution agreement, the Company contributed the Royalty Interest to Tamar Royalties in exchange for all of the ownership units of Tamar Royalties. Pursuant to the terms of its governing documents, Tamar Royalties will be managed by N.M.A. Energy Resources Ltd, a related party of the Company, and an independent manager, Donald J. Puglisi.\nPursuant to the terms of the DB Facility, Tamar Royalties borrowed $120,000,000 in its initial borrowing under this facility. The initial borrowing under the DB Facility bears annual interest based on the LIBOR for a three-month interest period plus a spread of 2.75%. The $120,000,000 initial borrowing under the DB Facility will be repaid over eight (8) years commencing July 1, 2015, in accordance with an amortization profile based on projected cash flows from the Royalty Interest. Tamar Royalties's obligations under the Facility are secured by a first ranking pledge of the shares of Tamar Royalties, first ranking pledge of all rights under the agreements creating the Royalty Interest, and a first priority security interest over the accounts created under the DB Facility.\nSo long as any amounts remain outstanding to the Lenders under the DB Facility, Tamar Royalties must, from and after the end of the Availability Period (as defined in the DB Facility), have a Historical Debt Service Coverage Ratio (as defined in the DB Facility) of not less than 1.00:1.00, a Loan Life Coverage Ratio (as defined in the DB Facility) of at least 1.1:1.00, and maintain a Required Reserve Amount (as defined in the DB Facility). In addition, Tamar Royalties is required under the DB facility to hedge against fluctuations in LIBOR as reflected in Note 3 Financial Instruments and Fair Value\u201d.\nThe amortization schedule under the DB Facility was based on the projection that the Investment Repayment Date (as defined therein) would occur at some point before the end of the first quarter of 2018 and therefore, commencing from the Payment Date occurring on 1st April 2018, the amounts to be repaid on each payment date under the credit agreement increase to reflect the expected increase in the Royalties Receivables (as defined therein) as a result of the increase in the royalty percentage following the Investment Repayment Date.\nAs noted above with regard to the payout of the Tamar Field, a disagreement between Tamar Royalties and Isramco Negev 2 Limited Partnership has emerged as to whether certain items may be included in the calculation of payout. The disagreement largely stems from the fact that the agreements governing the creation of the Tamar Royalty were formulated in the 1980s and do not have a clear and unequivocal definition as to what costs should be included in the payout calculation. The Company currently believes that the total scope of the disagreement is approximately forty five million dollars ($45,000,000). Under the terms of the agreements creating the Tamar Royalty, the dispute is subject to arbitration in Israel. The Company expects that the matter will be resolved through this arbitration process. However, the Company cannot be assured of a favorable result resulting from this arbitration process. Accordingly, the Company continues to receive royalty payments at the lower rates as if the Investment Repayment Date has not occurred.\nTherefore, as a result of the dispute with the Isramco Negev 2, Tamar Royalties will have a shortfall in its Royalties Receivables for the period (or part of the period) between 1st April 2018 and 1st April 2019, by which time, even if the Isramco Negev 2's claims regarding the Investment Repayment Date are accepted, the Investment Repayment Date is expected to occur.\nAs a result, the Company believes Tamar Royalites required an additional $15,600,000 USD to cover payments under the amortization schedule of the DB Facility (the Shortfall\u201d), and the Company believes that curing the Shortfall was in the best interest of both Isramco Inc. and Tamar Royalties. Therefore, Isramco Inc. contributed the expected amount of the Shortfall, being $15,600,000 USD, to Tamar Royalties as an additional capital contribution and such contribution was made pursuant to the terms and conditions of that certain Consent and Agreement dated February 27, 2018, between and among Tamar Royalties, as Borrower, Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, as Facility Agent and Collateral Agent, and the Lenders party thereto.

In 2016, cash received from operations and proceeds from sale of oil and gas properties was primarily used for repayment of long-term debt, short-term debt, investments in equipment and an increase in restricted cash.\nOur primary source of cash in 2015 was cash flow from financing activities. In 2015, net cash received from bank loans, sales of property, and operating activities was primarily used to replay related party loans and short-term debt, increase restricted cash, and investment in equipment for our production services subsidiary and oil and gas properties.\nOperating cash flow fluctuations were substantially driven by changes in commodity prices and changes in our production volumes. Working capital was substantially influenced by these variables. Fluctuation in commodity prices and our overall cash flow may result in an increase or decrease in our future capital expenditures. Prices for oil and natural gas have historically been subject to seasonal fluctuations characterized by peak demand and higher prices in the winter heating season; however, the impact of other risks and uncertainties have influenced prices throughout recent years.

This compares to net income of $6,745,000, or $2.48 per share for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nThis decrease in income is primarily due to the increase in allowance for foreign tax credit and deferred tax assets. We fully allowed for our accumulated future tax credit related to the taxes withheld by the Israeli taxing authorities. The valuation allowance amounted to $28,677,000. Total foreign tax credit balance was written off after the passing of new tax legislation of New Tax Reform in the United States which lowered the corporate tax rate to a level that eliminated the forecasted usage of the accumulated foreign tax credit. Likewise we increased our allowance to fully allow for our deferred tax assets see Item 5 Income Tax. This increase in tax expense was partially offset by increased revenues from our United States based production operations, increased revenues from the Tamar field, increased revenues from production service activities, and an increased in gain on divestiture.\nIn 2016 our net income was $6,745,000, or $2.48 per share. This compares to net loss of $(17,310,000), or $(6.37) per share for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nThis increase was primarily due to the decrease in impairment expense from $43,704,000 in 2015 to $4,529,000 in 2016. Additionally lease operating expenses decreased by $5,903,000 from $14,828,000 in 2015 to $8,925,000 in 2016 and Tamar Field proceeds increased by $2,311,000 from $25,151,000 in 2015 to $27,462,000 in 2016. This increase was offset by decreased revenues from our US based oil and gas assets and production services subsidiary which was driven by decrease in natural gas and crude oil prices which in turn reduced demand for our production services; and lower sales volumes of oil, natural gas and NGLs. Additionally the increase in net income was offset lower gain on divestiture, $600,000 in 2016 as compared to $8,378,000 in 2015.\nRevenues, Volumes and Average Prices Oil and Gas Segment - Israel\nDuring year ended December 31, 2017, net sales from the Tamar Field attributable to the Company amounted to 5,343,000 Mcf of natural gas and 6,990 Bbl of condensate with prices of $5.35 per Mcf and $47.46 per Bbl of condensate. Total revenues net of marketing and transportation expenses were $28,781,000. The Israeli Tax Authority withheld $6,907,000 of this revenue.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, net sales from the Tamar Field attributable to the Company amounted to 5,102,000 Mcf of natural gas and 6,882 Bbl of condensate with prices of $5.34 per Mcf and $37.48 per Bbl of condensate. Total revenues net of marketing and transportation expenses were $27,462,000. The Israeli Tax Authority withheld $6,866,000, of this revenue.\nDuring year ended December 31, 2015, net sales from the Tamar Field attributable to the Company amounted to 4,505,000 Mcf of natural gas and 6,074 Bbl of condensate with prices of $5.52 per Mcf and $46.53 per Bbl of condensate. Total revenues net of marketing and transportation expenses were $25,151,000.

The tax expense was primarily due to the full allowance of amounts previously in deferred tax assets as future tax credits related to tax withheld by the Israel taxation authorities on Tamar Field proceeds and the full allowance of other deferred tax assets. On December 22, 2017, the US Congress enacted the Tax Reform Legislation, which made significant changes to US federal income tax law, including a reduction in the federal corporate tax rate to 21% effective January 1, 2018. Under US GAAP, we are required to recognize the effect of a rate change on deferred tax assets and liabilities in the period in which the tax rate change is enacted. At the lower tax rate, we projected that we would not be able to recover accumulated foreign tax credits balance to reduce our future tax burden and therefore recorded a full valuation allowance of $31,091,000. In addition, a full valuation allowance was recorded to reduce deferred tax assets balances as of December 31, 2017 due to uncertainty in their future recoverability - see Note 5 Income Taxes. Our pre-tax income of $19,811,000 for 2017 increased by $11,288,000 from pre-tax income in 2016 of $8,523,000. This increase in pre-tax income from 2016 to 2017 was primarily the result of a $5,513,000 increase in production services revenues, a $2,162,000 increase revenues from United States based oil and gas assets, a $2,103,000 increase in gain on divestiture, and a $1,319,000 increase in Tamar Field proceeds. This increase was partially offset by increased operating expenses.\nIncome tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $3,634,000. The tax expense was primarily due to our pre-tax income of $8,523,000 which was primarily due to the decrease in impairment expense from $43,704,000 in 2015 to $4,529,000 in 2016. Additionally lease operating expenses decreased by $5,903,000 from $14,828,000 in 2015 to $8,925,000 in 2016 and Tamar Field proceeds increased by $2,311,000 from $25,151,000 in 2015 to $27,462,000 in 2016. This increase was offset by decreased revenues from our US based oil and gas assets and production services subsidiary which was driven by decrease in natural gas and crude oil prices which in turn reduced demand for our production services; and lower sales volumes of oil, natural gas and NGLs. Additionally the increase in net income was offset lower gain on divestiture, $600,000 in 2016 as compared to $8,378,000 in 2015.\nThe effective tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 were 230.4%, 42.6% and 30.6%, respectively.\nAdjusted EBITDAX.\nTo assess the operating results of Isramco, management analyzes income from operations before income taxes, interest expense, exploration expense, unrealized gain (loss) on derivative contracts and DD&A expense and impairments ( Adjusted EBITDAX\u201d). Adjusted EBITDAX is not a GAAP measure. Isramco's definition of Adjusted EBITDAX excludes exploration expense because exploration expense is not an indicator of operating efficiency for a given reporting period, but rather is monitored by management as a part of the costs incurred in exploration and development activities. Similarly, Isramco excludes DD&A expense and impairments from Adjusted EBITDAX as a measure of segment operating performance because capital expenditures are evaluated at the time capital costs are incurred. The Company's definition of Adjusted EBITDAX also excludes interest expense to allow for assessment of segment operating results without regard to Isramco's financing methods or capital structure. Adjusted EBITDAX is a widely accepted financial indicator of a company's ability to incur and service debt, fund capital expenditures and make payments on its long term loans. Management believes that the presentation of Adjusted EBITDAX provides information useful in assessing the Company's financial condition and results of operations.\nHowever, Adjusted EBITDAX, as defined by Isramco, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. Therefore, Isramco's consolidated Adjusted EBITDAX should be considered in conjunction with income (loss) from operations and other performance measures prepared in accordance with GAAP, such as operating income or cash flow from operating activities. Adjusted EBITDAX has important limitations as an analytical tool because it excludes certain items that affect income from continuing operations and net cash provided by operating activities. Adjusted EBITDAX should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for an analysis of Isramco's results as reported under GAAP. Below is a reconciliation of consolidated Adjusted EBITDAX to income (loss) from operations before income taxes.\nTable 171: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> In thousands\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income (loss) from operations before income taxes (1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 19,811\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 8,523\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (30,239\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Depreciation, depletion, amortization and impairment expense\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 7,208\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 11,196\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 53,648\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest expense, net\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 4,784\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 4,817\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 5,310\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loss (gain) on derivative contract\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (746\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (586\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1,602\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Accretion Expenses\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Consolidated Adjusted EBITDAX\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 31,970\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 24,847\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 31,177\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 172: <table> <tr> <td> (1)\n</td> <td> Including net gain on divestiture $2,703,000 in 2017, $600,000 in 2016, and $8,378,000 in 2015.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nWe discuss recently adopted and issued accounting standards in Item 8.

Our properties are primarily located in Texas, New Mexico and Oklahoma. We act as the operator of most of our U.S. properties. Historically, we have grown through acquisitions, with a focus on properties within our core operating areas that we believe have significant development and exploration opportunities and where we can apply our technical experience and economies of scale to increase production and proved reserves while lowering lease operating costs. In August, 2011 we created a new production services subsidiary that began operations in October 2011. As of December 2017, the subsidiary had 33 deployed production services rigs and various trucks that operate primarily in Texas and New Mexico. The Company provides a full range of production services such as well completion and wellbore maintenance, workover, fluid transportation and plugging and abandonment services.\nOil and Gas Exploration and Production Segment\nOur financial results depend upon many factors, but are largely driven by the volume of our oil and natural gas production and the price that we receive for that production. Our production volumes will decline as reserves are depleted unless we expend capital in successful development and exploration activities or acquire additional properties with existing production. The amount we realize for our production depends predominantly upon commodity prices, which are affected by changes in market demand and supply, as impacted by overall economic activity, weather, pipeline capacity constraints, inventory storage levels, quality, basis differentials and other factors, and secondarily upon our commodity price hedging activities. Accordingly, finding and developing oil and natural gas reserves at economical costs is critical to our long-term success. Our future drilling plans are subject to change based upon various factors, some of which are beyond our control, including drilling results, oil and natural gas prices, the availability and cost of capital, drilling and production costs, availability of drilling services and equipment, gathering system and pipeline transportation constraints and regulatory approvals. To the extent these factors lead to reductions in our drilling plans and associated capital budgets in future periods, our financial position, cash flows and operating results could be adversely impacted.\nWe own all ownership units in Tamar Royalties, LLC, which owns an overriding royalty interest of 1.5375% before payout / 2.7375% after payout in the Tamar Field (collectively the Tamar Royalty\u201d). An overriding royalty interest is an ownership interest in the oil and gas leasehold estate equating to a certain percentage of production or production revenues, calculated free of the costs of production and development of the underlying lease(s), but subject to its proportionate share of certain post production costs. An overriding royalty interest is a non-possessory interest in the oil and gas leasehold estate and, accordingly, we have no control over the operations, drilling, expenses, timing, production, sales, or any other aspect of development or production of the Tamar Field.\nThe Tamar Field project began production in March 2013 and is now operational and delivering natural gas to Israel. The natural gas flows from the Tamar Field through the world's longest subsea tieback, more than 90 miles to the Tamar platform, and then to the Ashdod onshore terminal.\nAs noted above with regard to the payout of the Tamar Field, a disagreement between the Company and Isramco Negev 2 Limited Partnership has emerged as to what costs should be included in the calculation of payout. In addition to actual costs for the development of the Tamar Field, Isramco, Negev 2 Limited Partnership has asserted that the following costs should be included in the calculation of payout: (i) Isramco Negev 2 Limited Partnership's financing costs; (ii) the general and administrative expenses of Isramco Negev 2 Limited Partnership; (iii) the expected decommissioning costs of the Tamar Field; and (iv) expected future payments to be made in respect of the Sheshinsky Levy\u201d under Israeli law. The disagreement primarily stems from the fact that the agreements governing the creation of the Tamar Royalty were formulated in the 1980s and do not have a clear and unequivocal definition as to what costs should be included in the payout calculation. The Company currently believes that the total scope of the disagreement is approximately forty-five million dollars ($45,000,000). Under the terms of the agreements creating the Tamar Royalty, the dispute is subject to arbitration in Israel. The Company believes that the claims of Isramco Negev 2 Limited Partnership are erroneous and contrary to generally accepted industry practice. The Company expects that the matter will be favorably resolved through this arbitration process; however, the Company cannot be assured of a favorable result in this arbitration process.\nDuring year ended December 31, 2017, net sales from the Tamar Field attributable to the Company amounted to 5,343,000 Mcf of natural gas and 6,990 Bbl of condensate with prices of $5.35 per Mcf and $47.46 per Bbl of condensate. Total revenues net of marketing and transportation expenses were $28,781,000. The Israeli Tax Authority withheld $6,907,000 of this revenue.\nDuring year ended December 31, 2016, net sales from the Tamar Field attributable to Isramco amounted to 5,102,000 Mcf of natural gas and 6,882 Bbl of condensate with prices of $5.34 per Mcf and $37.48 per Bbl of condensate. Total revenues net of marketing and transportation expenses were $27,462,000. The Israeli Tax Authority withheld $6,866,000 of this revenue.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, net sales from the Tamar Field attributable to the Company amounted to 4,505,000 Mcf of natural gas and 6,074 Bbl of condensate with prices of $5.52 per Mcf and $46.53 per Bbl of condensate. Total revenues net of marketing and transportation expenses were $25,151,000. The Israeli Tax Authority withheld $6,665,000 of this revenue.\nAt December 31, 2017, our estimated total proved oil, natural gas reserves and natural gas liquids, as prepared by our independent reserve engineering firms, Netherland, Sewell & Associates, Inc. and Cawley, Gillespie & Associates, Inc., were approximately 38,653 thousand barrels of oil equivalent ( MBOE\u201d), consisting of 1,765 thousand barrels (MBbls) of oil, 216,451 million cubic feet (MMcf) of natural gas and 813 thousand barrels (MBbls) of natural gas liquids. Approximately 86.0% of our proved reserves were classified as proved developed (See Note 13, Supplemental Oil and Gas Information\u201d). Full year 2017 production averaged 3.78 MBOE/d compared to 3.80 MBOE/d in 2016. Tamar Field production share amounted to 2.46 MBOE/d out of total 3.78 MBOE/d compared to 2.35 MBOE/d in 2016.\nProduction Services Segment\nOur core businesses depend on our customers' willingness to make expenditures to produce, develop and explore for oil and natural gas in the United States. Industry conditions are influenced by numerous factors, such as the supply of and demand for oil and natural gas, domestic and worldwide economic conditions, political instability in oil producing countries and merger and divestiture activity among oil and natural gas producers. The volatility of the oil and natural gas industry, and the consequent impact on exploration and production activity, could adversely impact the level of workover activity by some of our customers. This volatility also affects the demand for our services and the price of our services. In addition, the discovery rate of new oil and natural gas reserves in our market areas also may have an impact on our business, even in an environment of stronger oil and natural gas prices.\nWe derive a majority of our revenues from services supporting production from existing oil and natural gas operations including in moderate oil and natural gas price environments, ongoing maintenance spending is generally required to sustain production. However, in a low commodity price environment our customers may reduce their budgets resulting in reduced demand for our services. As oil and natural gas prices reach higher levels, demand for all of our services generally increases as our customers engage in more well servicing activities relating to existing wells to maintain or increase oil and natural gas production from those wells. Because our services are required to support drilling and workover activities, our revenues will vary based on changes in capital spending by our customers as oil and natural gas prices increase or decrease.\nThe production services market is highly competitive. Competition is influenced by such factors as price, capacity, availability of work crews, and reputation and experience of the service provider. We believe that an important competitive factor in establishing and maintaining long-term customer relationships is having an experienced, skilled and well-trained work force. We believe many of our larger customers place increased emphasis on the safety, performance and quality of the crews, equipment and services provided by their contractors. Although we believe customers consider all of these factors, price is often the primary factor in determining which service provider is awarded the work. However, in numerous instances, we secure and maintain work from large customers for which efficiency, safety, technology, size of fleet and availability of other services are of equal importance to price.\nThe demand for our services fluctuates, primarily in relation to the price (or anticipated price) of oil and natural gas, which, in turn, is driven primarily by the supply of, and demand for, oil and natural gas. Generally, as supply of those commodities decreases and demand increases, service and maintenance requirements increase as oil and natural gas producers attempt to maximize the productivity of their wells in a higher priced environment. However, in a lower oil and natural gas price environment, demand for service and maintenance generally decreases as oil and natural gas producers decrease their activity. In particular, the demand for new or existing field drilling and completion work is driven by available investment capital for such work. Oil and natural gas producers generally tend to be less risk tolerant when commodity prices are low or volatile, we may experience a more rapid decline in demand for well maintenance services compared with demand for other types of oilfield services. Further, in a low commodity price environment, fewer production services rigs are needed for completions, as these activities are generally associated with drilling activity. The plugging and abandonment work is less affected by prices and generally driven by state regulations and have smaller variations in demand.\nThe level of our revenues, earnings and cash flows are substantially dependent upon, and affected by, the level of U.S. oil and natural gas exploration, development and production activity, as well as the equipment capacity in any particular region.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect our reported results of operations and the amount of reported assets, liabilities and proved oil and natural gas reserves. Some accounting policies involve judgments and uncertainties to such an extent that there is reasonable likelihood that materially different amounts could have been reported under different conditions, or if different assumptions had been used. Actual results may differ from the estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. Described below are the most significant policies we apply in preparing our consolidated financial statements, some of which are subject to alternative treatments under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. We also describe the most significant estimates and assumptions we make in applying these policies.\nOil and Natural Gas Activities\nAccounting for oil and natural gas activities is subject to unique rules. Two generally accepted methods of accounting for oil and natural gas activities are available - successful efforts and full cost. The most significant differences between these two methods are the treatment of unsuccessful exploration costs and the manner in which the carrying value of oil and natural gas properties are amortized and evaluated for impairment. The successful efforts method requires unsuccessful exploration costs to be expensed as they are incurred upon a determination that the well is uneconomical, while the full cost method provides for the capitalization of these costs. Both methods generally provide for the periodic amortization of capitalized costs based on proved reserve quantities. Impairment of oil and natural gas properties under the successful efforts method is based on an evaluation of the carrying value of individual oil and natural gas properties against their estimated fair value, while impairment under the full cost method requires an evaluation of the carrying value of oil and natural gas properties included in a cost center against the net present value of future cash flows from the related proved reserves, using period-end prices and costs and a 10% discount rate. We account for our natural gas and crude oil exploration and production activities under the successful efforts method of accounting.\nProved Oil and Natural Gas Reserves\nIsramco estimates its proved oil and gas reserves as defined by the SEC and the FASB. This definition includes crude oil, natural gas, and NGLs that geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be economically producible in future periods from known reservoirs under existing economic conditions, operating methods, government regulations, etc., i.e., at prices and costs as of the date the estimates are made. Prices include consideration of price changes provided only by contractual arrangements, and do not include adjustments based upon expected future conditions.\nThe Company's estimates of proved reserves are made using available geological and reservoir data, as well as production performance data. These estimates are reviewed annually by our independent reserve engineering firm, Cawley, Gillespie & Associates, Inc and Netherland, Sewell & Associates, Inc. and revised, either upward or downward, as warranted by additional data. Revisions are necessary due to changes in, among other things, reservoir performance, prices, economic conditions, and governmental restrictions, as well as changes in the expected recovery associated with infill drilling. Decreases in prices, for example, may cause a reduction in some proved reserves due to reaching economic limits earlier. A material adverse change in the estimated volumes of proved reserves could have a negative impact on depreciation, depletion and amortization expense (DD&A) and could result in property impairments.\nDepreciation, Depletion and Amortization\nOur rate of recording DD&A is primarily dependent upon our estimate of proved reserves, which is utilized in our unit-of-production method calculation. If the estimates of proved reserves were to be reduced, the rate at which we record DD&A expense would increase, reducing net income. Such a reduction in reserves may result from lower market prices, which may make it non-economic to drill for and produce higher cost reserves.\nOur production services equipment and tools are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is provided for our assets over the estimated depreciable lives of the assets using the straight-line method. We depreciate our operational assets over their depreciable lives to their salvage value, which is a fair value higher than the assets' value as scrap. When we scrap an asset, we accelerate the depreciation of the asset down to its salvage value. When we dispose of an asset, a gain or loss is recognized.\nImpairment\nWe review our property and equipment in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 360, Property, Plant, and Equipment (ASC 360). ASC 360 requires us to evaluate property and equipment as an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the property and equipment below the carrying amount. If the carrying amount of property and equipment is not recoverable from its undiscounted cash flows, then we would recognize an impairment loss for the difference between the carrying amount and the current fair value. Further, we evaluate the remaining useful lives of property and equipment at each reporting period to determine whether events and circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining depreciation periods.\nAsset Retirement Obligations\nWe have significant obligations to remove tangible equipment and facilities associated with our oil and gas wells and to restore land at the end of oil and gas production operations. Our removal and restoration obligations are most often associated with plugging and abandoning wells. Estimating the future restoration and removal costs is difficult and requires us to make estimates and judgments because most of the removal obligations we have will be take effect in the future. Additionally, these operations are subject to private contracts and government regulations that often have vague descriptions of what is required. Asset removal technologies and costs are constantly changing, as are regulatory, political, environmental, safety and public relations considerations. Inherent in the present value calculations are numerous assumptions and judgments including the ultimate removal cost amounts, inflation factors, credit adjusted discount rates, timing of obligations and changes in the legal, regulatory, environmental and political environments.\nAccounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities\nWe have and may utilize derivative contracts to hedge against the variability in cash flows associated with the forecasted sale of our anticipated future oil and natural gas production. We may generally hedge a substantial, but varying, portion of our anticipated oil and natural gas production for the next years. We do not use derivative instruments for trading purposes. We have elected not to apply hedge accounting to our derivative contracts, which would potentially allow us to not record the change in fair value of our derivative contracts in the consolidated statements of operations. We carry our derivatives at fair value on our consolidated balance sheets, with the changes in the fair value included in our consolidated statements of operations in the period in which the change occurs.\nEnvironmental Obligations, Litigation and Other Contingencies\nManagement makes judgments and estimates in accordance with applicable accounting rules when it establishes reserves for environmental remediation, litigation, and other contingent matters. Provisions for such matters are charged to expense when it is probable that a liability is incurred and reasonable estimates of the liability can be made. Estimates of environmental liabilities are based on a variety of matters, including, but not limited to, the stage of investigation, the stage of the remedial design, evaluation of existing remediation technologies, and presently enacted laws and regulations. In future periods, a number of factors could significantly change the Company's estimate of environmental-remediation costs, such as changes in laws and regulations, changes in the interpretation or administration of laws and regulations, revisions to the remedial design, unanticipated construction problems, identification of additional areas or volumes of contaminated soil and groundwater, and changes in costs of labor, equipment, and technology. Consequently, it is not possible for management to reliably estimate the amount and timing of all future expenditures related to environmental or other contingent matters and actual costs may vary significantly from the Company's estimates. The Company's in-house legal counsel regularly assesses these contingent liabilities and, in certain circumstances, consults with third-party legal counsel or consultants to assist in forming the Company's conclusion.\nIncome Taxes and Impact of Tax Reform Legislation\nThe Company follows ASC 740, Income Taxes, (ASC 740), which requires recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the consolidated financial statements or tax returns. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are computed using the liability method based on the differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse.\nA valuation allowance is provided, if necessary, to reserve the amount of net operating loss and net deferred tax assets which the Company may not be able to use because of the expiration of maximum carryover periods allowed under applicable tax codes.\nOn December 22, 2017, the US Congress enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (Tax Reform Legislation), which made significant changes to US federal income tax law affecting us. See Note 5. Income Taxes.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur primary source of cash during the year ended December 31, 2017, was net cash flow from operating activities. We continuously monitor our liquidity and evaluate our development plans in light of a variety of factors, including, but not limited to, our cash flows, capital resources and drilling success.\nOur future capital resources and liquidity may depend, in part, on our success in developing the leasehold interests that we have acquired. Cash is required to fund capital expenditures necessary to offset inherent declines in production and proven reserves, which is typical in the capital-intensive oil and gas industry. Future success in growing reserves and production will be highly dependent on the capital resources available and our success in finding and acquiring additional reserves. Our production services subsidiary also requires capital resources to acquire and maintain equipment. We expect to fund our future capital requirements through internally generated cash flows, and borrowings under loans and the credit facility described below. Long-term cash flows are subject to a number of variables, including the level of production, prices, amount of work orders received, and our commodity price hedging activities, as well as various economic conditions that have historically affected the oil and natural gas industry.\nOn May 18, 2015, Tamar Royalties LLC ( Tamar Royalties\u201d), a newly formed, wholly-owned, special purpose subsidiary of the Company entered into a term loan credit agreement (the DB Facility\u201d) with Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas ( Deutsche Bank\u201d) in the amount of $120,000,000 secured by the Company's interest in the Tamar field. Interest on the borrowing is subject to fluctuations in LIBOR. The Company entered into interest rate swap agreements in relation to this borrowing. The terms of the agreement and swaps are disclosed in Notes 3 and 4.\nOn June 30, 2015, the Company obtained a credit facility (the SG Facility\u201d) with The Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale. The SG facility provided for a commitment by The Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale of $150,000,000, subject to an initial borrowing base of $40,000,000. The tenure of the SG Facility was four (4) years and it was secured by certain onshore United States oil and gas properties. Interest on borrowing was variable as disclosed in Note 4 Long-Term Debt and Interest Expense\u201d. On February 28, 2017 the SG Facility was terminated.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, our cash increased by $3,919,000. Specifically, net cash from operating activities of $18,552,000, was offset by cash used in financing activities of $10,519,000 and cash used in investing activities of $4,114,000.\n(See Item 1A Risk Factors\u201d).\nCommitments and Contingencies\nAs is common within the oil and natural gas industry, we have entered into various commitments and operating agreements related to the exploration and development of and production from proved oil and natural gas properties. It is our belief that such commitments will be met without a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nContractual Obligations: Aggregate maturities of contractual obligations at December 31, 2017 are due in future years as follows (in thousands):\nPrincipal Payments on Long-term debt:\n\nDebt\n\n (1) The amounts are exclusive of accrued interest. \nAt year-end 2017, our total debt was $95,886,000 compared to total debt of $104,588,000 at year-end 2016 and $114,204,000 at year-end 2015.\nBank Loan and Credit Facility\nThe Deutsche Bank Facility\nOn May 18, 2015, Tamar Royalties LLC ( Tamar Royalties\u201d), a newly formed, wholly-owned, special purpose subsidiary of the Company, entered into a term loan credit agreement (the DB Facility\u201d) with Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas ( Deutsche Bank\u201d), as facility agent for the lenders and as collateral agent for the secured parties, and with the lenders party thereto. The DB Facility provides for borrowings in the amount of $120,000,000 on a committed basis and is secured by, among other things, an overriding royalty interest in the Tamar Field, a natural gas field in the Mediterranean Sea, equal to 1.5375% before payout / 2.7375% after payout in the Tamar Field (the Royalty Interest\u201d). In connection with the DB Facility, and pursuant to a royalties sale and contribution agreement, the Company contributed the Royalty Interest to Tamar Royalties in exchange for all of the ownership units of Tamar Royalties. Pursuant to the terms of its governing documents, Tamar Royalties will be managed by N.M.A. Energy Resources Ltd, a related party of the Company, and an independent manager, Donald J. Puglisi.\nPursuant to the terms of the DB Facility, Tamar Royalties borrowed $120,000,000 in its initial borrowing under this facility. The initial borrowing under the DB Facility bears annual interest based on the LIBOR for a three-month interest period plus a spread of 2.75%. The $120,000,000 initial borrowing under the DB Facility will be repaid over eight (8) years commencing July 1, 2015, in accordance with an amortization profile based on projected cash flows from the Royalty Interest. Tamar Royalties's obligations under the Facility are secured by a first ranking pledge of the shares of Tamar Royalties, first ranking pledge of all rights under the agreements creating the Royalty Interest, and a first priority security interest over the accounts created under the DB Facility.\nSo long as any amounts remain outstanding to the Lenders under the DB Facility, Tamar Royalties must, from and after the end of the Availability Period (as defined in the DB Facility), have a Historical Debt Service Coverage Ratio (as defined in the DB Facility) of not less than 1.00:1.00, a Loan Life Coverage Ratio (as defined in the DB Facility) of at least 1.1:1.00, and maintain a Required Reserve Amount (as defined in the DB Facility). In addition, Tamar Royalties is required under the DB facility to hedge against fluctuations in LIBOR as reflected in Note 3 Financial Instruments and Fair Value\u201d.\nThe amortization schedule under the DB Facility was based on the projection that the Investment Repayment Date (as defined therein) would occur at some point before the end of the first quarter of 2018 and therefore, commencing from the Payment Date occurring on 1st April 2018, the amounts to be repaid on each payment date under the credit agreement increase to reflect the expected increase in the Royalties Receivables (as defined therein) as a result of the increase in the royalty percentage following the Investment Repayment Date.\nAs noted above with regard to the payout of the Tamar Field, a disagreement between Tamar Royalties and Isramco Negev 2 Limited Partnership has emerged as to whether certain items may be included in the calculation of payout. The disagreement largely stems from the fact that the agreements governing the creation of the Tamar Royalty were formulated in the 1980s and do not have a clear and unequivocal definition as to what costs should be included in the payout calculation. The Company currently believes that the total scope of the disagreement is approximately forty five million dollars ($45,000,000). Under the terms of the agreements creating the Tamar Royalty, the dispute is subject to arbitration in Israel. The Company expects that the matter will be resolved through this arbitration process. However, the Company cannot be assured of a favorable result resulting from this arbitration process. Accordingly, the Company continues to receive royalty payments at the lower rates as if the Investment Repayment Date has not occurred.\nTherefore, as a result of the dispute with the Isramco Negev 2, Tamar Royalties will have a shortfall in its Royalties Receivables for the period (or part of the period) between 1st April 2018 and 1st April 2019, by which time, even if the Isramco Negev 2's claims regarding the Investment Repayment Date are accepted, the Investment Repayment Date is expected to occur.\nAs a result, the Company believes Tamar Royalites required an additional $15,600,000 USD to cover payments under the amortization schedule of the DB Facility (the Shortfall\u201d), and the Company believes that curing the Shortfall was in the best interest of both Isramco Inc. and Tamar Royalties. Therefore, Isramco Inc. contributed the expected amount of the Shortfall, being $15,600,000 USD, to Tamar Royalties as an additional capital contribution and such contribution was made pursuant to the terms and conditions of that certain Consent and Agreement dated February 27, 2018, between and among Tamar Royalties, as Borrower, Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, as Facility Agent and Collateral Agent, and the Lenders party thereto. As a result of the aforementioned contribution, together with the terms and conditions of the aforementioned consent and assignment, Tamar Royalties remains in compliance with all covenants of the DB Facility.\nIn 2015 the Company incurred debt costs in obtaining the facility in the amount of $2,011,000 and $2,959,000 in fees were retained by the lenders. These costs totaling $4,970,000 were recorded as a reduction of the principal loan balance and are being amortized over the life of the loan using the effective interest method. Amortization of these costs for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015 totaled $789,000, $820,000, and $402,000 respectively.\nIn connection with the DB Facility, the Company and Tamar Royalties entered into an Intercompany Loan Agreement dated May 18, 2015 (the Intercompany Loan Agreement\u201d). Pursuant to the terms of the Intercompany Loan Agreement, Tamar Royalties LLC provided a loan to the Company in an aggregate principal amount of $108,000,000 USD. The purpose of the Intercompany Loan was to repay indebtedness owed by the Company to related parties, to enable acquisitions and capital expenditures by the Company, and for other general corporate purposes of the Company.\nAs of December 31, 2017, Tamar Royalties was in compliance with the financial covenants required under the DB Facility.\nThe Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale Facility\nOn June 30, 2015, Isramco Onshore LLC ( Isramco Onshore\u201d), a newly formed, wholly-owned, subsidiary of Isramco, Inc. (the Company\u201d), entered into a secured Credit Agreement (the SG Facility\u201d) with The Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, as Administrative Agent and Issuing Lender, SG Americas Securities LLC, as Sole Bookrunner, Lead Arranger and Documentation Agent, and the lenders party thereto from time to time, as Lenders. The SG Facility provides for a commitment by The Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale of $150,000,000, subject to an initial borrowing base of $40,000,000. The tenure of the SG Facility was four (4) years and the SG Facility was secured by certain onshore United States oil and gas properties. Pricing under the SG Facility was as follows: (i) for EuroDollar Rate (as defined in the SG Facility) loans range from the EuroDollar rate plus 1.75% to the EuroDollar rate plus 2.75% depending on borrowing base utilization; and (ii) for Reference Rate (as defined in the SG Facility) loans ranges from the Reference Rate plus 0.75% to the Reference Rate Spread plus 1.75% based on borrowing base utilization; (iii) a quarterly commitment fee (as defined in the SG Facility) ranging from an annual rate of 0.38% to 0.5% of the undrawn borrowing base.\nThe SG Facility provided that Isramco Onshore hedge at least seventy-five percent (75%) of its crude oil production before borrowing under the SG Facility. As of December 31, 2017 and as of the date of issuance Isramco Onshore has not entered into such hedge agreements nor has it made a draw under the SG Facility. The Company incurred $478,000 of financing costs in relation to this credit facility which were capitalized as a long-term asset and amortized over the term on the agreement on a straight-line basis until December 31, 2016 at which time the remaining balance totaling $299,000 was expensed.\nIsramco Onshore had various financial and operating covenants required by the SG Facility, including, among other things, the requirement that, during the term of the SG Facility, Isramco Onshore must have a Minimum Current Ratio (as defined in the SG Facility) of not less than 1.00:1.00, a Maximum Leverage Ratio (as defined in the SG Facility) of not less than 4.00:1.00 and a Minimum Interest Coverage Ratio (as defined in the SG Facility) of at least 2.50:1.00. In addition, the SG Facility provided for customary events of default, including, but not limited to, payment defaults, breach of representations or covenants, bankruptcy events and change of control.\nOn August 18, 2016 as a result of semi-annual borrowing base redetermination the borrowing base under SG Facility was reduced to zero. On February 28, 2017 the SG Facility was terminated.\nRelated Party Debt\nA discussion of the Company's related party debt previously outstanding in fiscal year 2015 is set forth below. On June 27, 2015 the Company used a portion of the proceeds secured from the DB Facility to repay the then-outstanding principal and interest balances of the related party debt discussed below. The final payment totaled $101,022,000 which included loan principal payments totaling $93,395,000 and interest payments totaling $7,267,000. The remaining portion of the payment equal to $360,000 repaid related party payables. As result, all such related party debt was repaid and the outstanding balance as of December 31, 2015, 2016 and 2017 was zero.\nI.O.C. Israel Oil Company, Ltd. ( IOC\u201d)\nOn February 27, 2007, Isramco obtained a loan in the principal amount of $12,000,000 from IOC, repayable at the end of five years. Interest accrues at a per annum rate of LIBOR plus 6%. Principal is due and payable in four equal annual installments, commencing on the second anniversary of the loan. Accrued interest is payable in equal annual installments. At any time Isramco can make prepayments without premium or penalty. The loan is not secured.\nIn July 2009, the Company entered into a loan transaction with IOC, a related party, pursuant to which the Company borrowed $6 million (the IOC Loan\u201d). Amounts outstanding under the IOC Loan bear interest at LIBOR plus 6.0%. The IOC Loan matures in five years, with accrued interest payable annually on each anniversary date of the loan. The IOC Loan may be prepaid at any time without penalty.\nEffective February 1, 2009, the loan from IOC was amended and restated to extend the payment deadlines arising on and after February 2009, by two years.\nOn March 3, 2011, the Company entered into a Loan Agreement with IOC pursuant to which it borrowed the sum of $11,000,000.

Mr. Haim Tsuff, Isramco's Co-Chief Executive Officer and Chairman, is a controlling shareholder of JOEL.\nAs noted above, on June 27, 2015 the Company used a portion of the proceeds secured from the DB Facility to repay the then-outstanding principal and interest balances of the related party debt. Accordingly, the JOEL debts have been paid in full.\nIsramco also had related party payables of $60,000 and $90,000 as of December 31, 2017 and 2016 respectively which are included with short term related party debt on the balance sheets.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAt December 31, 2017, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements.\nCash Flow\nOur primary source of cash in 2017 was cash flow from operating activities. In 2017, cash received from operations and proceeds from sale of oil and gas properties was primarily used for repayment of long-term debt, short-term debt, investments in equipment and an increase in restricted cash.\nOur primary source of cash in 2016 was cash flow from operating activities. In 2016, cash received from operations and proceeds from sale of oil and gas properties was primarily used for repayment of long-term debt, short-term debt, investments in equipment and an increase in restricted cash.\nOur primary source of cash in 2015 was cash flow from financing activities. In 2015, net cash received from bank loans, sales of property, and operating activities was primarily used to replay related party loans and short-term debt, increase restricted cash, and investment in equipment for our production services subsidiary and oil and gas properties.\nOperating cash flow fluctuations were substantially driven by changes in commodity prices and changes in our production volumes. Working capital was substantially influenced by these variables. Fluctuation in commodity prices and our overall cash flow may result in an increase or decrease in our future capital expenditures. Prices for oil and natural gas have historically been subject to seasonal fluctuations characterized by peak demand and higher prices in the winter heating season; however, the impact of other risks and uncertainties have influenced prices throughout recent years. See Results of Operations below for a review of the impact of prices and volumes on sales.\n\nOperating Activities, Net cash flows provided by operating activities were $18,552,000, $15,510,000, and $8,911,000 for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Key drivers of net operating cash flows are commodity prices, production volumes, operating costs, proceeds from an overriding royalty interest in the Tamar Field and activities of our production services subsidiary.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the same period in 2016, net cash flow provided by operating activities increased by $3,042,000 to $18,552,000.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to the same period in 2015, net cash flow provided by operating activities increased by $6,599,000 to $15,510,000.\nWe are unable to predict future production levels, future commodity prices, future proceeds from our Tamar Field royalties, and future revenues generated by our production services segment; therefore, we cannot predict future levels of net cash provided by operating activities.\nInvesting Activities, Net cash flows used in investing activities for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 were $4,114,000 and $807,000, respectively. During 2017 and 2016 the Company invested in equipment and oil and gas properties in amounts equal to $4,184,000 ($615,000 in oil and gas properties and $3,569,000 in production services equipment) and $794,000 ($157,000 in oil and gas properties and $637,000 in production services equipment) respectively. During 2017 the Company increased restricted cash by $2,653,000, received $2,705,000 from the sale of oil and gas properties, invested $31,000 in a LLC, and received $49,000 from the sale of equipment.\nNet cash flows used in investing activities for the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 were $807,000 and $4,680,000, respectively. During 2016 and 2015 the Company invested in equipment and oil and gas properties in amounts equal to $794,000 ($157,000 in oil and gas properties and $637,000 in production services equipment) and $4,883,000 ($2,292,000 in oil and gas properties and $2,591,000 in production services equipment) respectively. During 2016 the Company increased restricted cash by $557,000, received $600,000 from the sale of oil and gas properties, invested $133,000 in a LLC, and received $77,000 from the sale of equipment.\nFinancing Activities, Net cash flows used in financing activities were $10,519,000 and $10,691,000 for the year ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. In 2017, the Company made $9,600,000 in principal loan payments. The Company also repaid short-term insurance financing of $911,000.\nNet cash flows provided by (used in) financing activities were ($10,691,000) and $15,820,000 for the year ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. In 2016, the Company made $9,000,000 in principal loan payments. The Company also repaid short-term insurance financing of $1,341,000, and decreased bank overdraft by $350,000.\nResults of Continuing Operations\nSelected Data\n\n (1) See Adjusted EBITDAX for a description of Adjusted EBITDAX, which is not a Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) measure, and a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDAX to income from operations before income taxes, which is presented in accordance with GAAP. \nFinancial Results\nNet Income (Loss)\nIn 2017 our net loss was $(24,310,000), or $(8.95) per share. This compares to net income of $6,745,000, or $2.48 per share for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nThis decrease in income is primarily due to the increase in allowance for foreign tax credit and deferred tax assets. We fully allowed for our accumulated future tax credit related to the taxes withheld by the Israeli taxing authorities. The valuation allowance amounted to $28,677,000. Total foreign tax credit balance was written off after the passing of new tax legislation of New Tax Reform in the United States which lowered the corporate tax rate to a level that eliminated the forecasted usage of the accumulated foreign tax credit. Likewise we increased our allowance to fully allow for our deferred tax assets see Item 5 Income Tax. This increase in tax expense was partially offset by increased revenues from our United States based production operations, increased revenues from the Tamar field, increased revenues from production service activities, and an increased in gain on divestiture.\nIn 2016 our net income was $6,745,000, or $2.48 per share. This compares to net loss of $(17,310,000), or $(6.37) per share for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nThis increase was primarily due to the decrease in impairment expense from $43,704,000 in 2015 to $4,529,000 in 2016. Additionally lease operating expenses decreased by $5,903,000 from $14,828,000 in 2015 to $8,925,000 in 2016 and Tamar Field proceeds increased by $2,311,000 from $25,151,000 in 2015 to $27,462,000 in 2016. This increase was offset by decreased revenues from our US based oil and gas assets and production services subsidiary which was driven by decrease in natural gas and crude oil prices which in turn reduced demand for our production services; and lower sales volumes of oil, natural gas and NGLs. Additionally the increase in net income was offset lower gain on divestiture, $600,000 in 2016 as compared to $8,378,000 in 2015.\nRevenues, Volumes and Average Prices Oil and Gas Segment - Israel\nDuring year ended December 31, 2017, net sales from the Tamar Field attributable to the Company amounted to 5,343,000 Mcf of natural gas and 6,990 Bbl of condensate with prices of $5.35 per Mcf and $47.46 per Bbl of condensate. Total revenues net of marketing and transportation expenses were $28,781,000. The Israeli Tax Authority withheld $6,907,000 of this revenue.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, net sales from the Tamar Field attributable to the Company amounted to 5,102,000 Mcf of natural gas and 6,882 Bbl of condensate with prices of $5.34 per Mcf and $37.48 per Bbl of condensate. Total revenues net of marketing and transportation expenses were $27,462,000. The Israeli Tax Authority withheld $6,866,000, of this revenue.\nDuring year ended December 31, 2015, net sales from the Tamar Field attributable to the Company amounted to 4,505,000 Mcf of natural gas and 6,074 Bbl of condensate with prices of $5.52 per Mcf and $46.53 per Bbl of condensate. Total revenues net of marketing and transportation expenses were $25,151,000. The Israeli Tax Authority withheld $6,665,000 of this revenue.\nRevenues, Volumes and Average Prices Oil and Gas Segment - United States\nSales Revenues\n", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7.

THESE STATEMENTS ARE ONLY PREDICTIONS. OUR ACTUAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THOSE ANTICIPATED IN THESE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS AS A RESULT OF A VARIETY OF FACTORS, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THOSE SET FORTH UNDER RISK FACTORS\u201d AND ELSEWHERE IN THIS FORM 10-K.\nOverview\nWe are an independent oil and natural gas company engaged in the exploration, development, and production of oil and natural gas properties located onshore in the United States and an owner of various royalty interests offshore Israel. Our properties are primarily located in Texas, New Mexico and Oklahoma. We act as the operator of most of our U.S. properties. Historically, we have grown through acquisitions, with a focus on properties within our core operating areas that we believe have significant development and exploration opportunities and where we can apply our technical experience and economies of scale to increase production and proved reserves while lowering lease operating costs. In August, 2011 we created a new production services subsidiary that began operations in October 2011. As of December 2017, the subsidiary had 33 deployed production services rigs and various trucks that operate primarily in Texas and New Mexico. The Company provides a full range of production services such as well completion and wellbore maintenance, workover, fluid transportation and plugging and abandonment services.\nOil and Gas Exploration and Production Segment\nOur financial results depend upon many factors, but are largely driven by the volume of our oil and natural gas production and the price that we receive for that production. Our production volumes will decline as reserves are depleted unless we expend capital in successful development and exploration activities or acquire additional properties with existing production. The amount we realize for our production depends predominantly upon commodity prices, which are affected by changes in market demand and supply, as impacted by overall economic activity, weather, pipeline capacity constraints, inventory storage levels, quality, basis differentials and other factors, and secondarily upon our commodity price hedging activities. Accordingly, finding and developing oil and natural gas reserves at economical costs is critical to our long-term success. Our future drilling plans are subject to change based upon various factors, some of which are beyond our control, including drilling results, oil and natural gas prices, the availability and cost of capital, drilling and production costs, availability of drilling services and equipment, gathering system and pipeline transportation constraints and regulatory approvals. To the extent these factors lead to reductions in our drilling plans and associated capital budgets in future periods, our financial position, cash flows and operating results could be adversely impacted.\nWe own all ownership units in Tamar Royalties, LLC, which owns an overriding royalty interest of 1.5375% before payout / 2.7375% after payout in the Tamar Field (collectively the Tamar Royalty\u201d). An overriding royalty interest is an ownership interest in the oil and gas leasehold estate equating to a certain percentage of production or production revenues, calculated free of the costs of production and development of the underlying lease(s), but subject to its proportionate share of certain post production costs. An overriding royalty interest is a non-possessory interest in the oil and gas leasehold estate and, accordingly, we have no control over the operations, drilling, expenses, timing, production, sales, or any other aspect of development or production of the Tamar Field.\nThe Tamar Field project began production in March 2013 and is now operational and delivering natural gas to Israel. The natural gas flows from the Tamar Field through the world's longest subsea tieback, more than 90 miles to the Tamar platform, and then to the Ashdod onshore terminal.\nAs noted above with regard to the payout of the Tamar Field, a disagreement between the Company and Isramco Negev 2 Limited Partnership has emerged as to what costs should be included in the calculation of payout. In addition to actual costs for the development of the Tamar Field, Isramco, Negev 2 Limited Partnership has asserted that the following costs should be included in the calculation of payout: (i) Isramco Negev 2 Limited Partnership's financing costs; (ii) the general and administrative expenses of Isramco Negev 2 Limited Partnership; (iii) the expected decommissioning costs of the Tamar Field; and (iv) expected future payments to be made in respect of the Sheshinsky Levy\u201d under Israeli law. The disagreement primarily stems from the fact that the agreements governing the creation of the Tamar Royalty were formulated in the 1980s and do not have a clear and unequivocal definition as to what costs should be included in the payout calculation. The Company currently believes that the total scope of the disagreement is approximately forty-five million dollars ($45,000,000). Under the terms of the agreements creating the Tamar Royalty, the dispute is subject to arbitration in Israel. The Company believes that the claims of Isramco Negev 2 Limited Partnership are erroneous and contrary to generally accepted industry practice. The Company expects that the matter will be favorably resolved through this arbitration process; however, the Company cannot be assured of a favorable result in this arbitration process.\nDuring year ended December 31, 2017, net sales from the Tamar Field attributable to the Company amounted to 5,343,000 Mcf of natural gas and 6,990 Bbl of condensate with prices of $5.35 per Mcf and $47.46 per Bbl of condensate. Total revenues net of marketing and transportation expenses were $28,781,000. The Israeli Tax Authority withheld $6,907,000 of this revenue.\nDuring year ended December 31, 2016, net sales from the Tamar Field attributable to Isramco amounted to 5,102,000 Mcf of natural gas and 6,882 Bbl of condensate with prices of $5.34 per Mcf and $37.48 per Bbl of condensate. Total revenues net of marketing and transportation expenses were $27,462,000. The Israeli Tax Authority withheld $6,866,000 of this revenue.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, net sales from the Tamar Field attributable to the Company amounted to 4,505,000 Mcf of natural gas and 6,074 Bbl of condensate with prices of $5.52 per Mcf and $46.53 per Bbl of condensate. Total revenues net of marketing and transportation expenses were $25,151,000. The Israeli Tax Authority withheld $6,665,000 of this revenue.\nAt December 31, 2017, our estimated total proved oil, natural gas reserves and natural gas liquids, as prepared by our independent reserve engineering firms, Netherland, Sewell & Associates, Inc. and Cawley, Gillespie & Associates, Inc., were approximately 38,653 thousand barrels of oil equivalent ( MBOE\u201d), consisting of 1,765 thousand barrels (MBbls) of oil, 216,451 million cubic feet (MMcf) of natural gas and 813 thousand barrels (MBbls) of natural gas liquids. Approximately 86.0% of our proved reserves were classified as proved developed (See Note 13, Supplemental Oil and Gas Information\u201d). Full year 2017 production averaged 3.78 MBOE/d compared to 3.80 MBOE/d in 2016. Tamar Field production share amounted to 2.46 MBOE/d out of total 3.78 MBOE/d compared to 2.35 MBOE/d in 2016.\nProduction Services Segment\nOur core businesses depend on our customers' willingness to make expenditures to produce, develop and explore for oil and natural gas in the United States. Industry conditions are influenced by numerous factors, such as the supply of and demand for oil and natural gas, domestic and worldwide economic conditions, political instability in oil producing countries and merger and divestiture activity among oil and natural gas producers. The volatility of the oil and natural gas industry, and the consequent impact on exploration and production activity, could adversely impact the level of workover activity by some of our customers. This volatility also affects the demand for our services and the price of our services. In addition, the discovery rate of new oil and natural gas reserves in our market areas also may have an impact on our business, even in an environment of stronger oil and natural gas prices.\nWe derive a majority of our revenues from services supporting production from existing oil and natural gas operations including in moderate oil and natural gas price environments, ongoing maintenance spending is generally required to sustain production. However, in a low commodity price environment our customers may reduce their budgets resulting in reduced demand for our services. As oil and natural gas prices reach higher levels, demand for all of our services generally increases as our customers engage in more well servicing activities relating to existing wells to maintain or increase oil and natural gas production from those wells. Because our services are required to support drilling and workover activities, our revenues will vary based on changes in capital spending by our customers as oil and natural gas prices increase or decrease.\nThe production services market is highly competitive. Competition is influenced by such factors as price, capacity, availability of work crews, and reputation and experience of the service provider. We believe that an important competitive factor in establishing and maintaining long-term customer relationships is having an experienced, skilled and well-trained work force. We believe many of our larger customers place increased emphasis on the safety, performance and quality of the crews, equipment and services provided by their contractors. Although we believe customers consider all of these factors, price is often the primary factor in determining which service provider is awarded the work. However, in numerous instances, we secure and maintain work from large customers for which efficiency, safety, technology, size of fleet and availability of other services are of equal importance to price.\nThe demand for our services fluctuates, primarily in relation to the price (or anticipated price) of oil and natural gas, which, in turn, is driven primarily by the supply of, and demand for, oil and natural gas. Generally, as supply of those commodities decreases and demand increases, service and maintenance requirements increase as oil and natural gas producers attempt to maximize the productivity of their wells in a higher priced environment. However, in a lower oil and natural gas price environment, demand for service and maintenance generally decreases as oil and natural gas producers decrease their activity. In particular, the demand for new or existing field drilling and completion work is driven by available investment capital for such work. Oil and natural gas producers generally tend to be less risk tolerant when commodity prices are low or volatile, we may experience a more rapid decline in demand for well maintenance services compared with demand for other types of oilfield services. Further, in a low commodity price environment, fewer production services rigs are needed for completions, as these activities are generally associated with drilling activity. The plugging and abandonment work is less affected by prices and generally driven by state regulations and have smaller variations in demand.\nThe level of our revenues, earnings and cash flows are substantially dependent upon, and affected by, the level of U.S. oil and natural gas exploration, development and production activity, as well as the equipment capacity in any particular region.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect our reported results of operations and the amount of reported assets, liabilities and proved oil and natural gas reserves. Some accounting policies involve judgments and uncertainties to such an extent that there is reasonable likelihood that materially different amounts could have been reported under different conditions, or if different assumptions had been used. Actual results may differ from the estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. Described below are the most significant policies we apply in preparing our consolidated financial statements, some of which are subject to alternative treatments under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. We also describe the most significant estimates and assumptions we make in applying these policies.\nOil and Natural Gas Activities\nAccounting for oil and natural gas activities is subject to unique rules. Two generally accepted methods of accounting for oil and natural gas activities are available - successful efforts and full cost. The most significant differences between these two methods are the treatment of unsuccessful exploration costs and the manner in which the carrying value of oil and natural gas properties are amortized and evaluated for impairment. The successful efforts method requires unsuccessful exploration costs to be expensed as they are incurred upon a determination that the well is uneconomical, while the full cost method provides for the capitalization of these costs. Both methods generally provide for the periodic amortization of capitalized costs based on proved reserve quantities. Impairment of oil and natural gas properties under the successful efforts method is based on an evaluation of the carrying value of individual oil and natural gas properties against their estimated fair value, while impairment under the full cost method requires an evaluation of the carrying value of oil and natural gas properties included in a cost center against the net present value of future cash flows from the related proved reserves, using period-end prices and costs and a 10% discount rate. We account for our natural gas and crude oil exploration and production activities under the successful efforts method of accounting.\nProved Oil and Natural Gas Reserves\nIsramco estimates its proved oil and gas reserves as defined by the SEC and the FASB. This definition includes crude oil, natural gas, and NGLs that geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be economically producible in future periods from known reservoirs under existing economic conditions, operating methods, government regulations, etc., i.e., at prices and costs as of the date the estimates are made. Prices include consideration of price changes provided only by contractual arrangements, and do not include adjustments based upon expected future conditions.\nThe Company's estimates of proved reserves are made using available geological and reservoir data, as well as production performance data. These estimates are reviewed annually by our independent reserve engineering firm, Cawley, Gillespie & Associates, Inc and Netherland, Sewell & Associates, Inc. and revised, either upward or downward, as warranted by additional data. Revisions are necessary due to changes in, among other things, reservoir performance, prices, economic conditions, and governmental restrictions, as well as changes in the expected recovery associated with infill drilling. Decreases in prices, for example, may cause a reduction in some proved reserves due to reaching economic limits earlier. A material adverse change in the estimated volumes of proved reserves could have a negative impact on depreciation, depletion and amortization expense (DD&A) and could result in property impairments.\nDepreciation, Depletion and Amortization\nOur rate of recording DD&A is primarily dependent upon our estimate of proved reserves, which is utilized in our unit-of-production method calculation. If the estimates of proved reserves were to be reduced, the rate at which we record DD&A expense would increase, reducing net income. Such a reduction in reserves may result from lower market prices, which may make it non-economic to drill for and produce higher cost reserves.\nOur production services equipment and tools are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is provided for our assets over the estimated depreciable lives of the assets using the straight-line method. We depreciate our operational assets over their depreciable lives to their salvage value, which is a fair value higher than the assets' value as scrap. When we scrap an asset, we accelerate the depreciation of the asset down to its salvage value. When we dispose of an asset, a gain or loss is recognized.\nImpairment\nWe review our property and equipment in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 360, Property, Plant, and Equipment (ASC 360). ASC 360 requires us to evaluate property and equipment as an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the property and equipment below the carrying amount. If the carrying amount of property and equipment is not recoverable from its undiscounted cash flows, then we would recognize an impairment loss for the difference between the carrying amount and the current fair value. Further, we evaluate the remaining useful lives of property and equipment at each reporting period to determine whether events and circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining depreciation periods.\nAsset Retirement Obligations\nWe have significant obligations to remove tangible equipment and facilities associated with our oil and gas wells and to restore land at the end of oil and gas production operations. Our removal and restoration obligations are most often associated with plugging and abandoning wells. Estimating the future restoration and removal costs is difficult and requires us to make estimates and judgments because most of the removal obligations we have will be take effect in the future. Additionally, these operations are subject to private contracts and government regulations that often have vague descriptions of what is required. Asset removal technologies and costs are constantly changing, as are regulatory, political, environmental, safety and public relations considerations. Inherent in the present value calculations are numerous assumptions and judgments including the ultimate removal cost amounts, inflation factors, credit adjusted discount rates, timing of obligations and changes in the legal, regulatory, environmental and political environments.\nAccounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities\nWe have and may utilize derivative contracts to hedge against the variability in cash flows associated with the forecasted sale of our anticipated future oil and natural gas production. We may generally hedge a substantial, but varying, portion of our anticipated oil and natural gas production for the next years. We do not use derivative instruments for trading purposes. We have elected not to apply hedge accounting to our derivative contracts, which would potentially allow us to not record the change in fair value of our derivative contracts in the consolidated statements of operations. We carry our derivatives at fair value on our consolidated balance sheets, with the changes in the fair value included in our consolidated statements of operations in the period in which the change occurs.\nEnvironmental Obligations, Litigation and Other Contingencies\nManagement makes judgments and estimates in accordance with applicable accounting rules when it establishes reserves for environmental remediation, litigation, and other contingent matters. Provisions for such matters are charged to expense when it is probable that a liability is incurred and reasonable estimates of the liability can be made. Estimates of environmental liabilities are based on a variety of matters, including, but not limited to, the stage of investigation, the stage of the remedial design, evaluation of existing remediation technologies, and presently enacted laws and regulations. In future periods, a number of factors could significantly change the Company's estimate of environmental-remediation costs, such as changes in laws and regulations, changes in the interpretation or administration of laws and regulations, revisions to the remedial design, unanticipated construction problems, identification of additional areas or volumes of contaminated soil and groundwater, and changes in costs of labor, equipment, and technology. Consequently, it is not possible for management to reliably estimate the amount and timing of all future expenditures related to environmental or other contingent matters and actual costs may vary significantly from the Company's estimates. The Company's in-house legal counsel regularly assesses these contingent liabilities and, in certain circumstances, consults with third-party legal counsel or consultants to assist in forming the Company's conclusion.\nIncome Taxes and Impact of Tax Reform Legislation\nThe Company follows ASC 740, Income Taxes, (ASC 740), which requires recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the consolidated financial statements or tax returns. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are computed using the liability method based on the differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse.\nA valuation allowance is provided, if necessary, to reserve the amount of net operating loss and net deferred tax assets which the Company may not be able to use because of the expiration of maximum carryover periods allowed under applicable tax codes.\nOn December 22, 2017, the US Congress enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (Tax Reform Legislation), which made significant changes to US federal income tax law affecting us. See Note 5. Income Taxes.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur primary source of cash during the year ended December 31, 2017, was net cash flow from operating activities. We continuously monitor our liquidity and evaluate our development plans in light of a variety of factors, including, but not limited to, our cash flows, capital resources and drilling success.\nOur future capital resources and liquidity may depend, in part, on our success in developing the leasehold interests that we have acquired. Cash is required to fund capital expenditures necessary to offset inherent declines in production and proven reserves, which is typical in the capital-intensive oil and gas industry. Future success in growing reserves and production will be highly dependent on the capital resources available and our success in finding and acquiring additional reserves. Our production services subsidiary also requires capital resources to acquire and maintain equipment. We expect to fund our future capital requirements through internally generated cash flows, and borrowings under loans and the credit facility described below. Long-term cash flows are subject to a number of variables, including the level of production, prices, amount of work orders received, and our commodity price hedging activities, as well as various economic conditions that have historically affected the oil and natural gas industry.\nOn May 18, 2015, Tamar Royalties LLC ( Tamar Royalties\u201d), a newly formed, wholly-owned, special purpose subsidiary of the Company entered into a term loan credit agreement (the DB Facility\u201d) with Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas ( Deutsche Bank\u201d) in the amount of $120,000,000 secured by the Company's interest in the Tamar field. Interest on the borrowing is subject to fluctuations in LIBOR. The Company entered into interest rate swap agreements in relation to this borrowing. The terms of the agreement and swaps are disclosed in Notes 3 and 4.\nOn June 30, 2015, the Company obtained a credit facility (the SG Facility\u201d) with The Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale. The SG facility provided for a commitment by The Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale of $150,000,000, subject to an initial borrowing base of $40,000,000. The tenure of the SG Facility was four (4) years and it was secured by certain onshore United States oil and gas properties. Interest on borrowing was variable as disclosed in Note 4 Long-Term Debt and Interest Expense\u201d.

The DB Facility provides for borrowings in the amount of $120,000,000 on a committed basis and is secured by, among other things, an overriding royalty interest in the Tamar Field, a natural gas field in the Mediterranean Sea, equal to 1.5375% before payout / 2.7375% after payout in the Tamar Field (the Royalty Interest\u201d). In connection with the DB Facility, and pursuant to a royalties sale and contribution agreement, the Company contributed the Royalty Interest to Tamar Royalties in exchange for all of the ownership units of Tamar Royalties. Pursuant to the terms of its governing documents, Tamar Royalties will be managed by N.M.A. Energy Resources Ltd, a related party of the Company, and an independent manager, Donald J. Puglisi.\nPursuant to the terms of the DB Facility, Tamar Royalties borrowed $120,000,000 in its initial borrowing under this facility. The initial borrowing under the DB Facility bears annual interest based on the LIBOR for a three-month interest period plus a spread of 2.75%. The $120,000,000 initial borrowing under the DB Facility will be repaid over eight (8) years commencing July 1, 2015, in accordance with an amortization profile based on projected cash flows from the Royalty Interest. Tamar Royalties's obligations under the Facility are secured by a first ranking pledge of the shares of Tamar Royalties, first ranking pledge of all rights under the agreements creating the Royalty Interest, and a first priority security interest over the accounts created under the DB Facility.\nSo long as any amounts remain outstanding to the Lenders under the DB Facility, Tamar Royalties must, from and after the end of the Availability Period (as defined in the DB Facility), have a Historical Debt Service Coverage Ratio (as defined in the DB Facility) of not less than 1.00:1.00, a Loan Life Coverage Ratio (as defined in the DB Facility) of at least 1.1:1.00, and maintain a Required Reserve Amount (as defined in the DB Facility). In addition, Tamar Royalties is required under the DB facility to hedge against fluctuations in LIBOR as reflected in Note 3 Financial Instruments and Fair Value\u201d.\nThe amortization schedule under the DB Facility was based on the projection that the Investment Repayment Date (as defined therein) would occur at some point before the end of the first quarter of 2018 and therefore, commencing from the Payment Date occurring on 1st April 2018, the amounts to be repaid on each payment date under the credit agreement increase to reflect the expected increase in the Royalties Receivables (as defined therein) as a result of the increase in the royalty percentage following the Investment Repayment Date.\nAs noted above with regard to the payout of the Tamar Field, a disagreement between Tamar Royalties and Isramco Negev 2 Limited Partnership has emerged as to whether certain items may be included in the calculation of payout. The disagreement largely stems from the fact that the agreements governing the creation of the Tamar Royalty were formulated in the 1980s and do not have a clear and unequivocal definition as to what costs should be included in the payout calculation. The Company currently believes that the total scope of the disagreement is approximately forty five million dollars ($45,000,000). Under the terms of the agreements creating the Tamar Royalty, the dispute is subject to arbitration in Israel. The Company expects that the matter will be resolved through this arbitration process. However, the Company cannot be assured of a favorable result resulting from this arbitration process. Accordingly, the Company continues to receive royalty payments at the lower rates as if the Investment Repayment Date has not occurred.\nTherefore, as a result of the dispute with the Isramco Negev 2, Tamar Royalties will have a shortfall in its Royalties Receivables for the period (or part of the period) between 1st April 2018 and 1st April 2019, by which time, even if the Isramco Negev 2's claims regarding the Investment Repayment Date are accepted, the Investment Repayment Date is expected to occur.\nAs a result, the Company believes Tamar Royalites required an additional $15,600,000 USD to cover payments under the amortization schedule of the DB Facility (the Shortfall\u201d), and the Company believes that curing the Shortfall was in the best interest of both Isramco Inc. and Tamar Royalties. Therefore, Isramco Inc. contributed the expected amount of the Shortfall, being $15,600,000 USD, to Tamar Royalties as an additional capital contribution and such contribution was made pursuant to the terms and conditions of that certain Consent and Agreement dated February 27, 2018, between and among Tamar Royalties, as Borrower, Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, as Facility Agent and Collateral Agent, and the Lenders party thereto. As a result of the aforementioned contribution, together with the terms and conditions of the aforementioned consent and assignment, Tamar Royalties remains in compliance with all covenants of the DB Facility.\nIn 2015 the Company incurred debt costs in obtaining the facility in the amount of $2,011,000 and $2,959,000 in fees were retained by the lenders. These costs totaling $4,970,000 were recorded as a reduction of the principal loan balance and are being amortized over the life of the loan using the effective interest method. Amortization of these costs for the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015 totaled $789,000, $820,000, and $402,000 respectively.\nIn connection with the DB Facility, the Company and Tamar Royalties entered into an Intercompany Loan Agreement dated May 18, 2015 (the Intercompany Loan Agreement\u201d). Pursuant to the terms of the Intercompany Loan Agreement, Tamar Royalties LLC provided a loan to the Company in an aggregate principal amount of $108,000,000 USD. The purpose of the Intercompany Loan was to repay indebtedness owed by the Company to related parties, to enable acquisitions and capital expenditures by the Company, and for other general corporate purposes of the Company.\nAs of December 31, 2017, Tamar Royalties was in compliance with the financial covenants required under the DB Facility.\nThe Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale Facility\nOn June 30, 2015, Isramco Onshore LLC ( Isramco Onshore\u201d), a newly formed, wholly-owned, subsidiary of Isramco, Inc. (the Company\u201d), entered into a secured Credit Agreement (the SG Facility\u201d) with The Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, as Administrative Agent and Issuing Lender, SG Americas Securities LLC, as Sole Bookrunner, Lead Arranger and Documentation Agent, and the lenders party thereto from time to time, as Lenders. The SG Facility provides for a commitment by The Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale of $150,000,000, subject to an initial borrowing base of $40,000,000. The tenure of the SG Facility was four (4) years and the SG Facility was secured by certain onshore United States oil and gas properties. Pricing under the SG Facility was as follows: (i) for EuroDollar Rate (as defined in the SG Facility) loans range from the EuroDollar rate plus 1.75% to the EuroDollar rate plus 2.75% depending on borrowing base utilization; and (ii) for Reference Rate (as defined in the SG Facility) loans ranges from the Reference Rate plus 0.75% to the Reference Rate Spread plus 1.75% based on borrowing base utilization; (iii) a quarterly commitment fee (as defined in the SG Facility) ranging from an annual rate of 0.38% to 0.5% of the undrawn borrowing base.\nThe SG Facility provided that Isramco Onshore hedge at least seventy-five percent (75%) of its crude oil production before borrowing under the SG Facility. As of December 31, 2017 and as of the date of issuance Isramco Onshore has not entered into such hedge agreements nor has it made a draw under the SG Facility. The Company incurred $478,000 of financing costs in relation to this credit facility which were capitalized as a long-term asset and amortized over the term on the agreement on a straight-line basis until December 31, 2016 at which time the remaining balance totaling $299,000 was expensed.\nIsramco Onshore had various financial and operating covenants required by the SG Facility, including, among other things, the requirement that, during the term of the SG Facility, Isramco Onshore must have a Minimum Current Ratio (as defined in the SG Facility) of not less than 1.00:1.00, a Maximum Leverage Ratio (as defined in the SG Facility) of not less than 4.00:1.00 and a Minimum Interest Coverage Ratio (as defined in the SG Facility) of at least 2.50:1.00. In addition, the SG Facility provided for customary events of default, including, but not limited to, payment defaults, breach of representations or covenants, bankruptcy events and change of control.\nOn August 18, 2016 as a result of semi-annual borrowing base redetermination the borrowing base under SG Facility was reduced to zero. On February 28, 2017 the SG Facility was terminated.\nRelated Party Debt\nA discussion of the Company's related party debt previously outstanding in fiscal year 2015 is set forth below. On June 27, 2015 the Company used a portion of the proceeds secured from the DB Facility to repay the then-outstanding principal and interest balances of the related party debt discussed below. The final payment totaled $101,022,000 which included loan principal payments totaling $93,395,000 and interest payments totaling $7,267,000. The remaining portion of the payment equal to $360,000 repaid related party payables. As result, all such related party debt was repaid and the outstanding balance as of December 31, 2015, 2016 and 2017 was zero.\nI.O.C. Israel Oil Company, Ltd.

In 2017, cash received from operations and proceeds from sale of oil and gas properties was primarily used for repayment of long-term debt, short-term debt, investments in equipment and an increase in restricted cash.\nOur primary source of cash in 2016 was cash flow from operating activities. In 2016, cash received from operations and proceeds from sale of oil and gas properties was primarily used for repayment of long-term debt, short-term debt, investments in equipment and an increase in restricted cash.\nOur primary source of cash in 2015 was cash flow from financing activities. In 2015, net cash received from bank loans, sales of property, and operating activities was primarily used to replay related party loans and short-term debt, increase restricted cash, and investment in equipment for our production services subsidiary and oil and gas properties.\nOperating cash flow fluctuations were substantially driven by changes in commodity prices and changes in our production volumes. Working capital was substantially influenced by these variables. Fluctuation in commodity prices and our overall cash flow may result in an increase or decrease in our future capital expenditures. Prices for oil and natural gas have historically been subject to seasonal fluctuations characterized by peak demand and higher prices in the winter heating season; however, the impact of other risks and uncertainties have influenced prices throughout recent years. See Results of Operations below for a review of the impact of prices and volumes on sales.\nTable 142: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> (In thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash flows provided by operating activities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 18,552\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 15,510\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 8,911\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash flows (used in) investing activities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (4,114\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (807\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (4,680\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash flows provided by (used in) financing activities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (10,519\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (10,691\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 15,820\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net increase in cash\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,919\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,012\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 20,051\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating Activities, Net cash flows provided by operating activities were $18,552,000, $15,510,000, and $8,911,000 for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

This compares to net income of $6,745,000, or $2.48 per share for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nThis decrease in income is primarily due to the increase in allowance for foreign tax credit and deferred tax assets. We fully allowed for our accumulated future tax credit related to the taxes withheld by the Israeli taxing authorities. The valuation allowance amounted to $28,677,000. Total foreign tax credit balance was written off after the passing of new tax legislation of New Tax Reform in the United States which lowered the corporate tax rate to a level that eliminated the forecasted usage of the accumulated foreign tax credit. Likewise we increased our allowance to fully allow for our deferred tax assets see Item 5 Income Tax. This increase in tax expense was partially offset by increased revenues from our United States based production operations, increased revenues from the Tamar field, increased revenues from production service activities, and an increased in gain on divestiture.\nIn 2016 our net income was $6,745,000, or $2.48 per share. This compares to net loss of $(17,310,000), or $(6.37) per share for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nThis increase was primarily due to the decrease in impairment expense from $43,704,000 in 2015 to $4,529,000 in 2016. Additionally lease operating expenses decreased by $5,903,000 from $14,828,000 in 2015 to $8,925,000 in 2016 and Tamar Field proceeds increased by $2,311,000 from $25,151,000 in 2015 to $27,462,000 in 2016. This increase was offset by decreased revenues from our US based oil and gas assets and production services subsidiary which was driven by decrease in natural gas and crude oil prices which in turn reduced demand for our production services; and lower sales volumes of oil, natural gas and NGLs. Additionally the increase in net income was offset lower gain on divestiture, $600,000 in 2016 as compared to $8,378,000 in 2015.\nRevenues, Volumes and Average Prices Oil and Gas Segment - Israel\nDuring year ended December 31, 2017, net sales from the Tamar Field attributable to the Company amounted to 5,343,000 Mcf of natural gas and 6,990 Bbl of condensate with prices of $5.35 per Mcf and $47.46 per Bbl of condensate. Total revenues net of marketing and transportation expenses were $28,781,000. The Israeli Tax Authority withheld $6,907,000 of this revenue.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, net sales from the Tamar Field attributable to the Company amounted to 5,102,000 Mcf of natural gas and 6,882 Bbl of condensate with prices of $5.34 per Mcf and $37.48 per Bbl of condensate. Total revenues net of marketing and transportation expenses were $27,462,000. The Israeli Tax Authority withheld $6,866,000, of this revenue.\nDuring year ended December 31, 2015, net sales from the Tamar Field attributable to the Company amounted to 4,505,000 Mcf of natural gas and 6,074 Bbl of condensate with prices of $5.52 per Mcf and $46.53 per Bbl of condensate. Total revenues net of marketing and transportation expenses were $25,151,000. The Israeli Tax Authority withheld $6,665,000 of this revenue.\nRevenues, Volumes and Average Prices Oil and Gas Segment - United States\nSales Revenues\nTable 145: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> In thousands except percentages\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Dvs. 2016\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> D vs. 2015\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gas sales\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,955\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,209\n</td> <td> </td> <td>"}
