Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nYou should read the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations together with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes and other financial information included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve significant risks and uncertainties. As a result of many factors, such as those set forth in Part I, Item 1A. \u201cRisk Factors\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements.\nOverview\nWe are a leading provider of cloud-based platform solutions designed to help small and medium-sized businesses, or SMBs, succeed online. Leveraging our proprietary technology platform, we serve approximately 4.7 million subscribers globally with a comprehensive and integrated suite of over 150 products and services that help SMBs get online, get found and grow their businesses. Historically, our products focused largely on web hosting and other basic web presence solutions such as domains, but over time we have expanded to offer security, site backup, SEO and SEM, Google Adwords, mobile solutions, social media enablement, website analytics, email marketing and productivity and e-commerce tools, among others. More recently, we have launched additional products and services, including website builders, mobile site builders, cloud hosting solutions, premium domains and cloud storage solutions, both to satisfy existing subscriber needs and to expand the product gateways through which new subscribers initially reach us.\nOver our 18-year history, we have refined our platform and our analytics to collect insights into the needs and aspirations of our subscribers. These insights allow us to engage our subscribers in timely and compelling ways, driving significant business value for them. We believe that our platform delivers cloud-based solutions quickly, cost-effectively, reliably and securely. These strengths and capabilities help us attract and retain subscribers, who then demand additional products and services from us over time.\nOur revenue has grown from $520.3 million for fiscal year 2013 to $629.8 million for fiscal year 2014 and to $741.3 million for fiscal year 2015. This growth in our revenue was driven by acquisitions and by increasing product offerings and subscribers. Our net loss attributable to Endurance International Group Holdings, Inc. was $159.2 million for fiscal year 2013, which dropped to $42.8 million for fiscal year 2014, and dropped further to $25.8 million for fiscal year 2015. The decreases in our net loss are primarily attributable to the growth in our revenue, and to a lesser extent, one-time costs incurred for our initial public offering in fiscal year 2013.\nRecent Developments\nConstant Contact Acquisition\nOn October 30, 2015, we entered into a definitive agreement pursuant to which we agreed to acquire all of the outstanding shares of common stock of Constant Contact for $32.00 per share in cash, for a total purchase price of approximately $1.1 billion. Constant Contact is a leading provider of online marketing tools that are designed for small organizations, including small businesses, associations and non-profits. The acquisition closed on February 9, 2016.\nExpected benefits of the acquisition include:\nTable 217: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>Extension of Endurance's product offerings. We will increase our product portfolio of solutions and integrated products through the addition of Constant Contact's suite of online marketing tools such as email marketing, event management, social media integration and contact management systems. We expect to offer Constant Contact's email marketing products alongside our existing products, thereby expanding our position as a leading provider of end-to-end web presence and marketing solutions for SMBs. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 218: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>Extension of Endurance's core capabilities. Constant Contact has historically focused heavily on product development, and specifically on user experience, subscriber analytics and engagement models. We expect that the combination of this expertise with our historic focus on marketing networks and distribution platforms will enhance our standing as a leader in online SMB services as we expand to a more comprehensive suite of products and services for SMBs. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 219: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>Continuation of a successful partnership. The acquisition will build on our existing partnership with Constant Contact, through which we already offer the Constant Contact suite of products along with other products and services we make available to our subscriber base. Based on the results of this partnership to date, we believe that there is considerable demand within our subscriber base for Constant Contact's suite of products. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 220: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>Creation of significant operational and financial scale. We expect efficiencies to come from leveraging our fixed costs, sharing talent in technology and product development, the reduction of redundant costs and the combined use of our marketing channels. As we grow following the acquisition, we expect these efficiencies to support longer-term growth and value creation for our subscribers. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn connection with and concurrently with the acquisition, we entered into a $735 million incremental first lien term loan facility and a $165 million revolving credit facility (which replaced our existing $125 million revolving credit facility) and issued $350 million of 10.875% senior notes due 2024. See \u201cManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d in Part II, Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information on the financing transactions associated with our acquisition of Constant Contact.\nWZ UK Ltd. Acquisition\nOn January 6, 2016, we exercised an option to increase our stake in WZ UK Ltd., a provider of technology and sales marketing services associated with web builder solutions, from 49% to 57.5%, in exchange for a payment of approximately $2.1 million to the other shareholders of WZ UK Ltd. Subject to certain performance milestones being met, we have an option to purchase, and the other shareholders of WZ UK Ltd. have an option to sell to us within three years, the remaining shares of WZ UK Ltd. at a per-share price to be determined based on a multiple of revenue. The net loss for WZ UK Ltd. for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $28.4 million, of which our portion, recorded in our statement of operations, was $13.9 million. Our adjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2015 does not include our proportionate share of WZ UK Ltd.'s net loss. As a result of our increased ownership in WZ UK Ltd., we will consolidate WZ UK Ltd. in our future financial statements starting in the first quarter of 2016 and our adjusted EBITDA will reflect the WZ UK Ltd. net income (loss).\nKey Metrics\nWe did not report monthly recurring revenue, or MRR, retention rate figures in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2014 and 2015 because we had identified errors in our business intelligence system that impacted MRR and two of our other previously reported performance metrics, the number of products per subscriber, or PPS, and the number of subscribers paying us $500 or more per year, or 500+ Subscribers. We undertook to recalculate revised numbers for these metrics using an upgraded version of the business intelligence system that we believe has corrected these errors. These errors only affected these three performance metrics and did not impact our GAAP financial results, our adjusted EBITDA, free cash flow or unlevered free cash flow metrics, ARPS, or total subscriber figures.\nIn January 2016, we completed our review and recalculation of MRR for all past periods beginning with the three and nine months ended September 30, 2013 and determined that our previously reported MRR figures for those periods will remain at 99%. In addition, we determined that MRR for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2014 and 2015 was 99%.\nIn February 2016, we completed our review and recalculation of PPS and 500+ Subscribers for all past periods beginning with the fourth quarter of 2013. Previously reported and revised figures for PPS and 500+ Subscribers are shown in the charts below; however, for both metrics, the previously reported and revised figures are not directly comparable due to multiple inconsistencies and errors in the calculations used to arrive at the previously reported figures.\nTable 221: <table> <tr> <td>(1) </td> <td>Based on data for our HostGator, BlueHost, iPage, Fatcow, Homestead, A Small Orange and Domain.com brands and the smaller brands that share a billing platform with those brands, which together accounted for approximately 80% of our revenue for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015. Previously disclosed and revised figures are not directly comparable due to inconsistencies which have been corrected in the revised figures. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe define PPS as the number of products purchased across our platform divided by our subscribers at the end of the period, whether those products are sold in bundles or individually, and 500+ Subscribers as the number of subscribers paying us the annualized equivalent of $500 or more as of the measurement date. The PPS and 500+ Subscribers figures cover our HostGator, Bluehost, iPage, Fatcow, Homestead, A Small Orange and Domain.com brands and the smaller brands that share a billing platform with those brands, which together accounted for approximately 80% of our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015. The revised PPS and 500+ Subscriber figures reflect corrections to adjust for the errors identified in our business intelligence system. In addition, the revised figures only count subscribers who meet our definition of total subscribers for the covered brands, and reflect a consistent methodology across these brands.\nThe significant increase in PPS in the fourth quarter of 2014 is attributable to an adjustment to the number of our total subscribers to eliminate inactive customers that were first identified as inactive in that quarter. The impact of that adjustment on our total subscriber count in that quarter was offset by our inclusion, beginning in the fourth quarter of 2014, of customers of subscription-based products other than our hosted web presence solutions, which at that time consisted mostly of subscribers to our JDI Backup cloud storage and backup products. Because JDI Backup was not among the brands covered by the PPS calculation, the elimination of the inactive customers impacted the revised PPS figures.\nDue to the significant size of the Constant Contact acquisition and the difference in subscriber profile between Endurance and Constant Contact, we will no longer report PPS or 500+ Subscribers going forward.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures and Key Metrics\nIn addition to our financial information presented in accordance with GAAP, we use certain \u201cnon-GAAP financial measures\u201d described below to evaluate the operating and financial performance of our business, identify trends affecting our business, develop projections and make strategic business decisions. Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company's operating performance or financial position that includes or excludes amounts that are included or excluded from the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. We monitor the non-GAAP financial measures described below, and we believe they are helpful to investors, because we believe they reflect the operating performance of our business, excluding some recurring and non-recurring expenses that are included in the most directly comparable measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP.\nOur non-GAAP financial measures may not provide information that is directly comparable to that provided by other companies in our industry, as other companies in our industry may calculate non-GAAP financial results differently, particularly related to adjustments for integration and restructuring expenses. In addition, there are limitations in using non-GAAP financial measures because they are not prepared in accordance with GAAP, may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies and exclude expenses that may have a material impact on our reported financial results. Furthermore, interest expense, which is excluded from some of our non-GAAP measures, has been and will continue to be for the foreseeable future a significant recurring expense in our business. The presentation of non-GAAP financial information is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the directly comparable financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. We urge you to review the reconciliations of our non-GAAP financial measures to the comparable GAAP financial measures included below, and not to rely on any single financial measure to evaluate our business.\nKey Metrics\nWe use a number of metrics, including the following key metrics, to evaluate the operating and financial performance of our business, identify trends affecting our business, develop projections and make strategic business decisions:\nTable 222: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>total subscribers; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 223: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>average revenue per subscriber; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 224: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>monthly recurring revenue retention rate; and </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 225: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>adjusted EBITDA. </td> </tr>\n</table> Historically, we also presented adjusted net income, but starting in the second quarter of 2015, we no longer present this measure.\nThe following table summarizes these non-GAAP financial measures and key metrics for the periods presented (in thousands, except average revenue per subscriber and monthly recurring revenue retention rate):\nTable 226: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2013 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2014 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Financial and other metrics:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total subscribers\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,502 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,087 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,669 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Average subscribers\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,363 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,753 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,358 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Average revenue per subscriber\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>13.09 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>14.48 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>14.29 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Monthly recurring revenue retention rate\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>99 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>99 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>99 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Adjusted EBITDA\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>207,931 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>235,618 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>267,452 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTotal Subscribers\nWe define total subscribers as those that, as of the end of a period, are identified as subscribing directly to our products on a paid basis, excluding accounts that access our solutions via resellers or that purchase only domain names from us.\nHistorically, in calculating total subscribers, we included the number of end-of-period subscribers we added through business acquisitions as if those subscribers had subscribed with us since the beginning of the period presented. Since the first quarter of 2014, we have included subscribers we added through business acquisitions from the closing date of the relevant acquisition. Additionally, in the fourth quarter of 2014, we modified our definition of total subscribers to better reflect our expanding product mix by including paid subscribers to all of our subscription-based products (other than accounts that access our solutions via resellers or that purchase only domain names from us, rather than limiting the definition to paid subscribers to our hosted web presence solutions. Subscribers of more than one brand are counted as separate subscribers. Total subscribers for a period reflects adjustments to add or subtract subscribers as we integrate acquisitions and/or are otherwise able to identify subscribers that meet, or do not meet, the definition of total subscribers.\nOur total subscriber base increased from 3.5 million as of December 31, 2013 to 4.1 million as of December 31, 2014 and to 4.7 million as of December 31, 2015. The increase in our subscriber base during 2014 was driven primarily by word-of-mouth referrals, our referral and reseller network, on-boarding subscribers from acquisitions and the inclusion, commencing with the fourth quarter of 2014, of subscribers to all of our subscription-based products (other than accounts that access our solutions via resellers or that purchase only domain names from us) rather than just subscribers to our hosted web presence solutions. Of the approximately 582,000 increase in our total subscriber base from December 31, 2014 to December 31, 2015, approximately 158,000, or 27% of the increase, consisted of pre-acquisition subscriber bases of companies we acquired during 2015, and approximately 90,000, or 15% of the increase, consisted of the adjustments described above. The balance of the increase was due primarily to growth in our business and marketing efforts.\nAverage Revenue per Subscriber\nARPS is a non-GAAP financial measure that we calculate as the amount of revenue we recognize in a period, including marketing development funds and other revenue not received from subscribers, divided by the average of the number of total subscribers at the beginning of the period and at the end of the period, which we refer to as average subscribers for the period. Historically, we adjusted the amount of revenue to include the revenue generated from subscribers we added through business acquisitions as if those acquired subscribers had been our subscribers since the beginning of the period presented. Since the first quarter of 2014, we have included the revenue we add through business acquisitions from the date of the relevant acquisition. We believe ARPS is an indicator of our ability to optimize our mix of products and services and pricing and sell products and services to new and existing subscribers. As we on-board new subscribers, we typically on-board them at introductory prices, which negatively impacts ARPS. Furthermore, ARPS can be impacted by our acquisitions since the acquired subscribers may have higher or lower than average ARPS.\nIn calculating ARPS, we increase revenue for the \u201cpurchase accounting adjustment\u201d for acquisitions, which represents the reduction of post-acquisition revenues from the write-down of deferred revenue to fair value as of the acquisition date. Post-acquisition, deferred revenues are recognized at the reduced amount, until such time that the subscription is renewed. The impact generally normalizes within a year following the acquisition.\nARPS does not represent an exact measure of the average amount a subscriber spends with us each month, since our calculation of ARPS is impacted by revenues generated by non-subscribers. We have three principal sources of non-subscriber revenue: revenue attributable to customers who purchase only a domain name from us and do not purchase any other products, or domain-only customers, domain monetization revenue, and marketing development funds.\nDomain monetization revenue consists principally of revenue from our BuyDomains brand, which provides premium domain name products and services, and, to a lesser extent, revenue from advertisements placed on unused domains (often referred to as \u201cparked\u201d pages) owned by us or our customers. Historically, the contribution of domain monetization activities to our revenue and adjusted revenue has been insignificant, but has been increasing beginning in 2014 primarily due to our acquisition of BuyDomains in September 2014. Our domain monetization revenue (and adjusted revenue) was $3.0 million, $19.2 million and $39.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2014 and 2015, respectively, and its exclusion from our ARPS calculation would have resulted in ARPS being $0.07, $0.43 and $0.76 lower for those periods, respectively.\nMarketing development funds are amounts that certain of our partners pay us to assist in and incentivize our marketing of their products. Our marketing development fund revenue (and adjusted revenue) was $7.5 million, $9.1 million and $13.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2014 and 2015, respectively, and its exclusion from our ARPS calculation would have resulted in ARPS being $0.19, $0.20 and $0.25 lower for those periods, respectively.\nAlthough we are able to measure the total amount of our revenue from domains, we are not able to further break down domain revenue into revenue from domain-only customers versus revenue from customers who purchase domains from us in addition to other products. Total adjusted revenue from domains was $67.1 million, $111.9 million and $127.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2014 and 2015, respectively.\nThe following tables reflect the reconciliation of adjusted revenue from domains to revenue from domains in accordance with GAAP:\nTable 227: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2013 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2014 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(in thousands) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>66,397 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>91,300 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>125,190 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Purchase accounting adjustment\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>747 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>20,561 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,198 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Domain adjusted revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>67,144 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>111,861 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>127,388 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table> A portion of our revenue is generated from customers that resell our services. We refer to these customers as \u201cresellers.\u201d We consider these resellers (rather than the end user customers of these resellers) to be subscribers under our total subscribers definition, because we do not have a billing relationship with the end users and cannot determine the number of end users acquiring our services through a reseller. Additionally, a majority of our reseller revenues are for the purchase of domains and are included in the figures for adjusted revenue from domains shown above. Total adjusted revenue from resellers, excluding the portion that relates to domains, for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2014 and 2015 was $19.3, $23.9 and $25.5 million, respectively.\nThe following tables reflect the reconciliation of adjusted revenue from resellers to revenue from resellers in accordance with GAAP:\nTable 228: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2013 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2014 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(in thousands) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>19,270 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>23,525 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>25,441 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Purchase accounting adjustment\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>350 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Domain adjusted revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>19,270 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>23,875 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>25,458 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table> For the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2014, ARPS increased from $13.09 to $14.48, respectively. This increase in ARPS was driven primarily by increasing demand for our solutions and the acquisition of Directi in 2014.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2015, ARPS decreased from $14.48 to $14.29, respectively. This decrease in ARPS was driven primarily by subscribers coming to our platform through new gateway products, some of which are lower priced than our traditional web presence offerings, and by new subscribers joining us at low introductory prices for their first year with us. This decrease was partially offset by increased revenue from non-subscriber based revenue such as domain monetization and marketing development funds.\nThe following table reflects the reconciliation of ARPS to revenue calculated in accordance with GAAP.\nTable 229: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2013 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2014 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(in thousands, except ARPS data) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>520,296 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>629,845 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>741,315 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Purchase accounting adjustment\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,311 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>22,100 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,724 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Pre-acquisition revenue from acquired properties\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>512 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Adjusted revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>528,119 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>651,945 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>747,039 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total subscribers\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,502 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,087 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,669 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Average subscribers for the period\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,363 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,753 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,358 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> ARPS\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>13.09 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>14.48 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>14.29 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table> Monthly Recurring Revenue Retention Rate\nWe believe that our ability to retain revenue from our subscribers is an indicator of the long-term value of our subscriber relationships and the stability of our revenue base. To assess our performance in this area, we measure our MRR retention rate which reflects both subscriber churn and additional revenue from existing subscribers due to renewals, upsells and price changes. We calculate MRR retention rate at the end of a period by taking the retained recurring value of subscription revenue of all active subscribers of our major brands at the end of the prior period and dividing it into the retained recurring value of subscription revenue for those same subscribers at the end of the period presented. The brands included in this calculation are our HostGator, Bluehost, iPage, Fatcow, Homestead, A Small Orange and Domain.com brands and the smaller brands that share a billing platform with those brands, which together accounted for approximately 80% of our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015. A number of our recently acquired and international brands are not included in MRR, including in particular our Directi brands and our JDI Backup cloud storage brands, because these brands have not yet been integrated into our business intelligence system and we are not able to produce adequately reliable MRR data for them. MRR for a period is presented as a rolling average of MRR for the most recent four quarters. We believe MRR retention rate is an indicator of our ability to retain existing subscribers, upsell products and services to them and maintain subscriber satisfaction. MRR can be impacted by factors such as subscriber churn, new subscriber additions, increases in pricing and product uptake.\nOur MRR retention rate was 99% for all periods presented.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nAdjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure that we calculate as net income (loss) plus (i) changes in deferred revenue, depreciation, amortization, stock-based compensation expense, loss of unconsolidated entities, net loss on sale of assets, expenses related to integration of acquisitions and restructurings, transaction expenses and charges, including preparation for our IPO and any dividend-related payments accounted for as compensation expense, certain legal advisory expenses, interest expense and income tax expense, less (ii) earnings of unconsolidated entities, net gain on sale of assets and the impact of purchase accounting related to reduced fair value of deferred domain registration costs. We view adjusted EBITDA as a performance measure. Due to our history of acquisitions and financings, we have incurred and will continue to incur charges for integration, restructuring and transaction expenses that primarily relate to the process of acquiring another business and integrating that business into our support and/ or technical platforms. We believe that adjusting for\nthese items is useful to investors in evaluating the post-integration performance of our company. We manage our business based on the cash collected from our subscribers and the cash required to acquire and service those subscribers. We believe highlighting cash collected and cash spent in a given period provides insight to an investor to gauge the overall performance of our business. Under GAAP, although subscription fees are paid in advance, we recognize the associated revenue over the subscription term, which does not fully reflect short-term trends in our operating results. In order to capture these trends and report our performance consistently with how we manage our business, we include the change in deferred revenue for the period in our calculation of adjusted EBITDA for that period.\nThe following table reflects the reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA to net loss calculated in accordance with GAAP for the periods presented.\nTable 230: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2013 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2014 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(in thousands) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net loss\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(159,846 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(50,852 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(25,770 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Stock-based compensation\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10,763 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16,043 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>29,925 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (Gain) loss on sale of assets\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>309 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(168 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(155 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loss of unconsolidated entities(1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,067 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>61 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9,200 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Amortization of other intangible assets\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>105,915 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>102,723 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>91,057 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Amortization of deferred financing costs\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,768 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>83 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>82 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Changes in deferred revenue(2)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>51,047 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>67,654 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>34,241 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Impact of reduced fair value of deferred domain registration costs\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(18,782 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2,005 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Transaction expenses and charges(3)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>45,036 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,787 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9,582 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Integration and restructuring expenses\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>45,594 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>19,927 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16,262 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Legal advisory expenses(4)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,349 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Depreciation\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18,615 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>30,956 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>34,010 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income tax expense\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(3,596 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,186 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11,342 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest expense, net (excluding impact of amortization of deferred financing costs)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>89,259 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>57,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>58,332 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Adjusted EBITDA\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>207,931 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>235,618 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>267,452 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 231: <table> <tr> <td>(1) </td> <td>The loss of unconsolidated entities is reported on a net basis for the year ended December 31, 2015.

Additionally, we incurred lower costs for acquisition, integration and restructuring expenses, and did not incur the IPO costs incurred in the 2013 period. Net loss decreased from $50.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 to $25.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily as a result of our revenue growth, including revenue growth associated with acquisitions.\nAdjusted EBITDA increased from $207.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 to $235.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. These increases in adjusted EBITDA were primarily a result of our revenue growth, including revenue growth associated with acquisitions, increases in the number of subscribers on our platform and achieving greater scale benefits. During 2014 this growth was impacted by our increased investments in marketing and by the additional costs we incurred related to being a public company.\nAdjusted EBITDA increased from $235.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 to $267.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. This increase in adjusted EBITDA was primarily a result of our revenue growth, including revenue growth associated with acquisitions and a reduction in marketing expenses as we reduced marketing spend for certain products, including cloud storage products, as our subscriber base became more familiar with these products. The impact of these factors was partially offset by increased investment in our data center and subscriber support infrastructure and increases in engineering and development expense and general and administrative expense.\nComponents of Operating Results\nRevenue\nWe generate revenue primarily from selling subscriptions for our cloud-based products and services. The subscriptions we offer are similar across all of our brands and are provided under contracts pursuant to which we have ongoing obligations to support the subscriber. These contracts are generally for service periods of up to 36 months and typically require payment in advance at the time of initiating the subscription for the entire subscription period. Typically, we also have arrangements in place to auto renew a subscription at the end of the subscription period. Due to factors such as introductory pricing, our renewal fees may be higher than our initial subscription. We sell more subscriptions with 12 month terms than with any other term length. We also earn revenue from the sale of domain name registrations, premium domains and non-term based products and services, such as certain online security products and professional technical services as well as through referral fees and commissions. We expect our revenue to increase in future periods as we expand our subscriber base, including through acquisitions, and the roll out of new subscriber acquisition channels such as web builders and mobile applications.\nCost of Revenue\nCost of revenue includes costs of operating our subscriber support organization, fees we pay to register domain names for our subscribers, costs of operating our data center infrastructure, such as technical personnel costs associated with monitoring and maintaining our network operations, fees we pay to third-party product and service providers, and merchant fees we pay as part of our billing processes. We also allocate to cost of revenue the depreciation and amortization related to these activities and the intangible assets we have acquired, as well as a portion of our overhead costs attributable to our employees engaged in subscriber support activities. In addition, cost of revenue includes stock-based compensation expense for employees engaged in support and network operations. We expect cost of revenue to increase in absolute dollars in future periods as we expand our subscriber base, increase our levels of subscriber support, expand our domain name business and add data center capacity. Cost of revenue may increase or decrease as a percentage of revenue in a given period, depending on our ability to manage our infrastructure costs, in particular with respect to data centers and support, the amount of third-party product and services that we sell and as a result of our amortization expense related to acquisitions.\nGross Profit\nGross profit is the difference between revenue and cost of revenue. Gross profit has fluctuated from period to period in large part as a result of revenue and cost of revenue adjustments from purchase accounting impacts related to acquisitions, as well as revenue and cost of revenue impacts from growth in our business. With respect to revenue, the application of purchase accounting requires us to record purchase accounting adjustments for acquired deferred revenue, which reduces the revenue recorded from acquisitions for a period of time after the acquisition. The impact generally normalizes within a year following the acquisition. With respect to cost of revenue, the application of purchase accounting requires us to defer domain registration costs, which reduces cost of revenue, and record long-lived assets at fair value, which increases cost of revenue through an increase in amortization expense over the estimated useful life of the long-lived assets. In addition, our revenue and our cost of revenue have increased in recent years as our subscriber base has expanded. For a new subscriber that we bring on to our platform, we typically recognize revenue over the term of the subscription, even though we collect the subscription fee at the initial billing. As a result, our gross profit may be affected by the prices we charge for our subscriptions, as well as by the number of new subscribers and the terms of their subscriptions. We expect our gross profit to increase in absolute dollars in future periods while our gross profit margin may increase or decrease.\nOperating Expense\nWe classify our operating expense into three categories: sales and marketing, engineering and development, and general and administrative. Although our operating expenses will increase as a result of the Constant Contact acquisition, we are planning approximately $55.0 million of annual run rate cost reductions for the combined business, which we expect will be implemented by the end of 2016, with a majority of those cost reductions impacting operating expenses. In connection with these cost reduction plans, we expect to incur approximately $18.0 million to $22.0 million of restructuring charges, consisting of severance and facility exit related charges. A significant majority of the restructuring charge will be incurred in fiscal year 2016.\nSales and Marketing\nSales and marketing expense primarily consists of costs associated with bounty payments to our network of online partners, SEM and SEO, general awareness and brand building activities, as well as the cost of employees engaged in sales and marketing activities. Sales and marketing expense also includes costs associated with sales of products as well as stock-based compensation expense for employees engaged in sales and marketing activities. Sales and marketing expense as a percentage of revenue may increase or decrease in a given period, depending on the cost of attracting new subscribers to our solutions, changes in how we invest in different subscriber acquisition channels, changes in how we approach search engine marketing and search engine\noptimization and the extent of general awareness and brand building activities we may undertake, as well as the efficiency of our sales and support personnel and our ability to sell more products and services to our subscribers and drive favorable returns on invested marketing dollars.\nEngineering and Development\nEngineering and development expense includes the cost of employees engaged in enhancing our technology platform and our systems, developing and expanding product and service offerings, and integrating technology capabilities from our acquisitions. Engineering and development expense includes stock-based compensation expense for employees engaged in engineering and development activities. Our engineering and development expense does not include costs of leasing and operating our data center infrastructure, such as technical personnel costs associated with monitoring and maintaining our network operations and fees we pay to third-party product and service providers, which are included in cost of revenue.\nGeneral and Administrative\nGeneral and administrative expense includes the cost of employees engaged in corporate functions, such as finance, human resources, legal affairs and general management. General and administrative expense also includes all facility and related overhead costs not allocated to cost of revenue, as well as insurance premiums and professional service fees. We incurred additional expenses in preparing for our IPO during 2013 and will continue to incur expenses associated with being a publicly traded company and due to our expansion into international territories, including increased legal, corporate insurance, tax and accounting expenses, and the additional costs of maintaining compliance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and other regulations. General and administrative expense includes stock-based compensation expense for employees engaged in general and administrative activities.\nOther Income (Expense)\nOther income (expense) consists primarily of costs related to, and interest paid on, our indebtedness. We include the cash cost of interest payments and loan financing fees, the amortization of deferred financing costs and the amortization of the net present value adjustment which we may apply to some deferred consideration payments related to our acquisitions in our calculation of interest expense. Interest income consists primarily of interest income earned on our cash and cash equivalents balances. Our interest expense may increase in future periods if we continue to finance acquisitions through the issuance of debt. We expect our interest expense to increase in future periods as a result of the financing transactions we entered into in connection with our acquisition of Constant Contact. Other income (expense) also includes gains or losses recognized on investments in unconsolidated entities.\nIncome Tax Expense (Benefit)\nWe estimate our income taxes in accordance with the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on temporary differences between the assets and liabilities in our consolidated financial statements and the financial statements that are prepared in accordance with tax regulations for the purpose of filing our income tax returns, using statutory tax rates. This methodology requires us to record a valuation allowance against net deferred tax assets if, based upon the available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nWe prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the\nconsolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expense during the reported periods. We base our estimates, judgments and assumptions on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Our actual results may differ from the estimates, judgments and assumptions made by our management. To the extent that there are differences between our estimates, judgments and assumptions and our actual results, our future financial statement presentation, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be affected.\nWe believe that the following significant accounting policies, which are more fully described in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, involve a greater degree of judgment and complexity. Accordingly, these are the policies we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our financial condition and results of operations. We believe that our critical accounting policies and estimates are the assumptions and estimates associated with the following:\nTable 236: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>revenue recognition, </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 237: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>goodwill, </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 238: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>long-lived assets, </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 239: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>derivative instruments, </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 240: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>depreciation and amortization, </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 241: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>income taxes, and </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 242: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>stock-based compensation arrangements. </td> </tr>\n</table> Revenue Recognition\nWe generate revenue primarily from selling subscriptions to our cloud-based products and services. The subscriptions we offer are similar across all of our brands and are provided under contracts pursuant to which we have ongoing obligations to support the subscriber. These contracts are generally for service periods of up to 36 months and typically require payment in advance. We recognize the associated revenue ratably over the service period, whether the associated revenue is derived from a direct subscriber or through a reseller. Deferred revenue represents the liability to subscribers for advance billings for services not yet provided and the fair value of the assumed liability outstanding for subscriber relationships purchased in an acquisition.\nWe sell domain name registrations that provide a subscriber with the exclusive use of a domain name. These domains are obtained either by one of our registrars on the subscriber's behalf, or by us from third-party registrars on the subscriber's behalf. Domain registration fees are non-refundable.\nRevenue from the sale of a domain name registration by one of our registrars is recognized ratably over the subscriber's service period as we have the obligation to provide support over the domain term. Revenue from the sale of a domain name registration purchased by us from a third-party registrar is recognized when the subscriber is billed on a gross basis as we have no remaining obligations once the sale to the subscriber occurs, and we have full discretion on the sales price and bear all credit risk.\nRevenue from the sale of premium domains is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement to sell such domains exists, delivery of an authorization key to access the domain name has occurred, the fee for the sale of the premium domain is fixed or determinable, and collection of the fee for the sale of the premium domain is deemed probable.\nWe also earn revenue from the sale of non-term based products and services, such as online security products and professional technical services, referral fees and commissions. We recognize such revenue when the product is purchased, the service is provided or the referral fee or commission is earned.\nA substantial amount of our revenue is generated from transactions that are multiple-element service arrangements that may include hosting plans, domain name registrations, and other cloud-based products and services.\nWe follow the provisions of the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, Accounting Standards Update No. 2009-13, or ASU 2009-13, Revenue Recognition (Topic 605), Multiple-Deliverable Revenue Arrangements-a consensus of the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force and allocate revenue to each deliverable in a multiple- element service arrangement based on its respective relative selling price.\nUnder ASU 2009-13, to treat deliverables in a multiple-element service arrangement as separate units of accounting, the deliverables must have standalone value upon delivery. If the deliverables have standalone value upon delivery, we account for each deliverable separately. Hosting services, domain name registrations, cloud-based products and services have standalone value and are often sold separately.\nWhen multiple deliverables included in a multiple-element service arrangement are separated into different units of accounting, the total transaction amount is allocated to the identified separate units based on a relative selling price hierarchy. We determine the relative selling price for a deliverable based on vendor specific objective evidence, or VSOE, of fair value, if available, or best estimate of selling price, or BESP, if VSOE is not available. We have determined that third-party evidence of selling price, or TPE, is not a practical alternative due to differences in our multi-brand offerings compared to competitors and the availability of relevant third-party pricing information. We have not established VSOE for our offerings due to lack of pricing consistency, the introduction of new products, services and other factors. Accordingly, we generally allocate revenue to the deliverables in the arrangement based on the BESP. We determine BESP by considering our relative selling prices, competitive prices in the marketplace and management judgment; these selling prices, however, may vary depending upon the particular facts and circumstances related to each deliverable. We analyze the selling prices used in our allocation of transaction amount, at a minimum, on a quarterly basis. Selling prices will be analyzed on a more frequent basis if a significant change in our business necessitates a more timely analysis.\nWe maintain a reserve for refunds and chargebacks related to revenue that has been recognized and is expected to be refunded. We had a refund and chargeback reserve of $0.6 million and $0.5 million as of December 31, 2014 and 2015, respectively. The portion of deferred revenue that is expected to be refunded at December 31, 2014 and 2015 was $2.2 million and $1.8 million, respectively. Based on refund history, approximately 80% of all refunds happen in the same fiscal month that the customer contract starts or renews, and approximately 92% of all refunds happen within 45 days of the contract start or renewal date.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill relates to amounts that arose in connection with our various acquisitions and represents the difference between the purchase price and the fair value of the identifiable intangible and tangible net assets when accounted for using the purchase method of accounting. Goodwill is not amortized, but is subject to periodic review for impairment. Events that would indicate impairment and trigger an interim impairment assessment include, but are not limited to, current economic and market conditions, a decline in the equity value of the business, a significant adverse change in certain agreements that would materially affect reported operating results, business climate or operational performance of the business and an adverse action or assessment by a regulator.\nIn accordance with Accounting Standards Update No. 2011-08, or ASU 2011-08, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other (Topic 350) Testing Goodwill for Impairment, we are required to review goodwill by reporting unit for\nimpairment at least annually or more often if there are indicators of impairment present. Under U.S. GAAP, a reporting unit is either the equivalent of, or one level below, an operating segment. We have determined that we operate in one segment and our entire business represents one reporting unit. Changes in operations may cause us to evaluate our conclusion on operating segments and reporting units. Historically, we have performed our annual impairment analysis during the fourth quarter of each year. The provisions of ASU 2011-08 require us to perform a two-step impairment test for goodwill. In the first step, we compare the fair value of each reporting unit to which goodwill has been allocated to its carrying value. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets assigned to that reporting unit, goodwill is considered not impaired and we are not required to perform further testing. If the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit, then we must perform the second step of the impairment test to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill. If the carrying value of a reporting unit's goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, then we record an impairment loss equal to the difference. We have assessed fair value based on current market capitalization. As of December 31, 2014 and 2015, the fair value of our reporting unit exceeded the carrying value of the reporting unit's net assets and, therefore, no impairment existed as of these dates.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had goodwill of $1,207.3 million. We did not recognize any impairments of goodwill in the years ended December 31, 2013, 2014 or 2015.\nLong-Lived Assets\nOur long-lived assets consist primarily of intangible assets, including acquired subscriber relationships, trade names, intellectual property, developed technology, domain names available for sale and in-process research and development, or IPR&D. We also have long-lived tangible assets, primarily consisting of property and equipment. The majority of our intangible assets have been recorded in connection with our acquisitions, including the Sponsor Acquisition described below. We record intangible assets at fair value at the time of their acquisition. We amortize intangible assets over their estimated useful lives.\nOur determination of the estimated useful lives of the individual categories of intangible assets is based on the nature of the applicable intangible asset and the expected future cash flow to be derived from the intangible asset. We amortize intangible assets with finite lives in accordance with their estimated projected cash flows.\nWe evaluate long-lived intangible and tangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. If indicators of impairment are present and undiscounted future cash flow is less than the carrying amount, then we determine the fair value of the assets and compare it to the carrying value. If the fair value is less than the carrying value, then we reduce the carrying value to the estimated fair value and record an impairment loss in the period it is identified. We did not recognize any impairments of long-lived intangible and tangible assets in the years ended December 31, 2013, 2014 or 2015.\nIndefinite life intangibles include domain names that are available for sale which are recorded at cost to acquire. These assets are not being amortized and are being tested for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstance indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable. When a domain name is sold, we record the cost of the domain in cost of revenue.\nAcquired IPR&D, represents the fair value assigned to research and development that we acquire that has not been completed at the date of acquisition. The acquired IPR&D is capitalized as an intangible asset and reviewed on a quarterly basis to determine future use. Any impairment loss of the acquired IPR&D is charged to expense in the period the impairment is identified. Upon commercialization, the acquired fair value of the IPR&D will be amortized over its useful life. No such impairment losses have been identified during the years ended December 31, 2013, 2014 or 2015.\nDerivative Instruments\nAccounting Standards Codification 815, or ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging, provides the disclosure requirements for derivatives and hedging activities with the intent to provide users of financial statements with an enhanced understanding of: (a) how and why an entity uses derivative instruments, (b) how the entity accounts for derivative instruments and related hedged items, and (c) how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect an entity's financial position, financial performance, and cash flows. Further, qualitative disclosures are required that explain our objectives and strategies for using derivatives, as well as quantitative disclosures about the fair value of and gains and losses on derivative instruments, and disclosures about credit-risk-related contingent features in derivative instruments.\nAs required by ASC 815, we record all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value. The accounting for changes in the fair value of derivatives depends on the intended use of the derivative, whether we have elected to designate a derivative in a hedging relationship and apply hedge accounting and whether the hedging relationship has satisfied the criteria necessary to apply hedge accounting. Derivatives designated and qualifying as a hedge of the exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset, liability, or firm commitment attributable to a particular risk, such as interest rate risk, are considered fair value hedges. Derivatives designated and qualifying as a hedge of the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows, or other types of forecasted transactions, are considered cash flow hedges. Derivatives may also be designated as hedges of the foreign currency exposure of a net investment in a foreign operation. Hedge accounting generally provides for the matching of the timing of gain or loss recognition on the hedging instrument with the recognition of the changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk in a fair value hedge or the earnings effect of the hedged forecasted transactions in a cash flow hedge. We may enter into derivative contracts that are intended to economically hedge certain of its risk, even though hedge accounting does not apply or we elect not to apply hedge accounting.\nIn accordance with the FASB's fair value measurement guidance in Accounting Standards Update No. 2011-04, or ASU 2011-04, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820), we made an accounting policy election to measure the credit risk of our derivative financial instruments that are subject to master netting agreements on a net basis by counterparty portfolio.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nWe purchase or build the servers we place in our data centers, which we occupy pursuant to various lease or co-location arrangements. We also purchase the computer equipment that is used by our support and sales teams and employees in our offices. We capitalize the build-out of our facilities as leasehold improvements. Cost of revenue includes depreciation on data center equipment and support infrastructure. We also include depreciation in general and administrative expense, which includes depreciation on office equipment and leasehold improvements.\nAmortization expense consists of expense related to the amortization of intangible long-lived assets. In connection with our acquisitions, we allocate fair value to acquired long-lived intangible assets, which include subscriber relationships, trade names and developed technology. We use estimates and valuation techniques to determine the estimated useful lives of our intangible assets and amortize them to cost of revenue.\nIncome Taxes\nWe provide for income taxes in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification 740, or ASC 740, Accounting for Income Taxes. We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carry-forwards. We measure deferred tax assets and\nliabilities using enacted tax rates that we expect to apply to taxable income in the years in which we expect those temporary differences to be recovered or settled. We recognize the effect of changes in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities in the period that includes the enactment date.\nASC 740 clarifies the accounting for income taxes, by prescribing a minimum recognition threshold that a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements. We recognize the effect of income tax positions only if those positions are more likely than not to be sustained. We measure recognized income tax positions at the largest amount that is more likely than not to be realized. We reflect changes in recognition or measurement in the period in which the change in judgment occurs. There were no unrecognized tax benefits in the years ended December 31, 2013, 2014 or 2015.\nWe record interest related to unrecognized tax benefits in interest expense and penalties in operating expense. We did not recognize any interest or penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits during the years ended December 31, 2013, 2014 or 2015.\nIn 2013 and 2014, a significant amount of our GAAP foreign losses were generated by our subsidiaries organized in the United Kingdom and the United Arab Emirates, or the U.A.E. In 2013 and 2014, the foreign rate differential predominantly relates to these jurisdictions. Our foreign rate differential in 2014 has a negative impact on our expected benefit since the majority of the foreign losses are generated in jurisdictions where the statutory tax rate is lower than the U.S. statutory rate - specifically the United Kingdom, which has a statutory tax rate of 20% and represents $22.5 million of our foreign losses, and the U.A.E., which has a statutory tax rate of 0% and represents $6.2 million of our foreign losses.\nIn 2015, a significant amount of our GAAP foreign losses were generated by our subsidiaries in the U.A.E. and Israel. The foreign rate differential in 2015 predominantly related to these jurisdictions. Our foreign rate differential in 2015 had a negative impact on our expected tax expense since the majority of the foreign losses are generated in jurisdictions where the statutory tax rate is lower than the U.S. statutory rate - specifically the U.A.E., which has a statutory tax rate of 0% and represents $2.4 million of our foreign losses, and Israel, which has a statutory tax rate of 26.5% and represents $2.5 million of our foreign losses.\nWe describe our accounting treatment of taxes more fully in Note 14 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nStock-Based Compensation Arrangements\nAccounting Standards Codification 718, or ASC 718, Compensation-Stock Compensation, requires employee stock-based payments to be accounted for under the fair value method. Under this method, we are required to record compensation cost based on the estimated fair value for stock-based awards granted over the requisite service periods for the individual awards, which generally equals the vesting periods. We use the straight-line amortization method for recognizing stock-based compensation expense.\nWe estimate the fair value of employee stock options on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, which requires the use of highly subjective estimates and assumptions. For restricted stock awards granted by us we estimate the fair value of each restricted stock award based on the closing trading price of our common stock as reported on the NASDAQ Global Select Market on the date of grant. There was no public market for our common stock prior to October 25, 2013, the date our common stock began trading on the NASDAQ Global Select Market, and as a result, the trading history of our common stock was limited through December 31, 2015. Therefore, we determined the volatility for options granted by us based on an analysis of reported data for a peer group of companies that issued options with substantially similar terms. The expected volatility of options granted by us has been determined using an average of the historical volatility measures of this peer group of companies. The expected life assumption is based on the \u201csimplified method\u201d for estimating expected term as we do not have sufficient historical option exercises to support a reasonable estimate of the expected term. The risk-free interest rate is based on a treasury instrument whose term is consistent with the\nexpected life of the stock options. We use an expected dividend rate of zero as we currently have no history or expectation of paying dividends on our common stock. In addition, we have estimated expected forfeitures of options. If our actual forfeiture rate varies from our estimate, additional adjustments to compensation expense may be required in future periods.\nGiven the absence of an active trading market for our common stock prior to the completion of our IPO, the fair value of the equity interests underlying our stock-based awards was determined by management. In doing so, valuation analyses were prepared in accordance with the guidelines outlined in the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Practice Aid, Valuation of Privately-Held-Company Equity Securities Issued as Compensation, and were used by our management to assist in determining the fair value of the equity interests underlying our stock-based awards. Each equity interest was granted with a \u201cthreshold amount\u201d meaning that the recipient of an equity security only participated to the extent that the entity appreciated in value from and after the date of grant of the equity interest (with the value of the entity as of the grant date being the \u201cthreshold amount\u201d). The assumptions used in the valuation models were based on future expectations combined with management's judgment. In the absence of a public trading market, our management exercised significant judgment and considered numerous objective and subjective factors to determine the fair value of the stock-based awards as of the date of each award. These factors included:\nTable 243: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>contemporaneous or retrospective valuations for our company and our securities; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 244: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>the rights, preferences, and privileges of the stock-based awards relative to each other as well as to the existing shareholders; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 245: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>lack of marketability of our equity securities; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 246: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>historical operating and financial performance; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 247: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>our stage of development; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 248: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>current business conditions and projections; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 249: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>hiring of key personnel and the experience of our management team; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 250: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>risks inherent to the development of our products and services and delivery of our solutions; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 251: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>trends and developments in our industry; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 252: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>the threshold amount for the stock-based awards and the values at which the stock-based awards would vest; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 253: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>the market performance of comparable publicly traded companies; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 254: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>likelihood of achieving a liquidity event, such as an initial public offering or a merger or acquisition of our company given prevailing market conditions; and </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 255: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>U.S. and global economic and capital market conditions. </td> </tr>\n</table> Impact of Sponsor Acquisition\nOn December 22, 2011, investment funds and entities affiliated with Warburg Pincus and Goldman, Sachs & Co. acquired a controlling interest in our company, which we refer to as the Sponsor Acquisition. As a result, our consolidated financial statements present our operating results and cash flows separately for periods prior to and after the Sponsor Acquisition. Our company is referred to as the \u201cpredecessor\u201d for all periods prior to the Sponsor Acquisition and is referred to as the \u201csuccessor\u201d for all periods after the Sponsor Acquisition. The tables below summarize our operating results for all periods presented in our consolidated financial statements.\nThe application of purchase accounting required us to record all acquired assets and liabilities, including deferred revenue, deferred costs and long-lived assets, at fair value, which in some cases was different than their book values. The total impact of the purchase accounting treatment on our loss from operations resulting from\nthe Sponsor Acquisition for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2014 and 2015 was $26.7 million, $25.9 million and $35.4 million, respectively. These impacts consisted of the following components:\nTable 256: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>Impact on Revenue. We assessed the fair value of acquired deferred revenue to be $57.5 million, representing a decrease of $73.2 million from its $130.7 million book value. The effect of recording deferred revenue to fair value was to reduce revenue in successor periods. The impact to revenue for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2014 was $5.8 million and $0.5 million, respectively. The impact to revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015 and future periods is de minimis. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 257: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>Impact on Cost of Revenue. In conjunction with recording deferred revenue at fair value, we recorded related deferred domain registration costs at fair value, resulting in a $13.6 million decrease in deferred costs in successor periods. The impact on cost of revenue from deferring domain registration costs for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2014 and 2015 was $1.0 million, $0.2 million and $0.1 million, respectively. In our assessment of fair value of acquired long-lived assets, we recorded the fair value of our developed technology at $167.0 million, representing an increase of $160.1 million from a book value of $6.9 million. This increase is being amortized on a straight-line basis over ten years. In addition, we recorded the fair value of our subscriber relationships and trade names at $221.4 million, representing an increase of $104.2 million from a book value of $117.2 million. This increase is being amortized over ten to 15 years. The effect of recording long-lived assets at fair value was an increase in amortization expense to be recognized in successor periods. The impact on cost of revenue from amortizing the changes to acquired long lived assets for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2014 and 2015 was $21.8 million, $25.7 million and $35.6 million, respectively. </td> </tr>\n</table> The following table sets forth the impact of the application of purchase accounting from the Sponsor Acquisition as described above:\nTable 258: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2013 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2014 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(in thousands) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revenue that would have been recognized from December 21, 2011 book value of deferred revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(16,000 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(2,917 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revenue recognized based on fair value of acquired deferred revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10,160 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,461 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total impact to revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(5,840 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(456 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Impact of reduced fair value of deferred domain registration costs\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(978 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(241 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(144 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Amortization impact:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Amortization that would have been recognized from December 21, 2011 book value of long-lived assets\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(32,705 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(20,899 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(4,764 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Amortization on fair value of acquired long-lived assets recorded\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>54,541 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>46,634 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>40,354 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total amortization impact\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>21,836 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>25,735 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>35,590 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total impact to cost of revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>20,858 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>25,494 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>35,446 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total impact to loss from operations\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(26,698 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(25,950 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(35,446 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nResults of Operations\nThe following tables set forth our results of operations for the periods presented.

Of this increase, $49.4 million is attributable to revenues, including growth and synergies, from the acquisitions of businesses that were not part of our business for all or most of the year ended December 31, 2014. The remaining balance of the increase, or $62.1 million, is attributable primarily to the growth of our business, and to a lesser extent, other factors, including principally the $14.8 million impact of the purchase accounting adjustment for the Directi acquisition.\nOur revenues are generated primarily from our products and services delivered on a subscription basis, which include web hosting, domains, website builders, search engine marketing and other similar services. We also generate non-subscription revenues through domain monetization and marketing development funds. Non-subscription revenues increased from $28.3 million, or 4% of total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2014 to $52.6 million, or 7% of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase non-subscription revenues is primarily due to the acquisitions of Directi and BuyDomains.\nCost of Revenue\nTable 261: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2014 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Amount </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>% of\nRevenue </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Amount </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>% of\nRevenue </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Amount </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(dollars in thousands) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cost of revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>381,488 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>61 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>425,035 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>57 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>43,547 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table> Cost of revenue increased by $43.5 million, or 11%, from $381.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 to $425.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. Of this increase, domain registration costs increased by $32.5 million, partially due to the purchase accounting impact of Directi for the year ended December 31, 2014 and inclusion of domain registration costs related to businesses that we acquired that were not part of our business for most of the year ended December 31, 2014. In addition, support expenses increased by $10.8 million due to acquisitions subsequent to December 31, 2014 and investment in new and existing brands, data center expenses increased by $6.1 million due to acquisitions, subscriber growth and price increases under certain of our data center contracts, depreciation expense increased by $2.0 million, stock-based compensation expense increased by $1.4 million and merchant fees increased by $2.4 million. These increases were partially offset by an $11.7 million decrease in amortization expense.\nOur cost of revenue contains a significant portion of non-cash expenses, in particular amortization expense for the intangible assets we have acquired through our acquisitions and the Sponsor Acquisition. The following table sets forth the significant non-cash components of cost of revenue.\nTable 262: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2014 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2015 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(in thousands) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Amortization expense\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>102,723 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>91,057 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Depreciation expense\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>29,007 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>31,170 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Stock-based compensation expense\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>547 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,975 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table> Gross Profit\nTable 263: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2014 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Amount </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>% of\nRevenue </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Amount </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>% of\nRevenue </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Amount </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(dollars in thousands) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gross profit\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>248,357 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>39 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>316,280 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>43 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>67,923 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>27 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table> Gross profit increased by $67.9 million, or 27%, from $248.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 to $316.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. Approximately $56.2 million of the increase was primarily attributable to increases in our subscriber base, including acquired subscribers. Additionally, $11.7 million was attributable to a net decrease in amortization expense. Our gross profit as a percentage of revenue increased by four percentage points from 39% for the year ended December 31, 2014 to 43% for the year ended December 31, 2015. This increase was primarily attributable to lower amortization of intangible assets, which decreased to 12% of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to 16% for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nThe following table sets forth gross profit and the significant non-cash components of cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue:\nTable 264: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2014 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(dollars in thousands) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>629,845 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>741,315 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gross profit\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>248,357 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>316,280 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gross profit % of revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>39 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>43 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Amortization expense % of revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Depreciation expense % of revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Stock-based compensation expense % of revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>* </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>* </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 265: <table> <tr> <td>* </td> <td>Less than 1%. </td> </tr>\n</table> Operating Expense\nTable 266: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2014 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Amount </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>% of\nRevenue </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Amount </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>% of\nRevenue </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Amount </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(dollars in thousands) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Sales and marketing\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>146,797 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>23 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>145,419 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>20 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(1,378 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1 </td> <td>)% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Engineering and development\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>19,549 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>26,707 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,158 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>37 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> General and administrative\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>69,533 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>90,968 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>21,435 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>31 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>235,879 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>37 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>263,094 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>35 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>27,215 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table> Sales and Marketing. Sales and marketing expense decreased by $1.4 million, or 1%, from $146.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 to $145.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease in sales and marketing expense was primarily attributable to lower introductory product marketing spend for certain products, including cloud storage products, as our subscriber base became more familiar with these products. We expect to increase marketing expense in the near term by investing in new marketing programs.\nEngineering and Development. Engineering and development expense increased by $7.2 million, or 37%, from $19.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 to $26.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. Of this increase, $5.2 million was due to an increase in payroll and benefits to support the growth in our business, $1.1 million was due to an increase in stock-based compensation expense, $1.2 million was due to consulting costs incurred in connection with our restructuring activities and $0.5 million was due to an increase in depreciation expense, partially offset by a $0.8 million reduction in integration and restructuring costs.\nGeneral and Administrative. General and administrative expense increased by $21.4 million, or 31%, from $69.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 to $90.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The year-over-year increase consisted of a $3.9 million increase in personnel and facilities related costs to support the growth of our business, a $9.7 million increase in stock-based compensation, of which $5.9 million is related to the grant of a performance-based restricted stock award to our chief executive officer. In addition, the increase in general and administrative expense includes $1.3 million of additional legal advisory expense, a $5.5 million increase in transaction expenses primarily due to the acquisition of Constant Contact, $0.7 million of follow-on offering expenses incurred on behalf of the selling stockholders during the March 2015 follow-on offering and a $0.3 million increase in depreciation expense.\nOther Income (Expense), Net\nTable 267: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended\nDecember 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2014 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Amount </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(dollars in thousands) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other expense, net\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(57,083 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(52,974 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,109 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table> Other expense, net decreased by $4.1 million, or 7%, from $57.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 to $53.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. This decrease is primarily due to a $5.4 million gain as a result of the redemption of our equity interest in World Wide Web Hosting and a $0.1 million decrease in interest expense related to capital lease obligations. The decrease was partially offset by a $0.5 million increase in interest expense related to amounts drawn down on our revolving credit facility during the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared with the year ended December 31, 2014 and $1.1 million of accretion of present value for the deferred consideration related to the Webzai, BuyDomains and Ace acquisitions.\nIncome Tax Expense (Benefit)\nTable 268: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended\nDecember 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2014 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Amount </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(dollars in thousands) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income tax expense\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>6,186 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>11,342 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,156 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>83 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table> Income tax expense increased by $5.2 million, or 83%, from $6.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 to $11.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase consisted of a net increase in our deferred tax expense of $3.5 million and a net increase in our current federal, state and foreign income tax expense of $1.7 million. The net increase in our deferred tax expense from December 31, 2014 to December 31, 2015 was primarily attributable to a $9.9 million increase in federal, state and foreign deferred tax expense, partially offset by a $6.4 million decrease in provisions for the valuation allowance. In the year ended December 31, 2015, we had nondeductible expenses primarily related to stock-based compensation, transaction costs, other foreign permanent differences and a nontaxable gain on the redemption of our equity interest in World Wide Web Hosting.\nComparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2013 and 2014\nRevenue\nTable 269: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2013 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2014 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Amount </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(dollars in thousands) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>520,296 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>629,845 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>109,549 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>21 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table> Revenue increased by $109.5 million, or 21%, from $520.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 to $629.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. Of this increase, $31.3 million was related to revenues from our acquisition of Directi and $78.2 million was primarily due to an increase in subscribers including acquired subscribers on our platform as we expanded lead-in products such as back-up and storage and focused our marketing on attracting new subscribers, and selling more of our products such as our web presence bundle, domains, site back-up, security and SEO/SEM solutions. In addition, increases in prices paid by our subscribers at renewals or after expiration of promotional periods contributed to the increase in revenues. Consistent with our plans, as we completed the integration of the 2012 acquisitions of HostGator and Homestead onto our integrated technology platform, we were able to increase our marketing spend to drive additional subscriber signups and also enhance the promotion of our products and services through improved business insight and analytics offered through the integrated technology platform.\nCost of Revenue\nTable 270: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2013 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2014 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Amount </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>% of\nRevenue </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Amount </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>% of\nRevenue </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Amount </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(dollars in thousands) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cost of revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>350,103 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>67 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>381,488 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>61 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>31,385 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table> Cost of revenue increased by $31.4 million, or 9%, from $350.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 to $381.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. Of this increase of $31.4 million, $28.5 million was attributable to the acquisition of Directi, including an amortization charge of $6.0 million and a depreciation charge of $0.7 million. In addition, depreciation expense increased by $11.1 million to $28.3 million excluding the depreciation charge attributable to Directi while domain registration costs increased by $5.7 million and costs attributable to third-party products and services increased by $6.3 million. Stock-based compensation expense increased by approximately $0.4 million from $0.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 to $0.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. In addition, we recorded $1.8 million of facilities costs associated with closing our office in Englewood, Colorado and a $0.5 million severance charge. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in data center expenses of $7.7 million and support expenses of $6.0 million, in each case resulting from the migration of HostGator and Homestead subscribers onto our platform, as well as a $9.2 million decrease in amortization expense from $105.9 million to $96.7 million, excluding the amortization charge of $6.0 million attributable to Directi.\nOur cost of revenue contains a significant portion of non-cash expenses, in particular amortization expense for the intangible assets we have acquired through our acquisitions and the Sponsor Acquisition.

Additionally, $3.2 million was attributable to a net decrease in amortization expense. The increase in our gross profit was partially offset by $1.8 million of facilities costs associated with closing our office in Englewood, Colorado and $0.5 million of severance charges incurred during the year ended December 31, 2014.\nThe following table sets forth gross profit and the significant non-cash components of cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue:\nTable 273: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2013 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2014 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(dollars in thousands) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>520,296 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>629,845 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gross profit\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>170,193 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>248,357 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gross profit % of revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>33 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>39 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Amortization expense % of revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>20 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Depreciation expense % of revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Stock-based compensation expense % of revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>* </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>* </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 274: <table> <tr> <td>* </td> <td>Less than 1%. </td> </tr>\n</table> Operating Expense\nTable 275: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2013 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2014 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Amount </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>% of\nRevenue </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Amount </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>% of\nRevenue </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Amount </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(dollars in thousands) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Sales and marketing\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>117,689 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>23 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>146,797 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>23 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>29,108 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>25 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Engineering and development\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>23,205 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>19,549 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(3,656 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(16 </td> <td>)% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> General and administrative\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>92,347 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>69,533 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(22,814 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(25 </td> <td>)% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>233,241 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>45 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>235,879 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>37 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,638 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table> Sales and Marketing. Sales and marketing expense increased by $29.1 million, or 25%, from $117.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 to $146.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. In addition to investing in marketing expense for the acquisition of new subscribers, we have increased our investment in product marketing. The increase in sales and marketing spend is primarily attributable to an increase of $26.8 million in product marketing spend, $1.2 million in stock-based compensation expense, and $0.5 million in depreciation expense. In addition, net payroll and commission expense increased by $0.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 as we changed our commission structure, and we also incurred $0.3 million of severance charges as a result of our implementation of plans to consolidated sales and marketing operations.\nEngineering and Development. Engineering and development expense decreased by $3.7 million, or 16%, from $23.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 to $19.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. Of this decrease, $5.8 million was due to a reduction in integration and restructuring costs as we completed our integration of 2012 acquisitions at the end of 2013, and $3.2 million was due to capitalizing certain software development costs in connection with our investment in improvements to our infrastructure and technology platform. This was partially offset by $2.5 million of additional expense related to our expansion of our international footprint, a $1.2 million increase in payroll and benefits and a $0.6 million increase in stock-based compensation expense from $0.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 to $0.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. In addition, we recorded $1.0 million of severance charges for the year ended December 31, 2014 as a result of our implementation of plans to consolidate our engineering and development operations.\nGeneral and Administrative. General and administrative expense decreased by $22.8 million, or 25%, from $92.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 to $69.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The year over year decrease consisted of a $9.1 million decrease in transaction expenses and a decrease of $23.6\nmillion related to bonus payments made in 2013 in connection with our IPO, partially offset by an increase in stock-based compensation of $3.1 million from $9.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 to $13.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, an increase of $6.0 million to support the growth of our business and an increase of $0.8 million in severance and related facilities costs associated with the closure of our Redwood City, California offices.\nNet Interest Expense\nTable 276: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended\nDecember 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2013 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2014 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Amount </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(dollars in thousands) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net interest expense\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(98,327 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(57,083 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>41,244 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>42 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table> Net interest expense decreased by $41.2 million, or 42%, from $98.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 to $57.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. Of this decrease, $33.6 million is due to lower interest expense resulting from our debt refinancing activities in November 2013, which lowered our aggregate notes payable and our effective interest rate. We also incurred $6.3 million of debt prepayment fees in 2013 that we did not have in 2014. The decrease is also due to a $1.7 million reduction in the accretion of present value for the deferred consideration and deferred bonus payments related to the HostGator acquisition, paid in January 2014, which was offset by accretion of $0.2 million for the present value for the deferred consideration in 2014 related to the Webzai and BuyDomains acquisitions, and a $0.3 million reduction in other interest expense. These decreases were partially offset by $0.5 million related to capitalized lease obligations which were entered into during the year ended December 31, 2014.\nIncome Tax Expense (Benefit)\nTable 277: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended\nDecember 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2013 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2014 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Amount </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(dollars in thousands) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income tax expense (benefit)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(3,596 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>6,186 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>9,782 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>272 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table> The expense for income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2014 decreased by $9.8 million, or 272%, from a $3.6 million benefit for the year ended December 31, 2013 to a $6.2 million expense for the year ended December 31, 2014. The decrease consisted of a net increase in our state and foreign income tax expense of $1.4 million and a net increase in our deferred tax expense of $8.4 million. The decrease in our deferred tax benefit from December 31, 2013 to December 31, 2014 was primarily attributable to the different book and tax treatment for goodwill and intangible assets recorded due to acquisitions. We expect to continue to incur deferred tax expenses in the near term. In the year ended December 31, 2014, we had nondeductible expenses primarily related to stock-based compensation, transaction costs and other foreign permanent differences.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nSources of Liquidity\nWe have funded our operations since inception primarily with cash flow generated by operations, borrowings under our credit facilities and public offerings of our securities. Between the end of 2011 and our IPO, we raised additional debt through a series of refinancings. Historically, we have used debt primarily to finance our acquisition related activities. During 2014 and 2015, we used borrowings under our revolving credit facility to help meet our funding requirements for our acquisitions and minority investments. We expect to continue to use our revolving credit facility for similar investing and financing activities. In October 2013, we closed our IPO and received net proceeds of $232.1 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and\ncommissions and offering expenses payable by us. On November 25, 2013, we increased our revolving credit facility to $125.0 million and entered into a new first lien term loan facility of $1,050.0 million. The proceeds of the new first lien term loan facility, together with a portion of the net proceeds from our IPO, were used to refinance our existing first and second lien term loan facilities, which reduced our overall indebtedness by $148.8 million to $1,050.0 million. In November 2014, we raised funds from the sale of 3,000,000 shares of our common stock in our follow on offering, and received net proceeds of $41.1 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering related expenses payable by us. We used a portion of the net proceeds to reduce the outstanding balance of our revolving credit facility and $15.2 million to fund our investment in a 40% ownership interest in AppMachine.\nDuring 2015, we paid 5.00% interest on our first lien term loan, which is based on adjusted LIBOR plus 400 basis points, subject to a LIBOR floor of 1.00%, and between 7.75% and 8.50% interest on our revolving credit facility borrowings. As of December 31, 2015, the LIBOR-based interest rates on our first lien term loan facility and revolving credit facility were 5.00% and 7.75%. During 2015, we were required to make quarterly principal repayments of $2.6 million under our first lien term loan facility.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had cash and cash equivalents totaling $33.0 million and negative working capital of $370.3 million, which included the $10.5 million current portion of the first lien term loan facility, and $67.0 million drawn under our $125.0 million revolving credit facility. In addition, we had approximately $1,015.9 million of long term indebtedness outstanding under our first lien term loan facility, which matures on November 9, 2019. We also had $365.6 million of short-term and long-term deferred revenue, which is not expected to be payable in cash.\nConstant Contact Acquisition\nIn connection with our acquisition of Constant Contact on February 9, 2016, we entered into a $735 million incremental first lien term loan facility and a new $165 million revolving credit facility, and our wholly owned subsidiary EIG Investors issued $350 million aggregate principal amount of 10.875% senior notes due 2024. We refer to the incremental first lien term loan facility and new revolving credit facility, together with our previously existing first lien term loan facility, as the \u201cSenior Credit Facilities,\u201d and to the 10.875% senior notes due 2024 as the \u201cNotes\u201d.\nIncremental First Lien Term Loan Facility\nOn February 9, 2016, we entered into an incremental first lien term loan amendment to our existing credit agreement. Pursuant to this amendment, we obtained a seven-year $735 million incremental first lien term loan facility, which is in addition to our existing first lien term loan facility. The full amount of this incremental first lien term loan facility was drawn immediately following the effectiveness of the amendment.\nThis incremental first lien term loan facility will mature in seven years, was issued at a price of 97% of par (subject to the payment of an additional upfront fee of 1.0% on February 28, 2016 under certain circumstances), bears interest at a rate of LIBOR plus 5.0% per annum, subject to a LIBOR floor of 1.0% per annum, and has scheduled amortization of 0.50% per quarter.\nAs a result of the \u201cmost-favored nation\u201d pricing provision in our existing credit agreement, the interest rate on our existing first lien term loan facility has increased to LIBOR plus 5.23% per annum (and will further step up to LIBOR plus 5.48% per annum on February 28, 2016 under certain circumstances), subject to a LIBOR floor of 1.0% per annum. In addition, we are obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to make voluntary prepayments on our existing first lien term loan facility to effectively double the amount of each scheduled amortization payment under that facility (which is 0.25% per quarter of the principal outstanding as of November 25, 2013).\nRevolving Credit Facility\nAlso on February 9, 2016, we entered into a revolving facility amendment to our existing credit agreement. Pursuant to this amendment, we obtained a five-year $165 million revolving credit facility, which replaced our existing $125 million revolving credit facility. Loans under the facility will bear interest at a rate of LIBOR plus 4.0% per annum (subject to a leverage-based step-down), without a LIBOR floor. This revolving credit facility has a \u201cspringing\u201d maturity date of August 10, 2019 unless the existing first lien term loan facility has been repaid in full or otherwise extended to at least 91 days after the maturity of the revolving credit facility.\nLoans under the Senior Credit Facilities are also subject to a base rate option, with interest rate spreads of 1.0% per annum less than those applicable to LIBOR-based loans.\nThe Senior Credit Facilities have been fully and unconditionally guaranteed, on a senior unsecured basis, by us and certain of our subsidiaries (including Constant Contact and its subsidiaries).\n10.875% Senior Notes due 2024\nOn February 9, 2016, EIG Investors issued $350 million aggregate principal amount of Notes. The Notes will mature in February 2024, were issued at a price of 98.065% of par and will bear interest at the rate of 10.875% per annum. The Notes have been fully and unconditionally guaranteed, on a senior unsecured basis, by us and our subsidiaries that guarantee the Senior Credit Facilities (including Constant Contact and its subsidiaries).\nIn connection with the issuance of the Notes, we agreed to assist the initial purchasers of the Notes in marketing the Notes. In addition, we entered into a registration rights agreement with the initial purchasers of the Notes, which provides the holders of the Notes certain rights relating to registration of the Notes under the Securities Act.\nPursuant to the registration rights agreement, we will, among other obligations, use commercially reasonable efforts to file an exchange offer registration statement with respect to a registered offer, or the Exchange Offer, to exchange the Notes for substantially identical notes and consummate the Exchange Offer within 365 days after the issuance of the Notes. We will also, use commercially reasonable efforts to cause to become effective a shelf registration statement to cover resales of the Notes by the beneficial owners thereof who satisfy certain conditions relating to the provision of information in connection with the shelf registration statement. A registration default will occur if, among other things, (1) we fail to consummate the Exchange Offer or have the shelf registration statement become effective on or before the date that is 365 days after the issue date or (2) the shelf registration statement becomes effective but thereafter ceases to be effective or usable in connection with the resale of Notes (subject to certain exceptions) during the periods specified in the registration rights agreement. If a registration default occurs with respect to the Notes, the annual interest rate of the Notes will be increased by 0.25% per annum and will increase again by 0.25% per annum 90 days thereafter until all registration defaults have been cured, up to a maximum amount of additional interest of 0.50% per annum. We will also use commercially reasonable efforts to cause to become effective a registration statement providing for the registration of certain secondary transactions in the Notes by Goldman, Sachs & Co. and its affiliates.\nDebt Covenants\nSenior Credit Facilities\nThe Senior Credit Facilities require that we comply with a financial covenant to maintain a maximum ratio of net first lien debt to EBITDA (as defined in our existing credit agreement).\nThe Senior Credit Facilities contain covenants that limit our ability to, among other things, incur additional debt or issue certain preferred shares; pay dividends on or make other distributions in respect of capital stock;\nmake other restricted payments; make certain investments; sell or transfer certain assets; create liens on certain assets to secure debt; consolidate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets; and enter into certain transactions with affiliates. Additionally, the Senior Credit Facilities require us to comply with certain negative covenants and specify certain events of default that could result in amounts becoming payable, in whole or in part, prior to their maturity dates. We were in compliance with all covenants at December 31, 2015.\nWith the exception of certain equity interests and other excluded assets under the terms of the Senior Credit Facilities, substantially all of our assets are pledged as collateral for the obligations under the Senior Credit Facilities.\nNotes\nThe indenture with respect to the Notes contains covenants that limit our ability to, among other things, incur additional debt or issue certain preferred shares; pay dividends on or make other distributions in respect of capital stock; make other restricted payments; make certain investments; sell or transfer certain assets; create liens on certain assets to secure debt; consolidate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets; and enter into certain transactions with affiliates. Upon a change of control as defined in the Indenture, we or EIG Investors must offer to repurchase the Notes at 101% of the aggregate principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, up to, but not including, the repurchase date. These covenants are subject to a number of important limitations and exceptions.\nThe indenture also provides for events of default, which, if any of them occurs, may permit or, in certain circumstances, require the principal, premium, if any, interest and any other monetary obligations on all the then outstanding Notes to be due and payable immediately.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nAs of December 31, 2015, our cash and cash equivalents were primarily held for working capital purposes and for required principal and interest payments under our indebtedness. A majority of our cash and cash equivalents was held in operating accounts. Our cash and cash equivalents increased by $0.6 million from $32.4 million at December 31, 2014 to $33.0 million at December 31, 2015. We used cash on hand at December 31, 2014, along with cash flows from operations and a net draw against our revolving credit facility of $17.0 million to fund our acquisition and minority investment activity described under financing and investing activities below. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors including, but not limited to acquisitions, our growth rate, expansion of sales and marketing activities, the introduction of new and enhanced products and services, market acceptance of our solutions and our gross profits and operating expenses. We believe that our current cash and cash equivalents and operating cash flows will be sufficient to meet our anticipated working capital and capital expenditure requirements, as well as our required principal and interest payments under our indebtedness, for at least the next 12 months.\nThe following table shows our purchases of property and equipment, principal payments on capital lease obligations, depreciation, amortization and cash flows from operating activities, investing activities and financing activities for the stated periods:\nTable 278: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Years ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2013 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2014 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(in thousands) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Purchases of property and equipment\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(33,523 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(23,904 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(31,243 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Principal payments on capital lease obligations\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(3,608 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(4,822 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Depreciation\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18,615 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>30,956 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>34,010 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Amortization\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>110,273 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>102,989 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>92,403 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash flows provided by operating activities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>32,616 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>142,893 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>177,228 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash flows used in investing activities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(73,087 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(151,315 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(133,801 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash flows provided by (used in) financing activities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>84,288 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(25,936 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(41,632 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n</table>\nCapital Expenditures\nOur capital expenditures on the purchase of property and equipment for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2015 were $23.9 million and $31.2 million, respectively. The higher property and equipment expenditures in the year ended December 31, 2015 consisted primarily of an investment in data center infrastructure. In addition, our capital expenditures during the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2015 includes $3.6 million and $4.8 million, respectively, of principal payments under capital leases for software. The remaining balance payable on the capital leases is $13.1 million as of December 31, 2015. For the next twelve months, we expect our capital expenditures to be generally consistent with the combined level of capital expenditures of Endurance and Constant Contact during 2015.\nDepreciation\nOur depreciation expense for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2015 increased from $31.0 million to $34.0 million, respectively. This increase was primarily due to expansion in our business by on-boarding acquisitions as well as investments in data center infrastructure and leasehold improvements. The leasehold improvements were associated with operating leases as we expanded and revamped our presence in Massachusetts.\nAmortization\nOur amortization expense, which includes amortization of other intangible assets, amortization of deferred financing costs and amortization of net present value of deferred consideration, decreased by $10.6 million from $103.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 to $92.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. Of this decrease in amortization expense, $16.1 million was primarily due to lower amortization expense related to acquisitions that occurred prior to December 31, 2014, partially offset by $4.4 million of amortization expense related to intangible assets of businesses that have been acquired since January 1, 2015. In addition, partially offsetting the decrease was a $1.1 million increase attributable to higher amortization expense of net present value of deferred consideration as a result of our Webzai, BuyDomains and Ace acquisitions in August 2014, September 2014 and September 2015, respectively.\nOperating Activities\nCash provided by operating activities consists primarily of net loss adjusted for certain non-cash items including depreciation, amortization, stock-based compensation expense and changes in deferred taxes, and the effect of changes in working capital, in particular in deferred revenue. As we add subscribers to our platform, we typically collect subscription fees at the time of initial billing and recognize revenue over the terms of the subscriptions. Accordingly, we generate operating cash flows as we collect cash from our subscribers in advance of delivering the related products and services, and we maintain a significant deferred revenue balance. As we add subscribers and sell additional products and services, our deferred revenue balance increases. Our operating cash flows are net of transaction expenses and charges, including IPO expenses during fiscal year 2013.\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $177.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared with $142.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. Net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2015 consisted of net loss of $25.8 million, non-cash charges of $173.7 million and a net change of $29.3 million in our operating assets and liabilities. The net change in our operating assets and liabilities included an increase in deferred revenue of $34.2 million, which was $33.5 million less than in the same period in 2014 and also included an increase in prepaid domain name registry fees of $8.1 million.\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $142.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared with $32.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. The increase in the year ended December 31, 2014 consisted of a net loss of $50.9 million, offset by non-cash charges of $153.9 million, a cash\ndividend of $0.2 million from a minority investment and a net change of $39.7 million in our operating assets and liabilities. The net change in our operating assets and liabilities included an increase in deferred revenue of $67.7 million, which was $16.7 million greater than in the same period in 2013 and also included an increase in prepaid domain name registry fees of $30.5 million which was $24.7 million greater than in the same period in 2013. In addition, we reduced our interest payments by $43.4 million.\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $32.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2013 which consisted of a net loss of $159.8 million, offset by non-cash charges of $147.6 million, and a net change of $44.8 million in our operating assets and liabilities. The net change in our operating assets and liabilities included an increase in deferred revenue of $51.0 million.\nInvesting Activities\nCash flows used in investing activities consist primarily of purchase of property and equipment, acquisition consideration payments, and changes in restricted cash balances.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015 we used $97.8 million of cash, net of cash acquired, for the purchase consideration of our acquisitions of Verio, World Wide Web Hosting, Ace and Ecommerce. In addition, we used $8.5 million to make an additional investment in our joint venture with WZ UK Ltd. We also used $31.1 million of cash to purchase property and equipment, net of proceeds from disposals of $0.1 million, and purchased intangible assets of $0.1 million. These were partially offset by a net return of $0.1 million of restricted cash held by a payment processor and $0.2 million of proceeds from sale of assets. In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2015 we received a $3.5 million repayment on a note receivable related to our equity ownership in World Wide Web Hosting.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2014 we used $93.7 million in cash, net of cash acquired, for the purchase consideration for our acquisitions of the web presence business of Directi, Webzai, the BuyDomains assets, the assets of Arvixe, LLC and our purchase of a domain name business. In addition, we used $15.0 million to acquire a minority interest in Automattic, Inc., $15.2 million to acquire a 40% minority interest in AppMachine, and $3.9 million to invest in a joint venture with WZ UK Ltd. and acquire a 49% interest in that company. We also used $23.9 million of cash to purchase property and equipment and $0.2 million to purchase certain intangible assets and received proceeds from disposals of $0.2 million. These were partially offset by a net return of $0.4 million of restricted cash held by a payment processor.\nThe majority of the cash used during the year ended December 31, 2013 was to purchase $33.5 million of property and equipment, in particular for the migration of HostGator subscribers to our platform and $31.0 million to obtain a controlling interest in JDI Backup, Ltd. We also used $2.4 million, net of cash acquired, for initial consideration for an acquisition in Brazil, $5.0 million for a payment to Directi Web Technologies Holdings in August 2013, upon our agreement to acquire the Directi web presence business, $0.8 million to purchase intangible assets and a $0.2 million for a net deposit of restricted cash held by a payment processor.\nFinancing Activities\nCash flow from financing activities consists primarily of the net change in our overall indebtedness, payment of associated financing costs, payment of deferred consideration for our acquisitions and the issuance or repurchase of equity.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, cash flows used in financing activities was $41.6 million, which included a payment of $30.5 million under our agreement to increase our investment in JDI Backup Ltd. from 67% to 100%. We also paid $15.0 million of deferred consideration during the year ended December 31, 2015, $10.5 million of principal payments under our first lien term loan facility and $4.8 million of principal payments related to capital lease obligations. These items were partially offset by $2.2 million of proceeds we received from the exercise of stock options. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we borrowed in aggregate $147.0 million against our revolving credit facility and repaid in aggregate $130.0 million.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2014, cash flows used in financing activities was $25.9 million, which includes $98.3 million of deferred consideration paid during the period, the majority of which was for our Directi, HostGator and domain name business acquisitions, offset by net borrowings against our revolving credit facility of $50.0 million, principal payments of $10.5 million under our first lien term loan facility, a $4.2 million payment to increase our investment in JDI Backup Ltd. and $3.6 million of principal payments related to capital lease obligations. During the year ended December 31, 2014, we borrowed in aggregate $150.0 million against our revolving credit facility and repaid in aggregate $100.0 million of the amount borrowed. We received gross proceeds from our follow-on offering of $43.5 million less capitalized issuance costs of $2.2 million. In addition, we made payments of $0.7 million related to issuance costs from our IPO which were unpaid as of December 31, 2013 and we received $0.1 million of proceeds from the exercise of stock options during the year ended December 31, 2014. During the year ended December 31, 2014, we entered into a three-year capital lease agreement for $11.7 million for software licenses which required principal payments of approximately $0.9 million each quarter in 2014.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2013, cash flow provided by financing activities net of repayments was $84.3 million. We received gross proceeds from our IPO of $252.6 million less capitalized issuance costs paid of $17.5 million. An additional $0.7 million of capitalized issuance costs was unpaid as of December 31, 2013. In August of 2013 we increased our first lien term loan by $90.0 million, borrowed in aggregate $57.0 million against our revolving credit facility and repaid in aggregate $72.0 million under that facility as well as $6.2 million under our first lien term loan facility. In November 2013, we repaid our second lien term loan of $315.0 million in full and increased our first lien term loan by $166.2 million, resulting in an overall reduction in our bank debt by $148.8 million to $1,050.0 million. At the end of December 2013, we made a quarterly principal payment of $2.6 million. In addition, we paid $55.6 million of deferred consideration obligations outstanding at December 31, 2012, the majority of which was for our HostGator acquisition.\nOn January 6, 2016, we paid $2.1 million to increase our stake in WZ UK Ltd from 49% to 57.5%, and on February 9, 2016, we closed the Constant Contact acquisition and concurrently entered into the financing transactions described above under \u201cConstant Contact Acquisition.\u201d\nNet Operating Loss Carry-Forwards\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had net operating loss, or NOL, carry-forwards available to offset future U.S. federal taxable income of approximately $97.8 million and future state taxable income of approximately $111.2 million. These NOL carry-forwards expire on various dates through 2034. Approximately $1.6 million of the U.S. federal NOL carry-forwards and $0.7 million of the state NOL carry-forward are from excess stock-based compensation, for which the benefit will be recorded to additional-paid in capital when recognized. In addition, as of December 31, 2015, we had NOL carry-forwards in foreign jurisdictions available to offset future foreign taxable income by approximately $27.4 million. We have loss carry-forwards in India totaling $2.9 million that expire in 2021. We also have loss carry-forwards in the United Kingdom, Israel and Singapore of $23.4 million, $0.9 million, and $0.2 million, respectively, which have an indefinite carry-forward period.\nUtilization of the NOL carry-forwards can be subject to an annual limitation due to the ownership percentage change limitations under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code or Section 382 limitation. Ownership changes can limit the amount of net operating loss and other tax attributes that a company can use each year to offset future taxable income and taxes payable. In connection with a change in control in 2011 we were subject to Section 382 annual limitations of $77.1 million against the balance of NOL carry-forwards generated prior to the change in control in 2011. Through December 31, 2014 we accumulated the unused amount of Section 382 limitations in excess of the amount of NOL carry-forwards that were originally subject to limitation. Therefore, these unused NOL carry-forwards are available for future use to offset taxable income. We completed an analysis of changes in our ownership from 2011, through our IPO, to December 31, 2013 and concluded that there was not a Section 382 ownership change during this period and therefore any NOLs generated through December 31, 2013 will not be subject to any new Section 382 annual limitations on NOL\ncarry-forwards. On November 20, 2014, we completed a follow-on offering of 13,000,000 shares of common stock. The underwriters also exercised their overallotment option to purchase an additional 1,950,000 shares of common stock from the selling stockholders. We performed an analysis of the impact of this offering and determined that no Section 382 change in ownership has occurred. As a result, all unused NOL carry-forwards at December 31, 2014 were available for future use to offset taxable income.\nOn March 11, 2015, the Company closed a follow-on offering of its common stock, in which selling stockholders sold 12,000,000 shares of common stock at a public offering price of $19.00 per share. The underwriter also exercised its overallotment option to purchase an additional 1,800,000 shares of common stock from the selling stockholders. The Company is currently completing an analysis of its ownership changes from March 2015 through December 31, 2015, but does not believe the outcome of this analysis will result in an additional ownership change based on the information available at this time.\nBacklog and Deferred Revenue\nWe define our backlog as the total committed value of our contracts which have not been recognized as revenue at the end of a period. Since we require prepayments for all our products and services, our backlog is equal to our deferred revenue balance. Our backlog as of December 31, 2014 and 2015 was $325.4 million and $365.6 million, respectively. Because revenue for any period is a function of revenue recognized from deferred revenue under contracts in existence at the beginning of a period, as well as contract renewals and new customer contracts during the period, backlog at the beginning of any period is not necessarily indicative of future performance. Our presentation of backlog may differ from other companies in our industry.\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nOur principal commitments consist of obligations under our outstanding debt facilities, which in 2015 included a quarterly principal repayment against our first lien term loan facility of $2.6 million per quarter, interest payments on our term loan facilities, which are typically three-month LIBOR loans, non-cancelable leases for our office space, deferred payment obligations related to acquisitions, and purchase obligations under material contracts. The following table summarizes these contractual obligations as of December 31, 2015:\nTable 279: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Payments due by period </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Less\nthan 1 year </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1-3 years </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3-5 years </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>More\nthan 5 years </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(in thousands) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Long-term debt obligations:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Principal payments on term loan facility\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,026,375 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>10,500 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>21,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>994,875 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest payments on term loan facility(1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>198,513 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>51,973 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>102,064 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>44,476 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revolving credit facility\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>67,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>67,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Capital lease obligations\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13,804 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,334 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,470 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating lease obligations\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>71,954 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9,247 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18,980 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17,555 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>26,172 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Deferred consideration(2)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>52,301 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>51,488 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>813 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Purchase commitments\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>23,734 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13,778 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9,123 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>833 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,453,681 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>210,320 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>159,450 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,057,739 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>26,172 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 280: <table> <tr> <td>(1) </td> <td>Term loan facility interest rate is based on adjusted LIBOR plus 400 basis points for the first lien term loan facility, subject to a LIBOR floor of 1.00%.

The consideration for each of the three tranches is calculated as the product of AppMachine's revenue, as defined in the investment agreement, for the trailing twelve-month period prior to the applicable determination date times a specified multiple based upon year over year revenue growth, multiplied by 20%.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), or ASU 2014-09, which supersedes nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance under U.S. GAAP. The core principle of ASU 2014-09 is to recognize revenues when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled for those goods or services. ASU 2014-09 defines a five step process to achieve this core principle and, in doing so, more judgments and estimates may be required within the revenue recognition process than are required under existing U.S. GAAP. In July 2015, the FASB approved a one-year deferral of the effective date to January 1, 2018, with early adoption to be permitted as of the original effective date of January 1, 2017. Once this standard becomes effective, companies may use either of the following transition methods: (i) a full retrospective approach reflecting the application of the standard in each reporting period with the option to elect certain practical expedients, or (ii) a retrospective approach with the cumulative effect of initially adopting ASU 2014-09 recognized at the date of adoption (which includes additional footnote disclosures). We are currently evaluating the impact of our pending adoption of ASU 2014-09 on our consolidated financial statements and have not yet determined the method by which we will adopt the standard.\nIn February 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-02, Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis, or ASU 2015-02. This new guidance provides a revised consolidation model that reporting entities use to evaluate partnerships and similar entities, evaluate service providers and decision makers as they relate to a variable interest entity, referred to as a VIE, and examine how related party interests in a VIE can affect the consolidation of that VIE. ASU 2015-02 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015 with early adoption permitted. We believe the adoption of ASU 2015-02 does not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn April 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-03, Interest-Imputation of Interest, Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs, or ASU 2015-03. This new guidance changes the balance sheet presentation for deferred financing costs from being presented as an asset to being a deduction from the related recognized liability. ASU 2015-03 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016. We believe the adoption of ASU 2015-03 does not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn April 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-05, Intangibles Goodwill and Other-Internal Use Software (Subtopic 350-40): Customer's Accounting for Fees Paid in a Cloud Computing Arrangement. This new guidance will help entities evaluate the accounting for fees paid by a customer in a cloud computing arrangement by providing guidance as to whether an arrangement includes the sale or license of software. ASU 2015-05 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015. We believe the adoption of ASU 2015-05 does not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn September 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-16, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments. This new guidance requires an acquirer to recognize\nadjustments to provisional amounts that are identified during the measurement period in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined. The acquirer needs to record, in the same period's financial statements, the effect on earnings of changes in depreciation, amortization or other income effects, if any, as a result of the provisional amounts, calculated as if the accounting had been completed as of the acquisition date. ASU 2015-16 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015. We believe the adoption of ASU 2015-16 does not have a material effect on our accounting processes, however the ASU will affect our disclosures as we are required to disclose the adjustments made during the measurement period and their effect on the period's earnings.\nIn November 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-17, Income Taxes: Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes, or ASU 2015-17. This new guidance requires that deferred tax liabilities and assets be classified as noncurrent in the balance sheet, in order to simplify the presentation of deferred income taxes. ASU 2015-17 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016. We believe the adoption of ASU 2015-17 does not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-02, Leases. The new standard establishes a right-of-use (ROU) model that requires a lessee to record a ROU asset and a lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases with terms longer than 12 months. Leases will be classified as either finance or operating, with classification affecting the pattern of expense recognition in the income statement. The new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. A modified retrospective transition approach is required for lessees for capital and operating leases existing at, or entered into after, the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements, with certain practical expedients available. We are currently evaluating the impact of our pending adoption of the new standard on our consolidated financial statements.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe do not have any special purpose

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nYou should read the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations together with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes and other financial information included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve significant risks and uncertainties. As a result of many factors, such as those set forth in Part I, Item 1A. \u201cRisk Factors\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements.\nOverview\nWe are a leading provider of cloud-based platform solutions designed to help small and medium-sized businesses, or SMBs, succeed online. Leveraging our proprietary technology platform, we serve approximately 4.7 million subscribers globally with a comprehensive and integrated suite of over 150 products and services that help SMBs get online, get found and grow their businesses. Historically, our products focused largely on web hosting and other basic web presence solutions such as domains, but over time we have expanded to offer security, site backup, SEO and SEM, Google Adwords, mobile solutions, social media enablement, website analytics, email marketing and productivity and e-commerce tools, among others. More recently, we have launched additional products and services, including website builders, mobile site builders, cloud hosting solutions, premium domains and cloud storage solutions, both to satisfy existing subscriber needs and to expand the product gateways through which new subscribers initially reach us.\nOver our 18-year history, we have refined our platform and our analytics to collect insights into the needs and aspirations of our subscribers. These insights allow us to engage our subscribers in timely and compelling ways, driving significant business value for them. We believe that our platform delivers cloud-based solutions quickly, cost-effectively, reliably and securely. These strengths and capabilities help us attract and retain subscribers, who then demand additional products and services from us over time.\nOur revenue has grown from $520.3 million for fiscal year 2013 to $629.8 million for fiscal year 2014 and to $741.3 million for fiscal year 2015. This growth in our revenue was driven by acquisitions and by increasing product offerings and subscribers. Our net loss attributable to Endurance International Group Holdings, Inc. was $159.2 million for fiscal year 2013, which dropped to $42.8 million for fiscal year 2014, and dropped further to $25.8 million for fiscal year 2015. The decreases in our net loss are primarily attributable to the growth in our revenue, and to a lesser extent, one-time costs incurred for our initial public offering in fiscal year 2013.\nRecent Developments\nConstant Contact Acquisition\nOn October 30, 2015, we entered into a definitive agreement pursuant to which we agreed to acquire all of the outstanding shares of common stock of Constant Contact for $32.00 per share in cash, for a total purchase price of approximately $1.1 billion. Constant Contact is a leading provider of online marketing tools that are designed for small organizations, including small businesses, associations and non-profits. The acquisition closed on February 9, 2016.\nExpected benefits of the acquisition include:\n \u2022 Extension of Endurance's product offerings. We will increase our product portfolio of solutions and integrated products through the addition of Constant Contact's suite of online marketing tools such as email marketing, event management, social media integration and contact management systems. We expect to offer Constant Contact's email marketing products alongside our existing products, thereby expanding our position as a leading provider of end-to-end web presence and marketing solutions for SMBs. \n \u2022 Extension of Endurance's core capabilities. Constant Contact has historically focused heavily on product development, and specifically on user experience, subscriber analytics and engagement models. We expect that the combination of this expertise with our historic focus on marketing networks and distribution platforms will enhance our standing as a leader in online SMB services as we expand to a more comprehensive suite of products and services for SMBs. \n \u2022 Continuation of a successful partnership. The acquisition will build on our existing partnership with Constant Contact, through which we already offer the Constant Contact suite of products along with other products and services we make available to our subscriber base. Based on the results of this partnership to date, we believe that there is considerable demand within our subscriber base for Constant Contact's suite of products. \n \u2022 Creation of significant operational and financial scale. We expect efficiencies to come from leveraging our fixed costs, sharing talent in technology and product development, the reduction of redundant costs and the combined use of our marketing channels. As we grow following the acquisition, we expect these efficiencies to support longer-term growth and value creation for our subscribers. \nIn connection with and concurrently with the acquisition, we entered into a $735 million incremental first lien term loan facility and a $165 million revolving credit facility (which replaced our existing $125 million revolving credit facility) and issued $350 million of 10.875% senior notes due 2024. See \u201cManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d in Part II, Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information on the financing transactions associated with our acquisition of Constant Contact.\nWZ UK Ltd. Acquisition\nOn January 6, 2016, we exercised an option to increase our stake in WZ UK Ltd., a provider of technology and sales marketing services associated with web builder solutions, from 49% to 57.5%, in exchange for a payment of approximately $2.1 million to the other shareholders of WZ UK Ltd. Subject to certain performance milestones being met, we have an option to purchase, and the other shareholders of WZ UK Ltd. have an option to sell to us within three years, the remaining shares of WZ UK Ltd. at a per-share price to be determined based on a multiple of revenue. The net loss for WZ UK Ltd. for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $28.4 million, of which our portion, recorded in our statement of operations, was $13.9 million. Our adjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2015 does not include our proportionate share of WZ UK Ltd.'s net loss. As a result of our increased ownership in WZ UK Ltd., we will consolidate WZ UK Ltd. in our future financial statements starting in the first quarter of 2016 and our adjusted EBITDA will reflect the WZ UK Ltd. net income (loss).\nKey Metrics\nWe did not report monthly recurring revenue, or MRR, retention rate figures in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2014 and 2015 because we had identified errors in our business intelligence system that impacted MRR and two of our other previously reported performance metrics, the number of products per subscriber, or PPS, and the number of subscribers paying us $500 or more per year, or 500+ Subscribers. We undertook to recalculate revised numbers for these metrics using an upgraded version of the business intelligence system that we believe has corrected these errors. These errors only affected these three performance metrics and did not impact our GAAP financial results, our adjusted EBITDA, free cash flow or unlevered free cash flow metrics, ARPS, or total subscriber figures.\nIn January 2016, we completed our review and recalculation of MRR for all past periods beginning with the three and nine months ended September 30, 2013 and determined that our previously reported MRR figures for those periods will remain at 99%. In addition, we determined that MRR for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2014 and 2015 was 99%.\nIn February 2016, we completed our review and recalculation of PPS and 500+ Subscribers for all past periods beginning with the fourth quarter of 2013. Previously reported and revised figures for PPS and 500+ Subscribers are shown in the charts below; however, for both metrics, the previously reported and revised figures are not directly comparable due to multiple inconsistencies and errors in the calculations used to arrive at the previously reported figures.\n (1) Based on data for our HostGator, BlueHost, iPage, Fatcow, Homestead, A Small Orange and Domain.com brands and the smaller brands that share a billing platform with those brands, which together accounted for approximately 80% of our revenue for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015. Previously disclosed and revised figures are not directly comparable due to inconsistencies which have been corrected in the revised figures. \nWe define PPS as the number of products purchased across our platform divided by our subscribers at the end of the period, whether those products are sold in bundles or individually, and 500+ Subscribers as the number of subscribers paying us the annualized equivalent of $500 or more as of the measurement date. The PPS and 500+ Subscribers figures cover our HostGator, Bluehost, iPage, Fatcow, Homestead, A Small Orange and Domain.com brands and the smaller brands that share a billing platform with those brands, which together accounted for approximately 80% of our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015. The revised PPS and 500+ Subscriber figures reflect corrections to adjust for the errors identified in our business intelligence system. In addition, the revised figures only count subscribers who meet our definition of total subscribers for the covered brands, and reflect a consistent methodology across these brands.\nThe significant increase in PPS in the fourth quarter of 2014 is attributable to an adjustment to the number of our total subscribers to eliminate inactive customers that were first identified as inactive in that quarter. The impact of that adjustment on our total subscriber count in that quarter was offset by our inclusion, beginning in the fourth quarter of 2014, of customers of subscription-based products other than our hosted web presence solutions, which at that time consisted mostly of subscribers to our JDI Backup cloud storage and backup products. Because JDI Backup was not among the brands covered by the PPS calculation, the elimination of the inactive customers impacted the revised PPS figures.\nDue to the significant size of the Constant Contact acquisition and the difference in subscriber profile between Endurance and Constant Contact, we will no longer report PPS or 500+ Subscribers going forward.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures and Key Metrics\nIn addition to our financial information presented in accordance with GAAP, we use certain \u201cnon-GAAP financial measures\u201d described below to evaluate the operating and financial performance of our business, identify trends affecting our business, develop projections and make strategic business decisions. Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company's operating performance or financial position that includes or excludes amounts that are included or excluded from the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. We monitor the non-GAAP financial measures described below, and we believe they are helpful to investors, because we believe they reflect the operating performance of our business, excluding some recurring and non-recurring expenses that are included in the most directly comparable measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP.\nOur non-GAAP financial measures may not provide information that is directly comparable to that provided by other companies in our industry, as other companies in our industry may calculate non-GAAP financial results differently, particularly related to adjustments for integration and restructuring expenses. In addition, there are limitations in using non-GAAP financial measures because they are not prepared in accordance with GAAP, may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies and exclude expenses that may have a material impact on our reported financial results. Furthermore, interest expense, which is excluded from some of our non-GAAP measures, has been and will continue to be for the foreseeable future a significant recurring expense in our business. The presentation of non-GAAP financial information is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the directly comparable financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. We urge you to review the reconciliations of our non-GAAP financial measures to the comparable GAAP financial measures included below, and not to rely on any single financial measure to evaluate our business.\nKey Metrics\nWe use a number of metrics, including the following key metrics, to evaluate the operating and financial performance of our business, identify trends affecting our business, develop projections and make strategic business decisions:\n \u2022 total subscribers; \n \u2022 average revenue per subscriber; \n \u2022 monthly recurring revenue retention rate; and \n \u2022 adjusted EBITDA.  Historically, we also presented adjusted net income, but starting in the second quarter of 2015, we no longer present this measure.\nThe following table summarizes these non-GAAP financial measures and key metrics for the periods presented (in thousands, except average revenue per subscriber and monthly recurring revenue retention rate):\n\nTotal Subscribers\nWe define total subscribers as those that, as of the end of a period, are identified as subscribing directly to our products on a paid basis, excluding accounts that access our solutions via resellers or that purchase only domain names from us.\nHistorically, in calculating total subscribers, we included the number of end-of-period subscribers we added through business acquisitions as if those subscribers had subscribed with us since the beginning of the period presented. Since the first quarter of 2014, we have included subscribers we added through business acquisitions from the closing date of the relevant acquisition. Additionally, in the fourth quarter of 2014, we modified our definition of total subscribers to better reflect our expanding product mix by including paid subscribers to all of our subscription-based products (other than accounts that access our solutions via resellers or that purchase only domain names from us, rather than limiting the definition to paid subscribers to our hosted web presence solutions. Subscribers of more than one brand are counted as separate subscribers. Total subscribers for a period reflects adjustments to add or subtract subscribers as we integrate acquisitions and/or are otherwise able to identify subscribers that meet, or do not meet, the definition of total subscribers.\nOur total subscriber base increased from 3.5 million as of December 31, 2013 to 4.1 million as of December 31, 2014 and to 4.7 million as of December 31, 2015. The increase in our subscriber base during 2014 was driven primarily by word-of-mouth referrals, our referral and reseller network, on-boarding subscribers from acquisitions and the inclusion, commencing with the fourth quarter of 2014, of subscribers to all of our subscription-based products (other than accounts that access our solutions via resellers or that purchase only domain names from us) rather than just subscribers to our hosted web presence solutions. Of the approximately 582,000 increase in our total subscriber base from December 31, 2014 to December 31, 2015, approximately 158,000, or 27% of the increase, consisted of pre-acquisition subscriber bases of companies we acquired during 2015, and approximately 90,000, or 15% of the increase, consisted of the adjustments described above. The balance of the increase was due primarily to growth in our business and marketing efforts.\nAverage Revenue per Subscriber\nARPS is a non-GAAP financial measure that we calculate as the amount of revenue we recognize in a period, including marketing development funds and other revenue not received from subscribers, divided by the average of the number of total subscribers at the beginning of the period and at the end of the period, which we refer to as average subscribers for the period. Historically, we adjusted the amount of revenue to include the revenue generated from subscribers we added through business acquisitions as if those acquired subscribers had been our subscribers since the beginning of the period presented. Since the first quarter of 2014, we have included the revenue we add through business acquisitions from the date of the relevant acquisition. We believe ARPS is an indicator of our ability to optimize our mix of products and services and pricing and sell products and services to new and existing subscribers. As we on-board new subscribers, we typically on-board them at introductory prices, which negatively impacts ARPS. Furthermore, ARPS can be impacted by our acquisitions since the acquired subscribers may have higher or lower than average ARPS.\nIn calculating ARPS, we increase revenue for the \u201cpurchase accounting adjustment\u201d for acquisitions, which represents the reduction of post-acquisition revenues from the write-down of deferred revenue to fair value as of the acquisition date. Post-acquisition, deferred revenues are recognized at the reduced amount, until such time that the subscription is renewed. The impact generally normalizes within a year following the acquisition.\nARPS does not represent an exact measure of the average amount a subscriber spends with us each month, since our calculation of ARPS is impacted by revenues generated by non-subscribers. We have three principal sources of non-subscriber revenue: revenue attributable to customers who purchase only a domain name from us and do not purchase any other products, or domain-only customers, domain monetization revenue, and marketing development funds.\nDomain monetization revenue consists principally of revenue from our BuyDomains brand, which provides premium domain name products and services, and, to a lesser extent, revenue from advertisements placed on unused domains (often referred to as \u201cparked\u201d pages) owned by us or our customers. Historically, the contribution of domain monetization activities to our revenue and adjusted revenue has been insignificant, but has been increasing beginning in 2014 primarily due to our acquisition of BuyDomains in September 2014. Our domain monetization revenue (and adjusted revenue) was $3.0 million, $19.2 million and $39.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2014 and 2015, respectively, and its exclusion from our ARPS calculation would have resulted in ARPS being $0.07, $0.43 and $0.76 lower for those periods, respectively.\nMarketing development funds are amounts that certain of our partners pay us to assist in and incentivize our marketing of their products. Our marketing development fund revenue (and adjusted revenue) was $7.5 million, $9.1 million and $13.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2014 and 2015, respectively, and its exclusion from our ARPS calculation would have resulted in ARPS being $0.19, $0.20 and $0.25 lower for those periods, respectively.\nAlthough we are able to measure the total amount of our revenue from domains, we are not able to further break down domain revenue into revenue from domain-only customers versus revenue from customers who purchase domains from us in addition to other products. Total adjusted revenue from domains was $67.1 million, $111.9 million and $127.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2014 and 2015, respectively.\nThe following tables reflect the reconciliation of adjusted revenue from domains to revenue from domains in accordance with GAAP:\n A portion of our revenue is generated from customers that resell our services. We refer to these customers as \u201cresellers.\u201d We consider these resellers (rather than the end user customers of these resellers) to be subscribers under our total subscribers definition, because we do not have a billing relationship with the end users and cannot determine the number of end users acquiring our services through a reseller. Additionally, a majority of our reseller revenues are for the purchase of domains and are included in the figures for adjusted revenue from domains shown above. Total adjusted revenue from resellers, excluding the portion that relates to domains, for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2014 and 2015 was $19.3, $23.9 and $25.5 million, respectively.\nThe following tables reflect the reconciliation of adjusted revenue from resellers to revenue from resellers in accordance with GAAP:\n For the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2014, ARPS increased from $13.09 to $14.48, respectively. This increase in ARPS was driven primarily by increasing demand for our solutions and the acquisition of Directi in 2014.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2015, ARPS decreased from $14.48 to $14.29, respectively. This decrease in ARPS was driven primarily by subscribers coming to our platform through new gateway products, some of which are lower priced than our traditional web presence offerings, and by new subscribers joining us at low introductory prices for their first year with us. This decrease was partially offset by increased revenue from non-subscriber based revenue such as domain monetization and marketing development funds.\nThe following table reflects the reconciliation of ARPS to revenue calculated in accordance with GAAP.\n Monthly Recurring Revenue Retention Rate\nWe believe that our ability to retain revenue from our subscribers is an indicator of the long-term value of our subscriber relationships and the stability of our revenue base. To assess our performance in this area, we measure our MRR retention rate which reflects both subscriber churn and additional revenue from existing subscribers due to renewals, upsells and price changes. We calculate MRR retention rate at the end of a period by taking the retained recurring value of subscription revenue of all active subscribers of our major brands at the end of the prior period and dividing it into the retained recurring value of subscription revenue for those same subscribers at the end of the period presented. The brands included in this calculation are our HostGator, Bluehost, iPage, Fatcow, Homestead, A Small Orange and Domain.com brands and the smaller brands that share a billing platform with those brands, which together accounted for approximately 80% of our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015. A number of our recently acquired and international brands are not included in MRR, including in particular our Directi brands and our JDI Backup cloud storage brands, because these brands have not yet been integrated into our business intelligence system and we are not able to produce adequately reliable MRR data for them. MRR for a period is presented as a rolling average of MRR for the most recent four quarters. We believe MRR retention rate is an indicator of our ability to retain existing subscribers, upsell products and services to them and maintain subscriber satisfaction. MRR can be impacted by factors such as subscriber churn, new subscriber additions, increases in pricing and product uptake.\nOur MRR retention rate was 99% for all periods presented.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nAdjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure that we calculate as net income (loss) plus (i) changes in deferred revenue, depreciation, amortization, stock-based compensation expense, loss of unconsolidated entities, net loss on sale of assets, expenses related to integration of acquisitions and restructurings, transaction expenses and charges, including preparation for our IPO and any dividend-related payments accounted for as compensation expense, certain legal advisory expenses, interest expense and income tax expense, less (ii) earnings of unconsolidated entities, net gain on sale of assets and the impact of purchase accounting related to reduced fair value of deferred domain registration costs. We view adjusted EBITDA as a performance measure. Due to our history of acquisitions and financings, we have incurred and will continue to incur charges for integration, restructuring and transaction expenses that primarily relate to the process of acquiring another business and integrating that business into our support and/ or technical platforms. We believe that adjusting for\nthese items is useful to investors in evaluating the post-integration performance of our company. We manage our business based on the cash collected from our subscribers and the cash required to acquire and service those subscribers. We believe highlighting cash collected and cash spent in a given period provides insight to an investor to gauge the overall performance of our business. Under GAAP, although subscription fees are paid in advance, we recognize the associated revenue over the subscription term, which does not fully reflect short-term trends in our operating results. In order to capture these trends and report our performance consistently with how we manage our business, we include the change in deferred revenue for the period in our calculation of adjusted EBITDA for that period.\nThe following table reflects the reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA to net loss calculated in accordance with GAAP for the periods presented.\n\n (1) The loss of unconsolidated entities is reported on a net basis for the year ended December 31, 2015. The year ended December 31, 2015 includes our proportionate share of net losses from unconsolidated entities of $14.6 million, partially offset by the $5.4 million gain for the redemption of our equity interest in World Wide Web Hosting (Site5). \n (2) Changes in deferred revenue were higher in 2014, primarily due to the purchase accounting adjustment related to the acquisition of Directi. \n (3) Includes loan prepayment penalty of $6.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, which is included in interest expense in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss. \n (4) Consists of legal and related advisory expenses associated with matters that are the subject of a class action lawsuit filed against us in May 2015 and the SEC subpoena received by us in December 2015. \nThe following table provides a reconciliation of net interest expense included in the adjusted EBITDA table above to the net interest expense in our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss.\n Net loss decreased from $159.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 to $50.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 primarily as a result of our revenue growth, including revenue growth associated with acquisitions. Additionally, we incurred lower costs for acquisition, integration and restructuring expenses, and did not incur the IPO costs incurred in the 2013 period. Net loss decreased from $50.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 to $25.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily as a result of our revenue growth, including revenue growth associated with acquisitions.\nAdjusted EBITDA increased from $207.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 to $235.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. These increases in adjusted EBITDA were primarily a result of our revenue growth, including revenue growth associated with acquisitions, increases in the number of subscribers on our platform and achieving greater scale benefits. During 2014 this growth was impacted by our increased investments in marketing and by the additional costs we incurred related to being a public company.\nAdjusted EBITDA increased from $235.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 to $267.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. This increase in adjusted EBITDA was primarily a result of our revenue growth, including revenue growth associated with acquisitions and a reduction in marketing expenses as we reduced marketing spend for certain products, including cloud storage products, as our subscriber base became more familiar with these products. The impact of these factors was partially offset by increased investment in our data center and subscriber support infrastructure and increases in engineering and development expense and general and administrative expense.\nComponents of Operating Results\nRevenue\nWe generate revenue primarily from selling subscriptions for our cloud-based products and services. The subscriptions we offer are similar across all of our brands and are provided under contracts pursuant to which we have ongoing obligations to support the subscriber. These contracts are generally for service periods of up to 36 months and typically require payment in advance at the time of initiating the subscription for the entire subscription period. Typically, we also have arrangements in place to auto renew a subscription at the end of the subscription period. Due to factors such as introductory pricing, our renewal fees may be higher than our initial subscription. We sell more subscriptions with 12 month terms than with any other term length. We also earn revenue from the sale of domain name registrations, premium domains and non-term based products and services, such as certain online security products and professional technical services as well as through referral fees and commissions. We expect our revenue to increase in future periods as we expand our subscriber base, including through acquisitions, and the roll out of new subscriber acquisition channels such as web builders and mobile applications.\nCost of Revenue\nCost of revenue includes costs of operating our subscriber support organization, fees we pay to register domain names for our subscribers, costs of operating our data center infrastructure, such as technical personnel costs associated with monitoring and maintaining our network operations, fees we pay to third-party product and service providers, and merchant fees we pay as part of our billing processes. We also allocate to cost of revenue the depreciation and amortization related to these activities and the intangible assets we have acquired, as well as a portion of our overhead costs attributable to our employees engaged in subscriber support activities. In addition, cost of revenue includes stock-based compensation expense for employees engaged in support and network operations. We expect cost of revenue to increase in absolute dollars in future periods as we expand our subscriber base, increase our levels of subscriber support, expand our domain name business and add data center capacity. Cost of revenue may increase or decrease as a percentage of revenue in a given period, depending on our ability to manage our infrastructure costs, in particular with respect to data centers and support, the amount of third-party product and services that we sell and as a result of our amortization expense related to acquisitions.\nGross Profit\nGross profit is the difference between revenue and cost of revenue. Gross profit has fluctuated from period to period in large part as a result of revenue and cost of revenue adjustments from purchase accounting impacts related to acquisitions, as well as revenue and cost of revenue impacts from growth in our business. With respect to revenue, the application of purchase accounting requires us to record purchase accounting adjustments for acquired deferred revenue, which reduces the revenue recorded from acquisitions for a period of time after the acquisition. The impact generally normalizes within a year following the acquisition. With respect to cost of revenue, the application of purchase accounting requires us to defer domain registration costs, which reduces cost of revenue, and record long-lived assets at fair value, which increases cost of revenue through an increase in amortization expense over the estimated useful life of the long-lived assets. In addition, our revenue and our cost of revenue have increased in recent years as our subscriber base has expanded. For a new subscriber that we bring on to our platform, we typically recognize revenue over the term of the subscription, even though we collect the subscription fee at the initial billing. As a result, our gross profit may be affected by the prices we charge for our subscriptions, as well as by the number of new subscribers and the terms of their subscriptions. We expect our gross profit to increase in absolute dollars in future periods while our gross profit margin may increase or decrease.\nOperating Expense\nWe classify our operating expense into three categories: sales and marketing, engineering and development, and general and administrative. Although our operating expenses will increase as a result of the Constant Contact acquisition, we are planning approximately $55.0 million of annual run rate cost reductions for the combined business, which we expect will be implemented by the end of 2016, with a majority of those cost reductions impacting operating expenses. In connection with these cost reduction plans, we expect to incur approximately $18.0 million to $22.0 million of restructuring charges, consisting of severance and facility exit related charges. A significant majority of the restructuring charge will be incurred in fiscal year 2016.\nSales and Marketing\nSales and marketing expense primarily consists of costs associated with bounty payments to our network of online partners, SEM and SEO, general awareness and brand building activities, as well as the cost of employees engaged in sales and marketing activities. Sales and marketing expense also includes costs associated with sales of products as well as stock-based compensation expense for employees engaged in sales and marketing activities. Sales and marketing expense as a percentage of revenue may increase or decrease in a given period, depending on the cost of attracting new subscribers to our solutions, changes in how we invest in different subscriber acquisition channels, changes in how we approach search engine marketing and search engine\noptimization and the extent of general awareness and brand building activities we may undertake, as well as the efficiency of our sales and support personnel and our ability to sell more products and services to our subscribers and drive favorable returns on invested marketing dollars.\nEngineering and Development\nEngineering and development expense includes the cost of employees engaged in enhancing our technology platform and our systems, developing and expanding product and service offerings, and integrating technology capabilities from our acquisitions. Engineering and development expense includes stock-based compensation expense for employees engaged in engineering and development activities. Our engineering and development expense does not include costs of leasing and operating our data center infrastructure, such as technical personnel costs associated with monitoring and maintaining our network operations and fees we pay to third-party product and service providers, which are included in cost of revenue.\nGeneral and Administrative\nGeneral and administrative expense includes the cost of employees engaged in corporate functions, such as finance, human resources, legal affairs and general management. General and administrative expense also includes all facility and related overhead costs not allocated to cost of revenue, as well as insurance premiums and professional service fees. We incurred additional expenses in preparing for our IPO during 2013 and will continue to incur expenses associated with being a publicly traded company and due to our expansion into international territories, including increased legal, corporate insurance, tax and accounting expenses, and the additional costs of maintaining compliance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and other regulations. General and administrative expense includes stock-based compensation expense for employees engaged in general and administrative activities.\nOther Income (Expense)\nOther income (expense) consists primarily of costs related to, and interest paid on, our indebtedness. We include the cash cost of interest payments and loan financing fees, the amortization of deferred financing costs and the amortization of the net present value adjustment which we may apply to some deferred consideration payments related to our acquisitions in our calculation of interest expense. Interest income consists primarily of interest income earned on our cash and cash equivalents balances. Our interest expense may increase in future periods if we continue to finance acquisitions through the issuance of debt. We expect our interest expense to increase in future periods as a result of the financing transactions we entered into in connection with our acquisition of Constant Contact. Other income (expense) also includes gains or losses recognized on investments in unconsolidated entities.\nIncome Tax Expense (Benefit)\nWe estimate our income taxes in accordance with the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on temporary differences between the assets and liabilities in our consolidated financial statements and the financial statements that are prepared in accordance with tax regulations for the purpose of filing our income tax returns, using statutory tax rates. This methodology requires us to record a valuation allowance against net deferred tax assets if, based upon the available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nWe prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the\nconsolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expense during the reported periods. We base our estimates, judgments and assumptions on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Our actual results may differ from the estimates, judgments and assumptions made by our management. To the extent that there are differences between our estimates, judgments and assumptions and our actual results, our future financial statement presentation, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be affected.\nWe believe that the following significant accounting policies, which are more fully described in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, involve a greater degree of judgment and complexity. Accordingly, these are the policies we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our financial condition and results of operations. We believe that our critical accounting policies and estimates are the assumptions and estimates associated with the following:\n \u2022 revenue recognition, \n \u2022 goodwill, \n \u2022 long-lived assets, \n \u2022 derivative instruments, \n \u2022 depreciation and amortization, \n \u2022 income taxes, and \n \u2022 stock-based compensation arrangements.  Revenue Recognition\nWe generate revenue primarily from selling subscriptions to our cloud-based products and services. The subscriptions we offer are similar across all of our brands and are provided under contracts pursuant to which we have ongoing obligations to support the subscriber. These contracts are generally for service periods of up to 36 months and typically require payment in advance. We recognize the associated revenue ratably over the service period, whether the associated revenue is derived from a direct subscriber or through a reseller. Deferred revenue represents the liability to subscribers for advance billings for services not yet provided and the fair value of the assumed liability outstanding for subscriber relationships purchased in an acquisition.\nWe sell domain name registrations that provide a subscriber with the exclusive use of a domain name. These domains are obtained either by one of our registrars on the subscriber's behalf, or by us from third-party registrars on the subscriber's behalf. Domain registration fees are non-refundable.\nRevenue from the sale of a domain name registration by one of our registrars is recognized ratably over the subscriber's service period as we have the obligation to provide support over the domain term. Revenue from the sale of a domain name registration purchased by us from a third-party registrar is recognized when the subscriber is billed on a gross basis as we have no remaining obligations once the sale to the subscriber occurs, and we have full discretion on the sales price and bear all credit risk.\nRevenue from the sale of premium domains is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement to sell such domains exists, delivery of an authorization key to access the domain name has occurred, the fee for the sale of the premium domain is fixed or determinable, and collection of the fee for the sale of the premium domain is deemed probable.\nWe also earn revenue from the sale of non-term based products and services, such as online security products and professional technical services, referral fees and commissions. We recognize such revenue when the product is purchased, the service is provided or the referral fee or commission is earned.\nA substantial amount of our revenue is generated from transactions that are multiple-element service arrangements that may include hosting plans, domain name registrations, and other cloud-based products and services.\nWe follow the provisions of the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, Accounting Standards Update No. 2009-13, or ASU 2009-13, Revenue Recognition (Topic 605), Multiple-Deliverable Revenue Arrangements-a consensus of the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force and allocate revenue to each deliverable in a multiple- element service arrangement based on its respective relative selling price.\nUnder ASU 2009-13, to treat deliverables in a multiple-element service arrangement as separate units of accounting, the deliverables must have standalone value upon delivery. If the deliverables have standalone value upon delivery, we account for each deliverable separately. Hosting services, domain name registrations, cloud-based products and services have standalone value and are often sold separately.\nWhen multiple deliverables included in a multiple-element service arrangement are separated into different units of accounting, the total transaction amount is allocated to the identified separate units based on a relative selling price hierarchy. We determine the relative selling price for a deliverable based on vendor specific objective evidence, or VSOE, of fair value, if available, or best estimate of selling price, or BESP, if VSOE is not available. We have determined that third-party evidence of selling price, or TPE, is not a practical alternative due to differences in our multi-brand offerings compared to competitors and the availability of relevant third-party pricing information. We have not established VSOE for our offerings due to lack of pricing consistency, the introduction of new products, services and other factors. Accordingly, we generally allocate revenue to the deliverables in the arrangement based on the BESP. We determine BESP by considering our relative selling prices, competitive prices in the marketplace and management judgment; these selling prices, however, may vary depending upon the particular facts and circumstances related to each deliverable. We analyze the selling prices used in our allocation of transaction amount, at a minimum, on a quarterly basis. Selling prices will be analyzed on a more frequent basis if a significant change in our business necessitates a more timely analysis.\nWe maintain a reserve for refunds and chargebacks related to revenue that has been recognized and is expected to be refunded. We had a refund and chargeback reserve of $0.6 million and $0.5 million as of December 31, 2014 and 2015, respectively. The portion of deferred revenue that is expected to be refunded at December 31, 2014 and 2015 was $2.2 million and $1.8 million, respectively. Based on refund history, approximately 80% of all refunds happen in the same fiscal month that the customer contract starts or renews, and approximately 92% of all refunds happen within 45 days of the contract start or renewal date.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill relates to amounts that arose in connection with our various acquisitions and represents the difference between the purchase price and the fair value of the identifiable intangible and tangible net assets when accounted for using the purchase method of accounting. Goodwill is not amortized, but is subject to periodic review for impairment. Events that would indicate impairment and trigger an interim impairment assessment include, but are not limited to, current economic and market conditions, a decline in the equity value of the business, a significant adverse change in certain agreements that would materially affect reported operating results, business climate or operational performance of the business and an adverse action or assessment by a regulator.\nIn accordance with Accounting Standards Update No. 2011-08, or ASU 2011-08, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other (Topic 350) Testing Goodwill for Impairment, we are required to review goodwill by reporting unit for\nimpairment at least annually or more often if there are indicators of impairment present. Under U.S. GAAP, a reporting unit is either the equivalent of, or one level below, an operating segment. We have determined that we operate in one segment and our entire business represents one reporting unit. Changes in operations may cause us to evaluate our conclusion on operating segments and reporting units. Historically, we have performed our annual impairment analysis during the fourth quarter of each year. The provisions of ASU 2011-08 require us to perform a two-step impairment test for goodwill. In the first step, we compare the fair value of each reporting unit to which goodwill has been allocated to its carrying value. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets assigned to that reporting unit, goodwill is considered not impaired and we are not required to perform further testing. If the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit, then we must perform the second step of the impairment test to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill. If the carrying value of a reporting unit's goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, then we record an impairment loss equal to the difference. We have assessed fair value based on current market capitalization. As of December 31, 2014 and 2015, the fair value of our reporting unit exceeded the carrying value of the reporting unit's net assets and, therefore, no impairment existed as of these dates.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had goodwill of $1,207.3 million. We did not recognize any impairments of goodwill in the years ended December 31, 2013, 2014 or 2015.\nLong-Lived Assets\nOur long-lived assets consist primarily of intangible assets, including acquired subscriber relationships, trade names, intellectual property, developed technology, domain names available for sale and in-process research and development, or IPR&D. We also have long-lived tangible assets, primarily consisting of property and equipment. The majority of our intangible assets have been recorded in connection with our acquisitions, including the Sponsor Acquisition described below. We record intangible assets at fair value at the time of their acquisition. We amortize intangible assets over their estimated useful lives.\nOur determination of the estimated useful lives of the individual categories of intangible assets is based on the nature of the applicable intangible asset and the expected future cash flow to be derived from the intangible asset. We amortize intangible assets with finite lives in accordance with their estimated projected cash flows.\nWe evaluate long-lived intangible and tangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. If indicators of impairment are present and undiscounted future cash flow is less than the carrying amount, then we determine the fair value of the assets and compare it to the carrying value. If the fair value is less than the carrying value, then we reduce the carrying value to the estimated fair value and record an impairment loss in the period it is identified. We did not recognize any impairments of long-lived intangible and tangible assets in the years ended December 31, 2013, 2014 or 2015.\nIndefinite life intangibles include domain names that are available for sale which are recorded at cost to acquire. These assets are not being amortized and are being tested for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstance indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable. When a domain name is sold, we record the cost of the domain in cost of revenue.\nAcquired IPR&D, represents the fair value assigned to research and development that we acquire that has not been completed at the date of acquisition. The acquired IPR&D is capitalized as an intangible asset and reviewed on a quarterly basis to determine future use. Any impairment loss of the acquired IPR&D is charged to expense in the period the impairment is identified. Upon commercialization, the acquired fair value of the IPR&D will be amortized over its useful life. No such impairment losses have been identified during the years ended December 31, 2013, 2014 or 2015.\nDerivative Instruments\nAccounting Standards Codification 815, or ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging, provides the disclosure requirements for derivatives and hedging activities with the intent to provide users of financial statements with an enhanced understanding of: (a) how and why an entity uses derivative instruments, (b) how the entity accounts for derivative instruments and related hedged items, and (c) how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect an entity's financial position, financial performance, and cash flows. Further, qualitative disclosures are required that explain our objectives and strategies for using derivatives, as well as quantitative disclosures about the fair value of and gains and losses on derivative instruments, and disclosures about credit-risk-related contingent features in derivative instruments.\nAs required by ASC 815, we record all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value. The accounting for changes in the fair value of derivatives depends on the intended use of the derivative, whether we have elected to designate a derivative in a hedging relationship and apply hedge accounting and whether the hedging relationship has satisfied the criteria necessary to apply hedge accounting. Derivatives designated and qualifying as a hedge of the exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset, liability, or firm commitment attributable to a particular risk, such as interest rate risk, are considered fair value hedges. Derivatives designated and qualifying as a hedge of the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows, or other types of forecasted transactions, are considered cash flow hedges. Derivatives may also be designated as hedges of the foreign currency exposure of a net investment in a foreign operation. Hedge accounting generally provides for the matching of the timing of gain or loss recognition on the hedging instrument with the recognition of the changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk in a fair value hedge or the earnings effect of the hedged forecasted transactions in a cash flow hedge. We may enter into derivative contracts that are intended to economically hedge certain of its risk, even though hedge accounting", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nYou should read the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations together with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes and other financial information included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve significant risks and uncertainties. As a result of many factors, such as those set forth in Part I, Item 1A. \u201cRisk Factors\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements.\nOverview\nWe are a leading provider of cloud-based platform solutions designed to help small and medium-sized businesses, or SMBs, succeed online. Leveraging our proprietary technology platform, we serve approximately 4.7 million subscribers globally with a comprehensive and integrated suite of over 150 products and services that help SMBs get online, get found and grow their businesses. Historically, our products focused largely on web hosting and other basic web presence solutions such as domains, but over time we have expanded to offer security, site backup, SEO and SEM, Google Adwords, mobile solutions, social media enablement, website analytics, email marketing and productivity and e-commerce tools, among others. More recently, we have launched additional products and services, including website builders, mobile site builders, cloud hosting solutions, premium domains and cloud storage solutions, both to satisfy existing subscriber needs and to expand the product gateways through which new subscribers initially reach us.\nOver our 18-year history, we have refined our platform and our analytics to collect insights into the needs and aspirations of our subscribers. These insights allow us to engage our subscribers in timely and compelling ways, driving significant business value for them. We believe that our platform delivers cloud-based solutions quickly, cost-effectively, reliably and securely. These strengths and capabilities help us attract and retain subscribers, who then demand additional products and services from us over time.\nOur revenue has grown from $520.3 million for fiscal year 2013 to $629.8 million for fiscal year 2014 and to $741.3 million for fiscal year 2015. This growth in our revenue was driven by acquisitions and by increasing product offerings and subscribers. Our net loss attributable to Endurance International Group Holdings, Inc. was $159.2 million for fiscal year 2013, which dropped to $42.8 million for fiscal year 2014, and dropped further to $25.8 million for fiscal year 2015. The decreases in our net loss are primarily attributable to the growth in our revenue, and to a lesser extent, one-time costs incurred for our initial public offering in fiscal year 2013.\nRecent Developments\nConstant Contact Acquisition\nOn October 30, 2015, we entered into a definitive agreement pursuant to which we agreed to acquire all of the outstanding shares of common stock of Constant Contact for $32.00 per share in cash, for a total purchase price of approximately $1.1 billion. Constant Contact is a leading provider of online marketing tools that are designed for small organizations, including small businesses, associations and non-profits. The acquisition closed on February 9, 2016.\nExpected benefits of the acquisition include:\n \u2022 Extension of Endurance's product offerings. We will increase our product portfolio of solutions and integrated products through the addition of Constant Contact's suite of online marketing tools such as email marketing, event management, social media integration and contact management systems. We expect to offer Constant Contact's email marketing products alongside our existing products, thereby expanding our position as a leading provider of end-to-end web presence and marketing solutions for SMBs. \n \u2022 Extension of Endurance's core capabilities. Constant Contact has historically focused heavily on product development, and specifically on user experience, subscriber analytics and engagement models. We expect that the combination of this expertise with our historic focus on marketing networks and distribution platforms will enhance our standing as a leader in online SMB services as we expand to a more comprehensive suite of products and services for SMBs. \n \u2022 Continuation of a successful partnership. The acquisition will build on our existing partnership with Constant Contact, through which we already offer the Constant Contact suite of products along with other products and services we make available to our subscriber base. Based on the results of this partnership to date, we believe that there is considerable demand within our subscriber base for Constant Contact's suite of products. \n \u2022 Creation of significant operational and financial scale. We expect efficiencies to come from leveraging our fixed costs, sharing talent in technology and product development, the reduction of redundant costs and the combined use of our marketing channels. As we grow following the acquisition, we expect these efficiencies to support longer-term growth and value creation for our subscribers. \nIn connection with and concurrently with the acquisition, we entered into a $735 million incremental first lien term loan facility and a $165 million revolving credit facility (which replaced our existing $125 million revolving credit facility) and issued $350 million of 10.875% senior notes due 2024. See \u201cManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d in Part II, Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information on the financing transactions associated with our acquisition of Constant Contact.\nWZ UK Ltd. Acquisition\nOn January 6, 2016, we exercised an option to increase our stake in WZ UK Ltd., a provider of technology and sales marketing services associated with web builder solutions, from 49% to 57.5%, in exchange for a payment of approximately $2.1 million to the other shareholders of WZ UK Ltd. Subject to certain performance milestones being met, we have an option to purchase, and the other shareholders of WZ UK Ltd. have an option to sell to us within three years, the remaining shares of WZ UK Ltd. at a per-share price to be determined based on a multiple of revenue. The net loss for WZ UK Ltd. for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $28.4 million, of which our portion, recorded in our statement of operations, was $13.9 million. Our adjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2015 does not include our proportionate share of WZ UK Ltd.'s net loss. As a result of our increased ownership in WZ UK Ltd., we will consolidate WZ UK Ltd. in our future financial statements starting in the first quarter of 2016 and our adjusted EBITDA will reflect the WZ UK Ltd. net income (loss).\nKey Metrics\nWe did not report monthly recurring revenue, or MRR, retention rate figures in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2014 and 2015 because we had identified errors in our business intelligence system that impacted MRR and two of our other previously reported performance metrics, the number of products per subscriber, or PPS, and the number of subscribers paying us $500 or more per year, or 500+ Subscribers. We undertook to recalculate revised numbers for these metrics using an upgraded version of the business intelligence system that we believe has corrected these errors. These errors only affected these three performance metrics and did not impact our GAAP financial results, our adjusted EBITDA, free cash flow or unlevered free cash flow metrics, ARPS, or total subscriber figures.\nIn January 2016, we completed our review and recalculation of MRR for all past periods beginning with the three and nine months ended September 30, 2013 and determined that our previously reported MRR figures for those periods will remain at 99%. In addition, we determined that MRR for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2014 and 2015 was 99%.\nIn February 2016, we completed our review and recalculation of PPS and 500+ Subscribers for all past periods beginning with the fourth quarter of 2013. Previously reported and revised figures for PPS and 500+ Subscribers are shown in the charts below; however, for both metrics, the previously reported and revised figures are not directly comparable due to multiple inconsistencies and errors in the calculations used to arrive at the previously reported figures.\n (1) Based on data for our HostGator, BlueHost, iPage, Fatcow, Homestead, A Small Orange and Domain.com brands and the smaller brands that share a billing platform with those brands, which together accounted for approximately 80% of our revenue for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015. Previously disclosed and revised figures are not directly comparable due to inconsistencies which have been corrected in the revised figures. \nWe define PPS as the number of products purchased across our platform divided by our subscribers at the end of the period, whether those products are sold in bundles or individually, and 500+ Subscribers as the number of subscribers paying us the annualized equivalent of $500 or more as of the measurement date. The PPS and 500+ Subscribers figures cover our HostGator, Bluehost, iPage, Fatcow, Homestead, A Small Orange and Domain.com brands and the smaller brands that share a billing platform with those brands, which together accounted for approximately 80% of our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015. The revised PPS and 500+ Subscriber figures reflect corrections to adjust for the errors identified in our business intelligence system. In addition, the revised figures only count subscribers who meet our definition of total subscribers for the covered brands, and reflect a consistent methodology across these brands.\nThe significant increase in PPS in the fourth quarter of 2014 is attributable to an adjustment to the number of our total subscribers to eliminate inactive customers that were first identified as inactive in that quarter. The impact of that adjustment on our total subscriber count in that quarter was offset by our inclusion, beginning in the fourth quarter of 2014, of customers of subscription-based products other than our hosted web presence solutions, which at that time consisted mostly of subscribers to our JDI Backup cloud storage and backup products. Because JDI Backup was not among the brands covered by the PPS calculation, the elimination of the inactive customers impacted the revised PPS figures.\nDue to the significant size of the Constant Contact acquisition and the difference in subscriber profile between Endurance and Constant Contact, we will no longer report PPS or 500+ Subscribers going forward.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures and Key Metrics\nIn addition to our financial information presented in accordance with GAAP, we use certain \u201cnon-GAAP financial measures\u201d described below to evaluate the operating and financial performance of our business, identify trends affecting our business, develop projections and make strategic business decisions. Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company's operating performance or financial position that includes or excludes amounts that are included or excluded from the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. We monitor the non-GAAP financial measures described below, and we believe they are helpful to investors, because we believe they reflect the operating performance of our business, excluding some recurring and non-recurring expenses that are included in the most directly comparable measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP.\nOur non-GAAP financial measures may not provide information that is directly comparable to that provided by other companies in our industry, as other companies in our industry may calculate non-GAAP financial results differently, particularly related to adjustments for integration and restructuring expenses. In addition, there are limitations in using non-GAAP financial measures because they are not prepared in accordance with GAAP, may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies and exclude expenses that may have a material impact on our reported financial results. Furthermore, interest expense, which is excluded from some of our non-GAAP measures, has been and will continue to be for the foreseeable future a significant recurring expense in our business. The presentation of non-GAAP financial information is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the directly comparable financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. We urge you to review the reconciliations of our non-GAAP financial measures to the comparable GAAP financial measures included below, and not to rely on any single financial measure to evaluate our business.\nKey Metrics\nWe use a number of metrics, including the following key metrics, to evaluate the operating and financial performance of our business, identify trends affecting our business, develop projections and make strategic business decisions:\n \u2022 total subscribers; \n \u2022 average revenue per subscriber; \n \u2022 monthly recurring revenue retention rate; and \n \u2022 adjusted EBITDA.  Historically, we also presented adjusted net income, but starting in the second quarter of 2015, we no longer present this measure.\nThe following table summarizes these non-GAAP financial measures and key metrics for the periods presented (in thousands, except average revenue per subscriber and monthly recurring revenue retention rate):\nTable 226: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2013 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2014 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Financial and other metrics:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total subscribers\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,502 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,087 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,669 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Average subscribers\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,363 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,753 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,358 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Average revenue per subscriber\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>13.09 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>14.48 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>14.29 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Monthly recurring revenue retention rate\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>99 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>99 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>99 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Adjusted EBITDA\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>207,931 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>235,618 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>267,452 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTotal Subscribers\nWe define total subscribers as those that, as of the end of a period, are identified as subscribing directly to our products on a paid basis, excluding accounts that access our solutions via resellers or that purchase only domain names from us.\nHistorically, in calculating total subscribers, we included the number of end-of-period subscribers we added through business acquisitions as if those subscribers had subscribed with us since the beginning of the period presented. Since the first quarter of 2014, we have included subscribers we added through business acquisitions from the closing date of the relevant acquisition. Additionally, in the fourth quarter of 2014, we modified our definition of total subscribers to better reflect our expanding product mix by including paid subscribers to all of our subscription-based products (other than accounts that access our solutions via resellers or that purchase only domain names from us, rather than limiting the definition to paid subscribers to our hosted web presence solutions. Subscribers of more than one brand are counted as separate subscribers. Total subscribers for a period reflects adjustments to add or subtract subscribers as we integrate acquisitions and/or are otherwise able to identify subscribers that meet, or do not meet, the definition of total subscribers.\nOur total subscriber base increased from 3.5 million as of December 31, 2013 to 4.1 million as of December 31, 2014 and to 4.7 million as of December 31, 2015. The increase in our subscriber base during 2014 was driven primarily by word-of-mouth referrals, our referral and reseller network, on-boarding subscribers from acquisitions and the inclusion, commencing with the fourth quarter of 2014, of subscribers to all of our subscription-based products (other than accounts that access our solutions via resellers or that purchase only domain names from us) rather than just subscribers to our hosted web presence solutions. Of the approximately 582,000 increase in our total subscriber base from December 31, 2014 to December 31, 2015, approximately 158,000, or 27% of the increase, consisted of pre-acquisition subscriber bases of companies we acquired during 2015, and approximately 90,000, or 15% of the increase, consisted of the adjustments described above. The balance of the increase was due primarily to growth in our business and marketing efforts.\nAverage Revenue per Subscriber\nARPS is a non-GAAP financial measure that we calculate as the amount of revenue we recognize in a period, including marketing development funds and other revenue not received from subscribers, divided by the average of the number of total subscribers at the beginning of the period and at the end of the period, which we refer to as average subscribers for the period. Historically, we adjusted the amount of revenue to include the revenue generated from subscribers we added through business acquisitions as if those acquired subscribers had been our subscribers since the beginning of the period presented. Since the first quarter of 2014, we have included the revenue we add through business acquisitions from the date of the relevant acquisition. We believe ARPS is an indicator of our ability to optimize our mix of products and services and pricing and sell products and services to new and existing subscribers. As we on-board new subscribers, we typically on-board them at introductory prices, which negatively impacts ARPS. Furthermore, ARPS can be impacted by our acquisitions since the acquired subscribers may have higher or lower than average ARPS.\nIn calculating ARPS, we increase revenue for the \u201cpurchase accounting adjustment\u201d for acquisitions, which represents the reduction of post-acquisition revenues from the write-down of deferred revenue to fair value as of the acquisition date. Post-acquisition, deferred revenues are recognized at the reduced amount, until such time that the subscription is renewed. The impact generally normalizes within a year following the acquisition.\nARPS does not represent an exact measure of the average amount a subscriber spends with us each month, since our calculation of ARPS is impacted by revenues generated by non-subscribers. We have three principal sources of non-subscriber revenue: revenue attributable to customers who purchase only a domain name from us and do not purchase any other products, or domain-only customers, domain monetization revenue, and marketing development funds.\nDomain monetization revenue consists principally of revenue from our BuyDomains brand, which provides premium domain name products and services, and, to a lesser extent, revenue from advertisements placed on unused domains (often referred to as \u201cparked\u201d pages) owned by us or our customers. Historically, the contribution of domain monetization activities to our revenue and adjusted revenue has been insignificant, but has been increasing beginning in 2014 primarily due to our acquisition of BuyDomains in September 2014. Our domain monetization revenue (and adjusted revenue) was $3.0 million, $19.2 million and $39.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2014 and 2015, respectively, and its exclusion from our ARPS calculation would have resulted in ARPS being $0.07, $0.43 and $0.76 lower for those periods, respectively.\nMarketing development funds are amounts that certain of our partners pay us to assist in and incentivize our marketing of their products. Our marketing development fund revenue (and adjusted revenue) was $7.5 million, $9.1 million and $13.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2014 and 2015, respectively, and its exclusion from our ARPS calculation would have resulted in ARPS being $0.19, $0.20 and $0.25 lower for those periods, respectively.\nAlthough we are able to measure the total amount of our revenue from domains, we are not able to further break down domain revenue into revenue from domain-only customers versus revenue from customers who purchase domains from us in addition to other products. Total adjusted revenue from domains was $67.1 million, $111.9 million and $127.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2014 and 2015, respectively.\nThe following tables reflect the reconciliation of adjusted revenue from domains to revenue from domains in accordance with GAAP:\nTable 227: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2013 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2014 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(in thousands) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>66,397 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>91,300 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>125,190 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Purchase accounting adjustment\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>747 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>20,561 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,198 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Domain adjusted revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>67,144 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>111,861 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>127,388 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table> A portion of our revenue is generated from customers that resell our services. We refer to these customers as \u201cresellers.\u201d We consider these resellers (rather than the end user customers of these resellers) to be subscribers under our total subscribers definition, because we do not have a billing relationship with the end users and cannot determine the number of end users acquiring our services through a reseller. Additionally, a majority of our reseller revenues are for the purchase of domains and are included in the figures for adjusted revenue from domains shown above. Total adjusted revenue from resellers, excluding the portion that relates to domains, for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2014 and 2015 was $19.3, $23.9 and $25.5 million, respectively.\nThe following tables reflect the reconciliation of adjusted revenue from resellers to revenue from resellers in accordance with GAAP:\nTable 228: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2013 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2014 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(in thousands) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>19,270 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>23,525 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>25,441 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Purchase accounting adjustment\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>350 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Domain adjusted revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>19,270 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>23,875 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>25,458 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table> For the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2014, ARPS increased from $13.09 to $14.48, respectively. This increase in ARPS was driven primarily by increasing demand for our solutions and the acquisition of Directi in 2014.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2015, ARPS decreased from $14.48 to $14.29, respectively. This decrease in ARPS was driven primarily by subscribers coming to our platform through new gateway products, some of which are lower priced than our traditional web presence offerings, and by new subscribers joining us at low introductory prices for their first year with us. This decrease was partially offset by increased revenue from non-subscriber based revenue such as domain monetization and marketing development funds.\nThe following table reflects the reconciliation of ARPS to revenue calculated in accordance with GAAP.\nTable 229: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2013 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2014 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(in thousands, except ARPS data) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>520,296 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>629,845 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>741,315 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Purchase accounting adjustment\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,311 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>22,100 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,724 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Pre-acquisition revenue from acquired properties\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>512 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Adjusted revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>528,119 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>651,945 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>747,039 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total subscribers\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,502 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,087 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,669 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Average subscribers for the period\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,363 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,753 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,358 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> ARPS\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>13.09 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>14.48 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>14.29 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table> Monthly Recurring Revenue Retention Rate\nWe believe that our ability to retain revenue from our subscribers is an indicator of the long-term value of our subscriber relationships and the stability of our revenue base. To assess our performance in this area, we measure our MRR retention rate which reflects both subscriber churn and additional revenue from existing subscribers due to renewals, upsells and price changes. We calculate MRR retention rate at the end of a period by taking the retained recurring value of subscription revenue of all active subscribers of our major brands at the end of the prior period and dividing it into the retained recurring value of subscription revenue for those same subscribers at the end of the period presented. The brands included in this calculation are our HostGator, Bluehost, iPage, Fatcow, Homestead, A Small Orange and Domain.com brands and the smaller brands that share a billing platform with those brands, which together accounted for approximately 80% of our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015. A number of our recently acquired and international brands are not included in MRR, including in particular our Directi brands and our JDI Backup cloud storage brands, because these brands have not yet been integrated into our business intelligence system and we are not able to produce adequately reliable MRR data for them. MRR for a period is presented as a rolling average of MRR for the most recent four quarters. We believe MRR retention rate is an indicator of our ability to retain existing subscribers, upsell products and services to them and maintain subscriber satisfaction. MRR can be impacted by factors such as subscriber churn, new subscriber additions, increases in pricing and product uptake.\nOur MRR retention rate was 99% for all periods presented.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nAdjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure that we calculate as net income (loss) plus (i) changes in deferred revenue, depreciation, amortization, stock-based compensation expense, loss of unconsolidated entities, net loss on sale of assets, expenses related to integration of acquisitions and restructurings, transaction expenses and charges, including preparation for our IPO and any dividend-related payments accounted for as compensation expense, certain legal advisory expenses, interest expense and income tax expense, less (ii) earnings of unconsolidated entities, net gain on sale of assets and the impact of purchase accounting related to reduced fair value of deferred domain registration costs. We view adjusted EBITDA as a performance measure. Due to our history of acquisitions and financings, we have incurred and will continue to incur charges for integration, restructuring and transaction expenses that primarily relate to the process of acquiring another business and integrating that business into our support and/ or technical platforms. We believe that adjusting for\nthese items is useful to investors in evaluating the post-integration performance of our company. We manage our business based on the cash collected from our subscribers and the cash required to acquire and service those subscribers. We believe highlighting cash collected and cash spent in a given period provides insight to an investor to gauge the overall performance of our business. Under GAAP, although subscription fees are paid in advance, we recognize the associated revenue over the subscription term, which does not fully reflect short-term trends in our operating results. In order to capture these trends and report our performance consistently with how we manage our business, we include the change in deferred revenue for the period in our calculation of adjusted EBITDA for that period.\nThe following table reflects the reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA to net loss calculated in accordance with GAAP for the periods presented.\nTable 230: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2013 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2014 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(in thousands) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net loss\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(159,846 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(50,852 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(25,770 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Stock-based compensation\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10,763 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16,043 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>29,925 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (Gain) loss on sale of assets\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>309 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(168 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(155 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loss of unconsolidated entities(1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,067 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>61 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9,200 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Amortization of other intangible assets\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>105,915 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>102,723 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>91,057 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Amortization of deferred financing costs\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,768 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>83 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>82 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Changes in deferred revenue(2)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>51,047 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>67,654 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>34,241 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Impact of reduced fair value of deferred domain registration costs\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(18,782 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2,005 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Transaction expenses and charges(3)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>45,036 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,787 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9,582 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Integration and restructuring expenses\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>45,594 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>19,927 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16,262 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Legal advisory expenses(4)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,349 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Depreciation\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18,615 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>30,956 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>34,010 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income tax expense\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(3,596 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,186 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11,342 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest expense, net (excluding impact of amortization of deferred financing costs)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>89,259 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>57,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>58,332 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Adjusted EBITDA\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>207,931 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>235,618 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>267,452 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) The loss of unconsolidated entities is reported on a net basis for the year ended December 31, 2015.

Additionally, we incurred lower costs for acquisition, integration and restructuring expenses, and did not incur the IPO costs incurred in the 2013 period. Net loss decreased from $50.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 to $25.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily as a result of our revenue growth, including revenue growth associated with acquisitions.\nAdjusted EBITDA increased from $207.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 to $235.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. These increases in adjusted EBITDA were primarily a result of our revenue growth, including revenue growth associated with acquisitions, increases in the number of subscribers on our platform and achieving greater scale benefits. During 2014 this growth was impacted by our increased investments in marketing and by the additional costs we incurred related to being a public company.\nAdjusted EBITDA increased from $235.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 to $267.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. This increase in adjusted EBITDA was primarily a result of our revenue growth, including revenue growth associated with acquisitions and a reduction in marketing expenses as we reduced marketing spend for certain products, including cloud storage products, as our subscriber base became more familiar with these products. The impact of these factors was partially offset by increased investment in our data center and subscriber support infrastructure and increases in engineering and development expense and general and administrative expense.\nComponents of Operating Results\nRevenue\nWe generate revenue primarily from selling subscriptions for our cloud-based products and services. The subscriptions we offer are similar across all of our brands and are provided under contracts pursuant to which we have ongoing obligations to support the subscriber. These contracts are generally for service periods of up to 36 months and typically require payment in advance at the time of initiating the subscription for the entire subscription period. Typically, we also have arrangements in place to auto renew a subscription at the end of the subscription period. Due to factors such as introductory pricing, our renewal fees may be higher than our initial subscription. We sell more subscriptions with 12 month terms than with any other term length. We also earn revenue from the sale of domain name registrations, premium domains and non-term based products and services, such as certain online security products and professional technical services as well as through referral fees and commissions. We expect our revenue to increase in future periods as we expand our subscriber base, including through acquisitions, and the roll out of new subscriber acquisition channels such as web builders and mobile applications.\nCost of Revenue\nCost of revenue includes costs of operating our subscriber support organization, fees we pay to register domain names for our subscribers, costs of operating our data center infrastructure, such as technical personnel costs associated with monitoring and maintaining our network operations, fees we pay to third-party product and service providers, and merchant fees we pay as part of our billing processes. We also allocate to cost of revenue the depreciation and amortization related to these activities and the intangible assets we have acquired, as well as a portion of our overhead costs attributable to our employees engaged in subscriber support activities. In addition, cost of revenue includes stock-based compensation expense for employees engaged in support and network operations. We expect cost of revenue to increase in absolute dollars in future periods as we expand our subscriber base, increase our levels of subscriber support, expand our domain name business and add data center capacity. Cost of revenue may increase or decrease as a percentage of revenue in a given period, depending on our ability to manage our infrastructure costs, in particular with respect to data centers and support, the amount of third-party product and services that we sell and as a result of our amortization expense related to acquisitions.\nGross Profit\nGross profit is the difference between revenue and cost of revenue. Gross profit has fluctuated from period to period in large part as a result of revenue and cost of revenue adjustments from purchase accounting impacts related to acquisitions, as well as revenue and cost of revenue impacts from growth in our business. With respect to revenue, the application of purchase accounting requires us to record purchase accounting adjustments for acquired deferred revenue, which reduces the revenue recorded from acquisitions for a period of time after the acquisition. The impact generally normalizes within a year following the acquisition. With respect to cost of revenue, the application of purchase accounting requires us to defer domain registration costs, which reduces cost of revenue, and record long-lived assets at fair value, which increases cost of revenue through an increase in amortization expense over the estimated useful life of the long-lived assets. In addition, our revenue and our cost of revenue have increased in recent years as our subscriber base has expanded. For a new subscriber that we bring on to our platform, we typically recognize revenue over the term of the subscription, even though we collect the subscription fee at the initial billing. As a result, our gross profit may be affected by the prices we charge for our subscriptions, as well as by the number of new subscribers and the terms of their subscriptions. We expect our gross profit to increase in absolute dollars in future periods while our gross profit margin may increase or decrease.\nOperating Expense\nWe classify our operating expense into three categories: sales and marketing, engineering and development, and general and administrative. Although our operating expenses will increase as a result of the Constant Contact acquisition, we are planning approximately $55.0 million of annual run rate cost reductions for the combined business, which we expect will be implemented by the end of 2016, with a majority of those cost reductions impacting operating expenses. In connection with these cost reduction plans, we expect to incur approximately $18.0 million to $22.0 million of restructuring charges, consisting of severance and facility exit related charges. A significant majority of the restructuring charge will be incurred in fiscal year 2016.\nSales and Marketing\nSales and marketing expense primarily consists of costs associated with bounty payments to our network of online partners, SEM and SEO, general awareness and brand building activities, as well as the cost of employees engaged in sales and marketing activities. Sales and marketing expense also includes costs associated with sales of products as well as stock-based compensation expense for employees engaged in sales and marketing activities. Sales and marketing expense as a percentage of revenue may increase or decrease in a given period, depending on the cost of attracting new subscribers to our solutions, changes in how we invest in different subscriber acquisition channels, changes in how we approach search engine marketing and search engine\noptimization and the extent of general awareness and brand building activities we may undertake, as well as the efficiency of our sales and support personnel and our ability to sell more products and services to our subscribers and drive favorable returns on invested marketing dollars.\nEngineering and Development\nEngineering and development expense includes the cost of employees engaged in enhancing our technology platform and our systems, developing and expanding product and service offerings, and integrating technology capabilities from our acquisitions. Engineering and development expense includes stock-based compensation expense for employees engaged in engineering and development activities. Our engineering and development expense does not include costs of leasing and operating our data center infrastructure, such as technical personnel costs associated with monitoring and maintaining our network operations and fees we pay to third-party product and service providers, which are included in cost of revenue.\nGeneral and Administrative\nGeneral and administrative expense includes the cost of employees engaged in corporate functions, such as finance, human resources, legal affairs and general management. General and administrative expense also includes all facility and related overhead costs not allocated to cost of revenue, as well as insurance premiums and professional service fees. We incurred additional expenses in preparing for our IPO during 2013 and will continue to incur expenses associated with being a publicly traded company and due to our expansion into international territories, including increased legal, corporate insurance, tax and accounting expenses, and the additional costs of maintaining compliance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and other regulations. General and administrative expense includes stock-based compensation expense for employees engaged in general and administrative activities.\nOther Income (Expense)\nOther income (expense) consists primarily of costs related to, and interest paid on, our indebtedness. We include the cash cost of interest payments and loan financing fees, the amortization of deferred financing costs and the amortization of the net present value adjustment which we may apply to some deferred consideration payments related to our acquisitions in our calculation of interest expense. Interest income consists primarily of interest income earned on our cash and cash equivalents balances. Our interest expense may increase in future periods if we continue to finance acquisitions through the issuance of debt. We expect our interest expense to increase in future periods as a result of the financing transactions we entered into in connection with our acquisition of Constant Contact. Other income (expense) also includes gains or losses recognized on investments in unconsolidated entities.\nIncome Tax Expense (Benefit)\nWe estimate our income taxes in accordance with the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on temporary differences between the assets and liabilities in our consolidated financial statements and the financial statements that are prepared in accordance with tax regulations for the purpose of filing our income tax returns, using statutory tax rates. This methodology requires us to record a valuation allowance against net deferred tax assets if, based upon the available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nWe prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the\nconsolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expense during the reported periods. We base our estimates, judgments and assumptions on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Our actual results may differ from the estimates, judgments and assumptions made by our management. To the extent that there are differences between our estimates, judgments and assumptions and our actual results, our future financial statement presentation, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be affected.\nWe believe that the following significant accounting policies, which are more fully described in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, involve a greater degree of judgment and complexity. Accordingly, these are the policies we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our financial condition and results of operations. We believe that our critical accounting policies and estimates are the assumptions and estimates associated with the following:\n \u2022 revenue recognition, \n \u2022 goodwill, \n \u2022 long-lived assets, \n \u2022 derivative instruments, \n \u2022 depreciation and amortization, \n \u2022 income taxes, and \n \u2022 stock-based compensation arrangements.  Revenue Recognition\nWe generate revenue primarily from selling subscriptions to our cloud-based products and services. The subscriptions we offer are similar across all of our brands and are provided under contracts pursuant to which we have ongoing obligations to support the subscriber. These contracts are generally for service periods of up to 36 months and typically require payment in advance. We recognize the associated revenue ratably over the service period, whether the associated revenue is derived from a direct subscriber or through a reseller. Deferred revenue represents the liability to subscribers for advance billings for services not yet provided and the fair value of the assumed liability outstanding for subscriber relationships purchased in an acquisition.\nWe sell domain name registrations that provide a subscriber with the exclusive use of a domain name. These domains are obtained either by one of our registrars on the subscriber's behalf, or by us from third-party registrars on the subscriber's behalf. Domain registration fees are non-refundable.\nRevenue from the sale of a domain name registration by one of our registrars is recognized ratably over the subscriber's service period as we have the obligation to provide support over the domain term. Revenue from the sale of a domain name registration purchased by us from a third-party registrar is recognized when the subscriber is billed on a gross basis as we have no remaining obligations once the sale to the subscriber occurs, and we have full discretion on the sales price and bear all credit risk.\nRevenue from the sale of premium domains is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement to sell such domains exists, delivery of an authorization key to access the domain name has occurred, the fee for the sale of the premium domain is fixed or determinable, and collection of the fee for the sale of the premium domain is deemed probable.\nWe also earn revenue from the sale of non-term based products and services, such as online security products and professional technical services, referral fees and commissions. We recognize such revenue when the product is purchased, the service is provided or the referral fee or commission is earned.\nA substantial amount of our revenue is generated from transactions that are multiple-element service arrangements that may include hosting plans, domain name registrations, and other cloud-based products and services.\nWe follow the provisions of the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, Accounting Standards Update No. 2009-13, or ASU 2009-13, Revenue Recognition (Topic 605), Multiple-Deliverable Revenue Arrangements-a consensus of the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force and allocate revenue to each deliverable in a multiple- element service arrangement based on its respective relative selling price.\nUnder ASU 2009-13, to treat deliverables in a multiple-element service arrangement as separate units of accounting, the deliverables must have standalone value upon delivery. If the deliverables have standalone value upon delivery, we account for each deliverable separately. Hosting services, domain name registrations, cloud-based products and services have standalone value and are often sold separately.\nWhen multiple deliverables included in a multiple-element service arrangement are separated into different units of accounting, the total transaction amount is allocated to the identified separate units based on a relative selling price hierarchy. We determine the relative selling price for a deliverable based on vendor specific objective evidence, or VSOE, of fair value, if available, or best estimate of selling price, or BESP, if VSOE is not available. We have determined that third-party evidence of selling price, or TPE, is not a practical alternative due to differences in our multi-brand offerings compared to competitors and the availability of relevant third-party pricing information. We have not established VSOE for our offerings due to lack of pricing consistency, the introduction of new products, services and other factors. Accordingly, we generally allocate revenue to the deliverables in the arrangement based on the BESP. We determine BESP by considering our relative selling prices, competitive prices in the marketplace and management judgment; these selling prices, however, may vary depending upon the particular facts and circumstances related to each deliverable. We analyze the selling prices used in our allocation of transaction amount, at a minimum, on a quarterly basis. Selling prices will be analyzed on a more frequent basis if a significant change in our business necessitates a more timely analysis.\nWe maintain a reserve for refunds and chargebacks related to revenue that has been recognized and is expected to be refunded. We had a refund and chargeback reserve of $0.6 million and $0.5 million as of December 31, 2014 and 2015, respectively. The portion of deferred revenue that is expected to be refunded at December 31, 2014 and 2015 was $2.2 million and $1.8 million, respectively. Based on refund history, approximately 80% of all refunds happen in the same fiscal month that the customer contract starts or renews, and approximately 92% of all refunds happen within 45 days of the contract start or renewal date.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill relates to amounts that arose in connection with our various acquisitions and represents the difference between the purchase price and the fair value of the identifiable intangible and tangible net assets when accounted for using the purchase method of accounting. Goodwill is not amortized, but is subject to periodic review for impairment. Events that would indicate impairment and trigger an interim impairment assessment include, but are not limited to, current economic and market conditions, a decline in the equity value of the business, a significant adverse change in certain agreements that would materially affect reported operating results, business climate or operational performance of the business and an adverse action or assessment by a regulator.\nIn accordance with Accounting Standards Update No. 2011-08, or ASU 2011-08, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other (Topic 350) Testing Goodwill for Impairment, we are required to review goodwill by reporting unit for\nimpairment at least annually or more often if there are indicators of impairment present. Under U.S. GAAP, a reporting unit is either the equivalent of, or one level below, an operating segment. We have determined that we operate in one segment and our entire business represents one reporting unit. Changes in operations may cause us to evaluate our conclusion on operating segments and reporting units. Historically, we have performed our annual impairment analysis during the fourth quarter of each year. The provisions of ASU 2011-08 require us to perform a two-step impairment test for goodwill. In the first step, we compare the fair value of each reporting unit to which goodwill has been allocated to its carrying value. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets assigned to that reporting unit, goodwill is considered not impaired and we are not required to perform further testing. If the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit, then we must perform the second step of the impairment test to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill. If the carrying value of a reporting unit's goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, then we record an impairment loss equal to the difference. We have assessed fair value based on current market capitalization. As of December 31, 2014 and 2015, the fair value of our reporting unit exceeded the carrying value of the reporting unit's net assets and, therefore, no impairment existed as of these dates.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had goodwill of $1,207.3 million. We did not recognize any impairments of goodwill in the years ended December 31, 2013, 2014 or 2015.\nLong-Lived Assets\nOur long-lived assets consist primarily of intangible assets, including acquired subscriber relationships, trade names, intellectual property, developed technology, domain names available for sale and in-process research and development, or IPR&D. We also have long-lived tangible assets, primarily consisting of property and equipment. The majority of our intangible assets have been recorded in connection with our acquisitions, including the Sponsor Acquisition described below. We record intangible assets at fair value at the time of their acquisition. We amortize intangible assets over their estimated useful lives.\nOur determination of the estimated useful lives of the individual categories of intangible assets is based on the nature of the applicable intangible asset and the expected future cash flow to be derived from the intangible asset. We amortize intangible assets with finite lives in accordance with their estimated projected cash flows.\nWe evaluate long-lived intangible and tangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. If indicators of impairment are present and undiscounted future cash flow is less than the carrying amount, then we determine the fair value of the assets and compare it to the carrying value. If the fair value is less than the carrying value, then we reduce the carrying value to the estimated fair value and record an impairment loss in the period it is identified. We did not recognize any impairments of long-lived intangible and tangible assets in the years ended December 31, 2013, 2014 or 2015.\nIndefinite life intangibles include domain names that are available for sale which are recorded at cost to acquire. These assets are not being amortized and are being tested for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstance indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable. When a domain name is sold, we record the cost of the domain in cost of revenue.\nAcquired IPR&D, represents the fair value assigned to research and development that we acquire that has not been completed at the date of acquisition. The acquired IPR&D is capitalized as an intangible asset and reviewed on a quarterly basis to determine future use. Any impairment loss of the acquired IPR&D is charged to expense in the period the impairment is identified. Upon commercialization, the acquired fair value of the IPR&D will be amortized over its useful life. No such impairment losses have been identified during the years ended December 31, 2013, 2014 or 2015.\nDerivative Instruments\nAccounting Standards Codification 815, or ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging, provides the disclosure requirements for derivatives and hedging activities with the intent to provide users of financial statements with an enhanced understanding of: (a) how and why an entity uses derivative instruments, (b) how the entity accounts for derivative instruments and related hedged items, and (c) how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect an entity's financial position, financial performance, and cash flows. Further, qualitative disclosures are required that explain our objectives and strategies for using derivatives, as well as quantitative disclosures about the fair value of and gains and losses on derivative instruments, and disclosures about credit-risk-related contingent features in derivative instruments.\nAs required by ASC 815, we record all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value. The accounting for changes in the fair value of derivatives depends on the intended use of the derivative, whether we have elected to designate a derivative in a hedging relationship and apply hedge accounting and whether the hedging relationship has satisfied the criteria necessary to apply hedge accounting. Derivatives designated and qualifying as a hedge of the exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset, liability, or firm commitment attributable to a particular risk, such as interest rate risk, are considered fair value hedges. Derivatives designated and qualifying as a hedge of the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows, or other types of forecasted transactions, are considered cash flow hedges. Derivatives may also be designated as hedges of the foreign currency exposure of a net investment in a foreign operation. Hedge accounting generally provides for the matching of the timing of gain or loss recognition on the hedging instrument with the recognition of the changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk in a fair value hedge or the earnings effect of the hedged forecasted transactions in a cash flow hedge. We may enter into derivative contracts that are intended to economically hedge certain of its risk, even though hedge accounting"}
