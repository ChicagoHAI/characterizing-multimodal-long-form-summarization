MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is intended to clarify the results of our operations, certain changes in our financial position, liquidity, capital structure and business developments for the periods covered by the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion should be read in conjunction with, and is qualified by reference to, the other related information including, but not limited to, the audited consolidated financial statements (including the notes thereto and the independent registered public accounting firm's reports thereon), and the description of our business, all as set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, as well as the risk factors discussed below and in Item 1A.\nCertain statements in this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d are forward-looking statements.\u201d See Cautionary Statement with Respect to Forward-Looking Statements\u201d and Risk Factors.\u201d\nGeneral\nWe are a leading manufacturer of exterior building products in North America, operating in two reportable segments: (i) Siding, Fencing, and Stone and (ii) Windows and Doors, which comprised approximately 46% and 54% of our sales, respectively, for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015. These two segments produce a comprehensive product line of vinyl siding, designer accents, cellular PVC trim, vinyl fencing, vinyl and composite railing, stone veneer and vinyl windows and doors used in both the new construction market and the home repair and remodeling market in the United States and Canada. Vinyl building products have the leading share of sales volume in siding and windows in the United States. We also manufacture vinyl and aluminum soffit and siding accessories, aluminum trim coil, wood windows, aluminum windows, vinyl and aluminum-clad windows and steel and fiberglass doors, enabling us to bundle complementary and color-matched products and accessories with our core products. We believe that our comprehensive product portfolio and geographically diverse, low cost manufacturing platform allow us to better serve our customers and provide us with a competitive advantage over other exterior building products suppliers.\nThe following is a summary of Ply Gem's recent acquisition history:\nTable 49: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>On April 9, 2013, Ply Gem acquired all of the capital stock of Gienow WinDoor Ltd. (which was amalgamated into Gienow Canada Inc.) (\"Gienow\"), a manufacturer of windows and doors in Western Canada, for a purchase price, net of cash acquired, of $20.4 million. Gienow is our Western Canadian windows business and is part of the Windows and Doors segment.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 50: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>On May 31, 2013, Ply Gem acquired all of the capital stock of Mitten Inc.

The majority of Mitten's operations are part of the Siding, Fencing and Stone segment.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 51: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>On September 19, 2014, Ply Gem completed an acquisition for cash consideration of approximately $130.0 million to acquire the capital stock of Fortune Brands Windows Inc., and its direct and indirect wholly owned subsidiaries Simonton Building Products LLC, Simonton Industries, Inc., Simonton Windows, Inc., and SimEx, Inc. Simonton is a premier repair and remodeling window company with leading brand recognition and is part of the Windows and Doors segment.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 52: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>On May 29, 2015, Ply Gem acquired substantially all of the assets of Canyon Stone, Inc. ( Canyon Stone\u201d), a manufacturer of stone veneer, for a purchase price of $21.0 million, subject to certain purchase price adjustments. Canyon Stone is included in our Siding, Fencing, and Stone segment.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nPrior to January 11, 2010, Ply Gem Holdings was a wholly owned subsidiary of Ply Gem Investment Holdings, which was a wholly owned subsidiary of Ply Gem Prime. On January 11, 2010, Ply Gem Investment Holdings was merged with and into Ply Gem Prime, with Ply Gem Prime being the surviving corporation. In May 2013, the Company issued 18,157,895 shares of common stock in an initial public offering and received gross proceeds of approximately $381.3 million in an IPO of its common stock. The shares began trading on The New York Stock Exchange on May 23, 2013 under the symbol \"PGEM\". Immediately prior to the closing of the IPO, Ply Gem Prime merged with and into Ply Gem Holdings, with Ply Gem Holdings being the surviving entity. In the merger, all of the preferred stock of Ply Gem Prime (including the subordinated debt of Ply Gem Prime that was converted into preferred stock in connection with the IPO) was converted into a number of shares of the Company's common stock based on the IPO price of the common stock and the liquidation value of and the maximum dividend amount in respect of the preferred stock.\nWe are a holding company with no operations or assets of our own other than the capital stock of our subsidiaries. The terms of Ply Gem Industries' $350.0 million ABL Facility and the credit agreement governing the terms of its $430.0 million Term Loan Facility place restrictions on the ability of Ply Gem Industries and our other subsidiaries to pay dividends and otherwise transfer assets to us. Further, the terms of the indenture governing Ply Gem Industries' $650.0 million 6.50% Senior Notes place restrictions on the ability of Ply Gem Industries and our other subsidiaries to pay dividends and otherwise transfer assets to us.\nFinancial statement presentation\nNet sales. Net sales represent the fixed selling price of our products plus certain shipping charges less applicable provisions for discounts and allowances. Allowances include cash discounts, volume rebates and returns among others.\nCost of products sold. Cost of products sold includes direct material and manufacturing costs, manufacturing depreciation, third-party and in-house delivery costs and product warranty expense.\nSelling, general and administrative expense. Selling, general and administrative expense ( SG&A expense\u201d) includes all non-product related operating expenses, including selling, marketing, research and development costs, information technology, and other general and administrative expenses.\nOperating earnings (loss). Operating earnings (loss) represents net sales less cost of products sold, SG&A expense, amortization of intangible assets, and initial public offering costs.\nImpact of commodity pricing\nPVC resin and aluminum are major components in the production of our products and changes in PVC resin and aluminum prices have a direct impact on our cost of products sold. Historically, we have been able to pass on a substantial portion of significant price increases to our customers. The results of operations for individual quarters can be negatively impacted by a delay between the time of raw material cost increases and price increases that we implement in our products, or conversely can be positively impacted by a delay between the time of a raw material price decrease and competitive pricing moves that we implement accordingly.\nImpact of weather\nSince our building products are intended for exterior use, our sales and operating earnings tend to be lower during periods of inclement weather. Weather conditions in the first and fourth quarters of each calendar year historically result in these quarters producing significantly less sales revenue than our second and third quarters of the year. As a result, we have historically had lower profits or higher losses in the first and fourth quarters of each calendar year. Our results of operations for individual quarters in the future may be impacted by adverse weather conditions. In addition, favorable or unfavorable weather conditions may influence the comparability of our results from year to year or from quarter to quarter.\nCritical accounting policies\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Certain of our accounting policies require the application of judgments in selecting the appropriate assumptions for calculating financial estimates. By their nature, these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty. We periodically evaluate the judgments and estimates used for our critical accounting policies to ensure that such judgments and estimates are reasonable for our interim and year-end reporting requirements. These judgments and estimates are based upon our historical experience, current trends and information available from other sources, as appropriate. If different conditions occur compared to our assumptions and judgments, the results could be materially different from our estimates. Management also believes that the nine areas where different assumptions could result in materially different reported results are (1) goodwill and intangible asset impairment tests, (2) accounts receivable related to the estimation of allowances for doubtful accounts, (3) inventories in estimating reserves for obsolete and excess inventory, (4) warranty reserves, (5) insurance reserves, (6) income taxes including the tax receivable agreement, (7) rebates, (8) pensions, and (9) environmental accruals and other contingencies. Although we believe the likelihood of a material difference in these areas is low based upon our historical experience, a 10% change in our allowance for doubtful accounts, inventory reserve estimates, and warranty reserve at December 31, 2015 would result in an approximate $0.4 million, $0.8 million, and $7.7 million impact on expenses, respectively. Additionally, we have included in the discussion that follows our estimation methodology for both accounts receivable and inventories. While all significant policies are important to our consolidated financial statements, some of these policies may be viewed as being critical. Our critical accounting policies include:\nRevenue Recognition. We recognize sales based upon shipment of products to our customers net of applicable provisions for discounts and allowances. Generally, the customer takes title upon shipment and assumes the risks and rewards of ownership of the product. For certain products, it is industry standard that customers take title to products upon delivery, at which time revenue is then recognized by the Company. Revenue includes the selling price of the product and all shipping costs paid by the customer. Revenue is reduced at the time of sale for estimated sales returns and all applicable allowances and discounts based on historical experience. We also provide for estimates of warranty, bad debts, shipping costs and certain sales-related customer programs at the time of sale. Shipping and warranty costs are included in cost of products sold. Bad debt expense and sales-related marketing programs are included in SG&A expense. We believe that our procedures for estimating such amounts are reasonable and historically have not resulted in material adjustments in subsequent periods when the estimates are reconciled to the actual amounts.\nAccounts Receivable. We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses from the inability of our customers to make required payments, which is provided for in bad debt expense. We determine the adequacy of this allowance by regularly reviewing our accounts receivable aging and evaluating individual customers' receivables, considering customers' financial condition, credit history and other current economic conditions. If a customer's financial condition was to deteriorate, which might impact its ability to make payment, then additional allowances may be required.\nInventories. Inventories in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets are valued at the lower of cost or market. We record provisions, as appropriate, to write-down obsolete and excess inventory to estimated net realizable value. The process for evaluating obsolete and excess inventory often requires subjective judgments and estimates concerning future sales levels, quantities and prices at which such inventory will be sold in the normal course of business. Accelerating the disposal process or incorrect estimates of future sales potential may cause actual results to differ from the estimates at the time such inventory is disposed or sold.\nGoodwill Impairment. We perform an annual test for goodwill impairment during the fourth quarter of each year (November 28th for 2015) and also at any other date when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may exceed their fair value. We use the two-step method to determine goodwill impairment. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value (Step One Analysis), we measure the possible goodwill impairment based upon a hypothetical allocation of the fair value estimate of the reporting unit to all of the underlying assets and liabilities of the reporting unit, including previously unrecognized intangible assets (Step Two Analysis). The excess of the reporting unit's fair value over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill. An impairment loss is recognized to the extent that a reporting unit's recorded goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill.\nTo evaluate goodwill impairment, we estimate the fair value of reporting units considering such factors as discounted cash flows and valuation multiples for comparable publicly traded companies. A significant reduction in projected sales and earnings which would lead to a reduction in future cash flows could indicate potential impairment.\nA summary of the key assumptions utilized in the goodwill impairment analysis at November 28, 2015, November 22, 2014, and November 23, 2013, as it relates to the Step One fair values and the sensitivities for these assumptions follows:\nTable 53: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Siding, Fencing, and Stone\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>As of\nNovember 28,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>As of\nNovember 22,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>As of\nNovember 23,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Assumptions:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income approach:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Estimated housing starts in terminal year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,100,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,100,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,100,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Terminal growth rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Discount rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Market approach:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Control premiums\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Sensitivities:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Amounts in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Estimated fair value decrease in the event of a\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>1% decrease in the terminal year growth\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>104,863\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>101,916\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>89,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Estimated fair value decrease in the event of a\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>1% increase in the discount rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>189,363\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>178,819\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>161,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Estimated fair value decrease in the event of a\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>1% decrease in the control premium\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16,790\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15,440\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs of November 28, 2015, we maintained the terminal year estimated housing starts assumption consistent with 2014 and 2013 at 1,100,000, which reflects a normalized housing start level. We estimate that normalized recurring housing starts will be in a range of 1,000,000 to 1,200,000 to keep up with U.S. population growth according to the Joint Center for Housing Studies of Harvard University. We also maintained our terminal growth rate assumption at 3.0% for the three-year period, which is 0.5% lower than the assumption utilized in the Windows and Doors analysis due to Windows and Doors' higher correlation with the new construction market, which provides higher growth levels as we return to a normalized housing market. As of November 28, 2015, we increased the Siding, Fencing, and Stone's discount rate by 0.5% to 11.5%, due to anticipated new product growth included in our long-term forecasts, which offer more uncertainty than the existing revenue stream for Siding, Fencing, and Stone. As of November 22, 2014, we decreased the Siding, Fencing, and Stone discount rate by 0.5% to 11.0%, reflecting Siding, Fencing, and Stone's consistent financial performance with operating earnings of $113.1 million in a flat U.S. housing market relative to 2013.

As of November 22, 2014, we also maintained the assumption for estimated housing starts in the terminal year at 1,100,000, which is consistent with 2013.\nAs of November 28, 2015, we decreased the Windows and Doors' discount rate by 2.0% to 17.0% as a reflection of the improved operating performance of the Windows and Doors reporting unit which, increased their operating earnings by $45.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2015 due to improved gross profit margins from higher selling prices and favorable commodity costs. As of November 22, 2014, we decreased the Windows and Doors' discount rate by 1.0% to 19.0%, as a reflection of the improved operating performance of the Windows and Doors reporting unit. Windows and Doors experienced a $10.9 million improvement in operating loss during 2014, as compared to 2013, due to improved gross profit margins and the minimization of operating inefficiencies.\nAs of November 28, 2015, we increased the Windows and Doors' control premium to 10.0% from 5.0% in 2014, primarily due to improved internal financial performance within the reporting unit as well as an improvement in market comparisons companies and overall market conditions and growth. As of November 22, 2014, we maintained the Windows and Doors' control premium at 5.0%, consistent with the prior year due to the continued lack of public transaction comparatives.\nOverall, we utilize the same key assumptions in preparing the prospective financial information ( PFI\u201d) utilized in the discounted cash flow test for the Siding, Fencing, and Stone and Windows and Doors reporting units. However, each reporting unit is impacted differently by industry trends, how market factors are influencing the reporting units' expected performance, competition, and other unique business factors as mentioned above. The Windows and Doors reporting unit has more exposure to the new construction market which experienced depressed housing market conditions during 2009-2011, which ultimately decreased operating performance for this reporting unit. Siding, Fencing, and Stone's performance has been more consistent and profitable resulting in less risk in the PFI.\nTable 55: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Amounts in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>As of\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>As of\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>As of\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>November 28,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>November 22,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>November 23,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Estimated Windows and Doors reporting unit fair value increase in the event of a 10% increase in the weighting of the market multiples method\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Estimated Siding, Fencing, and Stone reporting unit fair value increase in the event of a 10% increase in the weighting of the market multiples method\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe provide no assurance that: (1) valuation multiples will not decline, (2) discount rates will not increase, or (3) the earnings, book values or projected earnings and cash flows of our reporting units will not decline. We will continue to analyze changes to these assumptions in future periods. We will continue to evaluate goodwill during future periods and further declines in the residential housing and remodeling markets could result in future goodwill impairments.\nIncome Taxes. We utilize the asset and liability method in accounting for income taxes, which requires that the deferred tax consequences of temporary differences between the amounts recorded in our consolidated financial statements and the amounts included in our federal and state income tax returns be recognized in the consolidated balance sheet. The amount recorded in our consolidated financial statements reflects estimates of final amounts due to timing of completion and filing of actual income tax returns. Estimates are required with respect to, among other things, the appropriate state income tax rates used in the various states in which we and our subsidiaries are required to file, the potential utilization of operating and capital loss carry-forwards for both federal and state income tax purposes and valuation allowances required, if any, for tax assets that may not be realized in the future. We establish reserves when, despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully supportable, certain positions could be challenged, and the positions may not be fully sustained. We have executed a tax sharing agreement with Ply Gem Holdings and Ply Gem Investment Holdings (during 2010, Ply Gem Investment Holdings was merged with and into Ply Gem Prime, with Ply Gem Prime being the surviving corporation) pursuant to which tax liabilities for each respective party are computed on a stand-alone basis. The tax sharing agreement was amended in 2013 to reflect the merger of Ply Gem Prime Holdings with and into Ply Gem Holdings. Our U.S. subsidiaries file a consolidated federal income tax return, unitary, combined, or separate state income tax returns. Gienow Canada and Mitten file separate Canadian income tax returns.\nAt December 31, 2015, we remained in a full federal valuation allowance position due to our cumulative loss position for income tax purposes as well as a full state valuation allowance position for certain legal entities. As of December 31, 2015, we have a full valuation allowance for our foreign subsidiary, Gienow Canada, however, we did not have a valuation allowance for our foreign subsidiary, Mitten. Refer to Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding income taxes.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table summarizes net sales and net income (loss) by segment and is derived from the accompanying consolidated statements of operations included in this report.\nTable 56: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Amounts in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net Sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Siding, Fencing, and Stone\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>840,118\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>801,601\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>737,841\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Windows and Doors\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>999,608\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>765,042\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>627,740\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating earnings (loss)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Siding, Fencing, and Stone\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>134,654\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>113,089\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>111,918\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Windows and Doors\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18,195\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(27,660\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(38,537\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Unallocated\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(30,317\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(23,931\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(45,605\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Foreign currency loss\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Siding, Fencing, and Stone\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(954\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(427\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(217\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Windows and Doors\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,212\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(565\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,316\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest income (expense), net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Siding, Fencing, and Stone\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>132\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Windows and Doors\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>48\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>195\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Unallocated\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(74,858\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(71,229\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(92,011\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax benefit (expense)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Unallocated\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>688\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>105\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(298\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss on modification or\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>extinguishment of debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Unallocated\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(21,364\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(18,948\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tax receivable agreement liability adjustment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Unallocated\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(12,947\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>670\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,167\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income (loss)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>32,288\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(31,269\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(79,520\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following tables set forth our results of operations based on the amounts and the percentage relationship of the items listed to net sales for the periods indicated. However, our results of operations set forth in the tables below may not necessarily be representative of our future operating results.\nThis review of performance is organized by business segment, reflecting the way we manage our business. Each business group leader is responsible for operating results down to operating earnings (loss). We use operating earnings as a performance measure as it captures the income and expenses within the management control of our business leaders. Corporate management is responsible for making all financing decisions. Therefore, each segment discussion focuses on the factors affecting operating earnings, while interest expense and income taxes and certain other unallocated expenses are separately discussed at the corporate level.\nSiding, Fencing, and Stone Segment\nTable 57: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Amounts in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Statement of operations data:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>840,118\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>801,601\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>737,841\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross profit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>238,326\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>209,288\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>197,626\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>SG&A expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>90,760\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>83,135\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>73,846\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of intangible assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12,912\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13,064\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11,862\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating earnings\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>134,654\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>113,089\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>111,918\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Currency transaction loss\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(954\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.1\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(427\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.1\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(217\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet Sales\nNet sales for the year ended December 31, 2015 increased from the year ended December 31, 2014 by approximately $38.5 million or 4.8%. The net sales increase for the year ended December 31, 2015 was related to our Canyon Stone acquisition, which was completed on May 29, 2015, and accounted for increased net sales of $17.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2015. Excluding Canyon Stone, our net sales increased $20.9 million or 2.6% during the year ended December 31, 2015. The net sales increase resulted predominantly from higher net sales in the United States of approximately $32.7 million partially offset by lower net sales in Canada of approximately $11.8 million. The 2.6% net sales increase resulted primarily from improved market conditions reflected in industry metrics for both the new construction and repair and remodeling markets. Our building products are typically installed on a new construction home 90 to 120 days after the start of the home, therefore single family housing starts commencing in the period from September of 2014 to September of 2015 directly impacts the demand for our products in the year ended December 31, 2015. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, single family housing starts increased 10.0% during this lag affected time period reflecting improved market conditions while heavy vinyl siding markets in the Northeast and Midwest only increased 2.6% on a lag effected basis. In addition to the new construction market improvement, remodeling activity, according to the Leading Indicator of Remodeling Activity ( LIRA\u201d), increased 5.6% during the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. The improved U.S. market conditions were partially offset by declining industry conditions in Canada where the deteriorating Canadian dollar negatively impacted our net sales by approximately $17.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2015. Excluding the negative foreign currency impact, our net sales in Canada through Mitten would have increased $6.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. During the year ended December 31, 2015, the Canadian dollar deteriorated 15.7% relative to the year ended December 31, 2014.\nDespite this negative foreign currency impact, the improved U.S. industry conditions of 2.6% for new construction and 5.6% for repair and remodeling resulted in increased net sales of approximately $27.1 million for our combined vinyl siding, metal accessory, and PVC trim products that fully offset the negative currency impact. We experienced increased PVC trim sales during the year ended December 31, 2015 relative to the year ended December 31, 2014 as this new product gained traction during 2015 after its market introduction in 2013. Our vinyl siding and metal accessory net sales increases resulted from new business wins and improved industry conditions. For the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, the percentage of net sales in vinyl siding and metal accessories represented approximately 60.1% and 24.5% and 62.2% and 24.3%, respectively, with our net sales of other products comprising approximately 15.4% and 13.5%. The net sales increase in other products resulted from the acquisition of Canyon Stone, which specializes in the manufactured stone category.\nThe improved U.S. market conditions which accounted for the majority of the 2.6% net sales increase during the year ended December 31, 2015 are further evidenced by the Vinyl Siding Institute reporting that U.S. vinyl siding industry shipments increased 1.6% during the year ended December 31, 2015 while shipments in Canada decreased 2.9% for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. The Canadian decrease reflected the challenging economic conditions that exist for Canada. Including Mitten, our U.S. market position in vinyl siding for the years ended December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014 was 38.8% and 38.8%, respectively, while our combined share of the Canadian vinyl siding market was 30.2% and 27.0%, respectively.\nNet sales for the year ended December 31, 2014 increased from the year ended December 31, 2013 by approximately $63.8 million or 8.6%. Our net sales were favorably impacted by the Mitten acquisition, which was completed on May 31, 2013, and accounted for increased net sales of approximately $39.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2014. Excluding Mitten, our Siding, Fencing, and Stone net sales increased $24.3 million or 3.3% for the year ended December 31, 2014 reflecting increased sales of our metal accessory products that resulted from new business wins, improved industry conditions in the second half of 2014 and higher selling prices to offset higher material costs partially offset by the challenging weather conditions that existed early in 2014. All of these factors contributed on a net basis to the 3.3% net sales growth during the year ended December 31, 2014 despite the Vinyl Siding Institute reporting that U.S. vinyl siding industry shipments increased a nominal 0.3% for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nIncluding Mitten, our U.S. market position in vinyl siding for the year ended December 31, 2014 was 38.8% compared to 39.5% for the year ended December 31, 2013, while our combined share of the Canadian vinyl siding market was 27.0% compared to 27.6% for the year ended December 31, 2013. These decreases in U.S. and Canadian market position resulted primarily from the timing of various orders from customers during 2014 compared to 2013. For the year ended December 31, 2014, the percentage of sales in vinyl siding and metal accessories represented approximately 62.2% and 24.3%, respectively, of our net sales with sales of other products comprising approximately 13.5%. These net sales percentages were consistent with the year ended December 31, 2013, for which the percentage of sales in vinyl siding and metal accessories represented approximately 62.6% and 25.5%, respectively, of our net sales with sales of other products comprising 11.9%.\nGross Profit\nGross profit for the year ended December 31, 2015 increased from the year ended December 31, 2014 by approximately $29.0 million or 13.9%. Excluding the impact of the Canyon Stone acquisition, which was completed on May 29, 2015 and contributed increased gross profit of approximately $5.0 million, our gross profit increased $24.0 million or 11.5%. The gross profit increase resulted from the 2.6% net sales increase resulting from improved market and weather conditions in the United States partially offset by the weakening Canadian dollar. The higher volumes experienced during the year ended December 31, 2015 enabled us to increase our operating leverage and cover fixed manufacturing costs relative to the lower volumes experienced during the year ended December 31, 2014. This operating leverage combined with lower freight expenses and favorable material cost pricing experienced during the year ended December 31, 2015 relative to the year ended December 31, 2014 increased our gross profit. For material costs, PVC resin decreased 3.8% during the year ended December 31, 2015 relative to the year ended December 31, 2014. In addition, the Midwest Ingot price of aluminum decreased 16.1% during the year ended December 31, 2015 relative to the year ended December 31, 2014. This favorable material cost pricing increased gross profit by approximately $26.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2015 relative to the year ended December 31, 2014. In addition, our freight expense on a volume adjusted basis was favorable by approximately $5.1 million as a result of declining fuel prices.\nAs a percentage of net sales, gross profit increased from 26.1% for the year ended December 31, 2014 to 28.4% for the year ended December 31, 2015 excluding the impact of Canyon Stone. The 230 basis point increase for the year ended December 31, 2015 resulted from improved operating leverage from the 2.6% net sales increase as well as favorable material cost pricing and favorable freight expense partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency impact from a weakening Canadian dollar.\nGross profit for the year ended December 31, 2014 increased from the year ended December 31, 2013 by approximately $11.7 million or 5.9%. Our gross profit was favorably impacted by the Mitten acquisition, which was completed on May 31, 2013, and contributed increased gross profit of approximately $11.1 million during 2014. Adjusting for the Mitten acquisition, our gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2014 increased by approximately $0.6 million or 0.3%. Our net sales for the year ended December 31, 2014 were negatively impacted during the early part of 2014 by adverse winter weather, which resulted in lower unit volume sales and gross profit. This lower sales volume created less operating leverage to cover fixed manufacturing costs in the first two quarters of 2014, excluding the impact of acquisitions, but was largely offset by higher net sales of 7.1% in the third quarter and 11.2% in the fourth quarter resulting from improved industry conditions which resulted in the 3.3% net sales increase for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nThe favorable impact from the net sales increase was partially offset by higher raw material and freight expenses that were not fully offset by our selling price increases within the year ended December 31, 2014. As it relates to our two primary raw material cost components, aluminum and PVC resin, there has been movement relative to prior years. The Midwest Ingot price of aluminum increased 10.8% for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the year ended December 31, 2013. The average market price for PVC resin was estimated to have increased 9.6% during 2014 compared to 2013. Excluding the impact of any selling price changes, commodity costs fluctuations, predominantly for aluminum and PVC, decreased gross profit by approximately 4.9% for the year ended December 31, 2014. In addition, freight expenses increased approximately $3.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2014 relative to the year ended December 31, 2013 and decreased gross profit as well.\nAs a percentage of net sales, gross profit, excluding the Mitten gross profit increase, decreased to 26.0% for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to 26.8% for the year ended December 31, 2013. The 80 basis point decrease for the year ended December 31, 2014 was primarily due to higher commodity costs, predominantly PVC and aluminum, and increased freight expense that were not fully offset by our selling price increases within the year ended December 31, 2014.\nSG&A Expense\nSG&A expense for the year ended December 31, 2015 increased from the year ended December 31, 2014 by approximately $7.6 million or 9.2%. Excluding the Canyon Stone acquisition, which was completed on May 29, 2015 and incurred SG&A expense of $3.2 million, SG&A expense increased $4.4 million or 5.3% during the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. The SG&A expense increase was predominantly caused by higher incentive compensation of $3.0 million, increased sales and marketing expenses of $0.7 million related to the 2.6% net sales increase, higher legal expenses of $0.4 million, and increased product development expenses of $0.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2015 relative to the year ended December 31, 2014. As a percentage of net sales excluding Canyon Stone, SG&A expense remained consistent at approximately 10.6% during the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to 10.4% for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nSG&A expense for the year ended December 31, 2014 increased from the year ended December 31, 2013 by approximately $9.3 million, or 12.6%. Our SG&A expense increased as a result of our Mitten acquisition, which was completed on May 31, 2013, causing increased SG&A expense of approximately $10.6 million adjusting the comparable SG&A expense decrease to $1.3 million or 1.8%. The SG&A expense decrease resulted from lower administrative and personnel costs for Mitten in the comparable June to December period in 2014 compared to 2013. This reflects a portion of the synergies realized from the Mitten acquisition. As a percentage of net sales, excluding the increased SG&A expense attributable to Mitten, our SG&A expense percentage decreased to 9.5% for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to 10.0% for the year ended December 31, 2013. This percentage decrease was attributable to the year over year decrease in Mitten's SG&A expense as a result of acquisition synergies.\nAmortization of Intangible Assets\nAmortization expense for the year ended December 31, 2015 was consistent with the year ended December 31, 2014 decreasing a nominal $0.2 million or 1.2%. Excluding the Canyon Stone acquisition, which was completed on May 29, 2015 and caused increased amortization expense of $0.8 million, amortization expense decreased by approximately $1.0 million or 7.4%. The decreased resulted from the negative 15.7% movement in the Canadian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar during the year ended December 31, 2015 which resulted in lower amortization expense in Canada. As a percentage of net sales, amortization expense was 1.5% for the year ended December 31, 2015, excluding Canyon Stone, as compared to 1.6% for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nAmortization expense for the year ended December 31, 2014 increased by $1.2 million compared with the year ended December 31, 2013 due to including approximately $35.4 million of intangible assets from the Mitten acquisition for the full fiscal year which accounted for increased amortization expense of $2.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to having seven months of amortization expense on those assets for the year ended December 31, 2013. This $2.1 million increase was partially offset by reduced amortization expense of approximately $0.9 million related to intangible assets, specifically customer relationships, becoming fully amortized in early 2014. As a percentage of net sales, amortization expense was 1.4%, excluding the increased Mitten amortization, consistent with the 1.6% for the year ended December 31, 2013.\nCurrency Transaction Loss\nA currency transaction impact was established in 2013 with the acquisition of Mitten within the Siding, Fencing, and Stone segment. The currency transaction loss for the year ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 was $1.0 million, $0.4 million and $0.2 million, respectively, related to the Mitten entity. The $0.6 million increase in the foreign currency loss for the year ended December 31, 2015 was due to the negative movement in the Canadian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar during the year ended December 31, 2015.\nWindows and Doors Segment\nTable 58: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Amounts in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Statement of operations data:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>999,608\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>765,042\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>627,740\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross profit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>181,386\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>98,513\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>61,044\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>SG&A expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>150,797\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>117,097\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>91,207\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of intangible assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12,394\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,076\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,374\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating earnings (loss)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18,195\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(27,660\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3.6\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(38,537\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(6.1\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Currency transaction loss\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,212\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.2\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(565\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.1\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,316\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.2\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet Sales\nNet sales for the year ended December 31, 2015 increased compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 by approximately $234.6 million or 30.7%. The net sales increase for the year ended December 31, 2015 was predominantly related to our Simonton acquisition, which was completed on September 19, 2014, and accounted for increased net sales of $231.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. Excluding Simonton, our Windows and Doors' net sales increased $2.7 million or 0.4% during the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. The net sales increase resulted from higher net sales in the United States for our U.S. window products of approximately $52.3 million partially offset by lower net sales for Simonton of approximately $5.9 million in the 2015 and 2014 comparable ownership period and lower net sales for our Western Canadian business of approximately $43.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014.\nThe U.S. window net sales increase resulted from improved market conditions reflected in industry metrics. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, single family housing starts increased 10.0% on a lag effected basis during the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. The lag effect is created by our building products being typically installed on a new construction residential home 90 to 120 days after the start of the home. In addition to the improved industry conditions in the United States with the 10.0% new construction market increase, our selling prices increased for our U.S. window products from price increases that we have implemented and favorable product mix that resulted from a higher proportion of our window sales being derived from our vinyl windows which typically carry a higher selling price than our aluminum windows. The impact of higher selling prices that resulted from our price increases and favorable product mix is estimated to have increased our average selling price for our U.S. window products by 5.8% which contributed higher net sales of approximately $29.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 relative to the year ended December 31, 2014. This increase was partially offset in the U.S. by lower Simonton net sales which resulted from the timing of the Company's fiscal calendar which provided Simonton four less shipping days during the comparable ownership period for the three months ended December 31, 2015 and the three months ended December 31, 2014. This net sales increase in the U.S. market was partially offset by a 27.7% decrease in net sales in our Western Canadian business during the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. The housing market conditions within the prairie provinces of Western Canada, in which a majority of our Western Canadian business' net sales are generated, has experienced demand softness due to declining world oil prices on this heavily dependent energy industrial area. In addition, the weakening of the Canadian dollar negatively impacted our net sales by approximately $15.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. During the year ended December 31, 2015, the Canadian dollar weakened 15.7% against the U.S. dollar relative to the year ended December 31, 2014.\nNet sales for the year ended December 31, 2014 increased compared to the year ended December 31, 2013 by approximately $137.3 million, or 21.9%. Our net sales were favorably impacted by acquisitions during the year ended December 31, 2014. The Simonton acquisition, which was completed on September 19, 2014, contributed net sales of approximately $91.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2014. The Gienow acquisition, which was completed on April 9, 2013 and legally amalgamated with our legacy Ply Gem Canada business effective January 2014, resulted in increased net sales of $12.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2014. The Mitten acquisition, which was completed on May 31, 2013, contributed increased net sales of approximately $2.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2014.\nAfter excluding the impact of these acquisitions, our net sales increased $31.1 million or 5.0% for the year ended December 31, 2014. The 5.0% net sales increase was primarily due to higher selling prices for our window products derived from price increases that we have implemented and favorable product mix that resulted from a higher proportion of our window sales being derived from our vinyl windows which typically carry a higher selling price than our aluminum windows. Improving industry conditions also contributed to our net sales increase with the U.S. Census Bureau estimating that single family housing starts increased 4.9% for the year ended December 31, 2014 relative to the year ended December 31, 2013. Single family starts experienced nominal growth during the first half of the year due to the severe winter weather that negatively impacted our customers with higher levels of snow accumulation and extreme cold temperatures with the polar vortex phenomenon. The winter weather had a negative impact on the new construction market to which our Windows and Doors market is highly aligned. The second half of 2014 had improved weather patterns relative to the second half of 2013, which when combined with our average selling price improvement produced net sales increases of 7.9% and 8.7% for the third and fourth quarters, respectively.\nThe net sales increases for the year ended December 31, 2014 were partially offset by a net sales decrease of approximately $7.4 million for Western Canada attributed to difficult weather conditions in the early spring, integration challenges with our dealer customers, and a negative foreign currency impact from a weakening Canadian dollar which accounted for a net sales decrease of $8.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2014 relative to the year ended December 31, 2013.\nGross Profit\nGross profit for the year ended December 31, 2015 increased compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 by approximately $82.9 million, or 84.1%. Our gross profit was favorably impacted by the Simonton acquisition, which was completed on September 19, 2014 and contributed increased gross profit of approximately $60.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. Adjusting for the Simonton acquisition, our gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2015 increased by approximately $22.8 million or 23.6%. This gross profit increase can be attributed to the continued improvement in our U.S. windows business, which was driven by improved net pricing and favorable product mix that resulted in a 5.8% increase in average selling price during the year ended December 31, 2015. In addition to the average sales price improvement, we have improved our operational efficiencies as a result of our enterprise lean\u201d initiative which continues to streamline our window product offering by providing additional manufacturing flexibility as well as our improved sales and operations planning process that is intended to provide better resource planning which will help to minimize ramp up costs that result from spikes in demand within a geographical area. Overall, our gross profit increased approximately $25.3 million for our U.S. windows business partially offset by a decrease of approximately $5.5 million for our Western Canadian business during the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. The decrease in our Canadian gross profit is attributed to the negative impact of foreign currency resulting from the weakening of the Canadian dollar as well as a softening in the Western Canadian market due to depressed oil prices. Finally, our gross profit for Simonton increased approximately $3.0 million due to a 3.7% in average selling prices for the comparable three month period ended December 31, 2015 relative to the three months ended December 31, 2014.\nAs a percentage of net sales, gross profit excluding the impact of Simonton for both years, increased from 12.8% for the year ended December 31, 2014 to 15.7% for the year ended December 31, 2015. The 290 basis point net increase in gross profit was driven by a 350 basis point improvement in U.S. windows gross profit performance resulting from improved net pricing and operational efficiencies and a 140 basis point increase for Western Canada driven by favorable gross profit performance during 2015 despite lower sales during the year and the negative foreign currency impact from a weakening Canadian dollar. This favorable gross profit performance was achieved in Western Canada by improving our selling prices despite the difficult conditions and decreased volumes.\nGross profit for the year ended December 31, 2014 increased compared to the year ended December 31, 2013 by approximately $37.5 million, or 61.4%. Our gross profit was favorably impacted by the Simonton, Gienow, and Mitten acquisitions which on a combined basis contributed increased gross profit of approximately $22.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. Excluding the impact of these acquisitions, our gross profit increased $15.4 million or 25.3% during the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the year ended December 31, 2013. This gross profit increase for the year ended December 31, 2014 can be attributed to the improvement in our U.S. windows business. Our U.S. windows business's gross profit increased by approximately $24.4 million or 92.1% during the year ended December 31, 2014. This gross profit increase was driven by improved pricing and favorable product mix that resulted from a higher proportion of our window sales being derived from our vinyl windows which typically carry a higher selling price than our aluminum windows resulting in a 4.8% increase in average selling price during the year ended December 31, 2014. This improved pricing and favorable product mix resulted in increased gross profit of approximately $18.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nIn addition to the average sales price improvement, we have improved our operational efficiencies as a result of our enterprise lean\u201d initiative which will continue to streamline our window product offering by providing additional manufacturing flexibility in the future and our improved sales and operations planning process that is intended to provide better resource planning which will help to minimize ramp up costs that result from significant spikes in demand within a geographical area. Furthermore, we did not incur approximately $1.4 million of expense associated with the start-up and consolidation of our production facility in Dallas, Texas and $0.7 million of higher than normal enterprise lean\u201d expenditures which occurred during the year ended December 31, 2013. The remaining increase in U.S. windows gross profit related to the minimization of 2013 labor inefficiencies and ramp up costs during the year ended December 31, 2014.\nThese gross profit increases were partially offset by the performance of our combined Western Canadian business. On a combined basis, our Western Canadian businesses experienced a decrease in gross profit of approximately $10.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2014. This gross profit decrease can be primarily attributed to expenses and inefficiencies associated with the consolidation of two operations (Gienow and Ply Gem Canada) into a single manufacturing facility including manufacturing inefficiencies and certain customer losses which decreased operating leverage and profitability for our Western Canadian business during the year ended December 31, 2014. Based on the poor performance of our Western Canadian business for the year ended December 31, 2014, we have made management changes within this leadership team during the fourth quarter of 2014 in an effort to improve operational performance for this business. This new leadership team will be responsible for commencing improvements in strategy, operations, and service for our Western Canadian business in 2015. Our Western Canadian business experienced a negative material cost impact of approximately $5.2 million during 2014 as a result of the 9% deterioration in the Canadian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar during the year ended December 31, 2014.\nAs a percentage of sales, gross profit, excluding the Simonton, Gienow, and Mitten acquisitions, increased from 9.7% to 11.6% for the Windows and Doors segment during the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2013. This increase was driven by the improvement in our U.S. windows gross profit performance that resulted in an improvement of approximately 370 basis points in gross profit performance resulting from improved net pricing and operational efficiencies during the year ended December 31, 2014 relative to the year ended December 31, 2013. This improvement was partially offset by the negative near-term integration costs, operational inefficiencies, and higher material costs resulting from an unfavorable foreign currency impact in our Western Canadian operations that resulted in the deterioration of approximately 140 basis points in gross profit performance during the year ended December 31, 2014.\nSG&A Expense\nSG&A expense for the year ended December 31, 2015 increased compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 by approximately $33.7 million, or 28.8%. The SG&A expense increase relates to the Simonton acquisition, which was completed on September 19, 2014 and contributed increased SG&A expense of $50.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. Excluding Simonton, our Windows and Doors SG&A expense decreased $16.6 million or 14.3%. This SG&A expense decrease was related to a $5.0 million expense recognized in connection with a preliminary settlement of class action lawsuits during the year ended December 31, 2014 which was offset by a $3.2 million insurance recovery during the year ended December 31, 2015. Excluding the impact of Simonton and the class action litigation, SG&A expense decreased $8.4 million or 7.6% during the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. This SG&A expense decrease was related to $8.4 million lower SG&A expense for Western Canada as a result of the weakening Canadian dollar which lowered SG&A expense by $3.4 million, lower sales and marketing expenses of $1.4 million based on the net sales decrease, and from the elimination of $3.6 million of one-time restructuring and integration costs related to the integration of our Western Canadian businesses that occurred during the year ended December 31, 2014. SG&A expenses for U.S. windows, excluding the impact of the class action litigation, remained flat overall reflecting higher incentive compensation offset by lower legal expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014.\nExcluding Simonton and the impact of the class action litigation, SG&A expense as a percentage of net sales decreased from 14.6% for the year ended December 31, 2014 to 13.5% for the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease can be attributed to $3.6 million lower restructuring and integration costs for Western Canada as well as gaining leverage on the fixed component of SG&A expense with the additional sales volume experienced in the U.S.\nGienow and Mitten's SG&A expenses are higher as a percentage of sales at approximately 22.2% and 21.5%, respectively, compared to our overall SG&A expense of 14.8% for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014, indicating that the remaining SG&A expense excluding Simonton, Gienow, and Mitten would be approximately 12.0% for our other businesses as a percentage of sales for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. Gienow and Mitten operate and sell primarily in Canada and own their distribution centers across their respective regions in Eastern and Western Canada, which increases their respective SG&A expense while allowing them to service their Canadian customer base across a broad geographical area.\nSG&A expense for the year ended December 31, 2014 increased compared to the year ended December 31, 2013 by approximately $25.9 million, or 28.4%. The SG&A expense increase was caused by several factors with the first relating to the impact of the Gienow and Simonton acquisitions, which on a combined basis increased SG&A expense by approximately $23.5 million including restructuring and integration costs related to Gienow of approximately $1.4 million within SG&A expense. These restructuring and integration expenses arose due to the consolidation of two manufacturing facilities into a single facility during the year ended December 31, 2014. Excluding the impact of these acquisitions, SG&A expense increased approximately $2.4 million or 2.7% for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2013. This increase was due to the preliminary legal settlement of class action lawsuits on May 1, 2014 for our Windows and Doors segment which resulted in a $5.0 million expense partially offset by lower relocation and consulting costs during the year ended December 31, 2014.\nAs a percentage of sales, SG&A expense increased to 15.3% of net sales from 14.5% during the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the year ended December 31, 2013. Excluding the expense associated with the class action settlement as well as the acquisition and integration costs, SG&A expense would have decreased as a percentage of sales to 13.5% for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the year ended December 31, 2013. The decrease related to the elimination of certain relocation and consulting costs for the U.S. windows business as well as increased leverage on the fixed component of SG&A expense as net sales increased 5.0% during the year ended December 31, 2014.\nGienow and Mitten's SG&A expense is higher as a percentage of sales at approximately 21.8% and 20.8%, respectively, compared to the remainder of the Company at approximately 12.8% for the year ended December 31, 2014. Gienow and Mitten own their distribution centers across their respective regions in Eastern and Western Canada, which increases their respective SG&A expense, while allowing them to service their Canadian customer base across a broad geographical area. Also included in Gienow and Mitten's SG&A expense are one-time costs related to restructuring and integration that are not expected to recur in future periods. These costs amounted to approximately $1.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nAmortization of Intangible Assets\nAmortization expense for the year ended December 31, 2015 increased $3.3 million or 36.6% compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase in amortization expense for the year ended December 31, 2015 is due to the additional intangible assets of $62.2 million acquired in the Simonton acquisition that was completed on September 19, 2014. As a percentage of net sales, amortization expense remained consistent at 1.2% for the year ended December 31, 2015 after excluding the impact of the Simonton acquisition for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to 1.2% for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nAmortization expense for the year ended December 31, 2014 increased $0.7 million or 8.4% compared to the year ended December 31, 2013. The increase was attributable to the Simonton acquisition, which closed on September 19, 2014, and the acquisition of approximately $62.2 million of intangible assets. Amortization expense as a percentage of sales remained consistent at 1.2%, excluding the Simonton acquisition, for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to 1.3% for the year ended December 31, 2013.\nCurrency Transaction Loss\nThe currency transaction loss for the year ended December 31, 2015 increased $1.6 million or 291.5% as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 as a result of the fluctuation in the Canadian dollar as compared to the U.S. dollar for 2015. The currency transaction loss for the year ended December 31, 2014 decreased $0.8 million as compared to the year ended December 31, 2013 as a result of the fluctuation in the Canadian dollar as compared to the U.S. dollar for 2014. Our Gienow acquisition during the year ended December 31, 2013, increased our transactional exposure to the Canadian currency. Management continues to evaluate methodologies to effectively hedge this foreign currency risk.\nUnallocated Operating Earnings, Interest, and Benefit (Provision) for Income Taxes Table 59: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Amounts in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Statement of operations data:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>SG&A expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(30,317\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(23,931\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(22,078\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Initial public offering costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(23,527\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating loss\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(30,317\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(23,931\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(45,605\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(74,863\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(71,234\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(92,019\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tax receivable agreement liability adjustment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(12,947\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>670\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,167\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss on modification or extinguishment of debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(21,364\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(18,948\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Benefit (provision) for income taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>688\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>105\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(298\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating loss/SG&A Expense\nUnallocated SG&A expense includes items which are not directly attributed to or allocated to either of our reporting segments. Such items include legal costs, corporate payroll, and unallocated finance and accounting expenses. The unallocated operating loss for the year ended December 31, 2015 increased by $6.4 million or 26.7% compared to the same period in 2014 due primarily to increased incentive compensation of approximately $4.8 million, increased executive retention expense of $1.2 million, and an increase in other professional fees of $1.6 million partially offset by decreases in various other personnel expenses.\nThe unallocated operating loss for the year ended December 31, 2014 decreased by $21.7 million or 47.5% compared to the year ended December 31, 2013 due primarily to the absence of $23.5 million in initial public offering costs incurred in 2013 highlighted in the table below offset by increased legal expenses and various personnel costs.\nTable 60: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Amounts in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Advisory termination fee to affiliate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>18,852\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2013 management fee as of date of termination\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,682\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other transaction expenses for the IPO\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,993\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>23,527\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nInterest expense\nInterest expense for the year ended December 31, 2015 increased by approximately $3.6 million or 5.1% compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 as a result of the additional $150.0 million debt incurred for the Simonton acquisition completed in September 2014 partially offset by the impact of the January 2014 debt refinancing. The increase is primarily due to the $150.0 million in Senior Tack-on Notes being outstanding for the full year ended December 31, 2015 and not the full year ended December 31, 2014 since the Simonton acquisition closed in September of 2014. In January 2014, we refinanced our 8.25% Senior Secured Notes due 2018 (the \"8.25% Senior Secured Notes\") and 9.375% Senior Notes due 2017 (the \"9.375% Senior Notes\") with the entry into the Term Loan Facility and 6.50% Senior Notes. The 6.50% Senior Notes and Term Loan Facility have lower interest rates on a weighted average basis of approximately 300 basis points and consequently reduced interest expense during the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the same period in 2014.\nInterest expense for the year ended December 31, 2014 decreased by approximately $20.8 million or 22.6% compared to the year ended December 31, 2013. This reduction in interest expense is primarily related to the completion of the 6.50% Senior Notes bond offering and entering into a $430.0 million Term Loan Facility in January 2014 which facilitated the purchase of the outstanding 8.25% Senior Secured Notes and 9.375% Senior Notes. This debt refinancing reduced our weighted average interest rate by approximately 300 basis points during the year ended December 31, 2014. The reduction in stated interest rates from this transaction reduced interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the year ended December 31, 2013 partially offset by the additional $150.0 million of 6.50% Senior Notes issued in September 2014 for the Simonton acquisition.\nInterest income\nInterest income for the year ended December 31, 2015 was consistent with the years ended December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013.\nTax receivable agreement liability adjustment\nAs a result of our full tax valuation allowance position, our methodology for calculating the TRA liability considers expectations regarding (i) current year taxable income only (due to the uncertainty of future taxable income associated with our cumulative loss position) and (ii) future income due to the expected reversals of deferred tax liabilities. During the quarterly periods of 2015, we estimated our projected taxable income for the full year ending December 31, 2015 based on our 2015 estimates and then adjust the TRA liability on an annualized basis once taxable income is finalized for the current fiscal year. However, our methodology to estimate the TRA liability excludes forecasts for fiscal years subsequent to 2015 because such future forecasts and projections cannot be relied upon based on the negative evidence from our three year cumulative loss position. For fiscal year 2015, we are in a taxable income position; however, this taxable income position was not sufficient to outweigh the negative evidence or alleviate our three year cumulative loss position. In addition to our current year taxable income position, we considered the reversals of deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities. The resulting taxable income (loss) from deferred taxes was then combined with our current year taxable income to determine the cumulative NOLs that were expected to be utilized. The TRA liability was accordingly adjusted using the 85% TRA rate.\nThe $12.9 million TRA liability adjustment for the year ended December 31, 2015 resulted from increases in taxable income estimates resulting from the reversal of deferred tax liabilities as well as increases in our 2015 taxable income compared to the 2014 period. The $115.9 million increase in our 2015 taxable income can be attributed to the following factors (i) the continued U.S. housing recovery which is estimated to have a 10.0% year over year increase in single family housing starts according to the U.S. Census Bureau, (ii) improvements in the repair and remodeling market evidenced by the 5.6% increase in homeowner improvements during 2015 versus 2014 according to LIRA, (iii) the positive income contributions from our acquisition of Simonton which was completed in September 2014, and (iv) continued improvements in our existing operations specifically for our U.S. windows business which increased its operating earnings by approximately $45.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. All of these items increased our taxable income estimate for the year ended December 31, 2015 and, as a result, our estimate of the TRA liability.\nThe $0.7 million tax receivable agreement liability adjustment for the year ended December 31, 2014 resulted from additional deferred tax liabilities assumed in the Simonton acquisition and changes in our deferred tax liabilities, partially offset by our 2014 taxable losses.\nThe $5.2 million tax receivable agreement liability adjustment for the year ended December 31, 2013 resulted from a combination of the IPO deductible expenses incurred during the year ended December 31, 2013 and changes in the expected timing of NOL utilization as well as decreases in our estimates of taxable income for 2013 and deferred tax liability reversals given our full valuation allowance position.\nLoss on modification or extinguishment of debt\nAs a result of the 6.50% Senior Notes and Term Loan Facility and the tender, redemption, and repurchase of the 8.25% Senior Notes and the 9.375% Senior Secured Notes as further described in the Liquidity and Capital Resources section below, we recognized a loss on modification or extinguishment of debt of approximately $21.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2014.\nAs a result of the June 28, 2013 redemption of approximately $84.0 million aggregate principal amount of the 8.25% Senior Secured Notes, we recorded a loss on debt extinguishment of approximately $8.1 million in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2013. As a result of the June 22, 2013 redemption of approximately $64.0 million aggregate principal amount of the 9.375% Senior Notes, we recorded a loss on debt extinguishment of approximately $10.8 million in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2013. Based on these financing transactions, as further described in the Liquidity and Capital Resources section below, we recognized a loss on debt modification or extinguishment of approximately $18.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2013.\nIncome taxes\nThe income tax benefit for the year ended December 31, 2015 increased to an approximate $0.7 million tax benefit from a $0.1 million tax benefit for the year ended December 31, 2014. The income tax benefit of approximately $0.7 million was comprised of approximately $2.1 million of federal tax benefit, $1.9 million state tax expense, and approximately $0.5 million of foreign income tax benefit. The increase in tax benefit is primarily due to the $9.8 million valuation allowance that was initially recorded in 2014 on the deferred tax assets of our Western Canadian business and a decrease in state income tax expense partially offset by a decrease in the tax losses of Mitten and assumption of Simonton's deferred tax liabilities which resulted in a reversal of approximately $2.8 million of our valuation allowance during the year ended December 31, 2015.\nThe income tax benefit for the year ended December 31, 2014 increased to an approximate $0.1 million tax benefit from a $0.3 million tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2013. The income tax benefit of approximately $0.1 million was comprised of approximately $7.0 million of federal tax benefit, $2.7 million state tax expense, and approximately $4.2 million of foreign income tax expense. The increase in tax benefit is primarily due to the Simonton acquisition and the assumption of their deferred tax liabilities which resulted in a $7.5 million reversal of our valuation allowance as well as 2014 taxable losses for Mitten partially offset by state income tax and a $9.8 million valuation allowance on the deferred tax assets of our Western Canadian business.\nAs of December 31, 2015, a full valuation allowance has been provided against certain deferred tax assets as it is presently deemed more likely than not that the benefit of such net tax assets will not be utilized. Due to recent cumulative losses, we did not rely upon projections of future taxable income in assessing the recoverability of deferred tax assets. Our effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2015 was approximately 2.2%. For the year ended December 31, 2015 our effective tax rate varied from the statutory rate primarily due to state income tax expense, changes in the valuation allowance, changes in tax contingencies and foreign income tax expense.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n2015 Debt Transaction\nOn November 5, 2015, Ply Gem Industries entered into a second amended and restated ABL Facility. Among other things, the second amended and restated ABL Facility: (i) increased the overall facility to $350.0 million, (ii) provided an accordion feature of $50.0 million, and (iii) established the applicable margin for borrowings under the ABL Facility to a range of 1.25% to 2.00% for Eurodollar rate loans, depending on availability. All outstanding loans under the second amended and restated ABL Facility are due and payable in full on November 5, 2020.\n2014 Debt Transactions\nOn January 30, 2014, Ply Gem Industries completed an offering of $500.0 million aggregate principal amount of 6.50% Senior Notes due 2022 (the 6.50% Senior Notes\u201d) and also entered into a $430.0 million senior secured term loan facility due 2021 (the Term Loan Facility\u201d). The approximate $927.9 million of net proceeds from the issuance of the 6.50% Senior Notes and the borrowings under the Term Loan Facility were used by Ply Gem Industries to purchase all of its 8.25% Senior Secured Notes and 9.375% Senior Notes tendered in the tender offers described below, to satisfy and discharge the remaining obligations under the indentures governing the 8.25% Senior Secured Notes and 9.375% Senior Notes and to pay related fees and expenses.\nOn January 30, 2014, Ply Gem Industries purchased approximately $705.9 million of the outstanding 8.25% Senior Secured Notes in a tender offer at a price of $1,067.50 per $1,000 principal amount, which included an early tender payment of $30.00 per $1,000 principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest. On January 30, 2014, Ply Gem Industries also purchased approximately $94.7 million of the outstanding 9.375% Senior Notes in a tender offer at a price of $1,108.36 per $1,000 principal amount, which included an early tender payment of $30.00 per $1,000 principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest. As a result, Ply Gem Industries paid aggregate consideration of approximately $780.2 million for the tendered 8.25% Senior Secured Notes, including a tender premium of approximately $47.6 million, and paid aggregate consideration of approximately $107.6 million for the tendered 9.375% Senior Notes, including a tender premium of approximately $10.3 million. On March 1, 2014, pursuant to the terms of the indenture governing the 8.25% Senior Secured Notes, Ply Gem Industries redeemed the remaining approximate $50.1 million principal amount of the outstanding 8.25% Senior Secured Notes at a redemption price equal to 106.188% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest. On February 16, 2014, pursuant to the terms of the indenture governing the 9.375% Senior Notes, Ply Gem Industries redeemed the remaining approximate $1.3 million principal amount of the outstanding 9.375% Senior Notes at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount plus the make-whole\u201d premium required under the indenture governing the 9.375% Senior Notes (which equated to 110.179% of the principal amount thereof), plus accrued and unpaid interest. As of March 1, 2014, there were no longer outstanding any 8.25% Senior Secured Notes. As of February 16, 2014, there were no longer outstanding any 9.375% Senior Notes.\nOn September 19, 2014, Ply Gem Industries issued an additional $150.0 million aggregate principal amount of its 6.50% Senior Notes ( Senior Tack-on Notes\u201d). The net proceeds from the transaction were approximately $138.0 million after deducting $10.1 million for the debt discount and $1.9 million in transaction costs. The proceeds from the issuance of the Senior Tack-on Notes and approximately $3.1 million of cash on hand were used by Ply Gem Industries to fund Ply Gem Industries' purchase of all the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of Simonton, to pay fees and expenses related to the offering of the Senior Tack-on Notes and the Simonton acquisition and for general corporate purposes, including the repayment of approximately $10.0 million of indebtedness under the ABL Facility. The additional $150.0 million of Senior Tack-on Notes have the same terms and covenants as the original $500.0 million of 6.50% Senior Notes. The 6.50% Senior Notes originally issued in January 2014 and the Senior Tack-on Notes issued in September 2014 (collectively, the \"6.50% Senior Notes\") will mature on February 1, 2022 and bear interest at the rate of 6.50%.\nIn November 2014, we exercised a portion of the accordion feature under the ABL Facility for $50.0 million, or 50% of the eligible accordion, increasing the ABL Facility from $250.0 million to $300.0 million to primarily account for the additional borrowing base acquired from Simonton.\nMay 2013 initial public offering and related transactions\nIn May 2013, we issued 18,157,895 shares of common stock receiving net proceeds of approximately $353.8 million after underwriting discounts and commissions of approximately $25.4 million and offering expenses of approximately $2.5 million. The net proceeds were primarily utilized to redeem certain of our outstanding indebtedness and for other uses as detailed below:\nTable 61: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Redemption of $84.0 million principal amount of 8.25% Senior Secured Notes with a call premium of approximately $2.5 million and accrued interest of $2.6 million.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 62: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Redemption of $64.0 million principal amount of 9.375% Senior Notes with a call premium of approximately $6.0 million and accrued interest of $1.1 million.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 63: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Payments made on the ABL Facility of $80.0 million.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 64: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Termination of CI Advisory Agreement for $18.9 million.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 65: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Acquisition of Mitten for $76.8 million.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 66: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>General corporate purposes usage of $17.9 million.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThese debt redemptions provided annualized cash interest savings of approximately $13.0 million excluding the ABL Facility and the 2014 debt transactions.\nIn connection with the IPO, we entered into a Tax Receivable Agreement which provides for us to pay the Tax Receivable Entity 85% of the amount of cash savings if any, in U.S. federal, state and local income tax that we actually realize in periods ending after the IPO as a result of (i) net operating loss (\"NOL\") carryovers from periods (or portions thereof) ending before January 1, 2013, (ii) deductible expenses attributable to the transactions related to the IPO and (iii) deductions related to imputed interest deemed to be paid by us as a result of or attributable to payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement. Future payments on the Tax Receivable Agreement could be substantial. Management estimates that the total amount of payments under the Tax Receivable Agreement could be approximately $100.0 million assuming no material changes in the relevant tax law, that we earn sufficient taxable income to utilize the net operating loss carry forwards, and that utilization of such tax attributes is not subject to limitation under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \"Code\") as the result of an ownership change\u201d. It is possible that future transactions or events or changes in estimates could increase or decrease the actual tax benefits realized from these tax attributes and the corresponding Tax Receivable Agreement payments and liability.\nGeneral cash flow movements\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, cash and cash equivalents increased to approximately $109.4 million compared to approximately $33.2 million as of December 31, 2014. During the year ended December 31, 2014, cash and cash equivalents decreased from approximately $69.8 million to $33.2 million as of December 31, 2014. The increase in cash was driven by a $61.0 million improvement in operating earnings year over year resulting from improved market conditions, higher selling prices, and favorable material costs. This improved operating performance resulted in a $71.1 million increase in working capital during the year ended December 31, 2015 relative to the year ended December 31, 2014. Accounts receivable improved by $7.6 million and inventory improved by $56.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to year ended December 31, 2014. The approximate $29.5 million inventory decrease from December 31, 2014 to December 31, 2015 resulted from successful management of 2015 inventory levels, in connection with higher sales demands, as contrasted with the ramp up in inventory levels at the end of 2014 in anticipation of higher sales volumes in 2015.\nOur business is seasonal because inclement weather during the winter months reduces the level of building and remodeling activity in both the home repair and remodeling and the new home construction sectors, especially in the Northeast and Midwest regions of the United States and Canada. As a result, our liquidity typically increases during the second and third quarters as our borrowing base increases under the ABL Facility reaching a peak early in the fourth quarter, and decreases late in the fourth quarter and throughout the first quarter.\nOur primary cash needs are for working capital, capital expenditures and debt service. Our annual cash interest charges for debt service, including the ABL Facility, are estimated to be approximately $60.7 million for fiscal year 2016. As of December 31, 2015, we did not have any scheduled debt maturities until 2020. The specific debt instruments and their corresponding terms and due dates are described in the following sections. Our capital expenditures have historically averaged approximately 1.5% to 2.0% of net sales on an annual basis. For the year ending December 31, 2016, we estimate that our capital expenditures will be in a range from 2.00% to 2.25% of net sales. We finance these cash requirements through internally generated cash flow and funds borrowed under Ply Gem Industries' ABL Facility.\nPly Gem's specific cash flow movement for the year ended December 31, 2015 is summarized below:\nCash provided by (used in) operating activities\nNet cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2015 was approximately $139.3 million. Net cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2014 was approximately $15.2 million, and net cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2013 was approximately $14.7 million.\nThe increase in cash provided by operating activities was impacted by the increase in operating earnings of approximately $61.0 million which was driven by improved operating performance for our Windows and Doors segment and Siding, Fencing and Stone segment of approximately $45.9 million and $21.6 million, respectively for the year ended December 31, 2015. In addition to the improvement in operating earnings, we also had improved working capital metrics during the year ended December 31, 2015 relative to the year ended December 31, 2014 of approximately $71.1 million related to improved accounts receivable and inventory as we experienced improved collection rates on receivables and managed our seasonal inventory build more effectively.\nThe increase in cash used in operating activities during 2014 was primarily caused by a deterioration in primary working capital (accounts receivable, inventories, and accounts payable) offset by a $33.7 million improvement in operating earnings in 2014. As our liquidity has improved, we have taken eligible early pay discounts at an increased rate during 2014 as compared to 2013. This reduced payables while net sales increases of 14.7% increased receivable and inventories.\nCash used in investing activities\nNet cash used in investing activities for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013 was approximately $54.7 million, $153.7 million, and $123.0 million, respectively. The cash used in investing activities in 2015 was primarily for the acquisition of Canyon Stone and capital expenditures on various ongoing capital projects. The Canyon Stone acquisition was approximately $21.0 million net of cash acquired. Capital expenditures for 2015 were approximately 1.8% of net sales, consistent with our historical average.\nThe cash used in investing activities in 2014 was primarily for the acquisition of Simonton and capital expenditures on various ongoing capital projects. The Simonton acquisition was approximately $130.9 million net of cash acquired. Capital expenditures for 2014 were approximately 1.5% of net sales, consistent with our historical average.\nThe cash used in investing activities in 2013 was primarily for the acquisitions of Mitten and Gienow in 2013 and capital expenditures on various ongoing capital projects in both years. The 2013 acquisitions consisted of approximately $76.8 million paid for Mitten and approximately $20.4 million paid for Gienow. Capital expenditures for 2013 were higher, at approximately 1.9% of net sales, compared to our historical average of 1.5% due primarily to the Windows and Doors segment purchasing manufacturing equipment and tooling to address the significant volume growth in certain geographical areas. In addition, the Windows and Doors segment continues to incur additional capital expenditures for its \"enterprise lean\" product streamlining initiative aimed at optimizing our SKUs while improving certain functionalities across multiple window products. By streamlining product offerings, we will be able to capitalize on operating efficiencies in a recovering U.S. housing market allowing us to produce identical product at multiple facilities throughout the United States.\nCash provided by (used in) financing activities\nNet cash used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2015 was approximately $3.5 million, primarily related to the 1.0% principal repayment of $4.3 million required by the Term Loan Facility and the payment of $1.4 million in debt issuance costs. These payments were offset by $2.2 million in cash provided by the exercise of stock options.\nNet cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2014 was approximately $135.5 million, primarily from the issuance of an additional $150.0 million in 6.50% Senior Notes, which net of fees was utilized for the Simonton acquisition. The long term debt refinancing in the year ended December 31, 2014 that occurred in January 2014 was essentially cash neutral after considering the final debt structure and related premiums/discounts with proceeds of $927.9 million offset by debt payments on the 8.25% Senior Secured Notes and 9.375% Senior Notes of $852.0 million, $61.1 million of tender/call premiums, and $14.6 million of debt issuance costs. The issuance of an additional $150.0 million in 6.50% Senior Notes in the year ended December 31, 2014 resulted in net proceeds of approximately $137.8 million after deducting $10.1 million for the debt discount and approximately $2.1 million in transaction costs incurred.\nNet cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2013 was approximately $181.2 million, primarily from net proceeds from the issuance of common stock of $353.8 million offset by the redemption of long-term debt of $148.0 million combined with the $8.5 million of call premiums associated with that redemption, $15.0 million of revolver payments, and $1.3 million in debt issuance costs paid primarily related to the entering into an amended and restated credit agreement governing the ABL Facility on November 1, 2013.\nPly Gem's specific debt instruments and terms are described below:\n6.50% Senior Notes due 2022\nOn January 30, 2014, Ply Gem Industries issued $500.0 million aggregate principal amount of 6.50% Senior Notes at par. On September 19, 2014, Ply Gem Industries issued an additional $150.0 million aggregate principal amount of 6.50% Senior Notes (the \"Senior Tack-on Notes\") at an issue price of 93.25%. Interest accrues at 6.50% per annum and is paid semi-annually on February 1 and August 1 of each year. The 6.50% Senior Notes will mature on February 1, 2022.\nPrior to February 1, 2017, Ply Gem Industries may redeem up to 40% of aggregate principal amount of the 6.50% Senior Notes with the net cash proceeds from certain equity offerings at a redemption price equal to 106.50% of the aggregate principal amount of the 6.50% Senior Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, provided that at least 50% of the aggregate principal amount of the 6.50% Senior Notes remains outstanding after the redemption. Prior to February 1, 2017, Ply Gem Industries may redeem the 6.50% Senior Notes, in whole or in part, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount plus a make-whole\u201d premium plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any. At any time on or after February 1, 2017, Ply Gem Industries may redeem the 6.50% Senior Notes, in whole or in part, at declining redemption prices set forth in the indenture governing the 6.50% Senior Notes plus, in each case, accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the redemption date. The effective interest rate for the 6.50% Senior Notes is 8.39% after considering each of the different interest expense components of this instrument, including the coupon payment and the deferred debt issuance costs.\nThe 6.50% Senior Notes are fully and unconditionally and jointly and severally guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by Ply Gem Holdings and all of the wholly-owned domestic subsidiaries of Ply Gem Industries (the Guarantors\u201d). The indenture governing the 6.50% Senior Notes contains certain covenants that limit the ability of Ply Gem Industries and its restricted subsidiaries to incur additional indebtedness, pay dividends or make other distributions or repurchase or redeem their stock, make loans and investments, sell assets, incur certain liens, enter into agreements restricting their ability to pay dividends, enter into transactions with affiliates, and consolidate, merge or sell assets. In particular, Ply Gem Industries and its restricted subsidiaries may not incur additional debt (other than permitted debt (as defined in the indenture) in limited circumstances) unless, after giving effect to such incurrence, the consolidated interest coverage ratio of Ply Gem Industries would be at least 2.00 to 1.00. In the absence of satisfying the consolidated interest coverage ratio test, Ply Gem Industries and its restricted subsidiaries may only incur additional debt under certain circumstances, including, but not limited to, debt under credit facilities (as defined in the indenture) (x) in an amount not to exceed the greater of (a) $350.0 million and (b) the borrowing base (as defined in the indenture) and (y) in an amount not to exceed the greater of (A) $575.0 million and (B) the aggregate amount of indebtedness (as defined in the indenture) that that would cause the consolidated secured debt ratio (as defined in the indenture) to be equal to 4.00 to 1.00; purchase money indebtedness in an aggregate amount not to exceed the greater of (x) $35.0 million and (y) 10% of consolidated net tangible assets (as defined in the indenture) at any one time outstanding; debt of foreign subsidiaries in an aggregate amount not to exceed the greater of (x) $60.0 million and (y) 15% of consolidated net tangible assets (as defined in the indenture) at any one time outstanding; debt pursuant to a general basket in an aggregate amount at any one time outstanding not to exceed the greater of (x) $75.0 million and (y) 20% of consolidated net tangible assets; and the refinancing of debt under certain circumstances.\nOn September 5, 2014, Ply Gem Industries completed an exchange offer with respect to the 6.50% Senior Notes issued in January 2014 to exchange $500.0 million 6.50% Senior Notes registered under the Securities Act for $500.0 million of the issued and outstanding 6.50% Senior Notes. Upon completion of the exchange offer, all $500.0 million of issued and outstanding 6.50% Senior Notes were registered under the Securities Act. On January 23, 2015, Ply Gem Industries completed an exchange offer with respect to the Senior Tack-on Notes issued in September 2014 to exchange $150.0 million Senior Tack-on Notes registered under the Securities Act for $150.0 million of the issued and outstanding Senior Tack-on Notes. Upon completion of the exchange offer, all $150.0 million of issued and outstanding Senior Tack-on Notes were registered under the Securities Act.\nTerm Loan Facility due 2021\nOn January 30, 2014, Ply Gem Industries entered into a credit agreement governing the terms of its $430.0 million Term Loan Facility. Ply Gem Industries originally borrowed $430.0 million under the Term Loan Facility on January 30, 2014, with an original discount of approximately $2.2 million, yielding proceeds of approximately $427.9 million. The Term Loan Facility will mature on January 30, 2021. The Term Loan Facility requires scheduled quarterly payments in an aggregate annual amount equal to 1.00% of the original aggregate principal amount of the Term Loan Facility with the balance due at maturity. Interest on outstanding borrowings under the Term Loan Facility is paid quarterly.\nBorrowings under the Term Loan Facility bear interest at a rate equal to, at Ply Gem Industries' option, either (a) a base rate determined by reference to the highest of (i) the prime rate of the administrative agent under the credit agreement, (ii) the federal funds rate plus 0.50% and (iii) the adjusted LIBO rate for a one-month interest period plus 1.00% or (b) a LIBO rate determined by reference to the cost of funds for eurocurrency deposits in dollars for the interest period relevant to such borrowing, adjusted for certain additional costs, subject to a 1.00% floor, plus, in each case, an applicable margin of 3.00% for any eurocurrency loan and 2.00% for any alternate base rate loan. As of December 31, 2015, the Company's interest rate on the Term Loan Facility was 4.00%. The effective interest rate for the Term Loan is 7.00% after considering each of the different interest expense components of this instrument, including the coupon payment, the deferred debt issuance costs and the original issue discount.\nThe Term Loan Facility allows Ply Gem Industries to request one or more incremental term loan facilities in an aggregate amount not to exceed the greater of (x) $140.0 million and (y) an amount such that Ply Gem Industries' consolidated senior secured debt ratio (as defined in the credit agreement), on a pro forma basis, does not exceed 3.75 to 1.00, in each case, subject to certain conditions and receipt of commitments by existing or additional financial institutions or institutional lenders.\nThe Term Loan Facility requires Ply Gem Industries to prepay outstanding term loans, subject to certain exceptions, with: (i) 50% (which percentage will be reduced to 25% if our consolidated senior secured debt ratio is equal or less than 2.50 to 1.00 but greater than 2.00 to 1.00 and to 0% if our consolidated senior secured debt ratio is equal to or less than 2.00 to 1.00) of our annual excess cash flow (as defined in the credit agreement), to the extent such excess cash flow exceeds $15.0 million, commencing with the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015; (ii) 100% of the net cash proceeds of certain non-ordinary course asset sales or certain insurance and condemnation proceeds, in each case subject to certain exceptions and reinvestment rights; and (iii) 100% of the net cash proceeds of certain issuances of debt, other than proceeds from debt permitted under the Term Loan Facility. Ply Gem Industries may voluntarily repay outstanding loans under the Term Loan Facility at any time without premium or penalty, other than customary breakage\u201d costs with respect to LIBOR loans. As of and for the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company's consolidated senior secure debt ratio was 1.97 and as a result no excess cash flow payment under the Term Loan Facility was required. However, the Company elected on March 10, 2016 to voluntarily prepay $30.0 million on the Term Loan Facility to reduce its outstanding indebtedness.\nThe Term Loan Facility is secured on a first-priority lien basis by the stock of Ply Gem Industries and by substantially all of the assets (other than the assets securing the obligations under the ABL Facility, which primarily consist of accounts receivable, inventory, cash, deposit accounts, securities accounts, chattel paper, contract rights, instruments, documents related thereto and proceeds of the foregoing) of Ply Gem Industries and the Guarantors that are subsidiaries of Ply Gem Industries and on a second-priority lien basis by the assets that secure the ABL Facility.\nThe Term Loan Facility includes negative covenants, subject to certain exceptions, that are substantially the same as the negative covenants in the 6.50% Senior Notes but does not contain any restrictive financial covenants. The Term Loan Facility also restricts the ability of Ply Gem Industries' subsidiaries to enter into agreements restricting their ability to grant liens to secure the Term Loan Facility and contains a restriction on changes in fiscal year.\n8.25% Senior Secured Notes due 2018\nOn February 11, 2011, Ply Gem Industries issued $800.0 million of 8.25% Senior Secured Notes at par. Ply Gem Industries used the proceeds to purchase approximately $724.6 million principal amount of its outstanding 11.75% Senior Secured Notes in a tender offer, to redeem the remaining approximate $0.4 million principal amount of outstanding 11.75% Senior Secured Notes, and to pay related fees and expenses. A portion of the early tender premiums and the original unamortized discount on the 11.75% Senior Secured Notes was recorded as a discount on the $800.0 million of 8.25% Senior Secured Notes given that the 2011 transaction was predominately accounted for as a loan modification. On February 15, 2012, Ply Gem Industries issued an additional $40.0 million principal amount of its 8.25% Senior Secured Notes. The 8.25% Senior Secured Notes would have matured on February 15, 2018 and bore interest at the rate of 8.25% per annum. Interest was paid semi-annually on February 15 and August 15 of each year. The 8.25% Senior Secured Notes were fully and unconditionally and jointly and severally guaranteed on a senior secured basis by the Guarantors. The 8.25% Senior Secured Notes and the related guarantees were secured on a first-priority lien basis by substantially all of the assets (other than the assets securing our obligations under the ABL Facility, which consist of accounts receivable, inventory, cash, deposit accounts, securities accounts, chattel paper and proceeds of the foregoing and certain assets such as contract rights, instruments and documents related thereto) of Ply Gem Industries and the Guarantors and on a second-priority lien basis by the assets that secure the ABL Facility.\nOn January 30, 2014, Ply Gem Industries purchased approximately $705.9 million of its outstanding 8.25% Senior Secured Notes in a tender offer at a price of $1,067.50 per $1,000 principal amount, which included an early tender payment of $30.00 per $1,000 principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest. On January 30, 2014, Ply Gem Industries irrevocably deposited with the trustee for the 8.25% Senior Secured Notes an amount sufficient to satisfy and discharge its obligations under the 8.25% Senior Secured Notes and the indenture. On March 1, 2014, Ply Gem Industries redeemed the remaining outstanding principal amount of the 8.25% Senior Secured Notes at a redemption price equal to 106.188% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date. Following the redemption, there were no longer any 8.25% Senior Secured Notes outstanding.\nSenior Secured Asset Based Revolving Credit Facility due 2020\nOn November 5, 2015, Ply Gem Holdings, Inc., Ply Gem Industries, Inc., Gienow Canada Inc., and Mitten Inc. (together with Gienow, the Canadian Borrowers\u201d) entered into a second amended and restated credit agreement governing the ABL Facility. Among other things, the second amendment and restatement of the credit agreement governing the ABL Facility: (i) increased the overall facility to $350.0 million from $300.0 million, (ii) established an accordion feature of $50.0 million, (iii) reduced the applicable margin for borrowings under the ABL Facility to a range from 1.25% to 2.00% for Eurodollar rate loans, depending on availability, and (iv) extended the maturity until November 5, 2020. Under the ABL Facility, $300.0 million is available to Ply Gem Industries and $50.0 million is available to the Canadian Borrowers. The following summary describes the ABL Facility after giving effect to the amendment and restatement. As a result of the ABL Facility amendment in which the loan syndication consisted of previous members who either maintained or increased their position as well as new syndication members, the Company capitalized new debt issuance costs of $1.5 million and will amortize these costs through 2020.\nBorrowings under the ABL Facility bear interest at a rate per annum equal to, at Ply Gem Industries' option, either (a) a base rate determined by reference to the higher of (1) the corporate base rate of the administrative agent under the ABL Facility and (2) the federal funds rate plus 0.5% or (b) a Eurodollar rate determined by reference to the costs of funds for U.S. dollar deposits for the interest period relevant to such borrowing adjusted for certain additional costs, in each case plus an applicable margin. The initial applicable margin for borrowings under the ABL Facility was 0.50% for base rate loans and 1.50% for Eurodollar rate loans. The applicable margin for borrowings under the ABL Facility is subject to step ups and step downs based on average excess availability under the ABL Facility. Swingline loans bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the base rate plus the applicable margin.\nIn addition to paying interest on outstanding principal under the ABL Facility, Ply Gem Industries is required to pay a commitment fee in respect of the unutilized commitments thereunder, which fee will be determined based on utilization of the ABL Facility (increasing when utilization is low and decreasing when utilization is high) multiplied by a commitment fee rate determined by reference to average excess availability under the ABL Facility. The commitment fee rate during any fiscal quarter is 0.375% when average excess availability is greater than $100.0 million for the preceding fiscal quarter and 0.25% when average availability is less than or equal to $100.0 million for the preceding fiscal quarter. Ply Gem Industries must also pay customary letter of credit fees equal to the applicable margin on Eurodollar loans and agency fees. As of December 31, 2015, the Company's interest rate on the ABL Facility was approximately 1.75%. The ABL Facility requires that if (a) excess availability is less than the greater of (x) 10.0% of the lower of the borrowing base and the aggregate commitments and (y) $25.0 million or (b) any event of default has occurred and is continuing, Ply Gem Industries must comply with a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio test of 1.0 to 1.0. If the excess availability under the ABL Facility is less than the greater of (a) 12.5% of the lesser of the borrowing base and the aggregate commitments and (b) $30.0 million ($27.5 million for the months of January, February, March and April) for a period of 5 consecutive days or an event of default has occurred and is continuing, all cash from Ply Gem Industries material deposit accounts (including all concentration accounts) will be swept daily into a collection account controlled by the administrative agent under the ABL Facility and used to repay outstanding loans and cash collateralize letters of credit.\nAll obligations under the ABL Facility are unconditionally guaranteed by Ply Gem Holdings and substantially all of Ply Gem Industries' existing and future, direct and indirect, wholly owned domestic subsidiaries. All obligations under the ABL Facility, and the guarantees of those obligations, are secured, subject to certain exceptions, by substantially all of the assets of Ply Gem Industries and the guarantors, including a first-priority security interest in personal property consisting of accounts receivable, inventory, cash, deposit accounts, and certain related assets and proceeds of the foregoing and a second-priority security interest in, and mortgages on, substantially all of Ply Gem Industries' and the Guarantors' material owned real property and equipment and all assets that secure the Term Loan Facility on a first-priority basis. In addition to being secured by the collateral securing the obligations of Ply Gem Industries under the domestic collateral package, the obligations of the Canadian Borrowers, which are borrowers under the Canadian sub-facility under the ABL Facility, are also secured by a first-priority security interest in substantially all of the assets of such Canadian subsidiaries, plus additional mortgages in Canada, and a pledge by Ply Gem Industries of the remaining 35% of the equity interests of the Canadian Borrowers pledged only to secure the Canadian sub-facility.\nThe ABL Facility contains certain covenants that limit Ply Gem Industries' ability and the ability of Ply Gem Industries' subsidiaries to incur additional indebtedness, pay dividends or make other distributions or repurchase or redeem their stock, make loans and investments, sell assets, incur certain liens, enter into transactions with affiliates, and consolidate, merge or sell assets.\nAs of December 31, 2015, Ply Gem Industries had approximately $343.2 million of contractual availability and approximately $204.9 million of borrowing base availability under the ABL Facility, reflecting $0.0 million of borrowings outstanding and approximately $6.8 million of letters of credit and priority payables reserves.\n9.375% Senior Notes due 2017\nOn September 27, 2012, Ply Gem Industries issued $160.0 million of 9.375% Senior Notes at par. Ply Gem Industries used the proceeds of the offering, together with cash on hand, to satisfy and discharge its obligations under the 13.125% Senior Subordinated Notes and the indenture governing the 13.125% Senior Subordinated Notes. The 9.375% Senior Notes would have matured on April 15, 2017 and bore interest at the rate of 9.375% per annum. Interest was paid semi-annually on April 15 and October 15 of each year. The 9.375% Senior Notes were unsecured and fully and unconditionally and jointly and severally guaranteed on a senior unsecured basis by the Guarantors.\nOn January 30, 2014, Ply Gem Industries purchased approximately $94.7 million of the outstanding 9.375% Senior Notes at a tender price of $1,108.36 per $1,000 principal amount, which included an early tender payment of $30.00 per $1,000 principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest. On January 30, 2014, Ply Gem Industries irrevocably deposited with the trustee for the 9.375% Senior Notes an amount sufficient to satisfy and discharge its obligations under the 9.375% Senior Notes and the indenture. On February 16, 2014, Ply Gem Industries redeemed the remaining outstanding principal amount of the 9.375% Senior Notes at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount plus the make-whole\u201d premium required under the indenture (which equated to 110.179% of the principal amount thereof), plus accrued and unpaid interest. Following the redemption, there were no longer any 9.375% Senior Notes outstanding.\nLoss on debt modification or extinguishment\nAs a result of the January 2014 issuance of the 6.50% Senior Notes and the entry into the Term Loan Facility and the tender, redemption, and repurchase of the 8.25% Senior Secured Notes and the 9.375% Senior Notes (the \"January 2014 Refinancing\") during the year ended December 31, 2014, the Company performed an analysis to determine the proper accounting treatment for the January 2014 Refinancing. Specifically, the Company evaluated each creditor with ownership in both the 6.50% Senior Notes and/or Term Loan Facility debt instruments and the old 8.25% Senior Secured Notes and/or 9.375% Senior Notes to determine whether the transaction should be accounted for as a modification or an extinguishment of debt as it relates to each individual creditor. The Company had approximately $34.4 million of unamortized debt discount and $14.9 million of unamortized debt issuance costs associated with the 8.25% Senior Secured Notes and 9.375% Senior Notes, of which approximately $4.8 million and $2.1 million, respectively, were expensed as a loss on extinguishment of debt in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2014 as a result of the January 2014 Refinancing.\nThe Company also incurred an early tender premium of approximately $61.1 million in conjunction with this transaction, of which approximately $52.6 million was recorded as a discount on the 6.50% Senior Notes and the Term Loan Facility and approximately $8.5 million was expensed as a loss on extinguishment of debt in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2014. The Company also expensed approximately $0.3 million for the third party fees for the 8.25% Senior Secured Notes and 9.375% Senior Notes as a result of the January 2014 Refinancing for the year ended December 31, 2014. The Company also incurred approximately $14.7 million of costs associated with the 6.50% Senior Notes and Term Loan Facility, of which approximately $9.2 million was recorded as debt issuance costs and approximately $5.5 million was expensed as a loss on modification of debt in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2014. Additionally, the Company incurred an original issue discount of approximately $2.2 million for the Term Loan Facility, of which approximately $1.9 million was recorded as a discount and approximately $0.3 million was expensed as a loss on extinguishment of debt in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nAs a result of the June 28, 2013 redemption of approximately $84.0 million aggregate principal amount of the 8.25% Senior Secured Notes, the Company recorded a loss on debt extinguishment of approximately $8.1 million in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2013.\nAs a result of the June 22, 2013 redemption of approximately $64.0 million aggregate principal amount of the 9.375% Senior Notes, the Company recorded a loss on debt extinguishment of approximately $10.8 million in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2013.\nBased on these financing transactions, the Company recognized a loss on debt modification or extinguishment of approximately $0.0 million, $21.4 million and $18.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively, as summarized in the table below.\nTable 67: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

requirements, including our internal growth, through a combination of cash flows from operations and, if necessary, from borrowings under our ABL Facility. We believe that we will continue to meet our liquidity requirements over the next 12 months. We believe that our operating units are positive cash flow generating units and will continue to sustain their operations without any significant liquidity concerns. The performance of these operating units is significantly impacted by the performance of the housing industry, specifically single family housing starts and the repair and remodeling activity. Any unforeseen or unanticipated downturn in the housing industry could have a negative impact on our liquidity position.\nManagement anticipates that our current liquidity position, as well as expected cash flows from our operations should be sufficient to meet ongoing operational cash flow needs, capital expenditures, debt service obligations, and other fees payable under other contractual obligations for the foreseeable future. As of December 31, 2015, we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $109.4 million, approximately $343.2 million of contractual availability under the ABL Facility and approximately $204.9 million of borrowing base availability.\nIn order to further supplement the Company's operating cash flow, the Company has from time to time opportunistically accessed capital markets based on prevailing economic and financial conditions. Based on market conditions, the Company may elect to pursue additional financing alternatives in the future.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table summarizes our contractual cash obligations under financing arrangements and lease commitments, including interest amounts, as of December 31, 2015. Interest on the 6.50% Senior Notes is fixed. Interest on the Term Loan Facility is variable and has been presented at the average rate of approximately 4.0% based on the current LIBOR rate and the 1.0% floor structure of the instrument. Interest on the ABL Facility is variable and has been presented at the average rate of approximately 1.8%. Actual interest rates for future periods may differ from those presented here.\nTable 68: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Less Than\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>More than\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Amounts in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1 Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1 - 3 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3 - 5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5 Years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term debt (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,119,077\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,300\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8,600\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>55,202\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,050,975\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest payments (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>426,585\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>55,628\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>152,474\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>151,098\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>67,385\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-cancelable lease commitments (3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>126,846\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>27,094\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>39,900\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26,740\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>33,112\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchase obligations (4)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>72,670\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>72,670\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other long-term liabilities (5)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,471\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>647\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,294\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,294\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,236\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,751,649\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>160,339\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>202,268\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>234,334\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,154,708\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 69: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>Long-term debt is shown before discount, and consists of our 6.50% Senior Notes, Term Loan Facility, and ABL Facility.

We do not believe that inflation has had a material impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations during the past three fiscal years.\nThe demand for our products is seasonal, particularly in the Northeast and Midwest regions of the United States and Canada where inclement weather conditions during the winter months usually reduces the level of building and remodeling activity in both the home repair and remodeling and the new home construction sectors. Our sales in both segments are usually lower during the first and fourth quarters. Since a portion of our manufacturing overhead and operating expenses are relatively fixed throughout the year, operating income and net earnings tend to be lower in quarters with lower sales levels. In addition, the demand for cash to fund our working capital is greater from late in the fourth quarter through the first quarter.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 1 to our consolidated

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is intended to clarify the results of our operations, certain changes in our financial position, liquidity, capital structure and business developments for the periods covered by the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion should be read in conjunction with, and is qualified by reference to, the other related information including, but not limited to, the audited consolidated financial statements (including the notes thereto and the independent registered public accounting firm's reports thereon), and the description of our business, all as set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, as well as the risk factors discussed below and in Item 1A.\nCertain statements in this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d are forward-looking statements.\u201d See Cautionary Statement with Respect to Forward-Looking Statements\u201d and Risk Factors.\u201d\nGeneral\nWe are a leading manufacturer of exterior building products in North America, operating in two reportable segments: (i) Siding, Fencing, and Stone and (ii) Windows and Doors, which comprised approximately 46% and 54% of our sales, respectively, for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015. These two segments produce a comprehensive product line of vinyl siding, designer accents, cellular PVC trim, vinyl fencing, vinyl and composite railing, stone veneer and vinyl windows and doors used in both the new construction market and the home repair and remodeling market in the United States and Canada. Vinyl building products have the leading share of sales volume in siding and windows in the United States. We also manufacture vinyl and aluminum soffit and siding accessories, aluminum trim coil, wood windows, aluminum windows, vinyl and aluminum-clad windows and steel and fiberglass doors, enabling us to bundle complementary and color-matched products and accessories with our core products. We believe that our comprehensive product portfolio and geographically diverse, low cost manufacturing platform allow us to better serve our customers and provide us with a competitive advantage over other exterior building products suppliers.\nThe following is a summary of Ply Gem's recent acquisition history:\n \u2022 On April 9, 2013, Ply Gem acquired all of the capital stock of Gienow WinDoor Ltd. (which was amalgamated into Gienow Canada Inc.) (\"Gienow\"), a manufacturer of windows and doors in Western Canada, for a purchase price, net of cash acquired, of $20.4 million. Gienow is our Western Canadian windows business and is part of the Windows and Doors segment. \n \u2022 On May 31, 2013, Ply Gem acquired all of the capital stock of Mitten Inc. (\"Mitten\"), a manufacturer of vinyl siding and distributor of various other exterior building products in Canada, for a purchase price, net of cash acquired, of $76.8 million. The majority of Mitten's operations are part of the Siding, Fencing and Stone segment. \n \u2022 On September 19, 2014, Ply Gem completed an acquisition for cash consideration of approximately $130.0 million to acquire the capital stock of Fortune Brands Windows Inc., and its direct and indirect wholly owned subsidiaries Simonton Building Products LLC, Simonton Industries, Inc., Simonton Windows, Inc., and SimEx, Inc. Simonton is a premier repair and remodeling window company with leading brand recognition and is part of the Windows and Doors segment. \n \u2022 On May 29, 2015, Ply Gem acquired substantially all of the assets of Canyon Stone, Inc. ( Canyon Stone\u201d), a manufacturer of stone veneer, for a purchase price of $21.0 million, subject to certain purchase price adjustments. Canyon Stone is included in our Siding, Fencing, and Stone segment. \nPrior to January 11, 2010, Ply Gem Holdings was a wholly owned subsidiary of Ply Gem Investment Holdings, which was a wholly owned subsidiary of Ply Gem Prime. On January 11, 2010, Ply Gem Investment Holdings was merged with and into Ply Gem Prime, with Ply Gem Prime being the surviving corporation. In May 2013, the Company issued 18,157,895 shares of common stock in an initial public offering and received gross proceeds of approximately $381.3 million in an IPO of its common stock. The shares began trading on The New York Stock Exchange on May 23, 2013 under the symbol \"PGEM\". Immediately prior to the closing of the IPO, Ply Gem Prime merged with and into Ply Gem Holdings, with Ply Gem Holdings being the surviving entity. In the merger, all of the preferred stock of Ply Gem Prime (including the subordinated debt of Ply Gem Prime that was converted into preferred stock in connection with the IPO) was converted into a number of shares of the Company's common stock based on the IPO price of the common stock and the liquidation value of and the maximum dividend amount in respect of the preferred stock.\nWe are a holding company with no operations or assets of our own other than the capital stock of our subsidiaries. The terms of Ply Gem Industries' $350.0 million ABL Facility and the credit agreement governing the terms of its $430.0 million Term Loan Facility place restrictions on the ability of Ply Gem Industries and our other subsidiaries to pay dividends and otherwise transfer assets to us. Further, the terms of the indenture governing Ply Gem Industries' $650.0 million 6.50% Senior Notes place restrictions on the ability of Ply Gem Industries and our other subsidiaries to pay dividends and otherwise transfer assets to us.\nFinancial statement presentation\nNet sales. Net sales represent the fixed selling price of our products plus certain shipping charges less applicable provisions for discounts and allowances. Allowances include cash discounts, volume rebates and returns among others.\nCost of products sold. Cost of products sold includes direct material and manufacturing costs, manufacturing depreciation, third-party and in-house delivery costs and product warranty expense.\nSelling, general and administrative expense. Selling, general and administrative expense ( SG&A expense\u201d) includes all non-product related operating expenses, including selling, marketing, research and development costs, information technology, and other general and administrative expenses.\nOperating earnings (loss). Operating earnings (loss) represents net sales less cost of products sold, SG&A expense, amortization of intangible assets, and initial public offering costs.\nImpact of commodity pricing\nPVC resin and aluminum are major components in the production of our products and changes in PVC resin and aluminum prices have a direct impact on our cost of products sold. Historically, we have been able to pass on a substantial portion of significant price increases to our customers. The results of operations for individual quarters can be negatively impacted by a delay between the time of raw material cost increases and price increases that we implement in our products, or conversely can be positively impacted by a delay between the time of a raw material price decrease and competitive pricing moves that we implement accordingly.\nImpact of weather\nSince our building products are intended for exterior use, our sales and operating earnings tend to be lower during periods of inclement weather. Weather conditions in the first and fourth quarters of each calendar year historically result in these quarters producing significantly less sales revenue than our second and third quarters of the year. As a result, we have historically had lower profits or higher losses in the first and fourth quarters of each calendar year. Our results of operations for individual quarters in the future may be impacted by adverse weather conditions. In addition, favorable or unfavorable weather conditions may influence the comparability of our results from year to year or from quarter to quarter.\nCritical accounting policies\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Certain of our accounting policies require the application of judgments in selecting the appropriate assumptions for calculating financial estimates. By their nature, these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty. We periodically evaluate the judgments and estimates used for our critical accounting policies to ensure that such judgments and estimates are reasonable for our interim and year-end reporting requirements. These judgments and estimates are based upon our historical experience, current trends and information available from other sources, as appropriate. If different conditions occur compared to our assumptions and judgments, the results could be materially different from our estimates. Management also believes that the nine areas where different assumptions could result in materially different reported results are (1) goodwill and intangible asset impairment tests, (2) accounts receivable related to the estimation of allowances for doubtful accounts, (3) inventories in estimating reserves for obsolete and excess inventory, (4) warranty reserves, (5) insurance reserves, (6) income taxes including the tax receivable agreement, (7) rebates, (8) pensions, and (9) environmental accruals and other contingencies. Although we believe the likelihood of a material difference in these areas is low based upon our historical experience, a 10% change in our allowance for doubtful accounts, inventory reserve estimates, and warranty reserve at December 31, 2015 would result in an approximate $0.4 million, $0.8 million, and $7.7 million impact on expenses, respectively. Additionally, we have included in the discussion that follows our estimation methodology for both accounts receivable and inventories. While all significant policies are important to our consolidated financial statements, some of these policies may be viewed as being critical. Our critical accounting policies include:\nRevenue Recognition. We recognize sales based upon shipment of products to our customers net of applicable provisions for discounts and allowances. Generally, the customer takes title upon shipment and assumes the risks and rewards of ownership of the product. For certain products, it is industry standard that customers take title to products upon delivery, at which time revenue is then recognized by the Company. Revenue includes the selling price of the product and all shipping costs paid by the customer. Revenue is reduced at the time of sale for estimated sales returns and all applicable allowances and discounts based on historical experience. We also provide for estimates of warranty, bad debts, shipping costs and certain sales-related customer programs at the time of sale. Shipping and warranty costs are included in cost of products sold. Bad debt expense and sales-related marketing programs are included in SG&A expense. We believe that our procedures for estimating such amounts are reasonable and historically have not resulted in material adjustments in subsequent periods when the estimates are reconciled to the actual amounts.\nAccounts Receivable. We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses from the inability of our customers to make required payments, which is provided for in bad debt expense. We determine the adequacy of this allowance by regularly reviewing our accounts receivable aging and evaluating individual customers' receivables, considering customers' financial condition, credit history and other current economic conditions. If a customer's financial condition was to deteriorate, which might impact its ability to make payment, then additional allowances may be required.\nInventories. Inventories in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets are valued at the lower of cost or market. We record provisions, as appropriate, to write-down obsolete and excess inventory to estimated net realizable value. The process for evaluating obsolete and excess inventory often requires subjective judgments and estimates concerning future sales levels, quantities and prices at which such inventory will be sold in the normal course of business. Accelerating the disposal process or incorrect estimates of future sales potential may cause actual results to differ from the estimates at the time such inventory is disposed or sold.\nGoodwill Impairment. We perform an annual test for goodwill impairment during the fourth quarter of each year (November 28th for 2015) and also at any other date when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may exceed their fair value. We use the two-step method to determine goodwill impairment. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value (Step One Analysis), we measure the possible goodwill impairment based upon a hypothetical allocation of the fair value estimate of the reporting unit to all of the underlying assets and liabilities of the reporting unit, including previously unrecognized intangible assets (Step Two Analysis). The excess of the reporting unit's fair value over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill. An impairment loss is recognized to the extent that a reporting unit's recorded goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill.\nTo evaluate goodwill impairment, we estimate the fair value of reporting units considering such factors as discounted cash flows and valuation multiples for comparable publicly traded companies. A significant reduction in projected sales and earnings which would lead to a reduction in future cash flows could indicate potential impairment.\nA summary of the key assumptions utilized in the goodwill impairment analysis at November 28, 2015, November 22, 2014, and November 23, 2013, as it relates to the Step One fair values and the sensitivities for these assumptions follows:\n\nAs of November 28, 2015, we maintained the terminal year estimated housing starts assumption consistent with 2014 and 2013 at 1,100,000, which reflects a normalized housing start level. We estimate that normalized recurring housing starts will be in a range of 1,000,000 to 1,200,000 to keep up with U.S. population growth according to the Joint Center for Housing Studies of Harvard University. We also maintained our terminal growth rate assumption at 3.0% for the three-year period, which is 0.5% lower than the assumption utilized in the Windows and Doors analysis due to Windows and Doors' higher correlation with the new construction market, which provides higher growth levels as we return to a normalized housing market. As of November 28, 2015, we increased the Siding, Fencing, and Stone's discount rate by 0.5% to 11.5%, due to anticipated new product growth included in our long-term forecasts, which offer more uncertainty than the existing revenue stream for Siding, Fencing, and Stone. As of November 22, 2014, we decreased the Siding, Fencing, and Stone discount rate by 0.5% to 11.0%, reflecting Siding, Fencing, and Stone's consistent financial performance with operating earnings of $113.1 million in a flat U.S. housing market relative to 2013. \nAs of November 28, 2015, we maintained our terminal year assumption for estimated housing starts at 1,100,000, which is consistent with 2014 and 2013. As of November 22, 2014, we also maintained the assumption for estimated housing starts in the terminal year at 1,100,000, which is consistent with 2013.\nAs of November 28, 2015, we decreased the Windows and Doors' discount rate by 2.0% to 17.0% as a reflection of the improved operating performance of the Windows and Doors reporting unit which, increased their operating earnings by $45.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2015 due to improved gross profit margins from higher selling prices and favorable commodity costs. As of November 22, 2014, we decreased the Windows and Doors' discount rate by 1.0% to 19.0%, as a reflection of the improved operating performance of the Windows and Doors reporting unit. Windows and Doors experienced a $10.9 million improvement in operating loss during 2014, as compared to 2013, due to improved gross profit margins and the minimization of operating inefficiencies.\nAs of November 28, 2015, we increased the Windows and Doors' control premium to 10.0% from 5.0% in 2014, primarily due to improved internal financial performance within the reporting unit as well as an improvement in market comparisons companies and overall market conditions and growth. As of November 22, 2014, we maintained the Windows and Doors' control premium at 5.0%, consistent with the prior year due to the continued lack of public transaction comparatives.\nOverall, we utilize the same key assumptions in preparing the prospective financial information ( PFI\u201d) utilized in the discounted cash flow test for the Siding, Fencing, and Stone and Windows and Doors reporting units. However, each reporting unit is impacted differently by industry trends, how market factors are influencing the reporting units' expected performance, competition, and other unique business factors as mentioned above. The Windows and Doors reporting unit has more exposure to the new construction market which experienced depressed housing market conditions during 2009-2011, which ultimately decreased operating performance for this reporting unit. Siding, Fencing, and Stone's performance has been more consistent and profitable resulting in less risk in the PFI.\n\nWe provide no assurance that: (1) valuation multiples will not decline, (2) discount rates will not increase, or (3) the earnings, book values or projected earnings and cash flows of our reporting units will not decline. We will continue to analyze changes to these assumptions in future periods. We will continue to evaluate goodwill during future periods and further declines in the residential housing and remodeling markets could result in future goodwill impairments.\nIncome Taxes. We utilize the asset and liability method in accounting for income taxes, which requires that the deferred tax consequences of temporary differences between the amounts recorded in our consolidated financial statements and the amounts included in our federal and state income tax returns be recognized in the consolidated balance sheet. The amount recorded in our consolidated financial statements reflects estimates of final amounts due to timing of completion and filing of actual income tax returns. Estimates are required with respect to, among other things, the appropriate state income tax rates used in the various states in which we and our subsidiaries are required to file, the potential utilization of operating and capital loss carry-forwards for both federal and state income tax purposes and valuation allowances required, if any, for tax assets that may not be realized in the future. We establish reserves when, despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully supportable, certain positions could be challenged, and the positions may not be fully sustained. We have executed a tax sharing agreement with Ply Gem Holdings and Ply Gem Investment Holdings (during 2010, Ply Gem Investment Holdings was merged with and into Ply Gem Prime, with Ply Gem Prime being the surviving corporation) pursuant to which tax liabilities for each respective party are computed on a stand-alone basis. The tax sharing agreement was amended in 2013 to reflect the merger of Ply Gem Prime Holdings with and into Ply Gem Holdings. Our U.S. subsidiaries file a consolidated federal income tax return, unitary, combined, or separate state income tax returns. Gienow Canada and Mitten file separate Canadian income tax returns.\nAt December 31, 2015, we remained in a full federal valuation allowance position due to our cumulative loss position for income tax purposes as well as a full state valuation allowance position for certain legal entities. As of December 31, 2015, we have a full valuation allowance for our foreign subsidiary, Gienow Canada, however, we did not have a valuation allowance for our foreign subsidiary, Mitten. Refer to Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding income taxes.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table summarizes net sales and net income (loss) by segment and is derived from the accompanying consolidated statements of operations included in this report.\n\nThe following tables set forth our results of operations based on the amounts and the percentage relationship of the items listed to net sales for the periods indicated. However, our results of operations set forth in the tables below may not necessarily be representative of our future operating results.\nThis review of performance is organized by business segment, reflecting the way we manage our business. Each business group leader is responsible for operating results down to operating earnings (loss). We use operating earnings as a performance measure as it captures the income and expenses within the management control of our business leaders. Corporate management is responsible for making all financing decisions. Therefore, each segment discussion focuses on the factors affecting operating earnings, while interest expense and income taxes and certain other unallocated expenses are separately discussed at the corporate level.\nSiding, Fencing, and Stone Segment\n\nNet Sales\nNet sales for the year ended December 31, 2015 increased from the year ended December 31, 2014 by approximately $38.5 million or 4.8%. The net sales increase for the year ended December 31, 2015 was related to our Canyon Stone acquisition, which was completed on May 29, 2015, and accounted for increased net sales of $17.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2015. Excluding Canyon Stone, our net sales increased $20.9 million or 2.6% during the year ended December 31, 2015. The net sales increase resulted predominantly from higher net sales in the United States of approximately $32.7 million partially offset by lower net sales in Canada of approximately $11.8 million. The 2.6% net sales increase resulted primarily from improved market conditions reflected in industry metrics for both the new construction and repair and remodeling markets. Our building products are typically installed on a new construction home 90 to 120 days after the start of the home, therefore single family housing starts commencing in the period from September of 2014 to September of 2015 directly impacts the demand for our products in the year ended December 31, 2015. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, single family housing starts increased 10.0% during this lag affected time period reflecting improved market conditions while heavy vinyl siding markets in the Northeast and Midwest only increased 2.6% on a lag effected basis. In addition to the new construction market improvement, remodeling activity, according to the Leading Indicator of Remodeling Activity ( LIRA\u201d), increased 5.6% during the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. The improved U.S. market conditions were partially offset by declining industry conditions in Canada where the deteriorating Canadian dollar negatively impacted our net sales by approximately $17.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2015. Excluding the negative foreign currency impact, our net sales in Canada through Mitten would have increased $6.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. During the year ended December 31, 2015, the Canadian dollar deteriorated 15.7% relative to the year ended December 31, 2014.\nDespite this negative foreign currency impact, the improved U.S. industry conditions of 2.6% for new construction and 5.6% for repair and remodeling resulted in increased net sales of approximately $27.1 million for our combined vinyl siding, metal accessory, and PVC trim products that fully offset the negative currency impact. We experienced increased PVC trim sales during the year ended December 31, 2015 relative to the year ended December 31, 2014 as this new product gained traction during 2015 after its market introduction in 2013. Our vinyl siding and metal accessory net sales increases resulted from new business wins and improved industry conditions. For the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, the percentage of net sales in vinyl siding and metal accessories represented approximately 60.1% and 24.5% and 62.2% and 24.3%, respectively, with our net sales of other products comprising approximately 15.4% and 13.5%. The net sales increase in other products resulted from the acquisition of Canyon Stone, which specializes in the manufactured stone category.\nThe improved U.S. market conditions which accounted for the majority of the 2.6% net sales increase during the year ended December 31, 2015 are further evidenced by the Vinyl Siding Institute reporting that U.S. vinyl siding industry shipments increased 1.6% during the year ended December 31, 2015 while shipments in Canada decreased 2.9% for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. The Canadian decrease reflected the challenging economic conditions that exist for Canada. Including Mitten, our U.S. market position in vinyl siding for the years ended December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014 was 38.8% and 38.8%, respectively, while our combined share of the Canadian vinyl siding market was 30.2% and 27.0%, respectively.\nNet sales for the year ended December 31, 2014 increased from the year ended December 31, 2013 by approximately $63.8 million or 8.6%. Our net sales were favorably impacted by the Mitten acquisition, which was completed on May 31, 2013, and accounted for increased net sales of approximately $39.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2014. Excluding Mitten, our Siding, Fencing, and Stone net sales increased $24.3 million or 3.3% for the year ended December 31, 2014 reflecting increased sales of our metal accessory products that resulted from new business wins, improved industry conditions in the second half of 2014 and higher selling prices to offset higher material costs partially offset by the challenging weather conditions that existed early in 2014. All of these factors contributed on a net basis to the 3.3% net sales growth during the year ended December 31, 2014 despite the Vinyl Siding Institute reporting that U.S. vinyl siding industry shipments increased a nominal 0.3% for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nIncluding Mitten, our U.S. market position in vinyl siding for the year ended December 31, 2014 was 38.8% compared to 39.5% for the year ended December 31, 2013, while our combined share of the Canadian vinyl siding market was 27.0% compared to 27.6% for the year ended December 31, 2013. These decreases in U.S. and Canadian market position resulted primarily from the timing of various orders from customers during 2014 compared to 2013. For the year ended December 31, 2014, the percentage of sales in vinyl siding and metal accessories represented approximately 62.2% and 24.3%, respectively, of our net sales with sales of other products comprising approximately 13.5%. These net sales percentages were consistent with the year ended December 31, 2013, for which the percentage of sales in vinyl siding and metal accessories represented approximately 62.6% and 25.5%, respectively, of our net sales with sales of other products comprising 11.9%.\nGross Profit\nGross profit for the year ended December 31, 2015 increased from the year ended December 31, 2014 by approximately $29.0 million or 13.9%. Excluding the impact of the Canyon Stone acquisition, which was completed on May 29, 2015 and contributed increased gross profit of approximately $5.0 million, our gross profit increased $24.0 million or 11.5%. The gross profit increase resulted from the 2.6% net sales increase resulting from improved market and weather conditions in the United States partially offset by the weakening Canadian dollar. The higher volumes experienced during the year ended December 31, 2015 enabled us to increase our operating leverage and cover fixed manufacturing costs relative to the lower volumes experienced during the year ended December 31, 2014. This operating leverage combined with lower freight expenses and favorable material cost pricing experienced during the year ended December 31, 2015 relative to the year ended December 31, 2014 increased our gross profit. For material costs, PVC resin decreased 3.8% during the year ended December 31, 2015 relative to the year ended December 31, 2014. In addition, the Midwest Ingot price of aluminum decreased 16.1% during the year ended December 31, 2015 relative to the year ended December 31, 2014. This favorable material cost pricing increased gross profit by approximately $26.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2015 relative to the year ended December 31, 2014. In addition, our freight expense on a volume adjusted basis was favorable by approximately $5.1 million as a result of declining fuel prices.\nAs a percentage of net sales, gross profit increased from 26.1% for the year ended December 31, 2014 to 28.4% for the year ended December 31, 2015 excluding the impact of Canyon Stone. The 230 basis point increase for the year ended December 31, 2015 resulted from improved operating leverage from the 2.6% net sales increase as well as favorable material cost pricing and favorable freight expense partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency impact from a weakening Canadian dollar.\nGross profit for the year ended December 31, 2014 increased from the year ended December 31, 2013 by approximately $11.7 million or 5.9%. Our gross profit was favorably impacted by the Mitten acquisition, which was completed on May 31, 2013, and contributed increased gross profit of approximately $11.1 million during 2014. Adjusting for the Mitten acquisition, our gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2014 increased by approximately $0.6 million or 0.3%. Our net sales for the year ended December 31, 2014 were negatively impacted during the early part of 2014 by adverse winter weather, which resulted in lower unit volume sales and gross profit. This lower sales volume created less operating leverage to cover fixed manufacturing costs in the first two quarters of 2014, excluding the impact of acquisitions, but was largely offset by higher net sales of 7.1% in the third quarter and 11.2% in the fourth quarter resulting from improved industry conditions which resulted in the 3.3% net sales increase for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nThe favorable impact from the net sales increase was partially offset by higher raw material and freight expenses that were not fully offset by our selling price increases within the year ended December 31, 2014. As it relates to our two primary raw material cost components, aluminum and PVC resin, there has been movement relative to prior years. The Midwest Ingot price of aluminum increased 10.8% for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the year ended December 31, 2013. The average market price for PVC resin was estimated to have increased 9.6% during 2014 compared to 2013. Excluding the impact of any selling price changes, commodity costs fluctuations, predominantly for aluminum and PVC, decreased gross profit by approximately 4.9% for the year ended December 31, 2014. In addition, freight expenses increased approximately $3.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2014 relative to the year ended December 31, 2013 and decreased gross profit as well.\nAs a percentage of net sales, gross profit, excluding the Mitten gross profit increase, decreased to 26.0% for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to 26.8% for the year ended December 31, 2013. The 80 basis point decrease for the year ended December 31, 2014 was primarily due to higher commodity costs, predominantly PVC and aluminum, and increased freight expense that were not fully offset by our selling price increases within the year ended December 31, 2014.\nSG&A Expense\nSG&A expense for the year ended December 31, 2015 increased from the year ended December 31, 2014 by approximately $7.6 million or 9.2%. Excluding the Canyon Stone acquisition, which was completed on May 29, 2015 and incurred SG&A expense of $3.2 million, SG&A expense increased $4.4 million or 5.3% during the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. The SG&A expense increase was predominantly caused by higher incentive compensation of $3.0 million, increased sales and marketing expenses of $0.7 million related to the 2.6% net sales increase, higher legal expenses of $0.4 million, and increased product development expenses of $0.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2015 relative to the year ended December 31, 2014. As a percentage of net sales excluding Canyon Stone, SG&A expense remained consistent at approximately 10.6% during the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to 10.4% for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nSG&A expense for the year ended December 31, 2014 increased from the year ended December 31, 2013 by approximately $9.3 million, or 12.6%. Our SG&A expense increased as a result of our Mitten acquisition, which was completed on May 31, 2013, causing increased SG&A expense of approximately $10.6 million adjusting the comparable SG&A expense decrease to $1.3 million or 1.8%. The SG&A expense decrease resulted from lower administrative and personnel costs for Mitten in the comparable June to December period in 2014 compared to 2013. This reflects a portion of the synergies realized from the Mitten acquisition. As a percentage of net sales, excluding the increased SG&A expense attributable to Mitten, our SG&A expense percentage decreased to 9.5% for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to 10.0% for the year ended December 31, 2013. This percentage decrease was attributable to the year over year decrease in Mitten's SG&A expense as a result of acquisition synergies.\nAmortization of Intangible Assets\nAmortization expense for the year ended December 31, 2015 was consistent with the year ended December 31, 2014 decreasing a nominal $0.2 million or 1.2%. Excluding the Canyon Stone acquisition, which was completed on May 29, 2015 and caused increased amortization expense of $0.8 million, amortization expense decreased by approximately $1.0 million or 7.4%. The decreased resulted from the negative 15.7% movement in the Canadian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar during the year ended December 31, 2015 which resulted in lower amortization expense in Canada. As a percentage of net sales, amortization expense was 1.5% for the year ended December 31, 2015, excluding Canyon Stone, as compared to 1.6% for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nAmortization expense for the year ended December 31, 2014 increased by $1.2 million compared with the year ended December 31, 2013 due to including approximately $35.4 million of intangible assets from the Mitten acquisition for the full fiscal year which accounted for increased amortization expense of $2.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to having seven months of amortization expense on those assets for the year ended December 31, 2013. This $2.1 million increase was partially offset by reduced amortization expense of approximately $0.9 million related to intangible assets, specifically customer relationships, becoming fully amortized in early 2014. As a percentage of net sales, amortization expense was 1.4%, excluding the increased Mitten amortization, consistent with the 1.6% for the year ended December 31, 2013.\nCurrency Transaction Loss\nA currency transaction impact was established in 2013 with the acquisition of Mitten within the Siding, Fencing, and Stone segment. The currency transaction loss for the year ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 was $1.0 million, $0.4 million and $0.2 million, respectively, related to the Mitten entity. The $0.6 million increase in the foreign currency loss for the year ended December 31, 2015 was due to the negative movement in the Canadian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar during the year ended December 31, 2015.\nWindows and Doors Segment\n\nNet Sales\nNet sales for the year ended December 31, 2015 increased compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 by approximately $234.6 million or 30.7%. The net sales increase for the year ended December 31, 2015 was predominantly related to our Simonton acquisition, which was completed on September 19, 2014, and accounted for increased net sales of $231.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. Excluding Simonton, our Windows and Doors' net sales increased $2.7 million or 0.4% during the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. The net sales increase resulted from higher net sales in the United States for our U.S. window products of approximately $52.3 million partially offset by lower net sales for Simonton of approximately $5.9 million in the 2015 and 2014 comparable ownership period and lower net sales for our Western Canadian business of approximately $43.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014.\nThe U.S. window net sales increase resulted from improved market conditions reflected in industry metrics. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, single family housing starts increased 10.0% on a lag effected basis during the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. The lag effect is created by our building products being typically installed on a new construction residential home 90 to 120 days after the start of the home. In addition to the improved industry conditions in the United States with the 10.0% new construction market increase, our selling prices increased for our U.S. window products from price increases that we have implemented and favorable product mix that resulted from a higher proportion of our window sales being derived from our vinyl windows which typically carry a higher selling price than our aluminum windows. The impact of higher selling prices that resulted from our price increases and favorable product mix is estimated to have increased our average selling price for our U.S. window products by 5.8% which contributed higher net sales of approximately $29.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 relative to the year ended December 31, 2014. This increase was partially offset in the U.S. by lower Simonton net sales which resulted from the timing of the Company's fiscal calendar which provided Simonton four less shipping days during the comparable ownership period for the three months ended December 31, 2015 and the three months ended December 31, 2014. This net sales increase in the U.S. market was partially offset by a 27.7% decrease in net sales in our Western Canadian business during the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. The housing market conditions within the prairie provinces of Western Canada, in which a majority of our Western Canadian business' net sales are generated, has experienced demand softness due to declining world oil prices on this heavily dependent energy industrial area. In addition, the weakening of the Canadian dollar negatively impacted our net sales by approximately $15.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. During the year ended December 31, 2015, the Canadian dollar weakened 15.7% against the U.S. dollar relative to the year ended December 31, 2014.\nNet sales for the year ended December 31, 2014 increased compared to the year ended December 31, 2013 by approximately $137.3 million, or 21.9%. Our net sales were favorably impacted by acquisitions during the year ended December 31, 2014. The Simonton acquisition, which was completed on September 19, 2014, contributed net sales of approximately $91.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2014. The Gienow acquisition, which was completed on April 9, 2013 and legally amalgamated with our legacy Ply Gem Canada business effective January 2014, resulted in increased net sales of $12.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2014. The Mitten acquisition, which was completed on May 31, 2013, contributed increased net sales of approximately $2.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2014.\nAfter excluding the impact of these acquisitions, our net sales increased $31.1 million or 5.0% for the year ended December 31, 2014. The 5.0% net sales increase was primarily due to higher selling prices for our window products derived from price increases that we have implemented and favorable product mix that resulted from a higher proportion of our window sales being derived from our vinyl windows which typically carry a higher selling price than our aluminum windows. Improving industry conditions also contributed to our net sales increase with the U.S. Census Bureau estimating that single family housing starts increased 4.9% for the year ended December 31, 2014 relative to the year ended December 31, 2013. Single family starts experienced nominal growth during the first half of the year due to the severe winter weather that negatively impacted our customers with higher levels of snow accumulation and extreme cold temperatures with the polar vortex phenomenon. The winter weather had a negative impact on the new construction market to which our Windows and Doors market is highly aligned. The second half of 2014 had improved weather patterns relative to the second half of 2013, which when combined with our average selling price improvement produced net sales increases of 7.9% and 8.7% for the third and fourth quarters, respectively.\nThe net sales increases for the year ended December 31, 2014 were partially offset by a net sales decrease of approximately $7.4 million for Western Canada attributed to difficult weather conditions in the early spring, integration challenges with our dealer customers, and a negative foreign currency impact from a weakening Canadian dollar which accounted for a net sales decrease of $8.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2014 relative to the year ended December 31, 2013.\nGross Profit\nGross profit for the year ended December 31, 2015 increased compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 by approximately $82.9 million, or 84.1%. Our gross profit was favorably impacted by the Simonton acquisition, which was completed on September 19, 2014 and contributed increased gross profit of approximately $60.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. Adjusting for the Simonton acquisition, our gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2015 increased by approximately $22.8 million or 23.6%. This gross profit increase can be attributed to the continued improvement in our U.S. windows business, which was driven by improved net pricing and favorable product mix that resulted in a 5.8% increase in average selling price during the year ended December 31, 2015. In addition to the average sales price improvement, we have improved our operational efficiencies as a result of our enterprise lean\u201d initiative which continues to streamline our window product offering by providing additional manufacturing flexibility as well as our improved sales and operations planning process that is intended to provide better resource planning which will help to minimize ramp up costs that result from spikes in demand within a geographical area. Overall, our gross profit increased approximately $25.3 million for our U.S. windows business partially offset by a decrease of approximately $5.5 million for our Western Canadian business during the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. The decrease in our Canadian gross profit is attributed to the negative impact of foreign currency resulting from the weakening of the Canadian dollar as well as a softening in the Western Canadian market due to depressed oil prices. Finally, our gross profit for Simonton increased approximately $3.0 million due to a 3.7% in average selling prices for the comparable three month period ended December 31, 2015 relative to the three months ended December 31, 2014.\nAs a percentage of net sales, gross profit excluding the impact of Simonton for both years, increased from 12.8% for the year ended December 31, 2014 to 15.7% for the year ended December 31, 2015. The 290 basis point net increase in gross profit was driven by a 350 basis point improvement in U.S. windows gross profit performance resulting from improved net pricing and operational efficiencies and a 140 basis point increase for Western Canada driven by favorable gross profit performance during 2015 despite lower sales during the year and the negative foreign currency impact from a weakening Canadian dollar. This favorable gross profit performance was achieved in Western Canada by improving our selling prices despite the difficult conditions and decreased volumes.\nGross profit for the year ended December 31, 2014 increased compared to the year ended December 31, 2013 by approximately $37.5 million, or 61.4%. Our gross profit was favorably impacted by the Simonton, Gienow, and Mitten acquisitions which on a combined basis contributed increased gross profit of approximately $22.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. Excluding the impact of these acquisitions, our gross profit increased $15.4 million or 25.3% during the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the year ended December 31, 2013. This gross profit increase for the year ended December 31, 2014 can be attributed to the improvement in our U.S. windows business. Our U.S. windows business's gross profit increased by approximately $24.4 million or 92.1% during the year ended December 31, 2014. This gross profit increase was driven by improved pricing and favorable product mix that resulted from a higher proportion of our window sales being derived from our vinyl windows which typically carry a higher selling price than our aluminum windows resulting in a 4.8% increase in average selling price during the year ended December 31, 2014. This improved pricing and favorable product mix resulted in increased gross profit of approximately $18.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nIn addition to the average sales price improvement, we have improved our operational efficiencies as a result of our enterprise lean\u201d initiative which will continue to streamline our window product offering by providing additional manufacturing flexibility in the future and our improved sales and operations planning process that is intended to provide better resource planning which will help to minimize ramp up costs that result from significant spikes in demand within a geographical area. Furthermore, we did not incur approximately $1.4 million of expense associated with the start-up and consolidation of our production facility in Dallas, Texas and $0.7 million of higher than normal enterprise lean\u201d expenditures which occurred during the year ended December 31, 2013. The remaining increase in U.S. windows gross profit related to the minimization of 2013 labor inefficiencies and ramp up costs during the year ended December 31, 2014.\nThese gross profit increases were partially offset by the performance of our combined Western Canadian business. On a combined basis, our Western Canadian businesses experienced a decrease in gross profit of approximately $10.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2014. This gross profit decrease can be primarily attributed to expenses and inefficiencies associated with the consolidation of two operations (Gienow and Ply Gem Canada) into a single manufacturing facility including manufacturing inefficiencies and certain customer losses which decreased operating leverage and profitability for our Western Canadian business during the year ended December 31, 2014. Based on the poor performance of our Western Canadian business for the year ended December 31, 2014, we have made management changes within this leadership team during the fourth quarter of 2014 in an effort to improve operational performance for this business. This new leadership team will be responsible for commencing improvements in strategy, operations, and service for our Western Canadian business in 2015. Our Western Canadian business experienced a negative material cost impact of approximately $5.2 million during 2014 as a result of the 9% deterioration in the Canadian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar during the year ended December 31, 2014.\nAs a percentage of sales, gross profit, excluding the Simonton, Gienow, and Mitten acquisitions, increased from 9.7% to 11.6% for the Windows and Doors segment during the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2013. This increase was driven by the improvement in our U.S. windows gross profit performance that resulted in an improvement of approximately 370 basis points in gross profit performance resulting from improved net pricing and operational efficiencies during the year ended December 31, 2014 relative to the year ended December 31, 2013. This improvement was partially offset by the negative near-term integration costs, operational inefficiencies, and higher material costs resulting from an unfavorable foreign currency impact in our Western Canadian operations that resulted in the deterioration of approximately 140 basis points in gross profit performance during the year ended December 31, 2014.\nSG&A Expense\nSG&A expense for the year ended December 31, 2015 increased compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 by approximately $33.7 million, or 28.8%. The SG&A expense increase relates to the Simonton acquisition, which was completed on September 19, 2014 and contributed increased SG&A expense of $50.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. Excluding Simonton, our Windows and Doors SG&A expense decreased $16.6 million or 14.3%. This SG&A expense decrease was related to a $5.0 million expense recognized in connection with a preliminary settlement of class action lawsuits during the year ended December 31, 2014 which was offset by a $3.2 million insurance recovery during the year ended December 31, 2015. Excluding the impact of Simonton and the class action litigation, SG&A expense decreased $8.4 million or 7.6% during the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. This SG&A expense decrease was related to $8.4 million lower SG&A expense for Western Canada as a result of the weakening Canadian dollar which lowered SG&A expense by $3.4 million, lower sales and marketing expenses of $1.4 million based on the net sales decrease, and from the elimination of $3.6 million of one-time restructuring and integration costs related to the integration of our Western Canadian businesses that occurred during the year ended December 31, 2014. SG&A expenses for U.S. windows, excluding the impact of the class action litigation, remained flat overall reflecting higher incentive compensation offset by lower legal expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014.\nExcluding Simonton and the impact of the class action litigation, SG&A expense as a percentage of net sales decreased from 14.6% for the year ended December 31, 2014 to 13.5% for the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease can be attributed to $3.6 million lower restructuring and integration costs for Western Canada as well as gaining leverage on the fixed component of SG&A expense with the additional sales volume experienced in the U.S.\nGienow and Mitten's SG&A expenses are higher as a percentage of sales at approximately 22.2% and 21.5%, respectively, compared to our overall SG&A expense of 14.8% for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014, indicating that the remaining SG&A expense excluding Simonton, Gienow, and Mitten would be approximately 12.0% for our other businesses as a percentage of sales for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. Gienow and Mitten operate and sell primarily in Canada and own their distribution centers across their respective regions in Eastern and Western Canada, which increases their respective SG&A expense while allowing them to service their Canadian customer base across a broad geographical area.\nSG&A expense for the year ended December 31, 2014 increased compared to the year ended December 31, 2013 by approximately $25.9 million, or 28.4%. The SG&A expense increase was caused by several factors with the first relating to the impact of the Gienow and Simonton acquisitions, which on a combined basis increased SG&A expense by approximately $23.5 million including restructuring and integration costs related to Gienow of approximately $1.4 million within SG&A expense. These restructuring and integration expenses arose due to the consolidation of two manufacturing facilities into a single facility during the year ended December 31, 2014. Excluding the impact of these acquisitions, SG&A expense increased approximately $2.4 million or 2.7% for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2013. This increase was due to the preliminary legal settlement of class action lawsuits on May 1, 2014 for our Windows and Doors segment which resulted in a $5.0 million expense partially offset by lower relocation and consulting costs during the year ended December 31, 2014.\nAs a percentage of sales, SG&A expense increased to 15.3% of net sales from 14.5% during the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the year ended December 31, 2013. Excluding the expense associated with the class action settlement as well as the acquisition and integration costs, SG&A expense would have decreased as a percentage of sales to 13.5% for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the year ended December 31, 2013. The decrease related to the elimination of certain relocation and consulting costs for the U.S. windows business as well as increased leverage on the fixed component of SG&A expense as net sales increased 5.0% during the year ended December 31, 2014.\nGienow and Mitten's SG&A expense is higher as a percentage of sales at approximately 21.8% and 20.8%, respectively, compared to the remainder of the Company at approximately 12.8% for the year ended December 31, 2014. Gienow and Mitten own their distribution centers across their respective regions in Eastern and Western Canada, which increases their respective SG&A expense, while allowing them to service their Canadian customer base across a broad geographical area. Also included in Gienow and Mitten's SG&A expense are one-time costs related to restructuring and integration that are not expected to recur in future periods. These costs amounted to approximately $1.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nAmortization of Intangible Assets\nAmortization expense for the year ended December 31, 2015 increased $3.3 million or 36.6% compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase in amortization expense for the year ended December 31, 2015 is due to the additional intangible assets of $62.2 million acquired in the Simonton acquisition that was completed on September 19, 2014. As a percentage of net", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is intended to clarify the results of our operations, certain changes in our financial position, liquidity, capital structure and business developments for the periods covered by the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion should be read in conjunction with, and is qualified by reference to, the other related information including, but not limited to, the audited consolidated financial statements (including the notes thereto and the independent registered public accounting firm's reports thereon), and the description of our business, all as set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, as well as the risk factors discussed below and in Item 1A.\nCertain statements in this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d are forward-looking statements.\u201d See Cautionary Statement with Respect to Forward-Looking Statements\u201d and Risk Factors.\u201d\nGeneral\nWe are a leading manufacturer of exterior building products in North America, operating in two reportable segments: (i) Siding, Fencing, and Stone and (ii) Windows and Doors, which comprised approximately 46% and 54% of our sales, respectively, for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015. These two segments produce a comprehensive product line of vinyl siding, designer accents, cellular PVC trim, vinyl fencing, vinyl and composite railing, stone veneer and vinyl windows and doors used in both the new construction market and the home repair and remodeling market in the United States and Canada. Vinyl building products have the leading share of sales volume in siding and windows in the United States. We also manufacture vinyl and aluminum soffit and siding accessories, aluminum trim coil, wood windows, aluminum windows, vinyl and aluminum-clad windows and steel and fiberglass doors, enabling us to bundle complementary and color-matched products and accessories with our core products. We believe that our comprehensive product portfolio and geographically diverse, low cost manufacturing platform allow us to better serve our customers and provide us with a competitive advantage over other exterior building products suppliers.\nThe following is a summary of Ply Gem's recent acquisition history:\n \u2022 On April 9, 2013, Ply Gem acquired all of the capital stock of Gienow WinDoor Ltd. (which was amalgamated into Gienow Canada Inc.) (\"Gienow\"), a manufacturer of windows and doors in Western Canada, for a purchase price, net of cash acquired, of $20.4 million. Gienow is our Western Canadian windows business and is part of the Windows and Doors segment. \n \u2022 On May 31, 2013, Ply Gem acquired all of the capital stock of Mitten Inc. (\"Mitten\"), a manufacturer of vinyl siding and distributor of various other exterior building products in Canada, for a purchase price, net of cash acquired, of $76.8 million. The majority of Mitten's operations are part of the Siding, Fencing and Stone segment. \n \u2022 On September 19, 2014, Ply Gem completed an acquisition for cash consideration of approximately $130.0 million to acquire the capital stock of Fortune Brands Windows Inc., and its direct and indirect wholly owned subsidiaries Simonton Building Products LLC, Simonton Industries, Inc., Simonton Windows, Inc., and SimEx, Inc. Simonton is a premier repair and remodeling window company with leading brand recognition and is part of the Windows and Doors segment. \n \u2022 On May 29, 2015, Ply Gem acquired substantially all of the assets of Canyon Stone, Inc. ( Canyon Stone\u201d), a manufacturer of stone veneer, for a purchase price of $21.0 million, subject to certain purchase price adjustments. Canyon Stone is included in our Siding, Fencing, and Stone segment. \nPrior to January 11, 2010, Ply Gem Holdings was a wholly owned subsidiary of Ply Gem Investment Holdings, which was a wholly owned subsidiary of Ply Gem Prime. On January 11, 2010, Ply Gem Investment Holdings was merged with and into Ply Gem Prime, with Ply Gem Prime being the surviving corporation. In May 2013, the Company issued 18,157,895 shares of common stock in an initial public offering and received gross proceeds of approximately $381.3 million in an IPO of its common stock. The shares began trading on The New York Stock Exchange on May 23, 2013 under the symbol \"PGEM\". Immediately prior to the closing of the IPO, Ply Gem Prime merged with and into Ply Gem Holdings, with Ply Gem Holdings being the surviving entity. In the merger, all of the preferred stock of Ply Gem Prime (including the subordinated debt of Ply Gem Prime that was converted into preferred stock in connection with the IPO) was converted into a number of shares of the Company's common stock based on the IPO price of the common stock and the liquidation value of and the maximum dividend amount in respect of the preferred stock.\nWe are a holding company with no operations or assets of our own other than the capital stock of our subsidiaries. The terms of Ply Gem Industries' $350.0 million ABL Facility and the credit agreement governing the terms of its $430.0 million Term Loan Facility place restrictions on the ability of Ply Gem Industries and our other subsidiaries to pay dividends and otherwise transfer assets to us. Further, the terms of the indenture governing Ply Gem Industries' $650.0 million 6.50% Senior Notes place restrictions on the ability of Ply Gem Industries and our other subsidiaries to pay dividends and otherwise transfer assets to us.\nFinancial statement presentation\nNet sales. Net sales represent the fixed selling price of our products plus certain shipping charges less applicable provisions for discounts and allowances. Allowances include cash discounts, volume rebates and returns among others.\nCost of products sold. Cost of products sold includes direct material and manufacturing costs, manufacturing depreciation, third-party and in-house delivery costs and product warranty expense.\nSelling, general and administrative expense. Selling, general and administrative expense ( SG&A expense\u201d) includes all non-product related operating expenses, including selling, marketing, research and development costs, information technology, and other general and administrative expenses.\nOperating earnings (loss). Operating earnings (loss) represents net sales less cost of products sold, SG&A expense, amortization of intangible assets, and initial public offering costs.\nImpact of commodity pricing\nPVC resin and aluminum are major components in the production of our products and changes in PVC resin and aluminum prices have a direct impact on our cost of products sold. Historically, we have been able to pass on a substantial portion of significant price increases to our customers. The results of operations for individual quarters can be negatively impacted by a delay between the time of raw material cost increases and price increases that we implement in our products, or conversely can be positively impacted by a delay between the time of a raw material price decrease and competitive pricing moves that we implement accordingly.\nImpact of weather\nSince our building products are intended for exterior use, our sales and operating earnings tend to be lower during periods of inclement weather. Weather conditions in the first and fourth quarters of each calendar year historically result in these quarters producing significantly less sales revenue than our second and third quarters of the year. As a result, we have historically had lower profits or higher losses in the first and fourth quarters of each calendar year. Our results of operations for individual quarters in the future may be impacted by adverse weather conditions. In addition, favorable or unfavorable weather conditions may influence the comparability of our results from year to year or from quarter to quarter.\nCritical accounting policies\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Certain of our accounting policies require the application of judgments in selecting the appropriate assumptions for calculating financial estimates. By their nature, these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty. We periodically evaluate the judgments and estimates used for our critical accounting policies to ensure that such judgments and estimates are reasonable for our interim and year-end reporting requirements. These judgments and estimates are based upon our historical experience, current trends and information available from other sources, as appropriate. If different conditions occur compared to our assumptions and judgments, the results could be materially different from our estimates. Management also believes that the nine areas where different assumptions could result in materially different reported results are (1) goodwill and intangible asset impairment tests, (2) accounts receivable related to the estimation of allowances for doubtful accounts, (3) inventories in estimating reserves for obsolete and excess inventory, (4) warranty reserves, (5) insurance reserves, (6) income taxes including the tax receivable agreement, (7) rebates, (8) pensions, and (9) environmental accruals and other contingencies. Although we believe the likelihood of a material difference in these areas is low based upon our historical experience, a 10% change in our allowance for doubtful accounts, inventory reserve estimates, and warranty reserve at December 31, 2015 would result in an approximate $0.4 million, $0.8 million, and $7.7 million impact on expenses, respectively. Additionally, we have included in the discussion that follows our estimation methodology for both accounts receivable and inventories. While all significant policies are important to our consolidated financial statements, some of these policies may be viewed as being critical. Our critical accounting policies include:\nRevenue Recognition. We recognize sales based upon shipment of products to our customers net of applicable provisions for discounts and allowances. Generally, the customer takes title upon shipment and assumes the risks and rewards of ownership of the product. For certain products, it is industry standard that customers take title to products upon delivery, at which time revenue is then recognized by the Company. Revenue includes the selling price of the product and all shipping costs paid by the customer. Revenue is reduced at the time of sale for estimated sales returns and all applicable allowances and discounts based on historical experience. We also provide for estimates of warranty, bad debts, shipping costs and certain sales-related customer programs at the time of sale. Shipping and warranty costs are included in cost of products sold. Bad debt expense and sales-related marketing programs are included in SG&A expense. We believe that our procedures for estimating such amounts are reasonable and historically have not resulted in material adjustments in subsequent periods when the estimates are reconciled to the actual amounts.\nAccounts Receivable. We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses from the inability of our customers to make required payments, which is provided for in bad debt expense. We determine the adequacy of this allowance by regularly reviewing our accounts receivable aging and evaluating individual customers' receivables, considering customers' financial condition, credit history and other current economic conditions. If a customer's financial condition was to deteriorate, which might impact its ability to make payment, then additional allowances may be required.\nInventories. Inventories in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets are valued at the lower of cost or market. We record provisions, as appropriate, to write-down obsolete and excess inventory to estimated net realizable value. The process for evaluating obsolete and excess inventory often requires subjective judgments and estimates concerning future sales levels, quantities and prices at which such inventory will be sold in the normal course of business. Accelerating the disposal process or incorrect estimates of future sales potential may cause actual results to differ from the estimates at the time such inventory is disposed or sold.\nGoodwill Impairment. We perform an annual test for goodwill impairment during the fourth quarter of each year (November 28th for 2015) and also at any other date when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may exceed their fair value. We use the two-step method to determine goodwill impairment. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value (Step One Analysis), we measure the possible goodwill impairment based upon a hypothetical allocation of the fair value estimate of the reporting unit to all of the underlying assets and liabilities of the reporting unit, including previously unrecognized intangible assets (Step Two Analysis). The excess of the reporting unit's fair value over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill. An impairment loss is recognized to the extent that a reporting unit's recorded goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill.\nTo evaluate goodwill impairment, we estimate the fair value of reporting units considering such factors as discounted cash flows and valuation multiples for comparable publicly traded companies. A significant reduction in projected sales and earnings which would lead to a reduction in future cash flows could indicate potential impairment.\nA summary of the key assumptions utilized in the goodwill impairment analysis at November 28, 2015, November 22, 2014, and November 23, 2013, as it relates to the Step One fair values and the sensitivities for these assumptions follows:\nTable 53: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Siding, Fencing, and Stone\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>As of\nNovember 28,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>As of\nNovember 22,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>As of\nNovember 23,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Assumptions:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income approach:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Estimated housing starts in terminal year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,100,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,100,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,100,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Terminal growth rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Discount rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Market approach:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Control premiums\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.0\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Sensitivities:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Amounts in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Estimated fair value decrease in the event of a\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>1% decrease in the terminal year growth\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>104,863\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>101,916\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>89,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Estimated fair value decrease in the event of a\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>1% increase in the discount rate\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>189,363\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>178,819\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>161,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Estimated fair value decrease in the event of a\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>1% decrease in the control premium\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16,790\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15,440\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs of November 28, 2015, we maintained the terminal year estimated housing starts assumption consistent with 2014 and 2013 at 1,100,000, which reflects a normalized housing start level. We estimate that normalized recurring housing starts will be in a range of 1,000,000 to 1,200,000 to keep up with U.S. population growth according to the Joint Center for Housing Studies of Harvard University. We also maintained our terminal growth rate assumption at 3.0% for the three-year period, which is 0.5% lower than the assumption utilized in the Windows and Doors analysis due to Windows and Doors' higher correlation with the new construction market, which provides higher growth levels as we return to a normalized housing market. As of November 28, 2015, we increased the Siding, Fencing, and Stone's discount rate by 0.5% to 11.5%, due to anticipated new product growth included in our long-term forecasts, which offer more uncertainty than the existing revenue stream for Siding, Fencing, and Stone. As of November 22, 2014, we decreased the Siding, Fencing, and Stone discount rate by 0.5% to 11.0%, reflecting Siding, Fencing, and Stone's consistent financial performance with operating earnings of $113.1 million in a flat U.S. housing market relative to 2013.

As of November 22, 2014, we also maintained the assumption for estimated housing starts in the terminal year at 1,100,000, which is consistent with 2013.\nAs of November 28, 2015, we decreased the Windows and Doors' discount rate by 2.0% to 17.0% as a reflection of the improved operating performance of the Windows and Doors reporting unit which, increased their operating earnings by $45.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2015 due to improved gross profit margins from higher selling prices and favorable commodity costs. As of November 22, 2014, we decreased the Windows and Doors' discount rate by 1.0% to 19.0%, as a reflection of the improved operating performance of the Windows and Doors reporting unit. Windows and Doors experienced a $10.9 million improvement in operating loss during 2014, as compared to 2013, due to improved gross profit margins and the minimization of operating inefficiencies.\nAs of November 28, 2015, we increased the Windows and Doors' control premium to 10.0% from 5.0% in 2014, primarily due to improved internal financial performance within the reporting unit as well as an improvement in market comparisons companies and overall market conditions and growth. As of November 22, 2014, we maintained the Windows and Doors' control premium at 5.0%, consistent with the prior year due to the continued lack of public transaction comparatives.\nOverall, we utilize the same key assumptions in preparing the prospective financial information ( PFI\u201d) utilized in the discounted cash flow test for the Siding, Fencing, and Stone and Windows and Doors reporting units. However, each reporting unit is impacted differently by industry trends, how market factors are influencing the reporting units' expected performance, competition, and other unique business factors as mentioned above. The Windows and Doors reporting unit has more exposure to the new construction market which experienced depressed housing market conditions during 2009-2011, which ultimately decreased operating performance for this reporting unit. Siding, Fencing, and Stone's performance has been more consistent and profitable resulting in less risk in the PFI.\nTable 55: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Amounts in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>As of\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>As of\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>As of\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>November 28,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>November 22,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>November 23,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Estimated Windows and Doors reporting unit fair value increase in the event of a 10% increase in the weighting of the market multiples method\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Estimated Siding, Fencing, and Stone reporting unit fair value increase in the event of a 10% increase in the weighting of the market multiples method\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>20,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe provide no assurance that: (1) valuation multiples will not decline, (2) discount rates will not increase, or (3) the earnings, book values or projected earnings and cash flows of our reporting units will not decline. We will continue to analyze changes to these assumptions in future periods. We will continue to evaluate goodwill during future periods and further declines in the residential housing and remodeling markets could result in future goodwill impairments.\nIncome Taxes. We utilize the asset and liability method in accounting for income taxes, which requires that the deferred tax consequences of temporary differences between the amounts recorded in our consolidated financial statements and the amounts included in our federal and state income tax returns be recognized in the consolidated balance sheet. The amount recorded in our consolidated financial statements reflects estimates of final amounts due to timing of completion and filing of actual income tax returns. Estimates are required with respect to, among other things, the appropriate state income tax rates used in the various states in which we and our subsidiaries are required to file, the potential utilization of operating and capital loss carry-forwards for both federal and state income tax purposes and valuation allowances required, if any, for tax assets that may not be realized in the future. We establish reserves when, despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully supportable, certain positions could be challenged, and the positions may not be fully sustained. We have executed a tax sharing agreement with Ply Gem Holdings and Ply Gem Investment Holdings (during 2010, Ply Gem Investment Holdings was merged with and into Ply Gem Prime, with Ply Gem Prime being the surviving corporation) pursuant to which tax liabilities for each respective party are computed on a stand-alone basis. The tax sharing agreement was amended in 2013 to reflect the merger of Ply Gem Prime Holdings with and into Ply Gem Holdings. Our U.S. subsidiaries file a consolidated federal income tax return, unitary, combined, or separate state income tax returns. Gienow Canada and Mitten file separate Canadian income tax returns.\nAt December 31, 2015, we remained in a full federal valuation allowance position due to our cumulative loss position for income tax purposes as well as a full state valuation allowance position for certain legal entities. As of December 31, 2015, we have a full valuation allowance for our foreign subsidiary, Gienow Canada, however, we did not have a valuation allowance for our foreign subsidiary, Mitten. Refer to Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding income taxes.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table summarizes net sales and net income (loss) by segment and is derived from the accompanying consolidated statements of operations included in this report.\nTable 56: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Amounts in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net Sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Siding, Fencing, and Stone\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>840,118\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>801,601\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>737,841\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Windows and Doors\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>999,608\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>765,042\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>627,740\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating earnings (loss)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Siding, Fencing, and Stone\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>134,654\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>113,089\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>111,918\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Windows and Doors\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18,195\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(27,660\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(38,537\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Unallocated\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(30,317\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(23,931\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(45,605\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Foreign currency loss\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Siding, Fencing, and Stone\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(954\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(427\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(217\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Windows and Doors\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,212\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(565\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,316\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest income (expense), net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Siding, Fencing, and Stone\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>132\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Windows and Doors\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>48\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>195\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Unallocated\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(74,858\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(71,229\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(92,011\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax benefit (expense)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Unallocated\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>688\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>105\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(298\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss on modification or\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>extinguishment of debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Unallocated\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(21,364\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(18,948\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tax receivable agreement liability adjustment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Unallocated\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(12,947\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>670\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,167\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income (loss)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>32,288\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(31,269\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(79,520\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following tables set forth our results of operations based on the amounts and the percentage relationship of the items listed to net sales for the periods indicated. However, our results of operations set forth in the tables below may not necessarily be representative of our future operating results.\nThis review of performance is organized by business segment, reflecting the way we manage our business. Each business group leader is responsible for operating results down to operating earnings (loss). We use operating earnings as a performance measure as it captures the income and expenses within the management control of our business leaders. Corporate management is responsible for making all financing decisions. Therefore, each segment discussion focuses on the factors affecting operating earnings, while interest expense and income taxes and certain other unallocated expenses are separately discussed at the corporate level.\nSiding, Fencing, and Stone Segment\nTable 57: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Amounts in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Statement of operations data:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>840,118\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>801,601\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>737,841\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross profit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>238,326\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>209,288\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>197,626\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>SG&A expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>90,760\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>83,135\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.4\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>73,846\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of intangible assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12,912\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13,064\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11,862\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating earnings\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>134,654\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>113,089\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>111,918\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Currency transaction loss\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(954\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.1\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(427\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.1\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(217\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet Sales\nNet sales for the year ended December 31, 2015 increased from the year ended December 31, 2014 by approximately $38.5 million or 4.8%. The net sales increase for the year ended December 31, 2015 was related to our Canyon Stone acquisition, which was completed on May 29, 2015, and accounted for increased net sales of $17.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2015. Excluding Canyon Stone, our net sales increased $20.9 million or 2.6% during the year ended December 31, 2015. The net sales increase resulted predominantly from higher net sales in the United States of approximately $32.7 million partially offset by lower net sales in Canada of approximately $11.8 million. The 2.6% net sales increase resulted primarily from improved market conditions reflected in industry metrics for both the new construction and repair and remodeling markets. Our building products are typically installed on a new construction home 90 to 120 days after the start of the home, therefore single family housing starts commencing in the period from September of 2014 to September of 2015 directly impacts the demand for our products in the year ended December 31, 2015. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, single family housing starts increased 10.0% during this lag affected time period reflecting improved market conditions while heavy vinyl siding markets in the Northeast and Midwest only increased 2.6% on a lag effected basis. In addition to the new construction market improvement, remodeling activity, according to the Leading Indicator of Remodeling Activity ( LIRA\u201d), increased 5.6% during the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. The improved U.S. market conditions were partially offset by declining industry conditions in Canada where the deteriorating Canadian dollar negatively impacted our net sales by approximately $17.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2015. Excluding the negative foreign currency impact, our net sales in Canada through Mitten would have increased $6.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. During the year ended December 31, 2015, the Canadian dollar deteriorated 15.7% relative to the year ended December 31, 2014.\nDespite this negative foreign currency impact, the improved U.S. industry conditions of 2.6% for new construction and 5.6% for repair and remodeling resulted in increased net sales of approximately $27.1 million for our combined vinyl siding, metal accessory, and PVC trim products that fully offset the negative currency impact. We experienced increased PVC trim sales during the year ended December 31, 2015 relative to the year ended December 31, 2014 as this new product gained traction during 2015 after its market introduction in 2013. Our vinyl siding and metal accessory net sales increases resulted from new business wins and improved industry conditions. For the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, the percentage of net sales in vinyl siding and metal accessories represented approximately 60.1% and 24.5% and 62.2% and 24.3%, respectively, with our net sales of other products comprising approximately 15.4% and 13.5%. The net sales increase in other products resulted from the acquisition of Canyon Stone, which specializes in the manufactured stone category.\nThe improved U.S. market conditions which accounted for the majority of the 2.6% net sales increase during the year ended December 31, 2015 are further evidenced by the Vinyl Siding Institute reporting that U.S. vinyl siding industry shipments increased 1.6% during the year ended December 31, 2015 while shipments in Canada decreased 2.9% for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. The Canadian decrease reflected the challenging economic conditions that exist for Canada. Including Mitten, our U.S. market position in vinyl siding for the years ended December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014 was 38.8% and 38.8%, respectively, while our combined share of the Canadian vinyl siding market was 30.2% and 27.0%, respectively.\nNet sales for the year ended December 31, 2014 increased from the year ended December 31, 2013 by approximately $63.8 million or 8.6%. Our net sales were favorably impacted by the Mitten acquisition, which was completed on May 31, 2013, and accounted for increased net sales of approximately $39.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2014. Excluding Mitten, our Siding, Fencing, and Stone net sales increased $24.3 million or 3.3% for the year ended December 31, 2014 reflecting increased sales of our metal accessory products that resulted from new business wins, improved industry conditions in the second half of 2014 and higher selling prices to offset higher material costs partially offset by the challenging weather conditions that existed early in 2014. All of these factors contributed on a net basis to the 3.3% net sales growth during the year ended December 31, 2014 despite the Vinyl Siding Institute reporting that U.S. vinyl siding industry shipments increased a nominal 0.3% for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nIncluding Mitten, our U.S. market position in vinyl siding for the year ended December 31, 2014 was 38.8% compared to 39.5% for the year ended December 31, 2013, while our combined share of the Canadian vinyl siding market was 27.0% compared to 27.6% for the year ended December 31, 2013. These decreases in U.S. and Canadian market position resulted primarily from the timing of various orders from customers during 2014 compared to 2013. For the year ended December 31, 2014, the percentage of sales in vinyl siding and metal accessories represented approximately 62.2% and 24.3%, respectively, of our net sales with sales of other products comprising approximately 13.5%. These net sales percentages were consistent with the year ended December 31, 2013, for which the percentage of sales in vinyl siding and metal accessories represented approximately 62.6% and 25.5%, respectively, of our net sales with sales of other products comprising 11.9%.\nGross Profit\nGross profit for the year ended December 31, 2015 increased from the year ended December 31, 2014 by approximately $29.0 million or 13.9%. Excluding the impact of the Canyon Stone acquisition, which was completed on May 29, 2015 and contributed increased gross profit of approximately $5.0 million, our gross profit increased $24.0 million or 11.5%. The gross profit increase resulted from the 2.6% net sales increase resulting from improved market and weather conditions in the United States partially offset by the weakening Canadian dollar. The higher volumes experienced during the year ended December 31, 2015 enabled us to increase our operating leverage and cover fixed manufacturing costs relative to the lower volumes experienced during the year ended December 31, 2014. This operating leverage combined with lower freight expenses and favorable material cost pricing experienced during the year ended December 31, 2015 relative to the year ended December 31, 2014 increased our gross profit. For material costs, PVC resin decreased 3.8% during the year ended December 31, 2015 relative to the year ended December 31, 2014. In addition, the Midwest Ingot price of aluminum decreased 16.1% during the year ended December 31, 2015 relative to the year ended December 31, 2014. This favorable material cost pricing increased gross profit by approximately $26.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2015 relative to the year ended December 31, 2014. In addition, our freight expense on a volume adjusted basis was favorable by approximately $5.1 million as a result of declining fuel prices.\nAs a percentage of net sales, gross profit increased from 26.1% for the year ended December 31, 2014 to 28.4% for the year ended December 31, 2015 excluding the impact of Canyon Stone. The 230 basis point increase for the year ended December 31, 2015 resulted from improved operating leverage from the 2.6% net sales increase as well as favorable material cost pricing and favorable freight expense partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency impact from a weakening Canadian dollar.\nGross profit for the year ended December 31, 2014 increased from the year ended December 31, 2013 by approximately $11.7 million or 5.9%. Our gross profit was favorably impacted by the Mitten acquisition, which was completed on May 31, 2013, and contributed increased gross profit of approximately $11.1 million during 2014. Adjusting for the Mitten acquisition, our gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2014 increased by approximately $0.6 million or 0.3%. Our net sales for the year ended December 31, 2014 were negatively impacted during the early part of 2014 by adverse winter weather, which resulted in lower unit volume sales and gross profit. This lower sales volume created less operating leverage to cover fixed manufacturing costs in the first two quarters of 2014, excluding the impact of acquisitions, but was largely offset by higher net sales of 7.1% in the third quarter and 11.2% in the fourth quarter resulting from improved industry conditions which resulted in the 3.3% net sales increase for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nThe favorable impact from the net sales increase was partially offset by higher raw material and freight expenses that were not fully offset by our selling price increases within the year ended December 31, 2014. As it relates to our two primary raw material cost components, aluminum and PVC resin, there has been movement relative to prior years. The Midwest Ingot price of aluminum increased 10.8% for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the year ended December 31, 2013. The average market price for PVC resin was estimated to have increased 9.6% during 2014 compared to 2013. Excluding the impact of any selling price changes, commodity costs fluctuations, predominantly for aluminum and PVC, decreased gross profit by approximately 4.9% for the year ended December 31, 2014. In addition, freight expenses increased approximately $3.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2014 relative to the year ended December 31, 2013 and decreased gross profit as well.\nAs a percentage of net sales, gross profit, excluding the Mitten gross profit increase, decreased to 26.0% for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to 26.8% for the year ended December 31, 2013. The 80 basis point decrease for the year ended December 31, 2014 was primarily due to higher commodity costs, predominantly PVC and aluminum, and increased freight expense that were not fully offset by our selling price increases within the year ended December 31, 2014.\nSG&A Expense\nSG&A expense for the year ended December 31, 2015 increased from the year ended December 31, 2014 by approximately $7.6 million or 9.2%. Excluding the Canyon Stone acquisition, which was completed on May 29, 2015 and incurred SG&A expense of $3.2 million, SG&A expense increased $4.4 million or 5.3% during the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. The SG&A expense increase was predominantly caused by higher incentive compensation of $3.0 million, increased sales and marketing expenses of $0.7 million related to the 2.6% net sales increase, higher legal expenses of $0.4 million, and increased product development expenses of $0.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2015 relative to the year ended December 31, 2014. As a percentage of net sales excluding Canyon Stone, SG&A expense remained consistent at approximately 10.6% during the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to 10.4% for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nSG&A expense for the year ended December 31, 2014 increased from the year ended December 31, 2013 by approximately $9.3 million, or 12.6%. Our SG&A expense increased as a result of our Mitten acquisition, which was completed on May 31, 2013, causing increased SG&A expense of approximately $10.6 million adjusting the comparable SG&A expense decrease to $1.3 million or 1.8%. The SG&A expense decrease resulted from lower administrative and personnel costs for Mitten in the comparable June to December period in 2014 compared to 2013. This reflects a portion of the synergies realized from the Mitten acquisition. As a percentage of net sales, excluding the increased SG&A expense attributable to Mitten, our SG&A expense percentage decreased to 9.5% for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to 10.0% for the year ended December 31, 2013. This percentage decrease was attributable to the year over year decrease in Mitten's SG&A expense as a result of acquisition synergies.\nAmortization of Intangible Assets\nAmortization expense for the year ended December 31, 2015 was consistent with the year ended December 31, 2014 decreasing a nominal $0.2 million or 1.2%. Excluding the Canyon Stone acquisition, which was completed on May 29, 2015 and caused increased amortization expense of $0.8 million, amortization expense decreased by approximately $1.0 million or 7.4%. The decreased resulted from the negative 15.7% movement in the Canadian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar during the year ended December 31, 2015 which resulted in lower amortization expense in Canada. As a percentage of net sales, amortization expense was 1.5% for the year ended December 31, 2015, excluding Canyon Stone, as compared to 1.6% for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nAmortization expense for the year ended December 31, 2014 increased by $1.2 million compared with the year ended December 31, 2013 due to including approximately $35.4 million of intangible assets from the Mitten acquisition for the full fiscal year which accounted for increased amortization expense of $2.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to having seven months of amortization expense on those assets for the year ended December 31, 2013. This $2.1 million increase was partially offset by reduced amortization expense of approximately $0.9 million related to intangible assets, specifically customer relationships, becoming fully amortized in early 2014. As a percentage of net sales, amortization expense was 1.4%, excluding the increased Mitten amortization, consistent with the 1.6% for the year ended December 31, 2013.\nCurrency Transaction Loss\nA currency transaction impact was established in 2013 with the acquisition of Mitten within the Siding, Fencing, and Stone segment. The currency transaction loss for the year ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 was $1.0 million, $0.4 million and $0.2 million, respectively, related to the Mitten entity. The $0.6 million increase in the foreign currency loss for the year ended December 31, 2015 was due to the negative movement in the Canadian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar during the year ended December 31, 2015.\nWindows and Doors Segment\nTable 58: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Year ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Amounts in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Statement of operations data:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>999,608\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>765,042\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>627,740\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>100.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross profit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>181,386\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>98,513\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>61,044\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>SG&A expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>150,797\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>117,097\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>91,207\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of intangible assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12,394\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,076\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,374\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating earnings (loss)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18,195\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(27,660\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3.6\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(38,537\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(6.1\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Currency transaction loss\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,212\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.2\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(565\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.1\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,316\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(0.2\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet Sales\nNet sales for the year ended December 31, 2015 increased compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 by approximately $234.6 million or 30.7%. The net sales increase for the year ended December 31, 2015 was predominantly related to our Simonton acquisition, which was completed on September 19, 2014, and accounted for increased net sales of $231.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. Excluding Simonton, our Windows and Doors' net sales increased $2.7 million or 0.4% during the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. The net sales increase resulted from higher net sales in the United States for our U.S. window products of approximately $52.3 million partially offset by lower net sales for Simonton of approximately $5.9 million in the 2015 and 2014 comparable ownership period and lower net sales for our Western Canadian business of approximately $43.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014.\nThe U.S. window net sales increase resulted from improved market conditions reflected in industry metrics. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, single family housing starts increased 10.0% on a lag effected basis during the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. The lag effect is created by our building products being typically installed on a new construction residential home 90 to 120 days after the start of the home. In addition to the improved industry conditions in the United States with the 10.0% new construction market increase, our selling prices increased for our U.S. window products from price increases that we have implemented and favorable product mix that resulted from a higher proportion of our window sales being derived from our vinyl windows which typically carry a higher selling price than our aluminum windows. The impact of higher selling prices that resulted from our price increases and favorable product mix is estimated to have increased our average selling price for our U.S. window products by 5.8% which contributed higher net sales of approximately $29.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 relative to the year ended December 31, 2014. This increase was partially offset in the U.S. by lower Simonton net sales which resulted from the timing of the Company's fiscal calendar which provided Simonton four less shipping days during the comparable ownership period for the three months ended December 31, 2015 and the three months ended December 31, 2014. This net sales increase in the U.S. market was partially offset by a 27.7% decrease in net sales in our Western Canadian business during the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. The housing market conditions within the prairie provinces of Western Canada, in which a majority of our Western Canadian business' net sales are generated, has experienced demand softness due to declining world oil prices on this heavily dependent energy industrial area. In addition, the weakening of the Canadian dollar negatively impacted our net sales by approximately $15.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. During the year ended December 31, 2015, the Canadian dollar weakened 15.7% against the U.S. dollar relative to the year ended December 31, 2014.\nNet sales for the year ended December 31, 2014 increased compared to the year ended December 31, 2013 by approximately $137.3 million, or 21.9%. Our net sales were favorably impacted by acquisitions during the year ended December 31, 2014. The Simonton acquisition, which was completed on September 19, 2014, contributed net sales of approximately $91.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2014. The Gienow acquisition, which was completed on April 9, 2013 and legally amalgamated with our legacy Ply Gem Canada business effective January 2014, resulted in increased net sales of $12.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2014. The Mitten acquisition, which was completed on May 31, 2013, contributed increased net sales of approximately $2.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2014.\nAfter excluding the impact of these acquisitions, our net sales increased $31.1 million or 5.0% for the year ended December 31, 2014. The 5.0% net sales increase was primarily due to higher selling prices for our window products derived from price increases that we have implemented and favorable product mix that resulted from a higher proportion of our window sales being derived from our vinyl windows which typically carry a higher selling price than our aluminum windows. Improving industry conditions also contributed to our net sales increase with the U.S. Census Bureau estimating that single family housing starts increased 4.9% for the year ended December 31, 2014 relative to the year ended December 31, 2013. Single family starts experienced nominal growth during the first half of the year due to the severe winter weather that negatively impacted our customers with higher levels of snow accumulation and extreme cold temperatures with the polar vortex phenomenon. The winter weather had a negative impact on the new construction market to which our Windows and Doors market is highly aligned. The second half of 2014 had improved weather patterns relative to the second half of 2013, which when combined with our average selling price improvement produced net sales increases of 7.9% and 8.7% for the third and fourth quarters, respectively.\nThe net sales increases for the year ended December 31, 2014 were partially offset by a net sales decrease of approximately $7.4 million for Western Canada attributed to difficult weather conditions in the early spring, integration challenges with our dealer customers, and a negative foreign currency impact from a weakening Canadian dollar which accounted for a net sales decrease of $8.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2014 relative to the year ended December 31, 2013.\nGross Profit\nGross profit for the year ended December 31, 2015 increased compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 by approximately $82.9 million, or 84.1%. Our gross profit was favorably impacted by the Simonton acquisition, which was completed on September 19, 2014 and contributed increased gross profit of approximately $60.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. Adjusting for the Simonton acquisition, our gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2015 increased by approximately $22.8 million or 23.6%. This gross profit increase can be attributed to the continued improvement in our U.S. windows business, which was driven by improved net pricing and favorable product mix that resulted in a 5.8% increase in average selling price during the year ended December 31, 2015. In addition to the average sales price improvement, we have improved our operational efficiencies as a result of our enterprise lean\u201d initiative which continues to streamline our window product offering by providing additional manufacturing flexibility as well as our improved sales and operations planning process that is intended to provide better resource planning which will help to minimize ramp up costs that result from spikes in demand within a geographical area. Overall, our gross profit increased approximately $25.3 million for our U.S. windows business partially offset by a decrease of approximately $5.5 million for our Western Canadian business during the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. The decrease in our Canadian gross profit is attributed to the negative impact of foreign currency resulting from the weakening of the Canadian dollar as well as a softening in the Western Canadian market due to depressed oil prices. Finally, our gross profit for Simonton increased approximately $3.0 million due to a 3.7% in average selling prices for the comparable three month period ended December 31, 2015 relative to the three months ended December 31, 2014.\nAs a percentage of net sales, gross profit excluding the impact of Simonton for both years, increased from 12.8% for the year ended December 31, 2014 to 15.7% for the year ended December 31, 2015. The 290 basis point net increase in gross profit was driven by a 350 basis point improvement in U.S. windows gross profit performance resulting from improved net pricing and operational efficiencies and a 140 basis point increase for Western Canada driven by favorable gross profit performance during 2015 despite lower sales during the year and the negative foreign currency impact from a weakening Canadian dollar. This favorable gross profit performance was achieved in Western Canada by improving our selling prices despite the difficult conditions and decreased volumes.\nGross profit for the year ended December 31, 2014 increased compared to the year ended December 31, 2013 by approximately $37.5 million, or 61.4%. Our gross profit was favorably impacted by the Simonton, Gienow, and Mitten acquisitions which on a combined basis contributed increased gross profit of approximately $22.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. Excluding the impact of these acquisitions, our gross profit increased $15.4 million or 25.3% during the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the year ended December 31, 2013. This gross profit increase for the year ended December 31, 2014 can be attributed to the improvement in our U.S. windows business. Our U.S. windows business's gross profit increased by approximately $24.4 million or 92.1% during the year ended December 31, 2014. This gross profit increase was driven by improved pricing and favorable product mix that resulted from a higher proportion of our window sales being derived from our vinyl windows which typically carry a higher selling price than our aluminum windows resulting in a 4.8% increase in average selling price during the year ended December 31, 2014. This improved pricing and favorable product mix resulted in increased gross profit of approximately $18.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nIn addition to the average sales price improvement, we have improved our operational efficiencies as a result of our enterprise lean\u201d initiative which will continue to streamline our window product offering by providing additional manufacturing flexibility in the future and our improved sales and operations planning process that is intended to provide better resource planning which will help to minimize ramp up costs that result from significant spikes in demand within a geographical area. Furthermore, we did not incur approximately $1.4 million of expense associated with the start-up and consolidation of our production facility in Dallas, Texas and $0.7 million of higher than normal enterprise lean\u201d expenditures which occurred during the year ended December 31, 2013. The remaining increase in U.S. windows gross profit related to the minimization of 2013 labor inefficiencies and ramp up costs during the year ended December 31, 2014.\nThese gross profit increases were partially offset by the performance of our combined Western Canadian business. On a combined basis, our Western Canadian businesses experienced a decrease in gross profit of approximately $10.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2014. This gross profit decrease can be primarily attributed to expenses and inefficiencies associated with the consolidation of two operations (Gienow and Ply Gem Canada) into a single manufacturing facility including manufacturing inefficiencies and certain customer losses which decreased operating leverage and profitability for our Western Canadian business during the year ended December 31, 2014. Based on the poor performance of our Western Canadian business for the year ended December 31, 2014, we have made management changes within this leadership team during the fourth quarter of 2014 in an effort to improve operational performance for this business. This new leadership team will be responsible for commencing improvements in strategy, operations, and service for our Western Canadian business in 2015. Our Western Canadian business experienced a negative material cost impact of approximately $5.2 million during 2014 as a result of the 9% deterioration in the Canadian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar during the year ended December 31, 2014.\nAs a percentage of sales, gross profit, excluding the Simonton, Gienow, and Mitten acquisitions, increased from 9.7% to 11.6% for the Windows and Doors segment during the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2013. This increase was driven by the improvement in our U.S. windows gross profit performance that resulted in an improvement of approximately 370 basis points in gross profit performance resulting from improved net pricing and operational efficiencies during the year ended December 31, 2014 relative to the year ended December 31, 2013. This improvement was partially offset by the negative near-term integration costs, operational inefficiencies, and higher material costs resulting from an unfavorable foreign currency impact in our Western Canadian operations that resulted in the deterioration of approximately 140 basis points in gross profit performance during the year ended December 31, 2014.\nSG&A Expense\nSG&A expense for the year ended December 31, 2015 increased compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 by approximately $33.7 million, or 28.8%. The SG&A expense increase relates to the Simonton acquisition, which was completed on September 19, 2014 and contributed increased SG&A expense of $50.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. Excluding Simonton, our Windows and Doors SG&A expense decreased $16.6 million or 14.3%. This SG&A expense decrease was related to a $5.0 million expense recognized in connection with a preliminary settlement of class action lawsuits during the year ended December 31, 2014 which was offset by a $3.2 million insurance recovery during the year ended December 31, 2015. Excluding the impact of Simonton and the class action litigation, SG&A expense decreased $8.4 million or 7.6% during the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. This SG&A expense decrease was related to $8.4 million lower SG&A expense for Western Canada as a result of the weakening Canadian dollar which lowered SG&A expense by $3.4 million, lower sales and marketing expenses of $1.4 million based on the net sales decrease, and from the elimination of $3.6 million of one-time restructuring and integration costs related to the integration of our Western Canadian businesses that occurred during the year ended December 31, 2014. SG&A expenses for U.S. windows, excluding the impact of the class action litigation, remained flat overall reflecting higher incentive compensation offset by lower legal expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014.\nExcluding Simonton and the impact of the class action litigation, SG&A expense as a percentage of net sales decreased from 14.6% for the year ended December 31, 2014 to 13.5% for the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease can be attributed to $3.6 million lower restructuring and integration costs for Western Canada as well as gaining leverage on the fixed component of SG&A expense with the additional sales volume experienced in the U.S.\nGienow and Mitten's SG&A expenses are higher as a percentage of sales at approximately 22.2% and 21.5%, respectively, compared to our overall SG&A expense of 14.8% for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014, indicating that the remaining SG&A expense excluding Simonton, Gienow, and Mitten would be approximately 12.0% for our other businesses as a percentage of sales for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. Gienow and Mitten operate and sell primarily in Canada and own their distribution centers across their respective regions in Eastern and Western Canada, which increases their respective SG&A expense while allowing them to service their Canadian customer base across a broad geographical area.\nSG&A expense for the year ended December 31, 2014 increased compared to the year ended December 31, 2013 by approximately $25.9 million, or 28.4%. The SG&A expense increase was caused by several factors with the first relating to the impact of the Gienow and Simonton acquisitions, which on a combined basis increased SG&A expense by approximately $23.5 million including restructuring and integration costs related to Gienow of approximately $1.4 million within SG&A expense. These restructuring and integration expenses arose due to the consolidation of two manufacturing facilities into a single facility during the year ended December 31, 2014. Excluding the impact of these acquisitions, SG&A expense increased approximately $2.4 million or 2.7% for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2013. This increase was due to the preliminary legal settlement of class action lawsuits on May 1, 2014 for our Windows and Doors segment which resulted in a $5.0 million expense partially offset by lower relocation and consulting costs during the year ended December 31, 2014.\nAs a percentage of sales, SG&A expense increased to 15.3% of net sales from 14.5% during the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the year ended December 31, 2013. Excluding the expense associated with the class action settlement as well as the acquisition and integration costs, SG&A expense would have decreased as a percentage of sales to 13.5% for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the year ended December 31, 2013. The decrease related to the elimination of certain relocation and consulting costs for the U.S. windows business as well as increased leverage on the fixed component of SG&A expense as net sales increased 5.0% during the year ended December 31, 2014.\nGienow and Mitten's SG&A expense is higher as a percentage of sales at approximately 21.8% and 20.8%, respectively, compared to the remainder of the Company at approximately 12.8% for the year ended December 31, 2014. Gienow and Mitten own their distribution centers across their respective regions in Eastern and Western Canada, which increases their respective SG&A expense, while allowing them to service their Canadian customer base across a broad geographical area. Also included in Gienow and Mitten's SG&A expense are one-time costs related to restructuring and integration that are not expected to recur in future periods. These costs amounted to approximately $1.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2014.\nAmortization of Intangible Assets\nAmortization expense for the year ended December 31, 2015 increased $3.3 million or 36.6% compared to the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase in amortization expense for the year ended December 31, 2015 is due to the additional intangible assets of $62.2 million acquired in the Simonton acquisition that was completed on September 19, 2014. As a percentage of net"}
