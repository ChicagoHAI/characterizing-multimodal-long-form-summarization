Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K generally discusses 2019 and 2018 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2019 and 2018. Discussions of 2017 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2018 and 2017 that are not included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K can be found in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d in Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018.\nOVERVIEW\nWe are an internally managed and self-advised REIT primarily engaged in the ownership and operation of office properties in the United States. We were formed in 1986 under Maryland law. The Company operates as what is commonly referred to as an umbrella partnership real estate investment trust, or UPREIT, conducting substantially all of its activities through the Operating Trust. As of December 31, 2019, the Company beneficially owned 99.96% of the outstanding OP Units.\nAt December 31, 2019, our portfolio consisted of seven properties (12 buildings), with a combined 2.5 million square feet and a total undepreciated book value of $662.1 million, and a depreciated book value of $459.4 million. As of December 31, 2019, we had $2.8 billion of cash and cash equivalents.\nAs of December 31, 2019, our overall portfolio was 94.7% leased. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we entered into leases, excluding leasing activity for assets during the quarter in which the asset was sold or classified as held for sale, for 617,000 square feet, including lease renewals for 383,000 square feet and new leases for 234,000 square feet. Leases entered into during the year ended December 31, 2019, including both lease renewals and new leases, had weighted average cash rental rates that were approximately 2.5% higher than prior rental rates for the same space and weighted average GAAP rental rates that were approximately 11.7% higher than prior rental rates for the same space. The change in GAAP rents is different than the change in cash rents due to differences in the amount of rent abatements, the magnitude and timing of contractual rent increases over the lease term, and the length of term for the newly executed leases compared to the prior leases.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, we sold three properties (six buildings) with a combined 2.7 million square feet for an aggregate gross sales price of $812.1 million, excluding credits and closing costs. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we sold seven properties (nine buildings) with a combined 4.4 million square feet for an aggregate gross sales price of $1.0 billion, excluding credits and closing costs. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we redeemed an aggregate of $250.0 million of outstanding unsecured notes. Additionally, in February 2020, we sold our 0.3 million square foot property at 109 Brookline Avenue for a gross sale price of $270.0 million, and in February 2020, we entered into a contract to sell our 0.4 million square foot property at 333 108th Avenue NE for a gross sale price of $401.5 million. We currently have one other property totaling 0.2 million square feet for sale. For more information regarding these transactions, see Notes 3 and 19 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. As we have sold assets, our income from operations has declined.\nOn September 24, 2019, our Board of Trustees declared a special, one-time cash distribution of $3.50 per common share/unit to shareholders/unitholders of record on October 7, 2019. On October 23, 2019, we paid this distribution to such shareholders/unitholders in the aggregate amount of $427.7 million.\nWe have engaged CBRE, Inc. (CBRE) to provide property management services for our properties. We pay CBRE a property-by-property management fee and may engage CBRE from time-to-time to perform project management services, such as coordinating and overseeing the completion of tenant improvements and other capital projects at the properties. We reimburse CBRE for certain expenses incurred in the performance of its duties, including certain personnel and equipment costs. For the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, we incurred expenses of $5.2 million and $9.2 million, respectively, related to our property management agreement with CBRE, for property management fees, typically calculated as a percentage of the properties' revenues, and salary and benefits reimbursements for property personnel, such as property managers, engineers and maintenance staff. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, we had amounts payable pursuant to these services of $0.6 million and $0.8 million, respectively.\nWe continue to execute our office repositioning strategy to own and acquire at a discount to replacement cost high-quality, multi-tenant office assets in markets and sub-markets with favorable long-term supply and demand fundamentals. We expect our efforts in the office sector to continue to be primarily focused on larger buildings in central business districts and\nmajor urban areas that offer an attractive quality of life, including opportunities for tenants to live and play in close proximity to where they work, with a preference for markets that have above average limitations on new supply. We currently target such efforts towards acquiring portfolios of properties or pursuing other large acquisitions as opposed to purchasing individual properties, although we may acquire individual properties if opportunities to do so are consistent with our strategy. However, to create a foundation for long-term growth, the set of opportunities that we pursue in the future may include acquisitions and/or investments in office or non-office property types.\nIn repositioning our portfolio, we may sell additional properties, depending on market conditions. With the progress we have had executing dispositions, and the strength and liquidity of our balance sheet, we are in a position to increasingly shift our focus to capital allocation. We intend to use our capital for acquisitions and/or investments in new properties or businesses, repay debt, repurchase common shares or make distributions that further our long-term strategic goals.\nWe may be unable to identify suitable investment opportunities. If we do not redeploy capital, we will strive to achieve a sale, liquidation or otherwise exit our business in one or more transactions in a manner that optimizes shareholder value. We are unable to predict if or when we will make a determination to sell, liquidate or otherwise exit our business.\nProperty Operations\nLeased occupancy data for 2019 and 2018 is as follows (square feet in thousands):\nTable 13: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>All Properties(1) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Comparable Properties(2) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>As of December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>As of December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total properties </td> <td>7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total square feet </td> <td>2,469 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,120 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,469 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,469 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Percent leased(3) </td> <td>94.7 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>94.8 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>94.7 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>93.2 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1)Excludes properties sold.\n(2)Based on properties owned continuously from January 1, 2018 through December 31, 2019 and excludes properties sold.\n(3)Percent leased includes space subject to leases that have commenced, space being fitted out for occupancy pursuant to existing leases, and space which is leased but not occupied or is being offered for sublease by tenants.\nThe weighted average lease term based on square feet for leases entered into during the year ended December 31, 2019 was 4.9 years. Commitments made for leasing expenditures and concessions, such as tenant improvements and leasing commissions, for leases entered into during the year ended December 31, 2019, excluding leasing activity for assets during the quarter in which the asset was sold or classified as held for sale, totaled $25.5 million, or $41.30 per square foot on average (approximately $8.37 per square foot per year of the lease term).\nAs of December 31, 2019, approximately 6.5% of our leased square feet and 7.5% of our annualized rental revenue, determined as set forth below, are included in leases scheduled to expire through December 31, 2020. Renewal and new leases and rental rates at which available space may be relet in the future will depend on prevailing market conditions at the times these leases are negotiated. We believe that the in-place cash rents for leases expiring in 2020, that have not been backfilled, are below market. Lease expirations by year, as of December 31, 2019, are as follows (square feet and dollars in thousands):\nTable 14: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

is leased but is not occupied or is being offered for sublease by tenants. The Leased Square Feet Expiring corresponds to the latest-expiring signed lease for a given suite. Thus, backfilled suites expire in the year stipulated by the new lease.\n(2)Annualized rental revenue is annualized contractual rents from our tenants pursuant to leases which have commenced as of December 31, 2019, plus estimated recurring expense reimbursements; excludes lease value amortization, straight line rent adjustments, abated (free) rent periods and parking revenue. We calculate annualized rental revenue by aggregating the recurring billings outlined above for the most recent month during the quarter reported, adding abated rent, and multiplying the sum by 12 to provide an estimation of near-term potentially-recurring revenues. Annualized rental revenue is a forward-looking non-GAAP measure. Annualized rental revenue cannot be reconciled to a comparable GAAP measure without unreasonable efforts, primarily due to the fact that it is calculated from the billings of tenants in the most recent month at the most recent rental rates during the quarter reported, whereas historical GAAP measures include billings from a potentially different group of tenants over multiple months at potentially different rental rates.\nA principal source of funds for our operations is rents from tenants at our properties. Rents are generally received from our tenants monthly in advance. As of December 31, 2019, tenants representing 2.0% or more of our total annualized rental revenue were as follows (square feet in thousands):\nTable 15: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tenant </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Square Feet(1) </td> <td> </td> <td>% of Total Leased Square Feet(1) </td> <td> </td> <td>% of Annualized Rental Revenue(2) </td> <td> </td> <td>Weighted Average Remaining Lease Term </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>1. </td> <td>Expedia, Inc.(3)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>427 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18.3 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>22.9 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2. </td> <td>Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Inc. </td> <td> </td> <td>77 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.3 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>4.1 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>9.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>3. </td> <td>Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Inc. </td> <td> </td> <td>117 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>4.1 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>3.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>4. </td> <td>British International School of Washington </td> <td> </td> <td>112 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.8 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>3.5 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>17.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>5. </td> <td>Equinor Energy Services, Inc. </td> <td> </td> <td>77 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.3 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>3.4 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>4.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>6. </td> <td>Georgetown University </td> <td> </td> <td>129 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.5 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>2.9 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>1.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>7. </td> <td>KPMG, LLP </td> <td> </td> <td>87 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.7 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>2.8 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>7.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>8. </td> <td>Crowdstrike, Inc. </td> <td> </td> <td>36 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.5 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>2.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>4.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>9. </td> <td>CBRE, Inc. </td> <td> </td> <td>40 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.7 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>2.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>8.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>1,102 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>47.1 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>47.7 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>4.4 </td> <td> </td> <td>(4) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1)Total Leased Square Feet as of December 31, 2019 includes space subject to leases that have commenced, space being fitted out for occupancy pursuant to existing leases, and space which is leased but is not occupied or is being offered for sublease by tenants.\n(2)Annualized rental revenue is annualized contractual rents from our tenants pursuant to leases which have commenced as of December 31, 2019, plus estimated recurring expense reimbursements; excludes lease value amortization, straight line rent adjustments, abated (free) rent periods and parking revenue.

properties (12 buildings) we owned continuously from January 1, 2018 to December 31, 2019.\n(2)Other properties consist of properties sold.\n(3)Certain reclassifications were made to conform the prior period to our presentation of the condensed consolidated statements of operations due to the impact of adopting Accounting Standards Update 2016-02. Amounts that were previously disclosed as \"Tenant reimbursements and other income\" are now included in \"Rental revenue\" and are no longer presented as a separate line item. Parking revenues that do not represent components of leases and were previously disclosed as \"Rental income\" are now included in \"Other revenue.\" Subsequent to January 1, 2019, provisions for credit losses are included in \"Rental revenue.\" Provisions for credit losses prior to January 1, 2019 were disclosed as \"Operating expenses\" and were not reclassified to conform prior periods to the current presentation.\n(4)We define net operating income, or NOI, as shown above, as income from our real estate including lease termination fees received from tenants less our property operating expenses. NOI excludes amortization of capitalized tenant improvement costs and leasing commissions and corporate level expenses. For a discussion of why we consider NOI to be an appropriate supplemental measure to net income as well as a reconciliation of NOI to net income, the most directly comparable financial measure under GAAP reported on our consolidated financial statements, please see \"Liquidity and Capital Resources - Property Net Operating Income (NOI).\"\nRental revenue. Rental revenue decreased $67.5 million, or 36.6%, in the 2019 period, compared to the 2018 period, primarily due to the properties sold in 2019 and 2018. Rental revenue at the comparable properties increased $6.2 million, or 6.8%, in the 2019 period, compared to the 2018 period, primarily due to leasing activity, a $2.1 million increase in lease termination fees and a $2.7 million increase in escalations and real estate tax recoveries.\nRental revenue includes increases for straight line rent adjustments totaling $0.4 million in the 2019 period and $5.0 million in the 2018 period, and net increases (reductions) for amortization of acquired real estate leases and assumed real estate lease obligations totaling $0.1 million in the 2019 period and $(0.1) million in the 2018 period. Rental income also includes the recognition of lease termination fees totaling $2.2 million in the 2019 period and $2.9 million in the 2018 period.\nOther revenue. Other revenue, which primarily includes parking revenue, decreased $1.7 million, or 13.2% in the 2019 period, compared to the 2018 period, primarily due to the properties sold in 2019 and 2018. Other revenue increased $0.7 million, or 7.8%, at the comparable properties in the 2019 period, compared to the 2018 period primarily due to increased parking revenue during the 2019 period.\nOperating expenses. Operating expenses decreased $33.5 million, or 41.9%, in the 2019 period, compared to the 2018 period, primarily due to the properties sold in 2019 and 2018. Operating expenses at our comparable properties increased $1.4 million, or 3.7%, primarily due to a $1.8 million increase in real estate tax expense, partially offset by a $0.9 million decrease in utility expense.\nDepreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization decreased $20.9 million, or 42.7%, in the 2019 period, compared to the 2018 period, primarily due to the properties sold in 2019 and 2018.\nGeneral and administrative. General and administrative expenses decreased $6.0 million, or 13.5% in the 2019 period, compared to the 2018 period, primarily due to a $5.7 million decrease in share-based compensation expense and a $1.7 million decrease in payroll expenses as a result of a staffing reduction, partially offset by a $1.6 million increase in compensation expenses related to severance from $1.8 million in the 2018 period to $3.4 million in the 2019 period.\nLoss on asset impairment. We recorded impairment charges of $12.1 million in the 2018 period related to 777 East Eisenhower Parkway and 97 Newberry Road, based upon the shortening of our expected period of ownership and updated market information in accordance with our impairment analysis procedures. We did not record any impairment charges in the 2019 period.\nInterest and other income, net. Interest and other income, net increased $25.6 million, or 54.6%, in the 2019 period, compared to the 2018 period, primarily due to $17.5 million of additional interest received on higher invested balances and higher average interest rates in 2019, a $5.0 million loss on the sale of marketable securities in the 2018 period and a $2.1 million loss on the sale of a real estate mortgage receivable in 2018. This mortgage receivable of $7.7 million represented mortgage financing we provided upon the sale of three properties in 2013.\nInterest expense. Interest expense decreased $17.7 million, or 66.5%, in the 2019 period, compared to the 2018 period, primarily due to the prepayment in March 2018 of all $175.0 million of our 5.75% senior unsecured notes due 2042, the redemption at par of the total $400.0 million outstanding under our 5-year and 7-year term loans in May 2018, the termination of our credit agreement in December 2018, the redemption in June 2019 of all $250 million of our 5.875% senior unsecured notes due 2020 and a decrease in amortization of deferred financing fees.\nLoss on early extinguishment of debt. The loss on early extinguishment of debt of $6.4 million in the 2019 period reflects the write off of unamortized deferred financing fees, the write off of an unamortized discount and prepayment fees related to the redemption of all $250 million of our 5.875% senior unsecured notes due 2020. The loss on early extinguishment of debt of $7.1 million in the 2018 period reflects the write off of unamortized deferred financing fees related to our redemption at par of the total $400.0 million outstanding under our 5-year and 7-year term loans, the write off of unamortized deferred financing fees related to our repayment at par of all $175.0 million of our 5.75% senior unsecured notes due 2042, prepayment fees and the write off of unamortized deferred financing fees related to our repayment of $4.9 million of mortgage debt at 97 Newberry Road and the write off of unamortized deferred financing fees related to our termination of the credit agreement\nGain on sale of properties, net. Gain on sale of properties, net increased $170.8 million, or 67.9%, in the 2019 period, compared to the 2018 period.

Income tax expense decreased $1.9 million, or 59.3%, in the 2019 period, compared to the 2018 period, primarily due to a decrease in state and local taxes as a result of the sale of properties.\nNet income attributable to noncontrolling interest. In 2019, 2018 and 2017, we granted LTIP Units to certain of our trustees and employees. As these LTIP Units vest, they automatically convert to operating partnership units, or OP Units. The net income attributable to noncontrolling interest of $0.2 million in the 2019 period and $0.1 million in the 2018 period relates to the allocation of net income to the LTIP/OP Unit holders.\nInflation\nInflation in the past several years in the United States has been modest. Future inflation might have either positive or negative impacts on our business. Inflation might cause the value of our real estate to increase. Inflation might also cause our costs of equity and debt capital and operating costs to increase. An increase in our capital costs or in our operating costs may result in decreased earnings unless it is offset by increased revenues. Further inflation may permit us to increase rents upon lease renewal or enter new leases above the previous rent amounts for the leased space.\nIn the event we incur any variable rate debt in the future, we may enter into interest rate hedge arrangements in order to mitigate the adverse impact of any increased cost of debt capital in the event of material inflation. The decision to enter into these agreements will be based on various factors, including the amount of any floating rate debt outstanding, our belief that material interest rate increases are likely to occur, the costs of and our expected benefit from these agreements and upon requirements of our borrowing arrangements.\nIn periods of rapid inflation, our tenants' operating costs may increase faster than revenues, which may have an adverse impact upon us if our tenants' operating income becomes insufficient to pay our rent. To mitigate the adverse impact of tenant financial distress upon us, we require many of our tenants to provide guarantees or security for our rent.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nOur Operating Liquidity and Resources\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had $2.8 billion of cash and cash equivalents. We expect to use our cash balances, cash flow from our operations and proceeds of any future property sales to fund our operations, repay debt, make distributions, repurchase our common shares, make acquisitions and/or investments in properties or businesses, fund tenant improvements and leasing costs and for other general business purposes. We believe our cash balances and the cash flow from our operations will be sufficient to fund our ordinary course activities.\nOur future cash flows from operating activities will depend primarily upon our:\n\u2022ability to maintain or improve the occupancy of, and the rental rates at, our properties;\n\u2022ability to control operating and financing expense increases at our properties; and\n\u2022ability to purchase additional properties, which produce rents, less property operating expenses, in excess of our costs of acquisition capital.\nIn addition, our future cash flows will also depend in part on interest income earned on our invested cash balances.\nVolatility in energy costs and real estate taxes may cause our future operating expenses to fluctuate; however, the impact of these fluctuations is expected to be partially offset by the pass through of operating expenses to our tenants pursuant to lease terms, although there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully offset these expenses or that doing so would not negatively impact our competitive position or business.\nCash flows provided by (used in) operating, investing and financing activities were $98.9 million, $995.7 million and $(698.1) million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2019, and $89.5 million, $942.1 million and $(988.1) million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2018. Changes in these three categories of our cash flows between 2019 and 2018 are primarily related to a decrease in property net operating income (as the result of property dispositions), an increase in interest income (as a result of additional interest received on higher invested balances and higher average interest rates in 2019), real estate improvements, dispositions of properties, proceeds from sales and maturities of marketable securities, repayments of debt, repurchase of our common shares and distributions to our common shareholders.\nOur Investment and Financing Liquidity and Resources\nOn June 28, 2019, we redeemed all $250.0 million of our 5.875% senior unsecured notes due 2020 and recognized a loss on early extinguishment of debt of $6.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 from prepayment fees, the write off of unamortized deferred financing fees and the write off of an unamortized discount. As of December 31, 2019, our only debt consists of one $25.4 million mortgage note payable.\nOn September 24, 2019, our Board of Trustees declared a special, one-time cash distribution of $3.50 per common share/unit to shareholders/unitholders of record on October 7, 2019. On October 23, 2019, we paid this distribution to such shareholders/unitholders in the aggregate amount of $427.7 million.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, we paid an aggregate of $8.0 million of distributions on our series D preferred shares. On January 10, 2020, our Board of Trustees declared a dividend of $0.40625 per series D preferred share, which will be paid on February 18, 2020 to shareholders of record on January 30, 2020.\nOn March 13, 2019, our Board of Trustees authorized the repurchase of up to $150.0 million of our outstanding common shares over the twelve month period following the date of authorization. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we did not repurchase any of our common shares under our share repurchase program. The $150.0 million of remaining authorization available under our share repurchase program as of December 31, 2019 is scheduled to expire on March 13, 2020.\nOur outstanding debt maturity and interest rate as of December 31, 2019, were as follows (dollars in thousands):\nTable 19: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Scheduled Principal Payments During Period </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Year </td> <td>Secured Fixed Rate Debt(1) </td> <td> </td> <td>Interest Rate(2) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2020 </td> <td>$ </td> <td>597 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.7 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2021 </td> <td>24,836 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.7 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Thereafter </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>25,433 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.7 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1)Total debt outstanding as of December 31, 2019, including net unamortized premiums and net unamortized deferred financing costs, was $25,691.\n(2)Contractual interest rate.\nFor further information about our indebtedness, see Note 7 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, which is incorporated herein by reference.\nAs the maturity date of our debt approaches, we may explore alternatives to repay the amount due. Such alternatives may include using our cash balances, incurring additional debt and issuing new equity securities. We have an effective shelf registration statement that allows us to issue certain types of public securities on an expedited basis, but it does not apply to debt securities nor does it assure that there will be buyers for any such securities.\nWe believe that we will have access to various types of financings, including debt or equity offerings, to fund any future acquisitions and/or investments and to pay our debt and other obligations as they become due. Although we are not currently rated by the debt rating agencies, the completion and the costs of any future debt transactions will depend primarily upon market conditions and our credit ratings at such time, if any. We have no control over market conditions. Our credit ratings will depend upon evaluations by credit rating agencies of our business practices and plans and, in particular, whether we appear to have the ability to maintain our earnings, to space our debt maturities and to balance our use of debt and equity capital so that our financial performance and leverage ratios afford us flexibility to withstand any reasonably foreseeable adverse changes. We intend to conduct our business activities in a manner which will continue to afford us reasonable access to capital for investment and financing activities. However, there can be no assurance regarding our ability to complete any debt or equity offerings or that our cost of any future public or private financings will not increase.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, we sold three properties (six buildings) with a combined 2.7 million square feet for an aggregate sales price of $812.1 million, excluding credits and closing costs.

Nareit defines FFO as net income (loss), calculated in accordance with GAAP, excluding real estate depreciation and amortization, gains (or losses) from sales of depreciable property, impairment of depreciable real estate, and our portion of these items related to equity investees and non-controlling interests. Our calculation of Normalized FFO differs from Nareit's definition of FFO because we exclude certain items that we view as nonrecurring or impacting comparability from period to period. We consider FFO and Normalized FFO to be appropriate measures of operating performance for a REIT, along with net income, net income attributable to Equity Commonwealth common shareholders and cash flow from operating activities.\nWe believe that FFO and Normalized FFO provide useful information to investors because by excluding the effects of certain historical amounts, such as depreciation expense, FFO and Normalized FFO may facilitate a comparison of our operating performance between periods and with other REITs. FFO and Normalized FFO do not represent cash generated by operating activities in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered as alternatives to net income, net income attributable to Equity Commonwealth common shareholders or cash flow from operating activities, determined in accordance with GAAP, or as indicators of our financial performance or liquidity, nor are these measures necessarily indicative of sufficient cash flow to fund all of our needs. These measures should be considered in conjunction with net income, net income attributable to Equity Commonwealth common shareholders and cash flow from operating activities as presented in our consolidated statements of operations, consolidated statements of comprehensive income and consolidated statements of cash flows. Other REITs and real estate companies may calculate FFO and Normalized FFO differently than we do.\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of net income to FFO attributable to Equity Commonwealth common shareholders and unitholders and a calculation to Normalized FFO attributable to Equity Commonwealth common shareholders and unitholders (in thousands):\nTable 23: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Years Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Reconciliation to FFO: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income </td> <td>$ </td> <td>492,866 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>272,908 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>29,666 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Real estate depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>27,037 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>47,816 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>89,519 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss on asset impairment\n</td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12,087 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>19,714 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain on sale of properties, net </td> <td>(422,172) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(251,417) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(15,498) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>FFO attributable to Equity Commonwealth </td> <td>97,731 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>81,394 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>123,401 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Preferred distributions </td> <td>(7,988) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(7,988) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(7,988) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>FFO attributable to Equity Commonwealth common shareholders and unitholders </td> <td>$ </td> <td>89,743 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>73,406 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>115,413 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Reconciliation to Normalized FFO: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>FFO attributable to Equity Commonwealth common shareholders and unitholders </td> <td>$ </td> <td>89,743 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>73,406 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>115,413 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Lease value amortization </td> <td>(117) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>54 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,774 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Straight line rent adjustments </td> <td>(418) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(4,971) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(14,425) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss on early extinguishment of debt\n</td> <td>6,374 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,122 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>493 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss on sale of securities </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,987 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss on sale of real estate mortgage receivable </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,117 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income taxes related to gains on property sales </td> <td>142 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,726 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Normalized FFO attributable to Equity Commonwealth common shareholders and unitholders\n</td> <td>$ </td> <td>95,724 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>85,441 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>103,255 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nPROPERTY NET OPERATING INCOME (NOI)\nWe use property net operating income, or NOI, to evaluate the performance of our properties. We define NOI as income from our real estate including lease termination fees received from tenants less our property operating expenses. NOI excludes amortization of capitalized tenant improvement costs and leasing commissions and corporate level expenses.\nThe following table includes the reconciliation of NOI to net income, the most directly comparable financial measure under GAAP reported in our consolidated financial statements. We consider NOI to be an appropriate supplemental measure to net income because it helps to understand the operations of our properties. We use NOI internally to evaluate property level performance, and we believe that NOI provides useful information to investors regarding our results of operations because it reflects only those income and expense items that are incurred at the property level and may facilitate comparisons of our operating performance between periods and with other REITs. NOI does not represent cash generated by operating activities in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to net income, net income attributable to Equity Commonwealth common shareholders or cash flow from operating activities, determined in accordance with GAAP, or as an indicator of our financial performance or liquidity, nor is this measure necessarily indicative of sufficient cash flow to fund all of our needs. This measure should be considered in conjunction with net income, net income attributable to Equity Commonwealth common shareholders and cash flow from operating activities as presented in our consolidated statements of operations, consolidated statements of comprehensive income and consolidated statements of cash flows. Other REITs and real estate companies may calculate NOI differently than we do.\nA reconciliation of NOI to net income for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, is as follows (in thousands):\nTable 24: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Rental revenue </td> <td>$ </td> <td>116,869 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>184,368 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>324,415 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other revenue </td> <td>10,981 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12,654 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16,156 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating expenses </td> <td>(46,418) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(79,916) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(141,425) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>NOI </td> <td>$ </td> <td>81,432 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>117,106 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>199,146 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>NOI </td> <td>$ </td> <td>81,432 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>117,106 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>199,146 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization </td> <td>(28,122) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(49,041) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(90,708) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General and administrative </td> <td>(38,442) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(44,439) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(47,760) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss on asset impairment </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(12,087) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(19,714) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest and other income, net </td> <td>72,392 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>46,815 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>26,380 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense </td> <td>(8,908) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(26,585) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(52,183) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss on early extinguishment of debt </td> <td>(6,374) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(7,122) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(493) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain on sale of properties, net\n</td> <td>422,172 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>251,417 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15,498 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income before income taxes\n</td> <td>494,150 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>276,064 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>30,166 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax expense </td> <td>(1,284) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(3,156) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(500) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income </td> <td>$ </td> <td>492,866 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>272,908 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>29,666 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nOur critical accounting policies are those that will have the most impact on the reporting of our financial condition and results of operations and those requiring significant judgments and estimates. We believe that our judgments and estimates are consistently applied and produce financial information that fairly presents our results of operations. Our most critical accounting policies involve our investments in real property. These policies affect our assessment of the carrying values and impairments of long lived assets.\nWe periodically evaluate our properties for possible impairments. Impairment indicators may include declining tenant occupancy, lack of progress releasing vacant space, tenant bankruptcies, low long term prospects for improvement in property performance, weak or declining tenant profitability, cash flow or liquidity, our decision to dispose of an asset before the end of its estimated useful life and legislative, market or industry changes that could permanently reduce the value of a property. If indicators of impairment are present, we evaluate the carrying value of the related property by comparing it to the expected future undiscounted cash flows to be generated from that property over our anticipated hold period. If the sum of these expected future cash flows is less than the carrying value, we reduce the net carrying value of the property to its estimated fair value. This analysis requires us to judge whether indicators of impairment exist and to estimate likely future cash flows. Projections of expected future operating cash flows require that we estimate future market rental revenue amounts subsequent to the expiration of current lease agreements, future property operating expenses, the number of months it takes to re-lease the property, and the number of years the property is held for investment, among other factors. The subjectivity of assumptions used in the future cash flow analysis, including discount rates, could result in an incorrect assessment of the property's fair value and could result in the misstatement of the carrying value of our real estate assets and net income (loss).\nThese policies involve significant judgments made based upon experience, including judgments about current valuations, ultimate realizable value, estimated useful lives, salvage or residual value, the ability and willingness of our tenants to perform their obligations to us, current and future economic conditions and competitive factors in the markets in which our properties are located. Competition, economic conditions and other factors may cause occupancy declines in the future. In the future, we may need to revise our carrying value assessments to incorporate information which is not now known, and such revisions could increase or decrease our depreciation expense related to properties we own or decrease the carrying values of our assets.\nRELATED PERSON TRANSACTIONS\nFor information about our related person transactions, see Note 17 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K generally discusses 2019 and 2018 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2019 and 2018. Discussions of 2017 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2018 and 2017 that are not included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K can be found in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d in Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018.\nOVERVIEW\nWe are an internally managed and self-advised REIT primarily engaged in the ownership and operation of office properties in the United States. We were formed in 1986 under Maryland law. The Company operates as what is commonly referred to as an umbrella partnership real estate investment trust, or UPREIT, conducting substantially all of its activities through the Operating Trust. As of December 31, 2019, the Company beneficially owned 99.96% of the outstanding OP Units.\nAt December 31, 2019, our portfolio consisted of seven properties (12 buildings), with a combined 2.5 million square feet and a total undepreciated book value of $662.1 million, and a depreciated book value of $459.4 million. As of December 31, 2019, we had $2.8 billion of cash and cash equivalents.\nAs of December 31, 2019, our overall portfolio was 94.7% leased. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we entered into leases, excluding leasing activity for assets during the quarter in which the asset was sold or classified as held for sale, for 617,000 square feet, including lease renewals for 383,000 square feet and new leases for 234,000 square feet. Leases entered into during the year ended December 31, 2019, including both lease renewals and new leases, had weighted average cash rental rates that were approximately 2.5% higher than prior rental rates for the same space and weighted average GAAP rental rates that were approximately 11.7% higher than prior rental rates for the same space. The change in GAAP rents is different than the change in cash rents due to differences in the amount of rent abatements, the magnitude and timing of contractual rent increases over the lease term, and the length of term for the newly executed leases compared to the prior leases.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, we sold three properties (six buildings) with a combined 2.7 million square feet for an aggregate gross sales price of $812.1 million, excluding credits and closing costs. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we sold seven properties (nine buildings) with a combined 4.4 million square feet for an aggregate gross sales price of $1.0 billion, excluding credits and closing costs. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we redeemed an aggregate of $250.0 million of outstanding unsecured notes. Additionally, in February 2020, we sold our 0.3 million square foot property at 109 Brookline Avenue for a gross sale price of $270.0 million, and in February 2020, we entered into a contract to sell our 0.4 million square foot property at 333 108th Avenue NE for a gross sale price of $401.5 million. We currently have one other property totaling 0.2 million square feet for sale. For more information regarding these transactions, see Notes 3 and 19 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. As we have sold assets, our income from operations has declined.\nOn September 24, 2019, our Board of Trustees declared a special, one-time cash distribution of $3.50 per common share/unit to shareholders/unitholders of record on October 7, 2019. On October 23, 2019, we paid this distribution to such shareholders/unitholders in the aggregate amount of $427.7 million.\nWe have engaged CBRE, Inc. (CBRE) to provide property management services for our properties. We pay CBRE a property-by-property management fee and may engage CBRE from time-to-time to perform project management services, such as coordinating and overseeing the completion of tenant improvements and other capital projects at the properties. We reimburse CBRE for certain expenses incurred in the performance of its duties, including certain personnel and equipment costs. For the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, we incurred expenses of $5.2 million and $9.2 million, respectively, related to our property management agreement with CBRE, for property management fees, typically calculated as a percentage of the properties' revenues, and salary and benefits reimbursements for property personnel, such as property managers, engineers and maintenance staff. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, we had amounts payable pursuant to these services of $0.6 million and $0.8 million, respectively.\nWe continue to execute our office repositioning strategy to own and acquire at a discount to replacement cost high-quality, multi-tenant office assets in markets and sub-markets with favorable long-term supply and demand fundamentals. We expect our efforts in the office sector to continue to be primarily focused on larger buildings in central business districts and\nmajor urban areas that offer an attractive quality of life, including opportunities for tenants to live and play in close proximity to where they work, with a preference for markets that have above average limitations on new supply. We currently target such efforts towards acquiring portfolios of properties or pursuing other large acquisitions as opposed to purchasing individual properties, although we may acquire individual properties if opportunities to do so are consistent with our strategy. However, to create a foundation for long-term growth, the set of opportunities that we pursue in the future may include acquisitions and/or investments in office or non-office property types.\nIn repositioning our portfolio, we may sell additional properties, depending on market conditions. With the progress we have had executing dispositions, and the strength and liquidity of our balance sheet, we are in a position to increasingly shift our focus to capital allocation. We intend to use our capital for acquisitions and/or investments in new properties or businesses, repay debt, repurchase common shares or make distributions that further our long-term strategic goals.\nWe may be unable to identify suitable investment opportunities. If we do not redeploy capital, we will strive to achieve a sale, liquidation or otherwise exit our business in one or more transactions in a manner that optimizes shareholder value. We are unable to predict if or when we will make a determination to sell, liquidate or otherwise exit our business.\nProperty Operations\nLeased occupancy data for 2019 and 2018 is as follows (square feet in thousands):\n\n(1)Excludes properties sold.\n(2)Based on properties owned continuously from January 1, 2018 through December 31, 2019 and excludes properties sold.\n(3)Percent leased includes space subject to leases that have commenced, space being fitted out for occupancy pursuant to existing leases, and space which is leased but not occupied or is being offered for sublease by tenants.\nThe weighted average lease term based on square feet for leases entered into during the year ended December 31, 2019 was 4.9 years. Commitments made for leasing expenditures and concessions, such as tenant improvements and leasing commissions, for leases entered into during the year ended December 31, 2019, excluding leasing activity for assets during the quarter in which the asset was sold or classified as held for sale, totaled $25.5 million, or $41.30 per square foot on average (approximately $8.37 per square foot per year of the lease term).\nAs of December 31, 2019, approximately 6.5% of our leased square feet and 7.5% of our annualized rental revenue, determined as set forth below, are included in leases scheduled to expire through December 31, 2020. Renewal and new leases and rental rates at which available space may be relet in the future will depend on prevailing market conditions at the times these leases are negotiated. We believe that the in-place cash rents for leases expiring in 2020, that have not been backfilled, are below market. Lease expirations by year, as of December 31, 2019, are as follows (square feet and dollars in thousands):\n\n(1)Leased Square Feet as of December 31, 2019 includes space subject to leases that have commenced, space being fitted out for occupancy pursuant to existing leases, and space which is leased but is not occupied or is being offered for sublease by tenants. The Leased Square Feet Expiring corresponds to the latest-expiring signed lease for a given suite. Thus, backfilled suites expire in the year stipulated by the new lease.\n(2)Annualized rental revenue is annualized contractual rents from our tenants pursuant to leases which have commenced as of December 31, 2019, plus estimated recurring expense reimbursements; excludes lease value amortization, straight line rent adjustments, abated (free) rent periods and parking revenue. We calculate annualized rental revenue by aggregating the recurring billings outlined above for the most recent month during the quarter reported, adding abated rent, and multiplying the sum by 12 to provide an estimation of near-term potentially-recurring revenues. Annualized rental revenue is a forward-looking non-GAAP measure. Annualized rental revenue cannot be reconciled to a comparable GAAP measure without unreasonable efforts, primarily due to the fact that it is calculated from the billings of tenants in the most recent month at the most recent rental rates during the quarter reported, whereas historical GAAP measures include billings from a potentially different group of tenants over multiple months at potentially different rental rates.\nA principal source of funds for our operations is rents from tenants at our properties. Rents are generally received from our tenants monthly in advance. As of December 31, 2019, tenants representing 2.0% or more of our total annualized rental revenue were as follows (square feet in thousands):\n\n(1)Total Leased Square Feet as of December 31, 2019 includes space subject to leases that have commenced, space being fitted out for occupancy pursuant to existing leases, and space which is leased but is not occupied or is being offered for sublease by tenants.\n(2)Annualized rental revenue is annualized contractual rents from our tenants pursuant to leases which have commenced as of December 31, 2019, plus estimated recurring expense reimbursements; excludes lease value amortization, straight line rent adjustments, abated (free) rent periods and parking revenue. We calculate annualized rental revenue by aggregating the recurring billings outlined above for the most recent month during the quarter reported, adding abated rent, and multiplying the sum by 12 to provide an estimation of near-term potentially-recurring revenues. Annualized rental revenue is a forward-looking non-GAAP measure. Annualized rental revenue cannot be reconciled to a comparable GAAP measure without unreasonable efforts, primarily due to the fact that it is calculated from the billings of tenants in the most recent month at the most recent rental rates during the quarter reported, whereas historical GAAP measures include billings from a potentially different group of tenants over multiple months at potentially different rental rates.\n(3)During the third quarter of 2018, an affiliate of Amazon.com, Inc. entered into a new 16-year lease for 429,012 square feet, including all of the Expedia, Inc. space. The Amazon lease is expected to commence in the third quarter of 2020.\n(4)The weighted average remaining lease term including leases that have been backfilled with new tenants is 10.9 years.\nFinancing Activities\nOn June 28, 2019, we redeemed all $250.0 million of our 5.875% senior unsecured notes due 2020 and recognized a loss on early extinguishment of debt of $6.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 from prepayment fees, the write off of unamortized deferred financing fees and the write off of an unamortized discount. As of December 31, 2019, our only debt consists of one $25.4 million mortgage note payable.\nFor more information regarding our financing sources and activities, please see the section captioned Liquidity and Capital Resources-Our Investment and Financing Liquidity and Resources\u201d below.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nYear Ended December 31, 2019 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2018\n\n(1)Comparable properties consist of 7 properties (12 buildings) we owned continuously from January 1, 2018 to December 31, 2019.\n(2)Other properties consist of properties sold.\n(3)Certain reclassifications were made to conform the prior period to our presentation of the condensed consolidated statements of operations due to the impact of adopting Accounting Standards Update 2016-02. Amounts that were previously disclosed as \"Tenant reimbursements and other income\" are now included in \"Rental revenue\" and are no longer presented as a separate line item. Parking revenues that do not represent components of leases and were previously disclosed as \"Rental income\" are now included in \"Other revenue.\" Subsequent to January 1, 2019, provisions for credit losses are included in \"Rental revenue.\" Provisions for credit losses prior to January 1, 2019 were disclosed as \"Operating expenses\" and were not reclassified to conform prior periods to the current presentation.\n(4)We define net operating income, or NOI, as shown above, as income from our real estate including lease termination fees received from tenants less our property operating expenses. NOI excludes amortization of capitalized tenant improvement costs and leasing commissions and corporate level expenses. For a discussion of why we consider NOI to be an appropriate supplemental measure to net income as well as a reconciliation of NOI to net income, the most directly comparable financial measure under GAAP reported on our consolidated financial statements, please see \"Liquidity and Capital Resources - Property Net Operating Income (NOI).\"\nRental revenue. Rental revenue decreased $67.5 million, or 36.6%, in the 2019 period, compared to the 2018 period, primarily due to the properties sold in 2019 and 2018. Rental revenue at the comparable properties increased $6.2 million, or 6.8%, in the 2019 period, compared to the 2018 period, primarily due to leasing activity, a $2.1 million increase in lease termination fees and a $2.7 million increase in escalations and real estate tax recoveries.\nRental revenue includes increases for straight line rent adjustments totaling $0.4 million in the 2019 period and $5.0 million in the 2018 period, and net increases (reductions) for amortization of acquired real estate leases and assumed real estate lease obligations totaling $0.1 million in the 2019 period and $(0.1) million in the 2018 period. Rental income also includes the recognition of lease termination fees totaling $2.2 million in the 2019 period and $2.9 million in the 2018 period.\nOther revenue. Other revenue, which primarily includes parking revenue, decreased $1.7 million, or 13.2% in the 2019 period, compared to the 2018 period, primarily due to the properties sold in 2019 and 2018. Other revenue increased $0.7 million, or 7.8%, at the comparable properties in the 2019 period, compared to the 2018 period primarily due to increased parking revenue during the 2019 period.\nOperating expenses. Operating expenses decreased $33.5 million, or 41.9%, in the 2019 period, compared to the 2018 period, primarily due to the properties sold in 2019 and 2018. Operating expenses at our comparable properties increased $1.4 million, or 3.7%, primarily due to a $1.8 million increase in real estate tax expense, partially offset by a $0.9 million decrease in utility expense.\nDepreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization decreased $20.9 million, or 42.7%, in the 2019 period, compared to the 2018 period, primarily due to the properties sold in 2019 and 2018.\nGeneral and administrative. General and administrative expenses decreased $6.0 million, or 13.5% in the 2019 period, compared to the 2018 period, primarily due to a $5.7 million decrease in share-based compensation expense and a $1.7 million decrease in payroll expenses as a result of a staffing reduction, partially offset by a $1.6 million increase in compensation expenses related to severance from $1.8 million in the 2018 period to $3.4 million in the 2019 period.\nLoss on asset impairment. We recorded impairment charges of $12.1 million in the 2018 period related to 777 East Eisenhower Parkway and 97 Newberry Road, based upon the shortening of our expected period of ownership and updated market information in accordance with our impairment analysis procedures. We did not record any impairment charges in the 2019 period.\nInterest and other income, net. Interest and other income, net increased $25.6 million, or 54.6%, in the 2019 period, compared to the 2018 period, primarily due to $17.5 million of additional interest received on higher invested balances and higher average interest rates in 2019, a $5.0 million loss on the sale of marketable securities in the 2018 period and a $2.1 million loss on the sale of a real estate mortgage receivable in 2018. This mortgage receivable of $7.7 million represented mortgage financing we provided upon the sale of three properties in 2013.\nInterest expense. Interest expense decreased $17.7 million, or 66.5%, in the 2019 period, compared to the 2018 period, primarily due to the prepayment in March 2018 of all $175.0 million of our 5.75% senior unsecured notes due 2042, the redemption at par of the total $400.0 million outstanding under our 5-year and 7-year term loans in May 2018, the termination of our credit agreement in December 2018, the redemption in June 2019 of all $250 million of our 5.875% senior unsecured notes due 2020 and a decrease in amortization of deferred financing fees.\nLoss on early extinguishment of debt. The loss on early extinguishment of debt of $6.4 million in the 2019 period reflects the write off of unamortized deferred financing fees, the write off of an unamortized discount and prepayment fees related to the redemption of all $250 million of our 5.875% senior unsecured notes due 2020. The loss on early extinguishment of debt of $7.1 million in the 2018 period reflects the write off of unamortized deferred financing fees related to our redemption at par of the total $400.0 million outstanding under our 5-year and 7-year term loans, the write off of unamortized deferred financing fees related to our repayment at par of all $175.0 million of our 5.75% senior unsecured notes due 2042, prepayment fees and the write off of unamortized deferred financing fees related to our repayment of $4.9 million of mortgage debt at 97 Newberry Road and the write off of unamortized deferred financing fees related to our termination of the credit agreement\nGain on sale of properties, net. Gain on sale of properties, net increased $170.8 million, or 67.9%, in the 2019 period, compared to the 2018 period. Gain on sale of properties, net in the 2019 period primarily related to the following (dollars in thousands):\n\nGain on sale of properties, net in the 2018 period primarily relates to the following (dollars in thousands):\n\nIncome tax expense. Income tax expense decreased $1.9 million, or 59.3%, in the 2019 period, compared to the 2018 period, primarily due to a decrease in state and local taxes as a result of the sale of properties.\nNet income attributable to noncontrolling interest. In 2019, 2018 and 2017, we granted LTIP Units to certain of our trustees and employees. As these LTIP Units vest, they automatically convert to operating partnership units, or OP Units. The net income attributable to noncontrolling interest of $0.2 million in the 2019 period and $0.1 million in the 2018 period relates to the allocation of net income to the LTIP/OP Unit holders.\nInflation\nInflation in the past several years in the United States has been modest. Future inflation might have either positive or negative impacts on our business. Inflation might cause the value of our real estate to increase. Inflation might also cause our costs of equity and debt capital and operating costs to increase. An increase in our capital costs or in our operating costs may result in decreased earnings unless it is offset by increased revenues. Further inflation may permit us to increase rents upon lease renewal or enter new leases above the previous rent amounts for the leased space.\nIn the event we incur any variable rate debt in the future, we may enter into interest rate hedge arrangements in order to mitigate the adverse impact of any increased cost of debt capital in the event of material inflation. The decision to enter into these agreements will be based on various factors, including the amount of any floating rate debt outstanding, our belief that material interest rate increases are likely to occur, the costs of and our expected benefit from these agreements and upon requirements of our borrowing arrangements.\nIn periods of rapid inflation, our tenants' operating costs may increase faster than revenues, which may have an adverse impact upon us if our tenants' operating income becomes insufficient to pay our rent. To mitigate the adverse impact of tenant financial distress upon us, we require many of our tenants to provide guarantees or security for our rent.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nOur Operating Liquidity and Resources\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had $2.8 billion of cash and cash equivalents. We expect to use our cash balances, cash flow from our operations and proceeds of any future property sales to fund our operations, repay debt, make distributions, repurchase our common shares, make acquisitions and/or investments in properties or businesses, fund tenant improvements and leasing costs and for other general business purposes. We believe our cash balances and the cash flow from our operations will be sufficient to fund our ordinary course activities.\nOur future cash flows from operating activities will depend primarily upon our:\n\u2022ability to maintain or improve the occupancy of, and the rental rates at, our properties;\n\u2022ability to control operating and financing expense increases at our properties; and\n\u2022ability to purchase additional properties, which produce rents, less property operating expenses, in excess of our costs of acquisition capital.\nIn addition, our future cash flows will also depend in part on interest income earned on our invested cash balances.\nVolatility in energy costs and real estate taxes may cause our future operating expenses to fluctuate; however, the impact of these fluctuations is expected to be partially offset by the pass through of operating expenses to our tenants pursuant to lease terms, although there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully offset these expenses or that doing so would not negatively impact our competitive position or business.\nCash flows provided by (used in) operating, investing and financing activities were $98.9 million, $995.7 million and $(698.1) million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2019, and $89.5 million, $942.1 million and $(988.1) million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2018. Changes in these three categories of our cash flows between 2019 and 2018 are primarily related to a decrease in property net operating income (as the result of property dispositions), an increase in interest income (as a result of additional interest received on higher invested balances and higher average interest rates in 2019), real estate improvements, dispositions of properties, proceeds from sales and maturities of marketable securities, repayments of debt, repurchase of our common shares and distributions to our common shareholders.\nOur Investment and Financing Liquidity and Resources\nOn June 28, 2019, we redeemed all $250.0 million of our 5.875% senior unsecured notes due 2020 and recognized a loss on early extinguishment of debt of $6.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 from prepayment fees, the write off of unamortized deferred financing fees and the write off of an unamortized discount. As of December 31, 2019, our only debt consists of one $25.4 million mortgage note payable.\nOn September 24, 2019, our Board of Trustees declared a special, one-time cash distribution of $3.50 per common share/unit to shareholders/unitholders of record on October 7, 2019. On October 23, 2019, we paid this distribution to such shareholders/unitholders in the aggregate amount of $427.7 million.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, we paid an aggregate of $8.0 million of distributions on our series D preferred shares. On January 10, 2020, our Board of Trustees declared a dividend of $0.40625 per series D preferred share, which will be paid on February 18, 2020 to shareholders of record on January 30, 2020.\nOn March 13, 2019, our Board of Trustees authorized the repurchase of up to $150.0 million of our outstanding common shares over the twelve month period following the date of authorization. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we did not repurchase any of our common shares under our share repurchase program. The $150.0 million of remaining authorization available under our share repurchase program as of December 31, 2019 is scheduled to expire on March 13, 2020.\nOur outstanding debt maturity and interest rate as of December 31, 2019, were as follows (dollars in thousands):\n\n(1)Total debt outstanding as of December 31, 2019, including net unamortized premiums and net unamortized deferred financing costs, was $25,691.\n(2)Contractual interest rate.\nFor further information about our indebtedness, see Note 7 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, which is incorporated herein by reference.\nAs the maturity date of our debt approaches, we may explore alternatives to repay the amount due. Such alternatives may include using our cash balances, incurring additional debt and issuing new equity securities. We have an effective shelf registration statement that allows us to issue certain types of public securities on an expedited basis, but it does not apply to debt securities nor does it assure that there will be buyers for any such securities.\nWe believe that we will have access to various types of financings, including debt or equity offerings, to fund any future acquisitions and/or investments and to pay our debt and other obligations as they become due. Although we are not currently rated by the debt rating agencies, the completion and the costs of any future debt transactions will depend primarily upon market conditions and our credit ratings at such time, if any. We have no control over market conditions. Our credit ratings will depend upon evaluations by credit rating agencies of our business practices and plans and, in particular, whether we appear to have the ability to maintain our earnings, to space our debt maturities and to balance our use of debt and equity capital so that our financial performance and leverage ratios afford us flexibility to withstand any reasonably foreseeable adverse changes. We intend to conduct our business activities in a manner which will continue to afford us reasonable access to capital for investment and financing activities. However, there can be no assurance regarding our ability to complete any debt or equity offerings or that our cost of any future public or private financings will not increase.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, we sold three properties (six buildings) with a combined 2.7 million square feet for an aggregate sales price of $812.1 million, excluding credits and closing costs. In February 2020, we sold our 0.3 million square foot property at 109 Brookline Avenue for a gross sale price of $270.0 million, and in February 2020, we entered into a contract to sell our 0.4 million square foot property at 333 108th Avenue NE for a gross sale price of $401.5 million. For more information regarding these transactions, see Notes 3 and 19 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, which are incorporated herein by reference.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 amounts capitalized at our properties, including properties sold or classified as held for sale, for tenant improvements, leasing costs and building improvements were as follows (amounts in thousands):\n\n(1)Tenant improvements include capital expenditures to improve tenants' space.\n(2)Leasing costs include leasing commissions and related legal expenses.\n(3)Building improvements generally include expenditures to replace obsolete building components and expenditures that extend the useful life of existing assets. Tenant-funded capital expenditures are excluded.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, commitments made for expenditures in connection with leasing space at our properties, excluding leasing activity for assets during the quarter in which the asset was sold or classified as held for sale, were as follows (dollar and square foot measures in thousands):\n\nDebt Covenants\nAfter the redemption of all $250.0 million of our 5.875% senior unsecured notes due 2020 on June 28, 2019, we no longer have any notes outstanding under our public debt indenture and related supplements, collectively, the Indenture, and we are no longer required to maintain the financial ratio covenants prescribed in the Indenture. As a result, we are no longer rated by the debt rating agencies.\nOFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had no off balance sheet arrangements that have had or that we expect would be reasonably likely to have a future material effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.\nCONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS\nAs of December 31, 2019, our contractual obligations were as follows (dollars in thousands):\n\n(1)Committed tenant related obligations are leasing commissions and tenant improvements and are based on leases in effect as of December 31, 2019.\n(2)Projected interest expense is attributable to only the long term debt obligation listed above at existing rates and is not intended to project future interest costs which may result from debt prepayments, new debt issuances or changes in interest rates.\nFUNDS FROM OPERATIONS (FFO) AND NORMALIZED FFO\nWe compute FFO in accordance with standards established by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, or Nareit. Nareit defines FFO as net income (loss), calculated in accordance with GAAP, excluding real estate depreciation and amortization, gains (or losses) from sales of depreciable property, impairment of depreciable real estate, and our portion of these items related to equity investees and non-controlling interests. Our calculation of Normalized FFO differs from Nareit's definition of FFO because we exclude certain items that we view as nonrecurring or impacting comparability from period to period. We consider FFO and Normalized FFO to be appropriate measures of operating performance for a REIT, along with net income, net income attributable to Equity Commonwealth common shareholders and cash flow from operating activities.\nWe believe that FFO and Normalized FFO provide useful information to investors because by excluding the effects of certain historical amounts, such as depreciation expense, FFO and Normalized FFO may facilitate a comparison of our operating performance between periods and with other REITs. FFO and Normalized FFO do not represent cash generated by operating activities in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered as alternatives to net income, net income attributable to Equity Commonwealth common shareholders or cash flow from operating activities, determined in accordance with GAAP, or as indicators of our financial performance or liquidity, nor are these measures necessarily indicative of sufficient cash flow to fund all of our needs. These measures should be considered in conjunction with net income, net income attributable to Equity Commonwealth common shareholders and cash flow from operating activities as presented in our consolidated statements of operations, consolidated statements of comprehensive income and consolidated statements of cash flows. Other REITs and real estate companies may calculate FFO and Normalized FFO differently than we do.\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of net income to FFO attributable to Equity Commonwealth common shareholders and unitholders and a calculation to Normalized FFO attributable to Equity Commonwealth common shareholders and unitholders (in thousands):\n\nPROPERTY NET OPERATING INCOME (NOI)\nWe use property net operating income, or NOI, to evaluate the performance of our properties. We define NOI as income from our real estate including lease termination fees received from tenants less our property operating expenses. NOI excludes amortization of capitalized tenant improvement costs and leasing commissions and corporate level expenses.\nThe following table includes the reconciliation of NOI to net income, the most directly comparable financial measure under GAAP reported in our consolidated financial statements. We consider NOI to be an appropriate supplemental measure to net income because it helps to understand the operations of our properties. We use NOI internally to evaluate property level performance, and we believe that NOI provides useful information to investors regarding our results of operations because it reflects only those income and expense items that are incurred at the property level and may facilitate comparisons of our operating performance between periods and with other REITs. NOI does not represent cash generated by operating activities in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to net income, net income attributable to Equity Commonwealth common shareholders or cash flow from operating activities, determined in accordance with GAAP, or as an indicator of our financial performance or liquidity, nor is this measure necessarily indicative of sufficient cash flow to fund all of our needs. This measure should be considered in conjunction with net income, net income attributable to Equity Commonwealth common shareholders and cash flow from operating activities as presented in our consolidated statements of operations, consolidated statements of comprehensive income and consolidated statements of cash flows. Other REITs and real estate companies may calculate NOI differently than we do.\nA reconciliation of NOI to net income for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, is as follows (in thousands):\n\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nOur critical accounting policies are those that will have the most impact on the reporting of our financial condition and results of operations and those requiring significant judgments and estimates. We believe that our judgments and estimates are consistently applied and produce financial information that fairly presents our results of operations. Our most critical accounting policies involve our investments in real property. These policies affect our assessment of the carrying values and impairments of long lived assets.\nWe periodically evaluate our properties for possible impairments. Impairment indicators may include declining tenant occupancy, lack of progress releasing vacant space, tenant bankruptcies, low long term prospects for", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K generally discusses 2019 and 2018 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2019 and 2018. Discussions of 2017 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2018 and 2017 that are not included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K can be found in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d in Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018.\nOVERVIEW\nWe are an internally managed and self-advised REIT primarily engaged in the ownership and operation of office properties in the United States. We were formed in 1986 under Maryland law. The Company operates as what is commonly referred to as an umbrella partnership real estate investment trust, or UPREIT, conducting substantially all of its activities through the Operating Trust. As of December 31, 2019, the Company beneficially owned 99.96% of the outstanding OP Units.\nAt December 31, 2019, our portfolio consisted of seven properties (12 buildings), with a combined 2.5 million square feet and a total undepreciated book value of $662.1 million, and a depreciated book value of $459.4 million. As of December 31, 2019, we had $2.8 billion of cash and cash equivalents.\nAs of December 31, 2019, our overall portfolio was 94.7% leased. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we entered into leases, excluding leasing activity for assets during the quarter in which the asset was sold or classified as held for sale, for 617,000 square feet, including lease renewals for 383,000 square feet and new leases for 234,000 square feet. Leases entered into during the year ended December 31, 2019, including both lease renewals and new leases, had weighted average cash rental rates that were approximately 2.5% higher than prior rental rates for the same space and weighted average GAAP rental rates that were approximately 11.7% higher than prior rental rates for the same space. The change in GAAP rents is different than the change in cash rents due to differences in the amount of rent abatements, the magnitude and timing of contractual rent increases over the lease term, and the length of term for the newly executed leases compared to the prior leases.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, we sold three properties (six buildings) with a combined 2.7 million square feet for an aggregate gross sales price of $812.1 million, excluding credits and closing costs. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we sold seven properties (nine buildings) with a combined 4.4 million square feet for an aggregate gross sales price of $1.0 billion, excluding credits and closing costs. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we redeemed an aggregate of $250.0 million of outstanding unsecured notes. Additionally, in February 2020, we sold our 0.3 million square foot property at 109 Brookline Avenue for a gross sale price of $270.0 million, and in February 2020, we entered into a contract to sell our 0.4 million square foot property at 333 108th Avenue NE for a gross sale price of $401.5 million. We currently have one other property totaling 0.2 million square feet for sale. For more information regarding these transactions, see Notes 3 and 19 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. As we have sold assets, our income from operations has declined.\nOn September 24, 2019, our Board of Trustees declared a special, one-time cash distribution of $3.50 per common share/unit to shareholders/unitholders of record on October 7, 2019. On October 23, 2019, we paid this distribution to such shareholders/unitholders in the aggregate amount of $427.7 million.\nWe have engaged CBRE, Inc. (CBRE) to provide property management services for our properties. We pay CBRE a property-by-property management fee and may engage CBRE from time-to-time to perform project management services, such as coordinating and overseeing the completion of tenant improvements and other capital projects at the properties. We reimburse CBRE for certain expenses incurred in the performance of its duties, including certain personnel and equipment costs. For the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, we incurred expenses of $5.2 million and $9.2 million, respectively, related to our property management agreement with CBRE, for property management fees, typically calculated as a percentage of the properties' revenues, and salary and benefits reimbursements for property personnel, such as property managers, engineers and maintenance staff. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, we had amounts payable pursuant to these services of $0.6 million and $0.8 million, respectively.\nWe continue to execute our office repositioning strategy to own and acquire at a discount to replacement cost high-quality, multi-tenant office assets in markets and sub-markets with favorable long-term supply and demand fundamentals. We expect our efforts in the office sector to continue to be primarily focused on larger buildings in central business districts and\nmajor urban areas that offer an attractive quality of life, including opportunities for tenants to live and play in close proximity to where they work, with a preference for markets that have above average limitations on new supply. We currently target such efforts towards acquiring portfolios of properties or pursuing other large acquisitions as opposed to purchasing individual properties, although we may acquire individual properties if opportunities to do so are consistent with our strategy. However, to create a foundation for long-term growth, the set of opportunities that we pursue in the future may include acquisitions and/or investments in office or non-office property types.\nIn repositioning our portfolio, we may sell additional properties, depending on market conditions. With the progress we have had executing dispositions, and the strength and liquidity of our balance sheet, we are in a position to increasingly shift our focus to capital allocation. We intend to use our capital for acquisitions and/or investments in new properties or businesses, repay debt, repurchase common shares or make distributions that further our long-term strategic goals.\nWe may be unable to identify suitable investment opportunities. If we do not redeploy capital, we will strive to achieve a sale, liquidation or otherwise exit our business in one or more transactions in a manner that optimizes shareholder value. We are unable to predict if or when we will make a determination to sell, liquidate or otherwise exit our business.\nProperty Operations\nLeased occupancy data for 2019 and 2018 is as follows (square feet in thousands):\nTable 13: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>All Properties(1) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Comparable Properties(2) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>As of December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>As of December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total properties </td> <td>7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total square feet </td> <td>2,469 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,120 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,469 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,469 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Percent leased(3) </td> <td>94.7 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>94.8 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>94.7 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>93.2 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1)Excludes properties sold.\n(2)Based on properties owned continuously from January 1, 2018 through December 31, 2019 and excludes properties sold.\n(3)Percent leased includes space subject to leases that have commenced, space being fitted out for occupancy pursuant to existing leases, and space which is leased but not occupied or is being offered for sublease by tenants.\nThe weighted average lease term based on square feet for leases entered into during the year ended December 31, 2019 was 4.9 years. Commitments made for leasing expenditures and concessions, such as tenant improvements and leasing commissions, for leases entered into during the year ended December 31, 2019, excluding leasing activity for assets during the quarter in which the asset was sold or classified as held for sale, totaled $25.5 million, or $41.30 per square foot on average (approximately $8.37 per square foot per year of the lease term).\nAs of December 31, 2019, approximately 6.5% of our leased square feet and 7.5% of our annualized rental revenue, determined as set forth below, are included in leases scheduled to expire through December 31, 2020. Renewal and new leases and rental rates at which available space may be relet in the future will depend on prevailing market conditions at the times these leases are negotiated. We believe that the in-place cash rents for leases expiring in 2020, that have not been backfilled, are below market. Lease expirations by year, as of December 31, 2019, are as follows (square feet and dollars in thousands):\nTable 14: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

The Leased Square Feet Expiring corresponds to the latest-expiring signed lease for a given suite. Thus, backfilled suites expire in the year stipulated by the new lease.\n(2)Annualized rental revenue is annualized contractual rents from our tenants pursuant to leases which have commenced as of December 31, 2019, plus estimated recurring expense reimbursements; excludes lease value amortization, straight line rent adjustments, abated (free) rent periods and parking revenue. We calculate annualized rental revenue by aggregating the recurring billings outlined above for the most recent month during the quarter reported, adding abated rent, and multiplying the sum by 12 to provide an estimation of near-term potentially-recurring revenues. Annualized rental revenue is a forward-looking non-GAAP measure. Annualized rental revenue cannot be reconciled to a comparable GAAP measure without unreasonable efforts, primarily due to the fact that it is calculated from the billings of tenants in the most recent month at the most recent rental rates during the quarter reported, whereas historical GAAP measures include billings from a potentially different group of tenants over multiple months at potentially different rental rates.\nA principal source of funds for our operations is rents from tenants at our properties. Rents are generally received from our tenants monthly in advance. As of December 31, 2019, tenants representing 2.0% or more of our total annualized rental revenue were as follows (square feet in thousands):\nTable 15: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tenant </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Square Feet(1) </td> <td> </td> <td>% of Total Leased Square Feet(1) </td> <td> </td> <td>% of Annualized Rental Revenue(2) </td> <td> </td> <td>Weighted Average Remaining Lease Term </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>1. </td> <td>Expedia, Inc.(3)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>427 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18.3 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>22.9 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2. </td> <td>Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Inc. </td> <td> </td> <td>77 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.3 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>4.1 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>9.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>3. </td> <td>Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Inc. </td> <td> </td> <td>117 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>4.1 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>3.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>4. </td> <td>British International School of Washington </td> <td> </td> <td>112 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.8 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>3.5 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>17.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>5. </td> <td>Equinor Energy Services, Inc. </td> <td> </td> <td>77 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.3 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>3.4 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>4.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>6. </td> <td>Georgetown University </td> <td> </td> <td>129 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.5 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>2.9 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>1.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>7. </td> <td>KPMG, LLP </td> <td> </td> <td>87 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.7 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>2.8 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>7.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>8. </td> <td>Crowdstrike, Inc. </td> <td> </td> <td>36 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.5 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>2.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>4.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>9. </td> <td>CBRE, Inc. </td> <td> </td> <td>40 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.7 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>2.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>8.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>1,102 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>47.1 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>47.7 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>4.4 </td> <td> </td> <td>(4) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1)Total Leased Square Feet as of December 31, 2019 includes space subject to leases that have commenced, space being fitted out for occupancy pursuant to existing leases, and space which is leased but is not occupied or is being offered for sublease by tenants.\n(2)Annualized rental revenue is annualized contractual rents from our tenants pursuant to leases which have commenced as of December 31, 2019, plus estimated recurring expense reimbursements; excludes lease value amortization, straight line rent adjustments, abated (free) rent periods and parking revenue.

properties (12 buildings) we owned continuously from January 1, 2018 to December 31, 2019.\n(2)Other properties consist of properties sold.\n(3)Certain reclassifications were made to conform the prior period to our presentation of the condensed consolidated statements of operations due to the impact of adopting Accounting Standards Update 2016-02. Amounts that were previously disclosed as \"Tenant reimbursements and other income\" are now included in \"Rental revenue\" and are no longer presented as a separate line item. Parking revenues that do not represent components of leases and were previously disclosed as \"Rental income\" are now included in \"Other revenue.\" Subsequent to January 1, 2019, provisions for credit losses are included in \"Rental revenue.\" Provisions for credit losses prior to January 1, 2019 were disclosed as \"Operating expenses\" and were not reclassified to conform prior periods to the current presentation.\n(4)We define net operating income, or NOI, as shown above, as income from our real estate including lease termination fees received from tenants less our property operating expenses. NOI excludes amortization of capitalized tenant improvement costs and leasing commissions and corporate level expenses. For a discussion of why we consider NOI to be an appropriate supplemental measure to net income as well as a reconciliation of NOI to net income, the most directly comparable financial measure under GAAP reported on our consolidated financial statements, please see \"Liquidity and Capital Resources - Property Net Operating Income (NOI).\"\nRental revenue. Rental revenue decreased $67.5 million, or 36.6%, in the 2019 period, compared to the 2018 period, primarily due to the properties sold in 2019 and 2018. Rental revenue at the comparable properties increased $6.2 million, or 6.8%, in the 2019 period, compared to the 2018 period, primarily due to leasing activity, a $2.1 million increase in lease termination fees and a $2.7 million increase in escalations and real estate tax recoveries.\nRental revenue includes increases for straight line rent adjustments totaling $0.4 million in the 2019 period and $5.0 million in the 2018 period, and net increases (reductions) for amortization of acquired real estate leases and assumed real estate lease obligations totaling $0.1 million in the 2019 period and $(0.1) million in the 2018 period. Rental income also includes the recognition of lease termination fees totaling $2.2 million in the 2019 period and $2.9 million in the 2018 period.\nOther revenue. Other revenue, which primarily includes parking revenue, decreased $1.7 million, or 13.2% in the 2019 period, compared to the 2018 period, primarily due to the properties sold in 2019 and 2018. Other revenue increased $0.7 million, or 7.8%, at the comparable properties in the 2019 period, compared to the 2018 period primarily due to increased parking revenue during the 2019 period.\nOperating expenses. Operating expenses decreased $33.5 million, or 41.9%, in the 2019 period, compared to the 2018 period, primarily due to the properties sold in 2019 and 2018. Operating expenses at our comparable properties increased $1.4 million, or 3.7%, primarily due to a $1.8 million increase in real estate tax expense, partially offset by a $0.9 million decrease in utility expense.\nDepreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization decreased $20.9 million, or 42.7%, in the 2019 period, compared to the 2018 period, primarily due to the properties sold in 2019 and 2018.\nGeneral and administrative. General and administrative expenses decreased $6.0 million, or 13.5% in the 2019 period, compared to the 2018 period, primarily due to a $5.7 million decrease in share-based compensation expense and a $1.7 million decrease in payroll expenses as a result of a staffing reduction, partially offset by a $1.6 million increase in compensation expenses related to severance from $1.8 million in the 2018 period to $3.4 million in the 2019 period.\nLoss on asset impairment. We recorded impairment charges of $12.1 million in the 2018 period related to 777 East Eisenhower Parkway and 97 Newberry Road, based upon the shortening of our expected period of ownership and updated market information in accordance with our impairment analysis procedures. We did not record any impairment charges in the 2019 period.\nInterest and other income, net. Interest and other income, net increased $25.6 million, or 54.6%, in the 2019 period, compared to the 2018 period, primarily due to $17.5 million of additional interest received on higher invested balances and higher average interest rates in 2019, a $5.0 million loss on the sale of marketable securities in the 2018 period and a $2.1 million loss on the sale of a real estate mortgage receivable in 2018. This mortgage receivable of $7.7 million represented mortgage financing we provided upon the sale of three properties in 2013.\nInterest expense. Interest expense decreased $17.7 million, or 66.5%, in the 2019 period, compared to the 2018 period, primarily due to the prepayment in March 2018 of all $175.0 million of our 5.75% senior unsecured notes due 2042, the redemption at par of the total $400.0 million outstanding under our 5-year and 7-year term loans in May 2018, the termination of our credit agreement in December 2018, the redemption in June 2019 of all $250 million of our 5.875% senior unsecured notes due 2020 and a decrease in amortization of deferred financing fees.\nLoss on early extinguishment of debt. The loss on early extinguishment of debt of $6.4 million in the 2019 period reflects the write off of unamortized deferred financing fees, the write off of an unamortized discount and prepayment fees related to the redemption of all $250 million of our 5.875% senior unsecured notes due 2020. The loss on early extinguishment of debt of $7.1 million in the 2018 period reflects the write off of unamortized deferred financing fees related to our redemption at par of the total $400.0 million outstanding under our 5-year and 7-year term loans, the write off of unamortized deferred financing fees related to our repayment at par of all $175.0 million of our 5.75% senior unsecured notes due 2042, prepayment fees and the write off of unamortized deferred financing fees related to our repayment of $4.9 million of mortgage debt at 97 Newberry Road and the write off of unamortized deferred financing fees related to our termination of the credit agreement\nGain on sale of properties, net. Gain on sale of properties, net increased $170.8 million, or 67.9%, in the 2019 period, compared to the 2018 period.

Income tax expense decreased $1.9 million, or 59.3%, in the 2019 period, compared to the 2018 period, primarily due to a decrease in state and local taxes as a result of the sale of properties.\nNet income attributable to noncontrolling interest. In 2019, 2018 and 2017, we granted LTIP Units to certain of our trustees and employees. As these LTIP Units vest, they automatically convert to operating partnership units, or OP Units. The net income attributable to noncontrolling interest of $0.2 million in the 2019 period and $0.1 million in the 2018 period relates to the allocation of net income to the LTIP/OP Unit holders.\nInflation\nInflation in the past several years in the United States has been modest. Future inflation might have either positive or negative impacts on our business. Inflation might cause the value of our real estate to increase. Inflation might also cause our costs of equity and debt capital and operating costs to increase. An increase in our capital costs or in our operating costs may result in decreased earnings unless it is offset by increased revenues. Further inflation may permit us to increase rents upon lease renewal or enter new leases above the previous rent amounts for the leased space.\nIn the event we incur any variable rate debt in the future, we may enter into interest rate hedge arrangements in order to mitigate the adverse impact of any increased cost of debt capital in the event of material inflation. The decision to enter into these agreements will be based on various factors, including the amount of any floating rate debt outstanding, our belief that material interest rate increases are likely to occur, the costs of and our expected benefit from these agreements and upon requirements of our borrowing arrangements.\nIn periods of rapid inflation, our tenants' operating costs may increase faster than revenues, which may have an adverse impact upon us if our tenants' operating income becomes insufficient to pay our rent. To mitigate the adverse impact of tenant financial distress upon us, we require many of our tenants to provide guarantees or security for our rent.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nOur Operating Liquidity and Resources\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had $2.8 billion of cash and cash equivalents. We expect to use our cash balances, cash flow from our operations and proceeds of any future property sales to fund our operations, repay debt, make distributions, repurchase our common shares, make acquisitions and/or investments in properties or businesses, fund tenant improvements and leasing costs and for other general business purposes. We believe our cash balances and the cash flow from our operations will be sufficient to fund our ordinary course activities.\nOur future cash flows from operating activities will depend primarily upon our:\n\u2022ability to maintain or improve the occupancy of, and the rental rates at, our properties;\n\u2022ability to control operating and financing expense increases at our properties; and\n\u2022ability to purchase additional properties, which produce rents, less property operating expenses, in excess of our costs of acquisition capital.\nIn addition, our future cash flows will also depend in part on interest income earned on our invested cash balances.\nVolatility in energy costs and real estate taxes may cause our future operating expenses to fluctuate; however, the impact of these fluctuations is expected to be partially offset by the pass through of operating expenses to our tenants pursuant to lease terms, although there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully offset these expenses or that doing so would not negatively impact our competitive position or business.\nCash flows provided by (used in) operating, investing and financing activities were $98.9 million, $995.7 million and $(698.1) million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2019, and $89.5 million, $942.1 million and $(988.1) million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2018. Changes in these three categories of our cash flows between 2019 and 2018 are primarily related to a decrease in property net operating income (as the result of property dispositions), an increase in interest income (as a result of additional interest received on higher invested balances and higher average interest rates in 2019), real estate improvements, dispositions of properties, proceeds from sales and maturities of marketable securities, repayments of debt, repurchase of our common shares and distributions to our common shareholders.\nOur Investment and Financing Liquidity and Resources\nOn June 28, 2019, we redeemed all $250.0 million of our 5.875% senior unsecured notes due 2020 and recognized a loss on early extinguishment of debt of $6.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 from prepayment fees, the write off of unamortized deferred financing fees and the write off of an unamortized discount. As of December 31, 2019, our only debt consists of one $25.4 million mortgage note payable.\nOn September 24, 2019, our Board of Trustees declared a special, one-time cash distribution of $3.50 per common share/unit to shareholders/unitholders of record on October 7, 2019. On October 23, 2019, we paid this distribution to such shareholders/unitholders in the aggregate amount of $427.7 million.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, we paid an aggregate of $8.0 million of distributions on our series D preferred shares. On January 10, 2020, our Board of Trustees declared a dividend of $0.40625 per series D preferred share, which will be paid on February 18, 2020 to shareholders of record on January 30, 2020.\nOn March 13, 2019, our Board of Trustees authorized the repurchase of up to $150.0 million of our outstanding common shares over the twelve month period following the date of authorization. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we did not repurchase any of our common shares under our share repurchase program. The $150.0 million of remaining authorization available under our share repurchase program as of December 31, 2019 is scheduled to expire on March 13, 2020.\nOur outstanding debt maturity and interest rate as of December 31, 2019, were as follows (dollars in thousands):\nTable 19: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Scheduled Principal Payments During Period </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Year </td> <td>Secured Fixed Rate Debt(1) </td> <td> </td> <td>Interest Rate(2) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2020 </td> <td>$ </td> <td>597 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.7 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>2021 </td> <td>24,836 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.7 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Thereafter </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>25,433 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.7 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1)Total debt outstanding as of December 31, 2019, including net unamortized premiums and net unamortized deferred financing costs, was $25,691.\n(2)Contractual interest rate.\nFor further information about our indebtedness, see Note 7 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, which is incorporated herein by reference.\nAs the maturity date of our debt approaches, we may explore alternatives to repay the amount due. Such alternatives may include using our cash balances, incurring additional debt and issuing new equity securities. We have an effective shelf registration statement that allows us to issue certain types of public securities on an expedited basis, but it does not apply to debt securities nor does it assure that there will be buyers for any such securities.\nWe believe that we will have access to various types of financings, including debt or equity offerings, to fund any future acquisitions and/or investments and to pay our debt and other obligations as they become due. Although we are not currently rated by the debt rating agencies, the completion and the costs of any future debt transactions will depend primarily upon market conditions and our credit ratings at such time, if any. We have no control over market conditions. Our credit ratings will depend upon evaluations by credit rating agencies of our business practices and plans and, in particular, whether we appear to have the ability to maintain our earnings, to space our debt maturities and to balance our use of debt and equity capital so that our financial performance and leverage ratios afford us flexibility to withstand any reasonably foreseeable adverse changes. We intend to conduct our business activities in a manner which will continue to afford us reasonable access to capital for investment and financing activities. However, there can be no assurance regarding our ability to complete any debt or equity offerings or that our cost of any future public or private financings will not increase.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, we sold three properties (six buildings) with a combined 2.7 million square feet for an aggregate sales price of $812.1 million, excluding credits and closing costs. In February 2020, we sold our 0.3 million square foot property at 109 Brookline Avenue for a gross sale price of $270.0 million, and in February 2020, we entered into a contract to sell our 0.4 million square foot property at 333 108th Avenue NE for a gross sale price of $401.5 million. For more information regarding these transactions, see Notes 3 and 19 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, which are incorporated herein by reference.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 amounts capitalized at our properties, including properties sold or classified as held for sale, for tenant improvements, leasing costs and building improvements were as follows (amounts in thousands):\nTable 20: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Years Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tenant improvements(1)\n</td> <td>$ </td> <td>7,529 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>47,248 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>29,161 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Leasing costs(2)\n</td> <td>5,409 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>21,674 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16,073 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Building improvements(3)\n</td> <td>6,366 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9,046 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>25,880 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1)Tenant improvements include capital expenditures to improve tenants' space.\n(2)Leasing costs include leasing commissions and related legal expenses.\n(3)Building improvements generally include expenditures to replace obsolete building components and expenditures that extend the useful life of existing assets. Tenant-funded capital expenditures are excluded.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, commitments made for expenditures in connection with leasing space at our properties, excluding leasing activity for assets during the quarter in which the asset was sold or classified as held for sale, were as follows (dollar and square foot measures in thousands):\nTable 21: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>New\nLeases\n</td> <td> </td> <td>Renewals </td> <td> </td> <td>Total </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Square feet leased during the period </td> <td>234 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>383 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>617 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tenant improvements and leasing commissions </td> <td>$ </td> <td>18,306 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>7,174 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>25,480 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tenant improvements and leasing commissions per square foot </td> <td>$ </td> <td>78.23 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>18.73 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>41.30 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Weighted average lease term by square foot (years) </td> <td>6.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.9 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tenant improvements and leasing commissions per square foot per year of lease term\n</td> <td>$ </td> <td>12.24 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4.63 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>8.37 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nDebt Covenants\nAfter the redemption of all $250.0 million of our 5.875% senior unsecured notes due 2020 on June 28, 2019, we no longer have any notes outstanding under our public debt indenture and related supplements, collectively, the Indenture, and we are no longer required to maintain the financial ratio covenants prescribed in the Indenture. As a result, we are no longer rated by the debt rating agencies.\nOFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had no off balance sheet arrangements that have had or that we expect would be reasonably likely to have a future material effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.\nCONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS\nAs of December 31, 2019, our contractual obligations were as follows (dollars in thousands):\nTable 22: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Payment Due by Period </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Contractual Obligations </td> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>Less than\n1 year </td> <td> </td> <td>1-3 years </td> <td> </td> <td>3-5 years </td> <td> </td> <td>More than\n5 years </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long term debt obligations </td> <td>$ </td> <td>25,433 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>597 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>24,836 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tenant related obligations(1)\n</td> <td>73,858 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>72,519 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,339 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Projected interest expense(2)\n</td> <td>1,577 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,456 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>121 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating lease obligations-corporate office space\n</td> <td>881 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>881 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total </td> <td>$ </td> <td>101,749 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>75,453 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>26,296 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1)Committed tenant related obligations are leasing commissions and tenant improvements and are based on leases in effect as of December 31, 2019.\n(2)Projected interest expense is attributable to only the long term debt obligation listed above at existing rates and is not intended to project future interest costs which may result from debt prepayments, new debt issuances or changes in interest rates.\nFUNDS FROM OPERATIONS (FFO) AND NORMALIZED FFO\nWe compute FFO in accordance with standards established by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, or Nareit. Nareit defines FFO as net income (loss), calculated in accordance with GAAP, excluding real estate depreciation and amortization, gains (or losses) from sales of depreciable property, impairment of depreciable real estate, and our portion of these items related to equity investees and non-controlling interests. Our calculation of Normalized FFO differs from Nareit's definition of FFO because we exclude certain items that we view as nonrecurring or impacting comparability from period to period. We consider FFO and Normalized FFO to be appropriate measures of operating performance for a REIT, along with net income, net income attributable to Equity Commonwealth common shareholders and cash flow from operating activities.\nWe believe that FFO and Normalized FFO provide useful information to investors because by excluding the effects of certain historical amounts, such as depreciation expense, FFO and Normalized FFO may facilitate a comparison of our operating performance between periods and with other REITs. FFO and Normalized FFO do not represent cash generated by operating activities in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered as alternatives to net income, net income attributable to Equity Commonwealth common shareholders or cash flow from operating activities, determined in accordance with GAAP, or as indicators of our financial performance or liquidity, nor are these measures necessarily indicative of sufficient cash flow to fund all of our needs. These measures should be considered in conjunction with net income, net income attributable to Equity Commonwealth common shareholders and cash flow from operating activities as presented in our consolidated statements of operations, consolidated statements of comprehensive income and consolidated statements of cash flows. Other REITs and real estate companies may calculate FFO and Normalized FFO differently than we do.\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of net income to FFO attributable to Equity Commonwealth common shareholders and unitholders and a calculation to Normalized FFO attributable to Equity Commonwealth common shareholders and unitholders (in thousands):\nTable 23: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Years Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Reconciliation to FFO: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income </td> <td>$ </td> <td>492,866 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>272,908 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>29,666 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Real estate depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>27,037 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>47,816 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>89,519 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss on asset impairment\n</td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12,087 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>19,714 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain on sale of properties, net </td> <td>(422,172) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(251,417) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(15,498) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>FFO attributable to Equity Commonwealth </td> <td>97,731 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>81,394 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>123,401 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Preferred distributions </td> <td>(7,988) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(7,988) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(7,988) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>FFO attributable to Equity Commonwealth common shareholders and unitholders </td> <td>$ </td> <td>89,743 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>73,406 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>115,413 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Reconciliation to Normalized FFO: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>FFO attributable to Equity Commonwealth common shareholders and unitholders </td> <td>$ </td> <td>89,743 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>73,406 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>115,413 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Lease value amortization </td> <td>(117) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>54 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,774 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Straight line rent adjustments </td> <td>(418) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(4,971) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(14,425) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss on early extinguishment of debt\n</td> <td>6,374 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,122 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>493 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss on sale of securities </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,987 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss on sale of real estate mortgage receivable </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,117 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income taxes related to gains on property sales </td> <td>142 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,726 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Normalized FFO attributable to Equity Commonwealth common shareholders and unitholders\n</td> <td>$ </td> <td>95,724 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>85,441 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>103,255 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nPROPERTY NET OPERATING INCOME (NOI)\nWe use property net operating income, or NOI, to evaluate the performance of our properties. We define NOI as income from our real estate including lease termination fees received from tenants less our property operating expenses. NOI excludes amortization of capitalized tenant improvement costs and leasing commissions and corporate level expenses.\nThe following table includes the reconciliation of NOI to net income, the most directly comparable financial measure under GAAP reported in our consolidated financial statements. We consider NOI to be an appropriate supplemental measure to net income because it helps to understand the operations of our properties. We use NOI internally to evaluate property level performance, and we believe that NOI provides useful information to investors regarding our results of operations because it reflects only those income and expense items that are incurred at the property level and may facilitate comparisons of our operating performance between periods and with other REITs. NOI does not represent cash generated by operating activities in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to net income, net income attributable to Equity Commonwealth common shareholders or cash flow from operating activities, determined in accordance with GAAP, or as an indicator of our financial performance or liquidity, nor is this measure necessarily indicative of sufficient cash flow to fund all of our needs. This measure should be considered in conjunction with net income, net income attributable to Equity Commonwealth common shareholders and cash flow from operating activities as presented in our consolidated statements of operations, consolidated statements of comprehensive income and consolidated statements of cash flows. Other REITs and real estate companies may calculate NOI differently than we do.\nA reconciliation of NOI to net income for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, is as follows (in thousands):\nTable 24: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Rental revenue </td> <td>$ </td> <td>116,869 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>184,368 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>324,415 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other revenue </td> <td>10,981 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12,654 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16,156 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating expenses </td> <td>(46,418) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(79,916) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(141,425) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>NOI </td> <td>$ </td> <td>81,432 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>117,106 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>199,146 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>NOI </td> <td>$ </td> <td>81,432 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>117,106 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>199,146 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization </td> <td>(28,122) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(49,041) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(90,708) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General and administrative </td> <td>(38,442) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(44,439) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(47,760) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss on asset impairment </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(12,087) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(19,714) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest and other income, net </td> <td>72,392 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>46,815 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>26,380 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense </td> <td>(8,908) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(26,585) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(52,183) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss on early extinguishment of debt </td> <td>(6,374) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(7,122) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(493) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain on sale of properties, net\n</td> <td>422,172 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>251,417 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15,498 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income before income taxes\n</td> <td>494,150 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>276,064 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>30,166 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax expense </td> <td>(1,284) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(3,156) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(500) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income </td> <td>$ </td> <td>492,866 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>272,908 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>29,666 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nOur critical accounting policies are those that will have the most impact on the reporting of our financial condition and results of operations and those requiring significant judgments and estimates.

Our most critical accounting policies involve our investments in real property. These policies affect our assessment of the carrying values and impairments of long lived assets.\nWe periodically evaluate our properties for possible impairments. Impairment indicators may include declining tenant occupancy, lack of progress releasing vacant space, tenant bankruptcies, low long term prospects for"}
