Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following information should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nIn addition to historical information, this report contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties which may cause our actual results to differ materially from plans and results discussed in forward-looking statements. We encourage you to review the risks and uncertainties discussed in the sections entitled Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d and Forward-Looking Statements\u201d included at the beginning of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The risks and uncertainties can cause actual results to differ significantly from those forecast in forward-looking statements or implied in historical results and trends.\nWe caution readers not to place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements made by us, which speak only as of the date they are made. We disclaim any obligation, except as specifically required by law and the rules of the SEC, to publicly update or revise any such statements to reflect any change in our expectations or in events, conditions or circumstances on which any such statements may be based, or that may affect the likelihood that actual results will differ from those set forth in the forward-looking statements.\nOverview\nWe are a biotechnology company committed to researching, developing, and commercializing potentially transformative gene therapies for severe genetic diseases and cancer. We have built an integrated product platform with broad therapeutic potential in a variety of indications based on our lentiviral gene addition platform, gene editing and cancer immunotherapy capabilities. Our severe genetic disease (\"SGD\") programs include beti-cel, LentiGlobin for SCD gene therapy, and eli-cel. Our programs in oncology are focused on developing novel T cell-based immunotherapies, including CAR and TCR T cell therapies. bb2121 (idecabtagene vicleucel, or ide-cel), and bb21217 are CAR-T cell product candidates for the treatment of multiple myeloma and partnered under our collaboration arrangement with BMS.\nWe are commercializing beti-cel as ZYNTEGLO in the EU and began to treat patients in the commercial context in the first quarter of 2021. However, in February 2021 we temporarily suspended marketing of ZYNTEGLO in light of safety events in the HGB-206 clinical study of LentiGlobin for SCD, which is manufactured using the same vector as ZYNTEGLO. Additionally, the EMA has paused the renewal procedure for ZYNTEGLO's conditional marketing authorization while the EMA's pharmacovigilance risk assessment committee reviews the risk-benefit assessment for ZYNTEGLO and determines whether any additional pharmacovigilance measures are necessary. We are engaged with the EMA in discussions regarding our proposed development plans for beti-cel as a treatment for patients with TDT who are less than 12 years of age and for patients who have a \u03b20/\u03b20 genotype. We are engaged with the FDA in discussions regarding our proposed development plans for beti-cel as a treatment for patients with TDT. Contingent upon successful resolution of the FDA's concerns arising out of the safety events in our SCD program, we currently expect to complete our BLA submission for beti-cel in mid-2021 for the treatment of patients with TDT across all genotypes, including non-\u03b20/\u03b20 and \u03b20/\u03b20 genotypes, and patients with TDT who are less than 12 years of age.\nBased on our prior discussions with the FDA, we believe that we may be able to seek accelerated approval for LentiGlobin for SCD in the United States on the basis of clinical data from Group C of our HGB-206 clinical study, with our HGB-210 clinical study providing confirmatory data for full approval. However, in light of a SUSAR of acute myeloid leukemia and a SUSAR of myelodysplastic syndrome in our HGB-206 clinical study, the FDA has placed our clinical studies of LentiGlobin for SCD on clinical hold. We are investigating these events and plan to continue to work closely with the FDA in their review of these events. In addition, we are also engaged with the EMA in discussions regarding our proposed development plans for LentiGlobin for SCD in Europe.\nIn October 2020, the EMA accepted our Marketing Authorization Application in the EU for eli-cel for the treatment of patients with CALD. Based on our discussions with the FDA, we believe that we may be able to seek approval for eli-cel for the treatment of patients with CALD on the basis of our clinical data from our ongoing Starbeam study, safety data from our ongoing ALD-104 study, and the completed ALD-103 observational study. We currently expect to submit the BLA for eli-cel for the treatment of patients with CALD in mid-2021.\nIn collaboration with BMS, we are developing ide-cel and the bb21217 product candidates as treatments for multiple myeloma. We are co-developing and co-promoting ide-cel in the United States with BMS and we have exclusively licensed to BMS the development and commercialization rights for ide-cel outside of the United States. In September 2020, the FDA accepted for Priority Review the BLA submitted by BMS for ide-cel as a treatment for relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma. We have exclusively licensed the development and commercialization rights for the bb21217 product candidate to BMS, with an option for us to elect to co-develop and co-promote bb21217 within the United States. In addition, we are\nindependently pursuing next-generation BCMA-targeting CAR-T approaches for treating multiple myeloma. Our other programs in oncology include preclinical programs to discover and develop T cell product candidates to treat other hematologic and solid tumor malignancies, including: non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, acute myeloid leukemia, MAGE-A4 positive solid tumors, and Merkel cell carcinoma.\nSince our inception in 1992, we have devoted substantially all of our resources to our development efforts relating to our product candidates, including activities to manufacture product candidates in compliance with good manufacturing practices, or GMP, to conduct clinical studies of our product candidates, to provide selling, general and administrative support for these operations and to protect our intellectual property. We have not generated any revenue from product sales. We have funded our operations primarily through the sale of common stock in our public offerings, private placements of preferred stock and warrants and through collaborations.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of approximately $1.27 billion. We have never been profitable and have incurred net losses in each year since inception. Our net losses were $618.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 and our accumulated deficit was $2.90 billion as of December 31, 2020. Substantially all of our net losses resulted from costs incurred in connection with our research and development programs and from selling, general and administrative costs associated with our operations. We expect to continue to incur significant expenses and operating losses for at least the next several years. We expect our expenses will increase substantially in connection with our ongoing and planned activities, as we:\n\u2022conduct clinical studies for our clinical programs in \u03b2-thalassemia, SCD, and ALD, fund our share of the costs of clinical studies for our program in multiple myeloma in collaboration with BMS, and advance our preclinical programs into clinical development;\n\u2022increase research and development-related activities for the discovery and development of product candidates in severe genetic diseases and oncology;\n\u2022manufacture clinical study materials and establish the infrastructure necessary to support and develop large-scale manufacturing capabilities to support commercialization of our product and any future products;\n\u2022seek regulatory approval for our product candidates;\n\u2022add personnel to support our product development and commercialization efforts;\n\u2022increase activities related to the commercialization of ZYNTEGLO in multiple markets in Europe, the potential commercial launch of beti-cel in the United States, and the potential commercial launches of additional late-stage product candidates in the United States and Europe; and\n\u2022incur costs related to the separation of our portfolio of programs and products in severe genetic disease and oncology into two separate, independent publicly traded companies.\nAs we seek to obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates and begin to commercialize ZYNTEGLO, we expect to incur significant commercialization expenses as we prepare for and begin product sales, marketing, commercial manufacturing, and distribution. Accordingly, until we generate significant revenues from product sales, we will seek to fund our operations through public or private equity or debt financings, strategic collaborations, or other sources. However, we may be unable to raise additional funds or enter into such other arrangements when needed on favorable terms or at all. Our failure to raise capital or enter into such other arrangements as and when needed would have a negative impact on our financial condition and our ability to develop our products.\nBecause of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with product development and commercialization, we are unable to predict the timing or amount of increased expenses or when or if we will be able to achieve or maintain profitability. Even if we are able to generate revenues from the sale of our products, we may not become profitable. If we fail to become profitable or are unable to sustain profitability on a continuing basis, then we may be unable to continue our operations at planned levels and be forced to reduce our operations.\nBusiness update\nBeginning in late 2019, the outbreak of a novel strain of coronavirus (COVID-19) has evolved into a global pandemic. As a result, we continue to experience disruptions and increased risk in our operations and those of third parties upon whom we rely, which may materially and adversely affect our business. These include disruptions and risks related to the conduct of our clinical trials, manufacturing, and commercialization efforts, as policies at various clinical sites and federal, state, local and foreign laws, rules and regulations continue to evolve, including quarantines, travel restrictions, and direction of healthcare resources toward pandemic response efforts. The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted the timing of patient treatment in the\ncommercial context, and the timing of our ongoing clinical studies, with the result of slower patient enrollment and treatment in our clinical studies and delays in post-treatment follow up visits, the impact of which has varied by clinical study and by program. It has also affected our activities with and operations at our third-party manufacturers. It is unknown how long these disruptions could continue. In addition, we expect the COVID-19 pandemic to delay our ability to achieve market access and reimbursement for ZYNTEGLO in Europe due to shifting priorities of the local authorities and healthcare system. As a result of the demands upon healthcare regulatory authorities, review, inspection, and other activities related to review of regulatory submissions in drug development may be impacted, and may result in delays for an unknown period of time.\nWe continue to evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 global pandemic on patients, healthcare providers and our employees, as well as our operations and the operations of our business partners and healthcare communities. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have implemented policies at our locations to mitigate the risk of exposure to COVID-19 by our personnel, including restrictions on the number of staff in any given research and development laboratory or manufacturing facility, a work-from-home policy applicable to the majority of our personnel, and a phased approach to bringing personnel back to our locations over time. Given the importance of supporting our patients, we are diligently working with our suppliers, healthcare providers and partners to provide patients with access to ZYNTEGLO, while taking into account regulatory, institutional, and government guidance, policies and protocols. Further, we are working with our clinical study sites to understand the duration and scope of the impact on enrollment, develop protocols to help mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, and other activities for our ongoing clinical studies. However, the ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business operations is highly uncertain and subject to change and will depend on future developments which are difficult to predict.\nWe expect our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $1.27 billion as of December 31, 2020, will be sufficient to fund planned operations for at least the next twelve months from the date of issuance of these financial statements, though we may pursue additional cash resources through public or private equity or debt financings or by establishing additional collaborations with other companies.\nIn January 2021, we announced our intent to separate our severe genetic disease and oncology programs into two separate, independent publicly traded companies, bluebird bio, Inc. and a new company, which we refer to as Oncology NewCo in this annual report on Form 10-K. bluebird bio, Inc. intends to retain focus on our severe genetic disease programs and Oncology NewCo is expected to focus on our oncology programs. The transaction is expected to be completed in late 2021 and is anticipated to be tax-free, subject to receipt of a favorable IRS ruling.\nFinancial operations overview\nRevenue\nTo date, we have not generated any revenues from the sale of products. Our revenues have been derived from collaboration arrangements, out-licensing arrangements, research fees, and grant revenues.\nTo date, revenue recognized under our collaborative arrangements has been primarily generated from our collaboration arrangement with BMS. The terms of the arrangement with respect to ide-cel contain multiple promised goods or services, which include at inception: (i) research and development services, (ii) a license to ide-cel, and (iii) manufacture of vectors and associated payload for incorporation into ide-cel under the license. As of September 2017, the collaboration also included the following promised goods or services with respect to bb21217: (i) research and development services, (ii) a license to bb21217, and (iii) manufacture of vectors and associated payload for incorporation into bb21217 under the license. We entered into an agreement with BMS to co-develop and co-promote ide-cel in March 2018, which was subsequently amended in May 2020, in which both parties will share equally in U.S. costs and profits. Revenue from our collaborative arrangements is recognized as the underlying performance obligations are satisfied.\nWe analyze our collaboration arrangements to assess whether they are within the scope of ASC 808, Collaborative Arrangements ( ASC 808\u201d) to determine whether such arrangements involve joint operating activities performed by parties that are both active participants in the activities and exposed to significant risks and rewards dependent on the commercial success of such activities. This assessment is performed throughout the life of the arrangement based on changes in the responsibilities of all parties in the arrangement. For collaboration arrangements within the scope of ASC 808, we first determine which elements of the collaboration are deemed to be within the scope of ASC 808 and those that are more reflective of a vendor-customer relationship and therefore within the scope of ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers ( Topic 606\u201d or \"ASC 606\"). For elements of collaboration arrangements that are accounted for pursuant to ASC 808, an appropriate recognition method is determined and applied consistently, generally by analogy to Topic 606. Amounts that are owed to collaboration partners are recognized as an offset to collaborative arrangement revenues as such amounts are incurred by the\ncollaboration partner. Where amounts owed to a collaboration partner exceed our collaborative arrangement revenues in a quarterly period, such amounts in excess are classified as research and development expense. For those elements of the arrangement that are accounted for pursuant to Topic 606, we apply the five-step model prescribed in Topic 606.\nEffective January 1, 2020, we adopted Accounting Standards Update (\"ASU\") No. 2018-18, Collaborative Arrangements (Topic 808): Clarifying the Interaction between Topic 808 and Topic 606 (\"ASU 2018-18\") on a retrospective basis. As a result, prior periods are presented in accordance with the new standard. Prior to the adoption of ASU 2018-18, we presented all revenue recognized under our collaborative arrangements as collaboration revenue on our consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss. However, as we recognize revenue under our collaborative arrangements both within and outside the scope of Topic 606, we have revised our presentation of revenue on our consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss as follows: service revenue includes revenue from collaborative partners recognized within the scope of Topic 606 and collaborative arrangement revenue includes only revenue from collaborative partners recognized outside the scope of Topic 606.\nNonrefundable license fees are recognized as revenue upon delivery of the license provided there are no unsatisfied performance obligations in the arrangement. License revenue has historically been generated from out-license agreements, under which we may also recognize revenue from potential future milestone payments and royalties.\nFor arrangements with licenses of intellectual property that include sales-based royalties, including milestone payments based on the level of sales, and the license is deemed to be the predominant item to which the royalties relate, we recognize revenue at the later of (i) when the related sales occur, or (ii) when the performance obligation to which the royalty has been allocated has been satisfied.\nResearch and development expenses\nResearch and development expenses consist primarily of costs incurred for the development of our product candidates, which include:\n\u2022employee-related expenses, including salaries, benefits, travel and stock-based compensation expense;\n\u2022expenses incurred under agreements with clinical research organizations ( CROs\u201d) and clinical sites that conduct our clinical studies;\n\u2022costs of acquiring, developing, and manufacturing inventory;\n\u2022reimbursable costs to our partners for collaborative activities;\n\u2022facilities, depreciation, and other expenses, which include direct and allocated expenses for rent and maintenance of facilities, information technology, insurance, and other supplies in support of research and development activities;\n\u2022costs associated with our research platform and preclinical activities;\n\u2022milestones and upfront license payments;\n\u2022costs associated with our regulatory, quality assurance and quality control operations; and\n\u2022amortization of certain intangible assets.\nResearch and development costs are expensed as incurred. Costs for certain development activities are recognized based on an evaluation of the progress to completion of specific tasks using information and data provided to us by our vendors and our clinical sites. We cannot determine with certainty the duration and completion costs of the current or future clinical studies of our product candidates or if, when, or to what extent we will generate revenues from the commercialization and sale of any of our product candidates that obtain regulatory approval. We may not succeed in achieving regulatory approval for all of our product candidates. The duration, costs, and timing of clinical studies and development of our product candidates will depend on a variety of factors, any of which could mean a significant change in the costs and timing associated with the development of our product candidates including:\n\u2022the scope, rate of progress, and expense of our ongoing as well as any additional clinical studies and other research and development activities we undertake;\n\u2022future clinical study results;\n\u2022uncertainties in clinical study enrollment rates;\n\u2022new manufacturing processes or protocols that we may choose to or be required to implement in the manufacture of our lentiviral vector or drug product;\n\u2022regulatory feedback on requirements for regulatory approval, as well as changing standards for regulatory approval; and\n\u2022the timing and receipt of any regulatory approvals.\nWe plan to increase our research and development expenses for the foreseeable future as we continue to advance the development of beti-cel, eli-cel, and LentiGlobin for SCD, conduct research and development activities in severe genetic diseases and oncology, fund our share of the costs of development of ide-cel and bb21217 (if we exercise our option to co-develop and co-commercialize this product candidate) in collaboration with BMS, and continue the research and discovery of product candidates using our gene editing technology platform. Our research and development expenses include expenses associated with the following activities:\n\u2022Northstar-2 Study (HGB-207) - a multi-site, international phase 3 study to examine the safety and efficacy of beti-cel in the treatment of patients with TDT and a non-\u03b20/\u03b20 genotype.\n\u2022Northstar-3 Study (HGB-212) - a multi-site, international phase 3 study to examine the safety and efficacy of beti-cel in the treatment of patients with TDT and a \u03b20/\u03b20 genotype or an IVS-I-110 mutation.\n\u2022HGB-206 study - a multi-site phase 1/2 study in the United States to study the safety and efficacy of LentiGlobin in the treatment of patients with SCD.\n\u2022HGB-210 study - our multi-site, international phase 3 study of LentiGlobin in patients with SCD and a history of vaso-occlusive events.\n\u2022Starbeam Study (ALD-102) - a multi-site, international phase 2/3 study to examine the safety and efficacy of eli-cel in the treatment of patients with CALD.\n\u2022ALD-104 study - our multi-site, international phase 3 study to examine the safety and efficacy of eli-cel after myeloablative conditioning using busulfan and fludarabine in the treatment of patients with CALD.\n\u2022CRB-401 study - an open label, single-arm, multi-center, phase 1 study to examine the safety and efficacy of ide-cel in the treatment of patients with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma.\n\u2022KarMMA study - an open label, single-arm, multi-center phase 2 study to examine the efficacy and safety of ide-cel in the treatment of patients with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma.\n\u2022KarMMa-2 study - a multi-cohort, open-label, multicenter phase 2 study to examine the safety and efficacy of ide-cel in the treatment of patients with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma and in high-risk multiple myeloma.\n\u2022KarMMa-3 study - a multicenter, randomized, open-label phase 3 study comparing the efficacy and safety of ide-cel versus standard triplet regimens in patients with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma.\n\u2022KarMMa-4 study -, a multi-cohort, open-label, multicenter phase 1 study intended to determine the optimal target dose and safety of ide-cel in subjects with newly-diagnosed multiple myeloma.\n\u2022CRB-402 study - an open label, single-arm, multicenter, phase 1 study to examine the safety and efficacy of the bb21217 product candidate in the treatment of patients with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma.\n\u2022We will continue to incur costs related to the manufacture of clinical study materials in support of our clinical studies.\nWe expect that the timing of investment in our ongoing clinical studies will reflect COVID-19 related delays in these studies.\nOur direct research and development expenses consist principally of external costs, such as fees paid to investigators, consultants, central laboratories and CROs in connection with our clinical studies, and costs related to acquiring and manufacturing clinical study materials. We allocate salary and benefit costs directly related to specific programs. We do not allocate personnel-related discretionary bonus or stock-based compensation costs, laboratory and related expenses, certain license and other collaboration costs, depreciation or other indirect costs that are deployed across multiple projects under development and, as such, the costs are separately classified as other research and development expenses in the table below:\nTable 11: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(in thousands) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>beti-cel(1)\n</td> <td>$ </td> <td>66,141 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>73,896 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>92,193 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>LentiGlobin for SCD </td> <td>58,862 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>50,796 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>32,865 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>eli-cel </td> <td>48,028 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>40,352 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>38,244 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>ide-cel </td> <td>105,240 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>121,182 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>75,667 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>bb21217 </td> <td>23,511 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>19,827 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15,624 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Preclinical programs </td> <td>45,888 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>49,700 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>50,115 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total direct research and development expense </td> <td>347,670 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>355,753 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>304,708 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Employee- and contractor-related expenses </td> <td>63,840 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>52,617 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>35,697 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Stock-based compensation expense </td> <td>72,239 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>80,139 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>54,422 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Laboratory and related expenses(2)\n</td> <td>16,689 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12,208 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,311 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>License and other collaboration expenses(2)\n</td> <td>15,285 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,021 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9,876 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Facility expenses </td> <td>67,464 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>67,274 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>32,158 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other expenses </td> <td>4,769 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,401 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,417 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total other research and development expenses </td> <td>240,286 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>226,660 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>143,881 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total research and development expense </td> <td>$ </td> <td>587,956 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>582,413 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>448,589 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1)Following our receipt of conditional approval for the marketing authorization of ZYNTEGLO by the European Commission in June 2019, all manufacturing costs associated with the production of LentiGlobin for use in the commercial sale of ZYNTEGLO in the European Union will be evaluated for capitalization as inventory on our consolidated balance sheets.\n(2)Prior to 2020, costs within these categories were disclosed as \"platform-related expenses.\"\nSelling, general and administrative expenses\nSelling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related costs for personnel, including stock-based compensation and travel expenses for our employees in executive, operational, finance, legal, business development, commercial, information technology, and human resource functions. Other selling, general and administrative expenses include facility-related costs, professional fees for accounting, tax, legal and consulting services, directors' fees and expenses associated with obtaining and maintaining patents.\nWe anticipate that our selling, general and administrative expenses, including payroll and sales and marketing expenses, will continue to increase in the future relative to current levels as we execute on our commercial launch plans in Europe for ZYNTEGLO, and perform commercial readiness activities in the United States for our product candidates.\nCost of royalty and other revenue\nCost of royalty and other revenue represents expense associated with amounts owed to third-party licensors as a result of revenue recognized under our out-license arrangements.\nChange in fair value of contingent consideration\nOn June 30, 2014, we acquired Precision Genome Engineering, Inc., or Pregenen. The agreement provided for up to $135.0 million in future contingent cash payments by us upon the achievement of certain preclinical, clinical and commercial milestones related to the Pregenen technology.\nAs of December 31, 2020, there are $120.0 million in future contingent cash payments, of which $20.1 million relates to clinical milestones and $99.9 million relates to commercial milestones. We estimate future contingent cash payments have a fair value of $1.5 million as of December 31, 2020, which are classified within other non-current liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet.\nInterest income, net\nFor the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, interest income, net consists primarily of interest income earned on investments. For the year ended December 31, 2018, interest income, net consisted primarily of interest income earned on investments and interest expense on the financing lease obligation for our headquarters at 60 Binney Street in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Upon adoption of ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) ( ASU 2016-02\u201d or ASC 842\u201d) on January 1, 2019, we de-recognized the financing lease obligation and, as a result, no longer recognize interest expense associated with the financing lease obligation.\nOther (expense) income, net\nOther (expense) income, net consists primarily of gains and losses on equity securities held by us, gains and losses on disposal of fixed assets, and gains and losses on foreign currency transactions.\nCritical accounting policies and significant judgments and estimates\nOur management's discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our financial statements. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and judgments, including expected business and operational changes, sensitivity and volatility associated with the assumptions used in developing estimates, and whether historical trends are expected to be representative of future trends. We base our estimates on historical experience, known trends and events and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. In making estimates and judgments, management employs critical accounting policies.\nWhile our significant accounting policies are described in more detail in the notes to our financial statements appearing elsewhere in this annual report, we believe the following accounting policies to be most critical to the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements.\nRevenue recognition\nRevenue recognition\nUnder Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, an entity recognizes revenue when its customer obtains control of promised goods or services, in an amount that reflects the consideration that the entity expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. To determine revenue recognition for arrangements that an entity determines are within the scope of Topic 606, the entity performs the following five steps: (i) identify the contract(s) with a customer; (ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (iii) determine the transaction price, including variable consideration, if any; (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (v) recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation. We only apply the five-step model to contracts when it is probable that the entity will collect the consideration to which it is entitled in exchange for the goods or services it transfers to the customer.\nOnce a contract is determined to be within the scope of Topic 606, we assess the goods or services promised within each contract and determine those that are performance obligations. Arrangements that include rights to additional goods or services that are exercisable at a customer's discretion are generally considered options. We assess if these options provide a material right to the customer and if so, they are considered performance obligations. The identification of material rights requires judgments related to the determination of the value of the underlying license relative to the option exercise price, including assumptions about technical feasibility and the probability of developing a candidate that would be subject to the option rights. The exercise of a material right is accounted for as a contract modification for accounting purposes.\nWe assess whether each promised good or service is distinct for the purpose of identifying the performance obligations in the contract. This assessment involves subjective determinations and requires management to make judgments about the individual promised goods or services and whether such are separable from the other aspects of the contractual relationship. Promised goods and services are considered distinct provided that: (i) the customer can benefit from the good or service either on its own or together with other resources that are readily available to the customer (that is, the good or service is capable of being distinct) and (ii) the entity's promise to transfer the good or service to the customer is separately identifiable from other promises in the contract (that is, the promise to transfer the good or service is distinct within the context of the contract). In assessing whether a promised good or service is distinct, we consider factors such as the research, manufacturing and\ncommercialization capabilities of the collaboration partner and the availability of the associated expertise in the general marketplace. We also consider the intended benefit of the contract in assessing whether a promised good or service is separately identifiable from other promises in the contract. If a promised good or service is not distinct, an entity is required to combine that good or service with other promised goods or services until it identifies a bundle of goods or services that is distinct.\nThe transaction price is then determined and allocated to the identified performance obligations in proportion to their standalone selling prices ( SSP\u201d) on a relative SSP basis. SSP is determined at contract inception and is not updated to reflect changes between contract inception and when the performance obligations are satisfied. Determining the SSP for performance obligations requires significant judgment. In developing the SSP for a performance obligation, we consider applicable market conditions and relevant entity-specific factors, including factors that were contemplated in negotiating the agreement with the customer and estimated costs. We validate the SSP for performance obligations by evaluating whether changes in the key assumptions used to determine the SSP will have a significant effect on the allocation of arrangement consideration between multiple performance obligations.\nIf the consideration promised in a contract includes a variable amount, we estimate the amount of consideration to which we will be entitled in exchange for transferring the promised goods or services to a customer. We determine the amount of variable consideration by using the expected value method or the most likely amount method. We include the unconstrained amount of estimated variable consideration in the transaction price. The amount included in the transaction price is constrained to the amount for which it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur. At the end of each subsequent reporting period, we re-evaluate the estimated variable consideration included in the transaction price and any related constraint, and if necessary, adjust our estimate of the overall transaction price. Any such adjustments are recorded on a cumulative catch-up basis in the period of adjustment.\nIf an arrangement includes development and regulatory milestone payments, we evaluate whether the milestones are considered probable of being reached and estimate the amount to be included in the transaction price using the most likely amount method. If it is probable that a significant revenue reversal would not occur, the associated milestone value is included in the transaction price. Milestone payments that are not within our control or the licensee's control, such as regulatory approvals, are generally not considered probable of being achieved until those approvals are received.\nFor arrangements with licenses of intellectual property that include sales-based royalties, including milestone payments based on the level of sales, and the license is deemed to be the predominant item to which the royalties relate, we recognize royalty revenue and sales-based milestones at the later of (i) when the related sales occur, or (ii) when the performance obligation to which the royalty has been allocated has been satisfied.\nIn determining the transaction price, we adjust consideration for the effects of the time value of money if the timing of payments provides us with a significant benefit of financing. We do not assess whether a contract has a significant financing component if the expectation at contract inception is such that the period between payment by the licensees and the transfer of the promised goods or services to the licensees will be one year or less. We assessed each of our revenue generating arrangements in order to determine whether a significant financing component exists and concluded that a significant financing component does not exist in any of our arrangements.\nWe then recognize as revenue the amount of the transaction price that is allocated to the respective performance obligation when (or as) each performance obligation is satisfied, either at a point in time or over time, and if over time recognition is based on the use of an output or input method.\nWe recognize revenue within the following financial statement captions:\nService revenue\nTo date, our service revenue has primarily been generated from the elements of our collaboration arrangement with BMS that are accounted for pursuant to Topic 606, using the five-step model described above. As discussed further below, we analyze our collaboration arrangement to assess whether they are within the scope of ASC 808, Collaborative Arrangements ( ASC 808\u201d) or Topic 606. For the elements of the arrangement which are more reflective of a vendor-customer relationship and therefore within the scope of Topic 606, we record the related revenue as service revenue on the consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss. Refer below for additional discussion around our policy for recognizing collaborative arrangement revenue and the determination of whether elements of a collaboration arrangement are within the scope of ASC 808 or Topic 606.\nCollaborative arrangement revenue\nTo date, collaborative arrangement revenue has been primarily generated from our collaboration arrangements with BMS and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (\"Regeneron\"), as further described in Note 11, Collaborative arrangements in the notes to consolidated financial statements.\nWe analyze our collaboration arrangements to assess whether they are within the scope of ASC 808 to determine whether such arrangements involve joint operating activities performed by parties that are both active participants in the activities and exposed to significant risks and rewards dependent on the commercial success of such activities. This assessment is performed throughout the life of the arrangement based on changes in the responsibilities of all parties in the arrangement. For collaboration arrangements within the scope of ASC 808 that contain multiple elements, we first determine which elements of the collaboration are deemed to be within the scope of ASC 808 and those that are more reflective of a vendor-customer relationship and therefore within the scope of Topic 606 (refer above for further discussion of the Company's policy for recognizing service revenue). For elements of collaboration arrangements that are accounted for pursuant to ASC 808, an appropriate recognition method is determined and applied consistently, generally by analogy to Topic 606. Amounts that are owed to collaboration partners are recognized as an offset to collaborative arrangement revenues as such amounts are incurred by the collaboration partner. Where amounts owed to a collaboration partner exceed our collaborative arrangement revenues in each quarterly period, such amounts are classified as research and development expense.\nThe recognition of service revenue and collaborative arrangement revenue (expense) require management judgment due to the fact that the terms of our collaboration arrangements are complicated and the nature of the collaborative activities change over time. This process includes the identification of costs that we incur that relate to each particular collaboration arrangement, evaluating the nature of these costs (for example, whether the costs relate to a particular geography or territory or whether the costs relate to clinical or commercial activities), and applying the terms of the respective collaborative arrangement to determine the portion of such costs that are the responsibility of the collaboration partner, which in certain circumstances requires significant judgment.\nLeases\nEffective January 1, 2019, we adopted ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), ( ASU 2016-02\u201d or ASC 842\u201d), using the required modified retrospective approach and utilizing the effective date as the date of initial application. As a result, prior periods are presented in accordance with the previous guidance in ASC 840, Leases ( ASC 840\u201d).\nAt the inception of an arrangement, we determine whether the arrangement is or contains a lease based on the unique facts and circumstances present in the arrangement. Leases with a term greater than one year are recognized on the balance sheet as right-of-use assets and short-term and long-term lease liabilities, as applicable. We do not have material financing leases.\nOperating lease liabilities and their corresponding right-of-use assets are initially recorded based on the present value of lease payments over the expected remaining lease term. Certain adjustments to the right-of-use asset may be required for items such as incentives received. The interest rate implicit in lease contracts is typically not readily determinable. As a result, we utilize our incremental borrowing rate to discount lease payments, which reflects the fixed rate at which we could borrow on a collateralized basis the amount of the lease payments in the same currency, for a similar term, in a similar economic environment. To estimate our incremental borrowing rate, a credit rating applicable to us is estimated using a synthetic credit rating analysis since we do not currently have a rating agency-based credit rating. Prospectively, we will adjust the right-of-use assets for straight-line rent expense or any incentives received and remeasure the lease liability at the net present value using the same incremental borrowing rate that was in effect as of the lease commencement or transition date.\nWe have elected not to recognize leases with an original term of one year or less on the balance sheet. We typically only includes an initial lease term in our assessment of a lease arrangement. Options to renew a lease are not included in our assessment unless there is reasonable certainty that we will renew.\nAssumptions that we made at the commencement date are re-evaluated upon occurrence of certain events, including a lease modification. A lease modification results in a separate contract when the modification grants the lessee an additional right of use not included in the original lease and when lease payments increase commensurate with the standalone price for the additional right of use. When a lease modification results in a separate contract, it is accounted for in the same manner as a new lease.\nASC 842 transition practical expedients and application of transition provisions to leases at the transition date\nWe elected the following practical expedients, which must be elected as a package and applied consistently to all of our leases at the transition date (including those for which we are a lessee or a lessor): i) we did not reassess whether any expired or existing contracts are or contain leases; ii) we did not reassess the lease classification for any expired or existing leases (that is, all existing leases that were classified as operating leases in accordance with ASC 840 are classified as operating leases, and all existing leases that were classified as capital leases in accordance with ASC 840 are classified as finance leases); and iii) we did not reassess initial direct costs for any existing leases.\nFor leases that existed prior to the date of initial application of ASC 842 (which were previously classified as operating leases), a lessee may elect to use either the total lease term measured at lease inception under ASC 840 or the remaining lease term as of the date of initial application of ASC 842 in determining the period for which to measure its incremental borrowing rate. In transition to ASC 842, we utilized the remaining lease term of its leases in determining the appropriate incremental borrowing rates.\nApplication of ASC 842 policy elections to leases post adoption\nWe have made certain policy elections to apply to our leases executed post adoption, or subsequent to January 1, 2019, as further described below.\nIn accordance with ASC 842, components of a lease should be split into three categories: lease components, non-lease components, and non-components. The fixed and in-substance fixed contract consideration (including any consideration related to non-components) must be allocated based on the respective relative fair values to the lease components and non-lease components.\nEntities may elect not to separate lease and non-lease components. Rather, entities would account for each lease component and related non-lease component together as a single lease component. We have elected to account for lease and non-lease components together as a single lease component for all underlying assets and allocate all of the contract consideration to the lease component only.\nASC 842 allows for the use of judgment in determining whether the assumed lease term is for a major part of the remaining economic life of the underlying asset and whether the present value of lease payments represents substantially all of the fair value of the underlying asset. We apply the bright line thresholds referenced in ASC 842-10-55-2 to assist in evaluating leases for appropriate classification. The aforementioned bright lines are applied consistently to our entire portfolio of leases.\nAccrued research and development expenses\nAs part of the process of preparing our financial statements, we are required to estimate our accrued expenses. This process involves reviewing open contracts and purchase orders, communicating with our personnel to identify services that have been performed on our behalf and estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred for the service when we have not yet been invoiced or otherwise notified of the actual cost. The majority of our service providers invoice us monthly in arrears for services performed or when contractual milestones are met. We make estimates of our accrued expenses as of each balance sheet date in our financial statements based on facts and circumstances known to us at that time.\nWe recognize expenses related to clinical studies based on our estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to contracts with multiple CROs that conduct and manage clinical studies on our behalf. The financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation, vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows. There may be instances in which payments made to our vendors will exceed the level of services provided and result in a prepayment of the clinical expense. Payments under some of these contracts depend on factors such as the successful enrollment of subjects and the completion of clinical study milestones. In accruing service fees, we estimate the time period over which services will be performed and the level of effort to be expended in each period and adjust accordingly.\nOther examples of estimated accrued research and development expenses include fees paid to:\n\u2022investigative sites in connection with clinical studies;\n\u2022vendors in connection with preclinical development activities; and\n\u2022vendors related to the development, manufacturing, and distribution of clinical trial materials.\nStock-based compensation\nWe issue stock-based awards to employees and non-employees, generally in the form of stock options and restricted stock units. We account for our stock-based awards in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718, Compensation-Stock Compensation, or ASC 718. ASC 718 requires all stock-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options and modifications to existing stock options, to be recognized in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss based on their fair values. Prior to the adoption of Accounting Standards Update ( ASU\u201d) No. 2018-07, Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Nonemployee Share-Based Payment Accounting ( ASU 2018-07\u201d), the measurement date for non-employee awards was generally the date the services are completed, resulting in financial reporting period adjustments to stock-based compensation during the vesting terms for changes in the fair value of the awards. After the adoption of ASU 2018-07, the measurement date for non-employee awards is the date of grant without changes in the fair value of the award. Stock-based compensation costs for non-employees are recognized as expense over the vesting period on a straight-line basis.\nOur stock-based awards are subject to either service or performance-based vesting conditions. Compensation expense related to awards to employees, non-employees, and directors, with service-based vesting conditions is recognized on a straight-line basis based on the grant date fair value over the associated service period of the award, which is generally the vesting term. Compensation expense related to awards to employees and non-employees with performance-based vesting conditions is recognized based on the grant date fair value over the requisite service period using the accelerated attribution method to the extent achievement of the performance condition is probable. We estimate the probability that certain performance criteria will be met and do not recognize compensation expense until it is probable that the performance-based vesting condition will be achieved.\nWe estimate the fair value of our stock-based awards to employees, non-employees, and directors, using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, which requires the input of subjective assumptions, including (i) the expected volatility of our stock, (ii) the expected term of the award, (iii) the risk-free interest rate, and (iv) expected dividends. Effective January 1, 2020, we eliminated the use of a representative peer group and use only our own historical volatility data in our estimate of expected volatility given that there is now a sufficient amount of historical information regarding the volatility of our own stock price. We estimate the expected life of our employee stock options using the simplified\u201d method, whereby, the expected life equals the average of the vesting term and the original contractual term of the option. The risk-free interest rates for periods within the expected life of the option were based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect during the period the options were granted.\nRecent accounting pronouncements\nSee Note 2, Summary of significant accounting policies and basis of presentation, in the notes to consolidated financial statements for a description of recent accounting pronouncements applicable to our business.\nResults of Operations\nComparison of the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019:\nTable 12: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(in thousands) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenue: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Service revenue </td> <td>$ </td> <td>114,064 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>30,729 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>83,335 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Collaborative arrangement revenue </td> <td>115,594 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,740 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>109,854 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Royalty and other revenue </td> <td>21,076 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,205 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12,871 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total revenues </td> <td>250,734 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>44,674 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>206,060 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating expenses: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Research and development </td> <td>587,956 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>582,413 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,543 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling, general and administrative </td> <td>286,896 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>271,362 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15,534 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of royalty and other revenue </td> <td>5,396 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,978 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,418 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Change in fair value of contingent consideration </td> <td>(6,468) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,747 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(9,215) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total operating expenses </td> <td>873,780 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>859,500 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14,280 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss from operations </td> <td>(623,046) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(814,826) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>191,780 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest income, net </td> <td>11,539 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>34,761 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(23,222) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other expense, net </td> <td>(6,502) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(10,088) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,586 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss before income taxes </td> <td>(618,009) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(790,153) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>172,144 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax (expense) benefit </td> <td>(686) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>545 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,231) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net loss </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(618,695) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(789,608) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>170,913 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenue. Total revenue was $250.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $44.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase of $206.1 million was primarily attributable to a cumulative catch-up adjustment to revenue recorded in connection with the May 2020 BMS contract modification, as well as an increase in royalty and other revenue primarily attributable to revenue recognized under an out-license agreement with Juno Therapeutics, Inc.\nResearch and development expenses. Research and development expenses were $588.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $582.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase of $5.5 million was primarily attributable to the following:\n\u2022$12.8 million of increased collaboration research funding costs, primarily due to an increase in collaboration costs incurred by BMS as a result of BMS assuming the contract manufacturing agreements relating to ide-cel adherent lentiviral vector under the May 2020 contract modification;\n\u2022$8.2 million of increased net employee compensation, benefit, and other headcount related expenses, which is primarily driven by an increase in headcount in the quality and manufacturing organizations to support overall growth and includes a $7.9 million decrease in stock-based compensation expense due to the recognition of expense on performance-based restricted stock units that vested in June 2019. Refer to Note 14, Stock-based compensation, in the notes to consolidated financial statements for discussion of stock-based compensation expense recognized on the performance-based restricted stock units;\n\u2022$7.0 million of increased license and milestone fees primarily due to a sublicense fee upon execution of the May 2020 BMS contract modification; and\n\u2022$5.3 million of increased consulting fees primarily related to the quality and manufacturing organizations.\nThese increased costs were partially offset by:\n\u2022$17.6 million of decreased material production and other platform costs, primarily due to BMS assuming the contract manufacturing agreements relating to ide-cel adherent lentiviral vector under the May 2020 contract modification;\n\u2022$7.0 million of decreased value-added taxes; and\n\u2022$2.1 million of decreased medical research costs.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses were $286.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $271.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase of $15.5 million was primarily due to the following:\n\u2022$14.7 million of increased employee compensation, benefit, and other headcount related expenses, which is primarily driven by an increase in headcount in the information technology and human resource organizations to support overall growth, including an increase of $3.9 million in stock-based compensation expense; and\n\u2022$10.6 million of increased information technology and facility-related costs primarily due to increased investment in software applications and technology.\nThese increased costs were partially offset by:\n\u2022$6.8 million of decreased costs related to commercial readiness activities due to delays in commercial launch activities during 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic; and\n\u2022$2.3 million of decreased consulting fees primarily related to commercial strategy and product marketing.\nCost of royalty and other revenue. Cost of royalty and other revenue was $5.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $3.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase is attributable to increased royalty revenue in the same periods.\nChange in fair value of contingent consideration. The change in fair value of contingent consideration was primarily due to the change in significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of contingent consideration, including the probabilities of successful achievement of clinical and commercial milestones and discount rates.\nInterest income, net. The decrease in interest income, net was primarily related to decreased interest income earned on investments due to an overall decrease in interest rates.\nOther expense, net. The decrease in other expense, net was primarily related to changes in fair value on equity securities.\nComparison of the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018:\nTable 13: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(in thousands) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenue: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Service revenue </td> <td>$ </td> <td>30,729 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>44,533 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(13,804) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Collaborative arrangement revenue </td> <td>5,740 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,820 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2,080) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Royalty and other revenue </td> <td>8,205 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,226 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,979 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total revenues </td> <td>44,674 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>54,579 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(9,905) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating expenses: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Research and development </td> <td>582,413 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>448,589 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>133,824 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling, general and administrative </td> <td>271,362 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>174,129 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>97,233 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of royalty and other revenue </td> <td>2,978 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>885 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,093 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Change in fair value of contingent consideration </td> <td>2,747 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,999 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(252) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total operating expenses </td> <td>859,500 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>626,602 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>232,898 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss from operations </td> <td>(814,826) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(572,023) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(242,803) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest income, net </td> <td>34,761 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14,624 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>20,137 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other (expense) income, net </td> <td>(10,088) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,961 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(12,049) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss before income taxes </td> <td>(790,153) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(555,438) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(234,715) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax benefit (expense) </td> <td>545 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(187) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>732 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net loss </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(789,608) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(555,625) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(233,983) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenue. Total revenue was $44.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $54.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The decrease of $9.9 million was primarily attributable to a decrease in service revenue recognized for the ide-cel license and manufacturing services under our agreement with BMS. This decrease was partially offset by an\nincrease in royalty and other revenue and an increase in collaborative arrangement revenue under our agreement with Regeneron.\nResearch and development expenses. Research and development expenses were $582.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $448.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase of $133.8 million was primarily attributable to the following:\n\u2022$66.1 million of increased employee compensation, benefit, and other headcount related expenses, which is primarily driven by an increase in research and development headcount to support overall growth, including an increase of $25.7 million in stock-based compensation expense. Refer to Note 14, Stock-based compensation, in the notes to consolidated financial statements for discussion of stock-based compensation expense recognized on the performance-based restricted stock units;\n\u2022$34.8 million of increased IT and facility related costs, which includes the impact of adopting ASU 2016-02;\n\u2022$26.3 million of increased collaboration research funding costs;\n\u2022$13.1 million of increased laboratory expenses, material production, and other platform costs;\n\u2022$9.7 million of increased research consulting and medical research costs; and\n\u2022$3.6 million of increased clinical trial costs.\nThese increased costs were partially offset by $20.6 million of decreased license and milestone fees.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses were $271.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $174.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase of approximately $97.2 million was primarily due to the following:\n\u2022$65.3 million of increased employee compensation, benefit, and other headcount related expenses, which is primarily driven by an increase in selling, general, and administrative headcount to support overall growth, including an increase of $24.1 million in stock-based compensation expense. Refer to Note 14, Stock-based compensation, in the notes to consolidated financial statements for discussion of stock-based compensation expense recognized on the performance-based restricted stock units;\n\u2022$18.4 million of increased costs related to commercial-readiness activities; and\n\u2022$13.2 million of increased consulting fees.\nCost of royalty and other revenue. Cost of royalty and other revenue was $3.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $0.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase is attributable to increased royalty revenue in the same periods.\nChange in fair value of contingent consideration. The change in fair value of contingent consideration was primarily due to the change in significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of contingent consideration, including the probabilities of successful achievement of clinical and commercial milestones and discount rates.\nInterest income, net. The change in interest income, net was primarily related to increased interest income earned on investments, as well as a decrease in interest expense incurred due to the de-recognition of the financing lease obligation associated with our corporate headquarters at 60 Binney Street related to the adoption of ASU 2016-02 on January 1, 2019.\nOther (expense) income, net. The change in other (expense) income, net was primarily related to changes in fair value on equity securities.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of approximately $1.27 billion. We expect our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities will be sufficient to fund planned operations for at least the next twelve months from the date of issuance of these financial statements, though we may pursue additional cash resources through public or private equity or debt financings or by establishing additional collaborations with other companies. Cash in excess of immediate requirements is invested in accordance with our investment policy, primarily with a view to liquidity and capital preservation. As of December 31, 2020, our funds are primarily held in U.S. government agency securities and treasuries, equity securities, corporate bonds, commercial paper, and money market accounts.\nWe have incurred losses and cumulative negative cash flows from operations since our inception in April 1992, and as of December 31, 2020, we had an accumulated deficit of $2.90 billion. We expect that our research and development and selling, general and administrative expenses will continue to increase and, as a result, we will need additional capital to fund our operations, which we may raise through public or private equity or debt financings, strategic collaborations, or other sources. The likelihood of our long-term success must be considered in light of the expenses, difficulties, and potential delays to be encountered in the development and commercialization of new pharmaceutical products, competitive factors in the marketplace and the complex regulatory environment in which we operate. We may never achieve significant revenue or profitable operations.\nWe have funded our operations principally from the sale of common stock in public offerings and through our collaborations with BMS and Regeneron as outlined below:\n\u2022In January 2018, we sold 0.3 million shares of common stock pursuant to the partial exercise of an overallotment option granted to the underwriters in connection with the December 2017 underwritten public offering at a price of $185.00 per share for aggregate net proceeds of $48.7 million.\n\u2022In July 2018, we sold 3.9 million shares of common stock through an underwritten public offering at a price of $162.50 per share for aggregate net proceeds to us of $600.6 million.\n\u2022In August 2018, we sold 0.4 million shares of common stock to Regeneron in connection with our collaboration arrangement at a price of $238.10 per share for aggregate net proceeds to us of $100.0 million, of which $45.5 million was attributed to a prepayment of joint research activities. See Note 11, Collaborative arrangements, in the notes to consolidated financial statements for more information.\n\u2022In May 2020, we entered into the First Amendment to the Amended and Restated Co-Development, Co-Promote and Profit Share Agreement (as amended, the Amended Ide-cel CCPS\u201d) and the Second Amended and Restated bb21217 License Agreement ( Amended bb21217 License Agreement\u201d) with BMS pursuant to which BMS modified its obligations to pay us for future ex-U.S. milestones and royalties on commercial sales by making a one-time up-front payment of $200.0 million. See Note 11, Collaborative arrangements, in the notes to consolidated financial statements for more information.\n\u2022In May 2020, we sold 10.5 million shares of common stock (inclusive of shares sold pursuant to an option granted to the underwriters in connection with the offering) through an underwritten public offering at a price of $55.00 per share for aggregate net proceeds of $541.5 million.\nSources of Liquidity\nCash Flows\nThe following table summarizes our cash flow activity:\nTable 14: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(in thousands) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash used in operating activities </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(470,351) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(564,384) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(413,426) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities </td> <td>(84,345) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>507,807 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(679,435) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by financing activities </td> <td>546,715 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>21,187 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>737,692 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Decrease in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(7,981) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(35,390) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(355,169) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating Activities.

Net cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $84.3 million and was primarily due to the purchase of $1.00 billion of marketable securities and the purchase of $29.0 million of property, plant and equipment offset by proceeds from the maturities of available-for-sale marketable securities of $918.3 million.\nNet cash provided by investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $507.8 million and was primarily due to proceeds from the maturities of available-for-sale marketable securities of $1.34 billion offset by the purchase of $756.6 million of marketable securities and the purchase of $71.0 million of property, plant and equipment.\nNet cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $679.4 million and was primarily due to the purchase of $1.52 billion of marketable securities and the purchase of $55.7 million of property, plant and equipment offset by proceeds from the maturities of available-for-sale marketable securities of $894.3 million.\nFinancing Activities: Net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $546.7 million and was primarily due to net cash proceeds from our May 2020 common stock offering, as well as employee option exercises and ESPP contributions.\nNet cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $21.2 million and was primarily due to net cash proceeds from employee option exercises and ESPP contributions.\nNet cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $737.7 million and was primarily due to net cash proceeds from our January 2018 and July 2018 common stock offerings, as well as our issuance of common stock to Regeneron and employee option exercises and ESPP contributions.\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nLease commitments\n60 Binney Street lease\nIn September 2015, we entered into a lease agreement for office and laboratory space located at 60 Binney Street, Cambridge, Massachusetts. Under the terms of the lease, starting on October 1, 2016, we leased approximately 253,108 square feet of office and laboratory space at $72.50 per square foot per year, or $18.4 million per year in base rent, which is subject to scheduled annual rent increases of 1.75% plus certain operating expenses and taxes. The Company currently maintains a $13.8 million collateralized letter of credit and, subject to the terms of the lease and certain reduction requirements specified therein, including market capitalization requirements, this amount may decrease to $9.2 million over time. The lease will continue until March 31, 2027. Pursuant to a work letter entered into in connection with the lease, the landlord contributed an aggregate of $42.4 million toward the cost of construction and tenant improvements for the building.\n50 Binney Street sublease\nIn April 2019, we entered into a sublease agreement for office space located at 50 Binney Street in Cambridge, Massachusetts (the 50 Binney Street Sublease\u201d) to supplement our corporate headquarters located at 60 Binney Street in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Under the terms of the 50 Binney Street Sublease, we will lease 267,278 square feet of office space for $99.95 per square foot, or $26.7 million per year in base rent subject to certain operating expenses, taxes and annual rent increases of approximately 3%. The lease will commence when the space is available for use, which is anticipated to be in the first half of 2022, which reflects the sublessor's exercise of its option to postpone the commencement date of the sublease, and end on December 31, 2030, unless other conditions specified in the 50 Binney Street Sublease occur. Upon signing the 50 Binney Street Sublease, we executed a $40.1 million cash-collateralized letter of credit, which may be reduced in the future subject to the terms of the 50 Binney Street Sublease and certain reduction requirements specified therein. The $40.1 million of cash collateralizing the letter of credit is classified as restricted cash and other non-current assets on our consolidated balance sheets. Payments will commence at the earlier of (i) the date which is 90 days following the commencement date and (ii) the date we take occupancy of all or any portion of the premises. In connection with the execution of the 50 Binney Street Sublease, we also entered into a Purchase Agreement for furniture and equipment (the Furniture Purchase Agreement\u201d) located on the premises upon lease commencement. Upon execution of the Furniture Purchase Agreement, we made an upfront payment of $7.5 million, all of which was recorded within restricted cash and other non-current assets on our consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2020.\nSeattle, Washington leases\nIn July 2018, we entered into a lease agreement for office and laboratory space located in a portion of a building in Seattle, Washington. The lease was amended in October 2018 to increase the total rentable space to approximately 36,126 square feet at $54.00 per square foot in base rent per year, which is subject to scheduled annual rent increases of 2.5% plus certain operating expenses and taxes. The lease commenced on January 1, 2019 and the lease term will continue through January 31, 2027. The Company moved into the facility in June 2019. The lease allowed for a tenant improvement allowance of up to $215.00 per square foot, or approximately $8.0 million. We utilized the $8.0 million tenant improvement allowance and it has been fully reimbursed by the landlord as of December 31, 2020.\nIn September 2019, we entered into a second amendment to the lease (the Second Amendment\u201d). The Second Amendment added approximately 22,188 square feet to the existing space and extended the lease term of the entire premises by 16 months, or until April 2028. Fixed monthly rent for the expanded space will be incurred at a rate of $62.80 per square foot per year beginning in January 2021, subject to annual increases of 2.5%. The Second Amendment includes a five-year option to extend the term. In September 2020, the Company entered into a sublease agreement for the 22,188 square feet added under the Second Amendment at a fixed monthly rent of $62.80 per square foot per year beginning in January 2021, subject to annual increases of 2.5%. The sublease term will continue through April 2028.\nEmbedded leases\nIn June 2016, we entered into a manufacturing agreement for the future commercial production of our beti-cel and eli-cel drug products with a contract manufacturing organization. Under this 12-year agreement, the contract manufacturing organization will complete the design, construction, validation and process validation of the leased suites prior to anticipated commercial launch of the product candidates. During construction, we paid $12.0 million upon the achievement of certain contractual milestones. We paid $5.0 million for the achievement of the first and second contractual milestones during 2016 and paid $5.5 million for the third and fourth contractual milestones achieved during 2017. In March 2018, $1.5 million of the possible $2.0 million related to the fifth contractual milestone was achieved and was paid in the second quarter of 2018. Given that construction was completed in March 2018, beginning in April 2018 we will pay $5.1 million per year in fixed suite fees as well as certain fixed labor, raw materials, testing and shipping costs for manufacturing services.\nWe may terminate this agreement at any time upon payment of a one-time termination fee and up to 24 months of fixed suite and labor fees. We concluded that this agreement contains an embedded lease as the suites are designated for our exclusive use during the term of the agreement. We concluded that we are not the deemed owner during construction nor is it a capital lease under ASC 840-10, Leases - Overall. As a result, in prior periods we accounted for the agreement as an operating lease under ASC 840 and recognized straight-line rent expense over the non-cancellable term of the embedded lease. As part of our adoption of ASC 842, effective January 1, 2019, we carried forward the existing lease classification under ASC 840. Additionally, we recorded a right-of-use asset and lease liability for this operating lease on the effective date and are recognizing rent expense on a straight-line basis throughout the remaining term of the embedded lease.\nIn November 2016, we entered into an agreement for clinical and commercial production of our ZYNTEGLO, LentiGlobin for SCD, and eli-cel drug products with a contract manufacturing organization at an existing facility. We concluded that this agreement contains an embedded operating lease as the clean rooms are designated for our exclusive use during the term of the agreement. The term of the agreement is five years with subsequent three-year renewals at the mutual option of each party. As a result, we recorded a right-of-use asset and lease liability for this operating lease on the effective date of ASC 842, and are recognizing rent expense on a straight-line basis throughout the estimated remaining term of the embedded lease. In March 2020, we amended this agreement with the contract manufacturing organization, resulting in a lease modification. Under the terms of the amended arrangement, we may be required to pay annual maintenance and production fees of up to \u20ac16.5 million, depending on its production needs, and may terminate this agreement with twelve months' notice and a one-time termination fee. The amendment also provides for an option to reserve an additional clean room for a one-time option fee plus annual maintenance fees. As a result, we increased the right-of-use asset and lease liability related to this embedded operating lease during the first quarter of 2020.\nIn July 2020, we entered into an agreement reserving manufacturing capacity with a contract manufacturing organization. We concluded that this agreement contains an embedded lease as a controlled environment room at the facility is designated for our exclusive use during the term of the agreement, with the option to sublease the space if we provide notice that we will not utilize it for a specified duration of time. Under the terms of the agreement, we will be required to pay up to $5.4 million per year in maintenance fees in addition to the cost of any services provided and may terminate this agreement with eighteen months' notice. The term of the agreement is five years, with the option to extend, and is expected to commence in the first half of 2021.\nContingent Consideration Related to Business Combinations\nIn connection with the Pregenen acquisition, we agreed to make contingent cash payments to the former equityholders of Pregenen. In accordance with accounting guidance for business combinations, these contingent cash payments are recorded as contingent consideration liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets at fair value. During the second quarter of 2017, a $5.0 million preclinical milestone was achieved, which resulted in a $5.0 million payment to the former equityholders of Pregenen during the third quarter of 2017. The aggregate remaining undiscounted amount of contingent consideration potentially payable is $120.0 million. As of December 31, 2020, and 2019, $1.5 million and $8.0 million, respectively, is reflected as a non-current liability in the consolidated balance sheet, which represents the fair value of our contingent consideration obligations as of this date.\nContingent Milestone and Royalty Payments\nWe also have obligations to make future payments to third parties that become due and payable on the achievement of certain development, regulatory and commercial milestones (such as the start of a clinical trial, filing of a BLA, approval by the FDA or product launch). We do not recognize these commitments in our financial statements until they become payable or have been paid.\nBased on our development plans as of December 31, 2020, we may be obligated to make future development, regulatory and commercial milestone payments and royalty payments on future sales of specified products associated with our collaboration and license agreements. Payments under these agreements generally become due and payable upon achievement of such milestones or sales. Because the achievement of these milestones or sales had not occurred as of December 31, 2020, such contingencies have not been recorded in our financial statements. Amounts related to contingent milestone payments and sales-based royalties are not yet considered contractual obligations as they are contingent upon success.\n\u2022Under a license agreement with Inserm-Transfert pursuant to which we license certain patents and know-how for use in adrenoleukodystrophy therapy, we will be required to make payments based upon development, regulatory and commercial milestones for any products covered by the in-licensed intellectual property. The maximum aggregate payments we may be obligated to pay for each of these milestone categories per product is \u20ac0.3, \u20ac0.2 and \u20ac1.6 million, respectively. We will also be required to pay a royalty on net sales of products covered by the in-licensed intellectual property in the low single digits. The royalty is subject to reduction for any third-party payments required to be made, with a minimum floor in the low single digits.\n\u2022Under a license agreement with Institut Pasteur pursuant to which we license certain patents for use in ex vivo gene therapy, we will be required to make payments per product covered by the in-licensed intellectual property upon the achievement of development and regulatory milestones, depending on the indication and the method of treatment. The maximum aggregate payments we may be obligated to pay for each of these milestone categories per product is \u20ac1.5 and \u20ac2.0 million, respectively. We will also be required to pay a royalty on net sales of products covered by the in-licensed intellectual property in the low single digits, which varies slightly depending on the indication of the product. We have the right to sublicense our rights under this agreement, and we will be required to pay a percentage of such license income varying from the low single digits to mid-range double digits depending on the nature of the sublicense and stage of development. We are required to make an annual maintenance payment, which is creditable against royalty payments on a year-by-year basis. On April 1, 2015, we amended this license agreement with Institut Pasteur, which resulted in a payment of \u20ac3.0 million that was paid during the second quarter of 2015. During the year ended December 31, 2020 we paid Institut Pasteur \u20ac7.3 million in connection with amounts owed to us by sublicensees.\n\u2022Under a license agreement with the Board of Trustees of the Leland Stanford Junior University, or Stanford, pursuant to which we license the HEK293T cell line for use in gene therapy products, we are required to pay a royalty on net sales of products covered by the in-licensed intellectual property in the low single digits that varies with net sales. The royalty is reduced for each third-party license that requires payments by us with respect to a licensed product, provided that the royalty to Stanford is not less than a specified percentage that is less than one percent. We have been paying Stanford an annual maintenance fee, which will be creditable against our royalty payments.\n\u2022Under a license agreement with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, or MIT, pursuant to which we license various patents, we will be required to make a payment of $0.1 million based upon a regulatory filing milestone. We will also be required to pay a royalty on net sales of products covered by the in-licensed intellectual property by us or our sublicensees. The royalty is in the low single digits and is reduced for royalties payable to third parties, provided that the royalty to MIT is not less than a specified percentage that is less than one percent. We have the right to sublicense our rights under this agreement, and we will be required to pay a percentage of such license income varying\nfrom the mid-single digits to low double digits. We are required to pay MIT an annual maintenance fee based on net sales of licensed products, which is creditable against our royalty payments.\n\u2022Under a license agreement with Research Development Foundation pursuant to which we license patents that involve lentiviral vectors, we will be required to make payments of $1.0 million based upon a regulatory milestone for each product covered by the in-licensed intellectual property. We will also be required to pay a royalty on net sales of products covered by the in-licensed intellectual property in the low single digits, which is reduced by half if during the ten years following first marketing approval the last valid claim within the licensed patent that covers the licensed product expires or ends.\n\u2022Under a license agreement with Biogen Inc., pursuant to which we license certain patents and patent applications related to our ide-cel and bb21217 product candidates, we will be required to make certain payments related to certain development milestone obligations and must report on our progress in achieving these milestones on a periodic basis. We may be obligated to pay up to $23.0 million in the aggregate for each licensed product upon the achievement of remaining milestones. Upon commercialization of our products covered by the in-licensed intellectual property, we will be obligated to pay a percentage of net sales as a royalty in the low single digits.\n\u2022Under a license agreement with the National Institutes of Health, or NIH, pursuant to which we license certain patent applications related to our ide-cel and bb21217 product candidates, we have agreed to certain development and regulatory milestone obligations and must report on our progress in achieving these milestones on a periodic basis. We may be obligated to pay up to $9.7 million in the aggregate for a licensed product upon the achievement of these milestones. Upon commercialization of our products covered by the in-licensed intellectual property, we will be obligated to pay NIH a percentage of net sales as a royalty in the low single digits. The royalties payable under this license agreement are subject to reduction for any third-party payments required to be made, with a minimum floor in the low single digits. During the year ended December 31, 2020 we paid NIH $1.0 million upon milestones reached for a product covered by in-licensed intellectual property.\n\u2022Under a license agreement with SIRION Biotech GmbH, or Sirion, pursuant to which we license certain patents directed to manufacturing related to our LentiGlobin product candidate, we will be required to make certain payments related to certain development milestone obligations and must report on our progress in achieving these milestones on a periodic basis. We may be obligated to pay up to $13.4 million in the aggregate for each product covered by the in-licensed intellectual property. Upon commercialization of our products covered by the in-licensed intellectual property, we will be obligated to pay Sirion a percentage of net sales as a royalty in the low single digits. The royalties payable under this license agreement are subject to reduction for any third-party payments required to be made, with a minimum floor in the low single digits.\nOther Funding Commitments\nWe enter into contracts in the normal course of business with CROs for preclinical research studies and clinical trials, research supplies and other services and products for operating purposes. We have also entered into multi-year agreements with manufacturing partners in the United States and Europe (Brammer Bio, now part of Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc., Novasep, now part of Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc., and SAFC Carlsbad, Inc., or SAFC, a subsidiary of MilliporeSigma), which are partnering with us on production of lentiviral vector across all of our programs. In addition, we have entered into multi-year agreements with Lonza Houston, Inc. and apceth Biopharma, or apceth, to produce drug product for Lenti-D, LentiGlobin and bb21217. Currently, SAFC is the sole manufacturer of the lentiviral vector and apceth is the sole manufacturer of the drug product to support commercialization of ZYNTEGLO in Europe for the treatment of TDT. In our manufacturing agreement with SAFC, we are required to provide rolling forecasts for products on a quarterly basis, a portion of which will be considered a binding, firm order, subject to a purchase commitment. In our manufacturing agreement with apceth, we reserve production capacity for the manufacture of our drug product. BMS manufactures drug product for ide-cel. Our total non-cancelable contractual obligations arising from these manufacturing agreements is $96.5 million, with $83.9 million of these obligations due within the next twelve months. We believe our team of technical personnel has extensive manufacturing, analytical and quality experience as well as strong project management discipline to effectively oversee these contract manufacturing and testing activities, and to compile manufacturing and quality information for our regulatory submissions and potential commercial launch. We are engaging with apheresis and infusion centers, which we refer to as qualified treatment centers, that will be the centers for collection of HSCs from the patient and for infusion of drug product to the patient. For the treatment of patients with our drug product in the commercial setting, we are entering into agreements with participating qualified treatment centers in the jurisdictions where we plan to commercialize our products. These contracts generally provide for termination on notice. Wherever contracts include stipulated commitment payments, we have included such payments in the table of contractual obligations and commitments.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs of December 31, 2020, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements as defined in the rules and regulations of the SEC.", "summary": "- Revenue is recognized under collaborative arrangements when the performance obligation is satisfied, which is generally upon the sale of the related product.\n- Service revenue includes revenue from collaborative partners recognized within the scope of Topic 606 and collaborative arrangement revenue includes only revenue from collaborative partners recognized outside the scope of Topic 606.\n- We recognize revenue within the following financial statement captions: service revenue and collaborative arrangement revenue.\n- Total revenue was $250.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $44.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019.\n- The increase of $206.1 million was primarily attributable to a cumulative catch-up adjustment to revenue recorded in connection with the May 2020 BMS contract modification, as well as an increase in royalty and other revenue primarily attributable to revenue recognized under an out-license agreement with Juno Therapeutics, Inc.\n- Research and development expenses were $588.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $582.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019.\n- The increase of $5.5 million was primarily attributable to the following: $12.",

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following information should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nIn addition to historical information, this report contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties which may cause our actual results to differ materially from plans and results discussed in forward-looking statements. We encourage you to review the risks and uncertainties discussed in the sections entitled Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d and Forward-Looking Statements\u201d included at the beginning of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The risks and uncertainties can cause actual results to differ significantly from those forecast in forward-looking statements or implied in historical results and trends.\nWe caution readers not to place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements made by us, which speak only as of the date they are made. We disclaim any obligation, except as specifically required by law and the rules of the SEC, to publicly update or revise any such statements to reflect any change in our expectations or in events, conditions or circumstances on which any such statements may be based, or that may affect the likelihood that actual results will differ from those set forth in the forward-looking statements.\nOverview\nWe are a biotechnology company committed to researching, developing, and commercializing potentially transformative gene therapies for severe genetic diseases and cancer. We have built an integrated product platform with broad therapeutic potential in a variety of indications based on our lentiviral gene addition platform, gene editing and cancer immunotherapy capabilities. Our severe genetic disease (\"SGD\") programs include beti-cel, LentiGlobin for SCD gene therapy, and eli-cel. Our programs in oncology are focused on developing novel T cell-based immunotherapies, including CAR and TCR T cell therapies. bb2121 (idecabtagene vicleucel, or ide-cel), and bb21217 are CAR-T cell product candidates for the treatment of multiple myeloma and partnered under our collaboration arrangement with BMS.\nWe are commercializing beti-cel as ZYNTEGLO in the EU and began to treat patients in the commercial context in the first quarter of 2021. However, in February 2021 we temporarily suspended marketing of ZYNTEGLO in light of safety events in the HGB-206 clinical study of LentiGlobin for SCD, which is manufactured using the same vector as ZYNTEGLO. Additionally, the EMA has paused the renewal procedure for ZYNTEGLO's conditional marketing authorization while the EMA's pharmacovigilance risk assessment committee reviews the risk-benefit assessment for ZYNTEGLO and determines whether any additional pharmacovigilance measures are necessary. We are engaged with the EMA in discussions regarding our proposed development plans for beti-cel as a treatment for patients with TDT who are less than 12 years of age and for patients who have a \u03b20/\u03b20 genotype. We are engaged with the FDA in discussions regarding our proposed development plans for beti-cel as a treatment for patients with TDT. Contingent upon successful resolution of the FDA's concerns arising out of the safety events in our SCD program, we currently expect to complete our BLA submission for beti-cel in mid-2021 for the treatment of patients with TDT across all genotypes, including non-\u03b20/\u03b20 and \u03b20/\u03b20 genotypes, and patients with TDT who are less than 12 years of age.\nBased on our prior discussions with the FDA, we believe that we may be able to seek accelerated approval for LentiGlobin for SCD in the United States on the basis of clinical data from Group C of our HGB-206 clinical study, with our HGB-210 clinical study providing confirmatory data for full approval. However, in light of a SUSAR of acute myeloid leukemia and a SUSAR of myelodysplastic syndrome in our HGB-206 clinical study, the FDA has placed our clinical studies of LentiGlobin for SCD on clinical hold. We are investigating these events and plan to continue to work closely with the FDA in their review of these events. In addition, we are also engaged with the EMA in discussions regarding our proposed development plans for LentiGlobin for SCD in Europe.\nIn October 2020, the EMA accepted our Marketing Authorization Application in the EU for eli-cel for the treatment of patients with CALD. Based on our discussions with the FDA, we believe that we may be able to seek approval for eli-cel for the treatment of patients with CALD on the basis of our clinical data from our ongoing Starbeam study, safety data from our ongoing ALD-104 study, and the completed ALD-103 observational study. We currently expect to submit the BLA for eli-cel for the treatment of patients with CALD in mid-2021.\nIn collaboration with BMS, we are developing ide-cel and the bb21217 product candidates as treatments for multiple myeloma. We are co-developing and co-promoting ide-cel in the United States with BMS and we have exclusively licensed to BMS the development and commercialization rights for ide-cel outside of the United States. In September 2020, the FDA accepted for Priority Review the BLA submitted by BMS for ide-cel as a treatment for relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma. We have exclusively licensed the development and commercialization rights for the bb21217 product candidate to BMS, with an option for us to elect to co-develop and co-promote bb21217 within the United States. In addition, we are\nindependently pursuing next-generation BCMA-targeting CAR-T approaches for treating multiple myeloma. Our other programs in oncology include preclinical programs to discover and develop T cell product candidates to treat other hematologic and solid tumor malignancies, including: non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, acute myeloid leukemia, MAGE-A4 positive solid tumors, and Merkel cell carcinoma.\nSince our inception in 1992, we have devoted substantially all of our resources to our development efforts relating to our product candidates, including activities to manufacture product candidates in compliance with good manufacturing practices, or GMP, to conduct clinical studies of our product candidates, to provide selling, general and administrative support for these operations and to protect our intellectual property. We have not generated any revenue from product sales. We have funded our operations primarily through the sale of common stock in our public offerings, private placements of preferred stock and warrants and through collaborations.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of approximately $1.27 billion. We have never been profitable and have incurred net losses in each year since inception. Our net losses were $618.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 and our accumulated deficit was $2.90 billion as of December 31, 2020. Substantially all of our net losses resulted from costs incurred in connection with our research and development programs and from selling, general and administrative costs associated with our operations. We expect to continue to incur significant expenses and operating losses for at least the next several years. We expect our expenses will increase substantially in connection with our ongoing and planned activities, as we:\n\u2022conduct clinical studies for our clinical programs in \u03b2-thalassemia, SCD, and ALD, fund our share of the costs of clinical studies for our program in multiple myeloma in collaboration with BMS, and advance our preclinical programs into clinical development;\n\u2022increase research and development-related activities for the discovery and development of product candidates in severe genetic diseases and oncology;\n\u2022manufacture clinical study materials and establish the infrastructure necessary to support and develop large-scale manufacturing capabilities to support commercialization of our product and any future products;\n\u2022seek regulatory approval for our product candidates;\n\u2022add personnel to support our product development and commercialization efforts;\n\u2022increase activities related to the commercialization of ZYNTEGLO in multiple markets in Europe, the potential commercial launch of beti-cel in the United States, and the potential commercial launches of additional late-stage product candidates in the United States and Europe; and\n\u2022incur costs related to the separation of our portfolio of programs and products in severe genetic disease and oncology into two separate, independent publicly traded companies.\nAs we seek to obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates and begin to commercialize ZYNTEGLO, we expect to incur significant commercialization expenses as we prepare for and begin product sales, marketing, commercial manufacturing, and distribution. Accordingly, until we generate significant revenues from product sales, we will seek to fund our operations through public or private equity or debt financings, strategic collaborations, or other sources. However, we may be unable to raise additional funds or enter into such other arrangements when needed on favorable terms or at all. Our failure to raise capital or enter into such other arrangements as and when needed would have a negative impact on our financial condition and our ability to develop our products.\nBecause of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with product development and commercialization, we are unable to predict the timing or amount of increased expenses or when or if we will be able to achieve or maintain profitability. Even if we are able to generate revenues from the sale of our products, we may not become profitable. If we fail to become profitable or are unable to sustain profitability on a continuing basis, then we may be unable to continue our operations at planned levels and be forced to reduce our operations.\nBusiness update\nBeginning in late 2019, the outbreak of a novel strain of coronavirus (COVID-19) has evolved into a global pandemic. As a result, we continue to experience disruptions and increased risk in our operations and those of third parties upon whom we rely, which may materially and adversely affect our business. These include disruptions and risks related to the conduct of our clinical trials, manufacturing, and commercialization efforts, as policies at various clinical sites and federal, state, local and foreign laws, rules and regulations continue to evolve, including quarantines, travel restrictions, and direction of healthcare resources toward pandemic response efforts. The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted the timing of patient treatment in the\ncommercial context, and the timing of our ongoing clinical studies, with the result of slower patient enrollment and treatment in our clinical studies and delays in post-treatment follow up visits, the impact of which has varied by clinical study and by program. It has also affected our activities with and operations at our third-party manufacturers. It is unknown how long these disruptions could continue. In addition, we expect the COVID-19 pandemic to delay our ability to achieve market access and reimbursement for ZYNTEGLO in Europe due to shifting priorities of the local authorities and healthcare system. As a result of the demands upon healthcare regulatory authorities, review, inspection, and other activities related to review of regulatory submissions in drug development may be impacted, and may result in delays for an unknown period of time.\nWe continue to evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 global pandemic on patients, healthcare providers and our employees, as well as our operations and the operations of our business partners and healthcare communities. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have implemented policies at our locations to mitigate the risk of exposure to COVID-19 by our personnel, including restrictions on the number of staff in any given research and development laboratory or manufacturing facility, a work-from-home policy applicable to the majority of our personnel, and a phased approach to bringing personnel back to our locations over time. Given the importance of supporting our patients, we are diligently working with our suppliers, healthcare providers and partners to provide patients with access to ZYNTEGLO, while taking into account regulatory, institutional, and government guidance, policies and protocols. Further, we are working with our clinical study sites to understand the duration and scope of the impact on enrollment, develop protocols to help mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, and other activities for our ongoing clinical studies. However, the ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business operations is highly uncertain and subject to change and will depend on future developments which are difficult to predict.\nWe expect our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $1.27 billion as of December 31, 2020, will be sufficient to fund planned operations for at least the next twelve months from the date of issuance of these financial statements, though we may pursue additional cash resources through public or private equity or debt financings or by establishing additional collaborations with other companies.\nIn January 2021, we announced our intent to separate our severe genetic disease and oncology programs into two separate, independent publicly traded companies, bluebird bio, Inc. and a new company, which we refer to as Oncology NewCo in this annual report on Form 10-K. bluebird bio, Inc. intends to retain focus on our severe genetic disease programs and Oncology NewCo is expected to focus on our oncology programs. The transaction is expected to be completed in late 2021 and is anticipated to be tax-free, subject to receipt of a favorable IRS ruling.\nFinancial operations overview\nRevenue\nTo date, we have not generated any revenues from the sale of products. Our revenues have been derived from collaboration arrangements, out-licensing arrangements, research fees, and grant revenues.\nTo date, revenue recognized under our collaborative arrangements has been primarily generated from our collaboration arrangement with BMS. The terms of the arrangement with respect to ide-cel contain multiple promised goods or services, which include at inception: (i) research and development services, (ii) a license to ide-cel, and (iii) manufacture of vectors and associated payload for incorporation into ide-cel under the license. As of September 2017, the collaboration also included the following promised goods or services with respect to bb21217: (i) research and development services, (ii) a license to bb21217, and (iii) manufacture of vectors and associated payload for incorporation into bb21217 under the license. We entered into an agreement with BMS to co-develop and co-promote ide-cel in March 2018, which was subsequently amended in May 2020, in which both parties will share equally in U.S. costs and profits. Revenue from our collaborative arrangements is recognized as the underlying performance obligations are satisfied.\nWe analyze our collaboration arrangements to assess whether they are within the scope of ASC 808, Collaborative Arrangements ( ASC 808\u201d) to determine whether such arrangements involve joint operating activities performed by parties that are both active participants in the activities and exposed to significant risks and rewards dependent on the commercial success of such activities. This assessment is performed throughout the life of the arrangement based on changes in the responsibilities of all parties in the arrangement. For collaboration arrangements within the scope of ASC 808, we first determine which elements of the collaboration are deemed to be within the scope of ASC 808 and those that are more reflective of a vendor-customer relationship and therefore within the scope of ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers ( Topic 606\u201d or \"ASC 606\"). For elements of collaboration arrangements that are accounted for pursuant to ASC 808, an appropriate recognition method is determined and applied consistently, generally by analogy to Topic 606. Amounts that are owed to collaboration partners are recognized as an offset to collaborative arrangement revenues as such amounts are incurred by the\ncollaboration partner. Where amounts owed to a collaboration partner exceed our collaborative arrangement revenues in a quarterly period, such amounts in excess are classified as research and development expense. For those elements of the arrangement that are accounted for pursuant to Topic 606, we apply the five-step model prescribed in Topic 606.\nEffective January 1, 2020, we adopted Accounting Standards Update (\"ASU\") No. 2018-18, Collaborative Arrangements (Topic 808): Clarifying the Interaction between Topic 808 and Topic 606 (\"ASU 2018-18\") on a retrospective basis. As a result, prior periods are presented in accordance with the new standard. Prior to the adoption of ASU 2018-18, we presented all revenue recognized under our collaborative arrangements as collaboration revenue on our consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss. However, as we recognize revenue under our collaborative arrangements both within and outside the scope of Topic 606, we have revised our presentation of revenue on our consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss as follows: service revenue includes revenue from collaborative partners recognized within the scope of Topic 606 and collaborative arrangement revenue includes only revenue from collaborative partners recognized outside the scope of Topic 606.\nNonrefundable license fees are recognized as revenue upon delivery of the license provided there are no unsatisfied performance obligations in the arrangement. License revenue has historically been generated from out-license agreements, under which we may also recognize revenue from potential future milestone payments and royalties.\nFor arrangements with licenses of intellectual property that include sales-based royalties, including milestone payments based on the level of sales, and the license is deemed to be the predominant item to which the royalties relate, we recognize revenue at the later of (i) when the related sales occur, or (ii) when the performance obligation to which the royalty has been allocated has been satisfied.\nResearch and development expenses\nResearch and development expenses consist primarily of costs incurred for the development of our product candidates, which include:\n\u2022employee-related expenses, including salaries, benefits, travel and stock-based compensation expense;\n\u2022expenses incurred under agreements with clinical research organizations ( CROs\u201d) and clinical sites that conduct our clinical studies;\n\u2022costs of acquiring, developing, and manufacturing inventory;\n\u2022reimbursable costs to our partners for collaborative activities;\n\u2022facilities, depreciation, and other expenses, which include direct and allocated expenses for rent and maintenance of facilities, information technology, insurance, and other supplies in support of research and development activities;\n\u2022costs associated with our research platform and preclinical activities;\n\u2022milestones and upfront license payments;\n\u2022costs associated with our regulatory, quality assurance and quality control operations; and\n\u2022amortization of certain intangible assets.\nResearch and development costs are expensed as incurred. Costs for certain development activities are recognized based on an evaluation of the progress to completion of specific tasks using information and data provided to us by our vendors and our clinical sites. We cannot determine with certainty the duration and completion costs of the current or future clinical studies of our product candidates or if, when, or to what extent we will generate revenues from the commercialization and sale of any of our product candidates that obtain regulatory approval. We may not succeed in achieving regulatory approval for all of our product candidates. The duration, costs, and timing of clinical studies and development of our product candidates will depend on a variety of factors, any of which could mean a significant change in the costs and timing associated with the development of our product candidates including:\n\u2022the scope, rate of progress, and expense of our ongoing as well as any additional clinical studies and other research and development activities we undertake;\n\u2022future clinical study results;\n\u2022uncertainties in clinical study enrollment rates;\n\u2022new manufacturing processes or protocols that we may choose to or be required to implement in the manufacture of our lentiviral vector or drug product;\n\u2022regulatory feedback on requirements for regulatory approval, as well as changing standards for regulatory approval; and\n\u2022the timing and receipt of any regulatory approvals.\nWe plan to increase our research and development expenses for the foreseeable future as we continue to advance the development of beti-cel, eli-cel, and LentiGlobin for SCD, conduct research and development activities in severe genetic diseases and oncology, fund our share of the costs of development of ide-cel and bb21217 (if we exercise our option to co-develop and co-commercialize this product candidate) in collaboration with BMS, and continue the research and discovery of product candidates using our gene editing technology platform. Our research and development expenses include expenses associated with the following activities:\n\u2022Northstar-2 Study (HGB-207) - a multi-site, international phase 3 study to examine the safety and efficacy of beti-cel in the treatment of patients with TDT and a non-\u03b20/\u03b20 genotype.\n\u2022Northstar-3 Study (HGB-212) - a multi-site, international phase 3 study to examine the safety and efficacy of beti-cel in the treatment of patients with TDT and a \u03b20/\u03b20 genotype or an IVS-I-110 mutation.\n\u2022HGB-206 study - a multi-site phase 1/2 study in the United States to study the safety and efficacy of LentiGlobin in the treatment of patients with SCD.\n\u2022HGB-210 study - our multi-site, international phase 3 study of LentiGlobin in patients with SCD and a history of vaso-occlusive events.\n\u2022Starbeam Study (ALD-102) - a multi-site, international phase 2/3 study to examine the safety and efficacy of eli-cel in the treatment of patients with CALD.\n\u2022ALD-104 study - our multi-site, international phase 3 study to examine the safety and efficacy of eli-cel after myeloablative conditioning using busulfan and fludarabine in the treatment of patients with CALD.\n\u2022CRB-401 study - an open label, single-arm, multi-center, phase 1 study to examine the safety and efficacy of ide-cel in the treatment of patients with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma.\n\u2022KarMMA study - an open label, single-arm, multi-center phase 2 study to examine the efficacy and safety of ide-cel in the treatment of patients with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma.\n\u2022KarMMa-2 study - a multi-cohort, open-label, multicenter phase 2 study to examine the safety and efficacy of ide-cel in the treatment of patients with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma and in high-risk multiple myeloma.\n\u2022KarMMa-3 study - a multicenter, randomized, open-label phase 3 study comparing the efficacy and safety of ide-cel versus standard triplet regimens in patients with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma.\n\u2022KarMMa-4 study -, a multi-cohort, open-label, multicenter phase 1 study intended to determine the optimal target dose and safety of ide-cel in subjects with newly-diagnosed multiple myeloma.\n\u2022CRB-402 study - an open label, single-arm, multicenter, phase 1 study to examine the safety and efficacy of the bb21217 product candidate in the treatment of patients with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma.\n\u2022We will continue to incur costs related to the manufacture of clinical study materials in support of our clinical studies.\nWe expect that the timing of investment in our ongoing clinical studies will reflect COVID-19 related delays in these studies.\nOur direct research and development expenses consist principally of external costs, such as fees paid to investigators, consultants, central laboratories and CROs in connection with our clinical studies, and costs related to acquiring and manufacturing clinical study materials. We allocate salary and benefit costs directly related to specific programs. We do not allocate personnel-related discretionary bonus or stock-based compensation costs, laboratory and related expenses, certain license and other collaboration costs, depreciation or other indirect costs that are deployed across multiple projects under development and, as such, the costs are separately classified as other research and development expenses in the table below:\n\n(1)Following our receipt of conditional approval for the marketing authorization of ZYNTEGLO by the European Commission in June 2019, all manufacturing costs associated with the production of LentiGlobin for use in the commercial sale of ZYNTEGLO in the European Union will be evaluated for capitalization as inventory on our consolidated balance sheets.\n(2)Prior to 2020, costs within these categories were disclosed as \"platform-related expenses.\"\nSelling, general and administrative expenses\nSelling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related costs for personnel, including stock-based compensation and travel expenses for our employees in executive, operational, finance, legal, business development, commercial, information technology, and human resource functions. Other selling, general and administrative expenses include facility-related costs, professional fees for accounting, tax, legal and consulting services, directors' fees and expenses associated with obtaining and maintaining patents.\nWe anticipate that our selling, general and administrative expenses, including payroll and sales and marketing expenses, will continue to increase in the future relative to current levels as we execute on our commercial launch plans in Europe for ZYNTEGLO, and perform commercial readiness activities in the United States for our product candidates.\nCost of royalty and other revenue\nCost of royalty and other revenue represents expense associated with amounts owed to third-party licensors as a result of revenue recognized under our out-license arrangements.\nChange in fair value of contingent consideration\nOn June 30, 2014, we acquired Precision Genome Engineering, Inc., or Pregenen. The agreement provided for up to $135.0 million in future contingent cash payments by us upon the achievement of certain preclinical, clinical and commercial milestones related to the Pregenen technology.\nAs of December 31, 2020, there are $120.0 million in future contingent cash payments, of which $20.1 million relates to clinical milestones and $99.9 million relates to commercial milestones. We estimate future contingent cash payments have a fair value of $1.5 million as of December 31, 2020, which are classified within other non-current liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet.\nInterest income, net\nFor the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, interest income, net consists primarily of interest income earned on investments. For the year ended December 31, 2018, interest income, net consisted primarily of interest income earned on investments and interest expense on the financing lease obligation for our headquarters at 60 Binney Street in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Upon adoption of ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) ( ASU 2016-02\u201d or ASC 842\u201d) on January 1, 2019, we de-recognized the financing lease obligation and, as a result, no longer recognize interest expense associated with the financing lease obligation.\nOther (expense) income, net\nOther (expense) income, net consists primarily of gains and losses on equity securities held by us, gains and losses on disposal of fixed assets, and gains and losses on foreign currency transactions.\nCritical accounting policies and significant judgments and estimates\nOur management's discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our financial statements. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and judgments, including expected business and operational changes, sensitivity and volatility associated with the assumptions used in developing estimates, and whether historical trends are expected to be representative of future trends. We base our estimates on historical experience, known trends and events and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. In making estimates and judgments, management employs critical accounting policies.\nWhile our significant accounting policies are described in more detail in the notes to our financial statements appearing elsewhere in this annual report, we believe the following accounting policies to be most critical to the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements.\nRevenue recognition\nRevenue recognition\nUnder Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, an entity recognizes revenue when its customer obtains control of promised goods or services, in an amount that reflects the consideration that the entity expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. To determine revenue recognition for arrangements that an entity determines are within the scope of Topic 606, the entity performs the following five steps: (i) identify the contract(s) with a customer; (ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (iii) determine the transaction price, including variable consideration, if any; (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (v) recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation. We only apply the five-step model to contracts when it is probable that the entity will collect the consideration to which it is entitled in exchange for the goods or services it transfers to the customer.\nOnce a contract is determined to be within the scope of Topic 606, we assess the goods or services promised within each contract and determine those that are performance obligations. Arrangements that include rights to additional goods or services that are exercisable at a customer's discretion are generally considered options. We assess if these options provide a material right to the customer and if so, they are considered performance obligations. The identification of material rights requires judgments related to the determination of the value of the underlying license relative to the option exercise price, including assumptions about technical feasibility and the probability of developing a candidate that would be subject to the option rights. The exercise of a material right is accounted for as a contract modification for accounting purposes.\nWe assess whether each promised good or service is distinct for the purpose of identifying the performance obligations in the contract. This assessment involves subjective determinations and requires management to make judgments about the individual promised goods or services and whether such are separable from the other aspects of the contractual relationship. Promised goods and services are considered distinct provided that: (i) the customer can benefit from the good or service either on its own or together with other resources that are readily available to the customer (that is, the good or service is capable of being distinct) and (ii) the entity's promise to transfer the good or service to the customer is separately identifiable from other promises in the contract (that is, the promise to transfer the good or service is distinct within the context of the contract). In assessing whether a promised good or service is distinct, we consider factors such as the research, manufacturing and\ncommercialization capabilities of the collaboration partner and the availability of the associated expertise in the general marketplace. We also consider the intended benefit of the contract in assessing whether a promised good or service is separately identifiable from other promises in the contract. If a promised good or service is not distinct, an entity is required to combine that good or service with other promised goods or services until it identifies a bundle of goods or services that is distinct.\nThe transaction price is then determined and allocated to the identified performance obligations in proportion to their standalone selling prices ( SSP\u201d) on a relative SSP basis. SSP is determined at contract inception and is not updated to reflect changes between contract inception and when the performance obligations are satisfied. Determining the SSP for performance obligations requires significant judgment. In developing the SSP for a performance obligation, we consider applicable market conditions and relevant entity-specific factors, including factors that were contemplated in negotiating the agreement with the customer and estimated costs. We validate the SSP for performance obligations by evaluating whether changes in the key assumptions used to determine the SSP will have a significant effect on the allocation of arrangement consideration between multiple performance obligations.\nIf the consideration promised in a contract includes a variable amount, we estimate the amount of consideration to which we will be entitled in exchange for transferring the promised goods or services to a customer. We determine the amount of variable consideration by using the expected value method or the most likely amount method. We include the unconstrained amount of estimated variable consideration in the transaction price. The amount included in the transaction price is constrained to the amount for which it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur. At the end of each subsequent reporting period, we re-evaluate the estimated variable consideration included in the transaction price and any related constraint, and if necessary, adjust our estimate of the overall transaction price. Any such adjustments are recorded on a cumulative catch-up basis in the period of adjustment.\nIf an arrangement includes development and regulatory milestone payments, we evaluate whether the milestones are considered probable of being reached and estimate the amount to be included in the transaction price using the most likely amount method. If it is probable that a significant revenue reversal would not occur, the associated milestone value is included in the transaction price. Milestone payments that are not within our control or the licensee's control, such as regulatory approvals, are generally not considered probable of being achieved until those approvals are received.\nFor arrangements with licenses of intellectual property that include sales-based royalties, including milestone payments based on the level of sales, and the license is deemed to be the predominant item to which the royalties relate, we recognize royalty revenue and sales-based milestones at the later of (i) when the related sales occur, or (ii) when the performance obligation to which the royalty has been allocated has been satisfied.\nIn determining the transaction price, we adjust consideration for the effects of the time value of money if the timing of payments provides us with a significant benefit of financing. We do not assess whether a contract has a significant financing component if the expectation at contract inception is such that the period between payment by the licensees and the transfer of the promised goods or services to the licensees will be one year or less. We assessed each of our revenue generating arrangements in order to determine whether a significant financing component exists and concluded that a significant financing component does not exist in any of our arrangements.\nWe then recognize as revenue the amount of the transaction price that is allocated to the respective performance obligation when (or as) each performance obligation is satisfied, either at a point in time or over time, and if over time recognition is based on the use of an output or input method.\nWe recognize revenue within the following financial statement captions:\nService revenue\nTo date, our service revenue has primarily been generated from the elements of our collaboration arrangement with BMS that are accounted for pursuant to Topic 606, using the five-step model described above. As discussed further below, we analyze our collaboration arrangement to assess whether they are within the scope of ASC 808, Collaborative Arrangements ( ASC 808\u201d) or Topic 606. For the elements of the arrangement which are more reflective of a vendor-customer relationship and therefore within the scope of Topic 606, we record the related revenue as service revenue on the consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss. Refer below for additional discussion around our policy for recognizing collaborative arrangement revenue and the determination of whether elements of a collaboration arrangement are within the scope of ASC 808 or Topic 606.\nCollaborative arrangement revenue\nTo date, collaborative arrangement revenue has been primarily generated from our collaboration arrangements with BMS and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (\"Regeneron\"), as further described in Note 11, Collaborative arrangements in the notes to consolidated financial statements.\nWe analyze our collaboration arrangements to assess whether they are within the scope of ASC 808 to determine whether such arrangements involve joint operating activities performed by parties that are both active participants in the activities and exposed to significant risks and rewards dependent on the commercial success of such activities. This assessment is performed throughout the life of the arrangement based on changes in the responsibilities of all parties in the arrangement. For collaboration arrangements within the scope of ASC 808 that contain multiple elements, we first determine which elements of the collaboration are deemed to be within the scope of ASC 808 and those that are more reflective of a vendor-customer relationship and therefore within the scope of Topic 606 (refer above for further discussion of the Company's policy for recognizing service revenue). For elements of collaboration arrangements that are accounted for pursuant to ASC 808, an appropriate recognition method is determined and applied consistently, generally by analogy to Topic 606. Amounts that are owed to collaboration partners are recognized as an offset to collaborative arrangement revenues as such amounts are incurred by the collaboration partner. Where amounts owed to a collaboration partner exceed our collaborative arrangement revenues in each quarterly period, such amounts are classified as research and development expense.\nThe recognition of service revenue and collaborative arrangement revenue (expense) require management judgment due to the fact that the terms of our collaboration arrangements are complicated and the nature of the collaborative activities change over time. This process includes the identification of costs that we incur that relate to each particular collaboration arrangement, evaluating the nature of these costs (for example, whether the costs relate to a particular geography or territory or whether the costs relate to clinical or commercial activities), and applying the terms of the respective collaborative arrangement to determine the portion of such costs that are the responsibility of the collaboration partner, which in certain circumstances requires significant judgment.\nLeases\nEffective January 1, 2019, we adopted ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), ( ASU 2016-02\u201d or ASC 842\u201d), using the required modified retrospective approach and utilizing the effective date as the date of initial application. As a result, prior periods are presented in accordance with the previous guidance in ASC 840, Leases ( ASC 840\u201d).\nAt the inception of an arrangement, we determine whether the arrangement is or contains a lease based on the unique facts and circumstances present in the arrangement. Leases with a term greater than one year are recognized on the balance sheet as right-of-use assets and short-term and long-term lease liabilities, as applicable. We do not have material financing leases.\nOperating lease liabilities and their corresponding right-of-use assets are initially recorded based on the present value of lease payments over the expected remaining lease term. Certain adjustments to the right-of-use asset may be required for items such as incentives received. The interest rate implicit in lease contracts is typically not readily determinable. As a result, we utilize our incremental borrowing rate to discount lease payments, which reflects the fixed rate at which we could borrow on a collateralized basis the amount of the lease payments in the same currency, for a similar term, in a similar economic environment. To estimate our incremental borrowing rate, a credit rating applicable to us is estimated using a synthetic credit rating analysis since we do not currently have a rating agency-based credit rating. Prospectively, we will adjust the right-of-use assets for straight-line rent expense or any incentives received and remeasure the lease liability at the net present value using the same incremental borrowing rate that was in effect as of the lease commencement or transition date.\nWe have elected not to recognize leases with an original term of one year or less on the balance sheet. We typically only includes an initial lease term in our assessment of a lease arrangement. Options to renew a lease are not included in our assessment unless there is reasonable certainty that we will renew.\nAssumptions that we made at the commencement date are re-evaluated upon occurrence of certain events, including a lease modification. A lease modification results in a separate contract when the modification grants the lessee an additional right of use not included in the original lease and when lease payments increase commensurate with the standalone price for the additional right of use. When a lease modification results in a separate contract, it is accounted for in the same manner as a new lease.\nASC 842 transition practical expedients and application of transition provisions to leases at the transition date\nWe elected the following practical expedients, which must be elected as a package and applied consistently to all of our leases at the transition date (including those for which we are a lessee or a lessor): i) we did not reassess whether any expired or existing contracts are or contain leases; ii) we did not reassess the lease classification for any expired or existing leases (that is, all existing leases that were classified as operating leases in accordance with ASC 840 are classified as operating leases, and all existing leases that were classified as capital leases in accordance with ASC 840 are classified as finance leases); and iii) we did not reassess initial direct costs for any existing leases.\nFor leases that existed prior to the date of initial application of ASC 842 (which were previously classified as operating leases), a lessee may elect to use either the total lease term measured at lease inception under ASC 840 or the remaining lease term as of the date of initial application of ASC 842 in determining the period for which to measure its incremental borrowing rate. In transition to ASC 842, we utilized the remaining lease term of its leases in determining the appropriate incremental borrowing rates.\nApplication of ASC 842 policy elections to leases post adoption\nWe have made certain policy elections to apply to our leases executed post adoption, or subsequent to January 1, 2019, as further described below.\nIn accordance with ASC 842, components of a lease should be split into three categories: lease components, non-lease components, and non-components. The fixed and in-substance fixed contract consideration (including any consideration related to non-components) must be allocated based on the respective relative fair values to the lease components and non-lease components.\nEntities may elect not to separate lease and non-lease components. Rather, entities would account for each lease component and related non-lease component together as a single lease component. We have elected to account for lease and non-lease components together as a single lease component for all underlying assets and allocate all of the contract consideration to the lease component only.\nASC 842 allows for the use of judgment in determining whether the assumed lease term is for a major part of the remaining economic life of the underlying asset and whether the present value of lease payments represents substantially all of the fair value of the underlying asset. We apply the bright line thresholds referenced in ASC 842-10-55-2 to assist in evaluating leases for appropriate classification. The aforementioned bright lines are applied consistently to our entire portfolio of leases.\nAccrued research and development expenses\nAs part of the process of preparing our financial statements, we are required to estimate our accrued expenses. This process involves reviewing open contracts and purchase orders, communicating with our personnel to identify services that have been performed on our behalf and estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred for the service when we have not yet been invoiced or otherwise notified of the actual cost. The majority of our service providers invoice us monthly in arrears for services performed or when contractual milestones are met. We make estimates of our accrued expenses as of each balance sheet date in our financial statements based on facts and circumstances known to us at that time.\nWe recognize expenses related to clinical studies based on our estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to contracts with multiple CROs that conduct and manage clinical studies on our behalf. The financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation, vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows. There may be instances in which payments made to our vendors will exceed the level of services provided and result in a prepayment of the clinical expense. Payments under some of these contracts depend on factors such as the successful enrollment of subjects and the completion of clinical study milestones. In accruing service fees, we estimate the time period over which services will be performed and the level of effort to be expended in each period and adjust accordingly.\nOther examples of estimated accrued research and development expenses include fees paid to:\n\u2022investigative sites in connection with clinical studies;\n\u2022vendors in connection with preclinical development activities; and\n\u2022vendors related to the development, manufacturing, and distribution of clinical trial materials.\nStock-based compensation\nWe issue stock-based awards to employees and non-employees, generally in the form of stock options and restricted stock units. We account for our stock-based awards in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718, Compensation-Stock Compensation, or ASC 718. ASC 718 requires all stock-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options and modifications to existing stock options, to be recognized in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss based on their fair values. Prior to the adoption of Accounting Standards Update ( ASU\u201d) No. 2018-07, Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Nonemployee Share-Based Payment Accounting ( ASU 2018-07\u201d), the measurement date for non-employee awards was generally the date the services are completed, resulting in financial reporting period adjustments to stock-based compensation during the vesting terms for changes in the fair value of the awards. After the adoption of ASU 2018-07, the measurement date for non-employee awards is the date of grant without changes in the fair value of the award. Stock-based compensation costs for non-employees are recognized as expense over the vesting period on a straight-line basis.\nOur stock-based awards are subject to either service or performance-based vesting conditions. Compensation expense related to awards to employees, non-employees, and directors, with service-based vesting conditions is recognized on a straight-line basis based on the grant date fair value over the associated service period of the award, which is generally the vesting term. Compensation expense related to awards to employees and non-employees with performance-based vesting conditions is recognized based on the grant date fair value over the requisite service period using the accelerated attribution method to the extent achievement of the performance condition is probable. We estimate the probability that certain performance criteria will be met and do not recognize compensation expense until it is probable that the performance-based vesting condition will be achieved.\nWe estimate the fair value of our stock-based awards to employees, non-employees, and directors, using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, which requires the input of subjective assumptions, including (i) the expected volatility of our stock, (ii) the expected term of the award, (iii) the risk-free interest rate, and (iv) expected dividends. Effective January 1, 2020, we eliminated the use of a representative peer group and use only our own historical volatility data in our estimate of expected volatility given that there is now a sufficient amount of historical information regarding the volatility of our own stock price. We estimate the expected life of our employee stock options using the simplified\u201d method, whereby, the expected life equals the average of the vesting term and the original contractual term of the option. The risk-free interest rates for periods within the expected life of the option were based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect during the period the options were granted.\nRecent accounting pronouncements\nSee Note 2, Summary of significant accounting policies and basis of presentation, in the notes to consolidated financial statements for a description of recent accounting pronouncements applicable to our business.\nResults of Operations\nComparison of the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019:\n\nRevenue. Total revenue was $250.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $44.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase of $206.1 million was primarily attributable to a cumulative catch-up adjustment to revenue recorded in connection with the May 2020 BMS contract modification, as well as an increase in royalty and other revenue primarily attributable to revenue recognized under an out-license agreement with Juno Therapeutics, Inc.\nResearch and development expenses. Research and development expenses were $588.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $582.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase of $5.5 million was primarily attributable to the following:\n\u2022$12.8 million of increased collaboration research funding costs, primarily due to an increase in collaboration costs incurred by BMS as a result of BMS assuming the contract manufacturing agreements relating to ide-cel adherent lentiviral vector under the May 2020 contract modification;\n\u2022$8.2 million of increased net employee compensation, benefit, and other headcount related expenses, which is primarily driven by an increase in headcount in the quality and manufacturing organizations to support overall growth and includes a $7.9 million decrease in stock-based compensation expense due to the recognition of expense on performance-based restricted stock units that vested in June 2019. Refer to Note 14, Stock-based compensation, in the notes to consolidated financial statements for discussion of stock-based compensation expense recognized on the performance-based restricted stock units;\n\u2022$7.0 million of increased license and milestone fees primarily due to a sublicense fee upon execution of the May 2020 BMS contract modification; and\n\u2022$5.3 million of increased consulting fees primarily related to the quality and manufacturing organizations.\nThese increased costs were partially offset by:\n\u2022$17.6 million of decreased material production and other platform costs, primarily due to BMS assuming the contract manufacturing agreements relating to ide-cel adherent lentiviral vector under the May 2020 contract modification;\n\u2022$7.0 million of decreased value-added taxes; and\n\u2022$2.1 million of decreased medical research costs.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses were $286.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $271.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase of $15.5 million was primarily due to the following:\n\u2022$14.7 million of increased employee compensation, benefit, and other headcount related expenses, which is primarily driven by an increase in headcount in the information technology and human resource organizations to support overall growth, including an increase of $3.9 million in stock-based compensation expense; and\n\u2022$10.6 million of increased information technology and facility-related costs primarily due to increased investment in software applications and technology.\nThese increased costs were partially offset by:\n\u2022$6.8 million of decreased costs related to commercial readiness activities due to delays in commercial launch activities during 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic; and\n\u2022$2.3 million of decreased consulting fees primarily related to commercial strategy and product marketing.\nCost of royalty and other revenue. Cost of royalty and other revenue was $5.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $3.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase is attributable to increased royalty revenue in the same periods.\nChange in fair value of contingent consideration. The change in fair value of contingent consideration was primarily due to the change in significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of contingent consideration, including the probabilities of successful achievement of clinical and commercial milestones and discount rates.\nInterest income, net. The decrease in interest income, net was primarily related to decreased interest income earned on investments due to an overall decrease in interest rates.\nOther expense, net. The decrease in other expense, net was primarily related to changes in fair value on equity securities.\nComparison of the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018:\n\nRevenue. Total revenue was $44.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $54.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The decrease of $9.9 million was primarily attributable to a decrease in service revenue recognized for the ide-cel license and manufacturing services under our agreement with BMS. This decrease was partially offset by an\nincrease in royalty and other revenue and an increase in collaborative arrangement revenue under our agreement with Regeneron.\nResearch and development expenses. Research and development expenses were $582.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $448.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase of $133.8 million was primarily attributable to the following:\n\u2022$66.1 million of increased employee compensation, benefit, and other headcount related expenses, which is primarily driven by an increase in research and development headcount to support overall growth, including an increase of $25.7 million in stock-based compensation expense. Refer to Note 14, Stock-based compensation, in the notes to consolidated financial statements for discussion of stock-based compensation expense recognized on the performance-based restricted stock units;\n\u2022$34.8 million of increased IT and facility related costs, which includes the impact of adopting ASU 2016-02;\n\u2022$26.3 million of increased collaboration research funding costs;\n\u2022$13.1 million of increased laboratory expenses, material production, and other platform costs;\n\u2022$9.7 million of increased research consulting and medical research costs; and\n\u2022$3.6 million of increased clinical trial costs.\nThese increased costs were partially offset by $20.6 million of decreased license and milestone fees.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses were $271.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $174.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase of approximately $97.2 million was primarily due to the following:\n\u2022$65.3 million of increased employee compensation, benefit, and other headcount related expenses, which is primarily driven by an increase in selling, general, and administrative headcount to support overall growth, including an increase of $24.1 million in stock-based compensation expense. Refer to Note 14, Stock-based compensation, in the notes to consolidated financial statements for discussion of stock-based compensation expense recognized on the performance-based restricted stock units;\n\u2022$18.4 million of increased costs related to commercial-readiness activities; and\n\u2022$13.2 million of increased consulting fees.\nCost of royalty and other revenue. Cost of royalty and other revenue was $3.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $0.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase is attributable to increased royalty revenue in the same periods.\nChange in fair value of contingent consideration. The change in fair value of contingent consideration was primarily due to the change in significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of contingent consideration, including the probabilities of successful achievement of clinical and commercial milestones and discount rates.\nInterest income, net. The change in interest income, net was primarily related to increased interest income earned on investments, as well as a decrease in interest expense incurred due to the de-recognition of the financing lease obligation associated with our corporate headquarters at 60 Binney Street related to the adoption of ASU 2016-02 on January 1, 2019.\nOther (expense) income, net. The change in other (expense) income, net was primarily related to changes in fair value on equity securities.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of approximately $1.27 billion. We expect our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities will be sufficient to fund planned operations for at least the next twelve months from the date of issuance of these financial statements, though we may pursue additional cash resources through public or private equity or debt financings or by establishing additional collaborations with other companies. Cash in excess of immediate requirements is invested in accordance with our investment policy, primarily with a view to liquidity and capital", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following information should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nIn addition to historical information, this report contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties which may cause our actual results to differ materially from plans and results discussed in forward-looking statements. We encourage you to review the risks and uncertainties discussed in the sections entitled Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d and Forward-Looking Statements\u201d included at the beginning of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The risks and uncertainties can cause actual results to differ significantly from those forecast in forward-looking statements or implied in historical results and trends.\nWe caution readers not to place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements made by us, which speak only as of the date they are made. We disclaim any obligation, except as specifically required by law and the rules of the SEC, to publicly update or revise any such statements to reflect any change in our expectations or in events, conditions or circumstances on which any such statements may be based, or that may affect the likelihood that actual results will differ from those set forth in the forward-looking statements.\nOverview\nWe are a biotechnology company committed to researching, developing, and commercializing potentially transformative gene therapies for severe genetic diseases and cancer. We have built an integrated product platform with broad therapeutic potential in a variety of indications based on our lentiviral gene addition platform, gene editing and cancer immunotherapy capabilities. Our severe genetic disease (\"SGD\") programs include beti-cel, LentiGlobin for SCD gene therapy, and eli-cel. Our programs in oncology are focused on developing novel T cell-based immunotherapies, including CAR and TCR T cell therapies. bb2121 (idecabtagene vicleucel, or ide-cel), and bb21217 are CAR-T cell product candidates for the treatment of multiple myeloma and partnered under our collaboration arrangement with BMS.\nWe are commercializing beti-cel as ZYNTEGLO in the EU and began to treat patients in the commercial context in the first quarter of 2021. However, in February 2021 we temporarily suspended marketing of ZYNTEGLO in light of safety events in the HGB-206 clinical study of LentiGlobin for SCD, which is manufactured using the same vector as ZYNTEGLO. Additionally, the EMA has paused the renewal procedure for ZYNTEGLO's conditional marketing authorization while the EMA's pharmacovigilance risk assessment committee reviews the risk-benefit assessment for ZYNTEGLO and determines whether any additional pharmacovigilance measures are necessary. We are engaged with the EMA in discussions regarding our proposed development plans for beti-cel as a treatment for patients with TDT who are less than 12 years of age and for patients who have a \u03b20/\u03b20 genotype. We are engaged with the FDA in discussions regarding our proposed development plans for beti-cel as a treatment for patients with TDT. Contingent upon successful resolution of the FDA's concerns arising out of the safety events in our SCD program, we currently expect to complete our BLA submission for beti-cel in mid-2021 for the treatment of patients with TDT across all genotypes, including non-\u03b20/\u03b20 and \u03b20/\u03b20 genotypes, and patients with TDT who are less than 12 years of age.\nBased on our prior discussions with the FDA, we believe that we may be able to seek accelerated approval for LentiGlobin for SCD in the United States on the basis of clinical data from Group C of our HGB-206 clinical study, with our HGB-210 clinical study providing confirmatory data for full approval. However, in light of a SUSAR of acute myeloid leukemia and a SUSAR of myelodysplastic syndrome in our HGB-206 clinical study, the FDA has placed our clinical studies of LentiGlobin for SCD on clinical hold. We are investigating these events and plan to continue to work closely with the FDA in their review of these events. In addition, we are also engaged with the EMA in discussions regarding our proposed development plans for LentiGlobin for SCD in Europe.\nIn October 2020, the EMA accepted our Marketing Authorization Application in the EU for eli-cel for the treatment of patients with CALD. Based on our discussions with the FDA, we believe that we may be able to seek approval for eli-cel for the treatment of patients with CALD on the basis of our clinical data from our ongoing Starbeam study, safety data from our ongoing ALD-104 study, and the completed ALD-103 observational study. We currently expect to submit the BLA for eli-cel for the treatment of patients with CALD in mid-2021.\nIn collaboration with BMS, we are developing ide-cel and the bb21217 product candidates as treatments for multiple myeloma. We are co-developing and co-promoting ide-cel in the United States with BMS and we have exclusively licensed to BMS the development and commercialization rights for ide-cel outside of the United States. In September 2020, the FDA accepted for Priority Review the BLA submitted by BMS for ide-cel as a treatment for relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma. We have exclusively licensed the development and commercialization rights for the bb21217 product candidate to BMS, with an option for us to elect to co-develop and co-promote bb21217 within the United States. In addition, we are\nindependently pursuing next-generation BCMA-targeting CAR-T approaches for treating multiple myeloma. Our other programs in oncology include preclinical programs to discover and develop T cell product candidates to treat other hematologic and solid tumor malignancies, including: non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, acute myeloid leukemia, MAGE-A4 positive solid tumors, and Merkel cell carcinoma.\nSince our inception in 1992, we have devoted substantially all of our resources to our development efforts relating to our product candidates, including activities to manufacture product candidates in compliance with good manufacturing practices, or GMP, to conduct clinical studies of our product candidates, to provide selling, general and administrative support for these operations and to protect our intellectual property. We have not generated any revenue from product sales. We have funded our operations primarily through the sale of common stock in our public offerings, private placements of preferred stock and warrants and through collaborations.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of approximately $1.27 billion. We have never been profitable and have incurred net losses in each year since inception. Our net losses were $618.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 and our accumulated deficit was $2.90 billion as of December 31, 2020. Substantially all of our net losses resulted from costs incurred in connection with our research and development programs and from selling, general and administrative costs associated with our operations. We expect to continue to incur significant expenses and operating losses for at least the next several years. We expect our expenses will increase substantially in connection with our ongoing and planned activities, as we:\n\u2022conduct clinical studies for our clinical programs in \u03b2-thalassemia, SCD, and ALD, fund our share of the costs of clinical studies for our program in multiple myeloma in collaboration with BMS, and advance our preclinical programs into clinical development;\n\u2022increase research and development-related activities for the discovery and development of product candidates in severe genetic diseases and oncology;\n\u2022manufacture clinical study materials and establish the infrastructure necessary to support and develop large-scale manufacturing capabilities to support commercialization of our product and any future products;\n\u2022seek regulatory approval for our product candidates;\n\u2022add personnel to support our product development and commercialization efforts;\n\u2022increase activities related to the commercialization of ZYNTEGLO in multiple markets in Europe, the potential commercial launch of beti-cel in the United States, and the potential commercial launches of additional late-stage product candidates in the United States and Europe; and\n\u2022incur costs related to the separation of our portfolio of programs and products in severe genetic disease and oncology into two separate, independent publicly traded companies.\nAs we seek to obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates and begin to commercialize ZYNTEGLO, we expect to incur significant commercialization expenses as we prepare for and begin product sales, marketing, commercial manufacturing, and distribution. Accordingly, until we generate significant revenues from product sales, we will seek to fund our operations through public or private equity or debt financings, strategic collaborations, or other sources. However, we may be unable to raise additional funds or enter into such other arrangements when needed on favorable terms or at all. Our failure to raise capital or enter into such other arrangements as and when needed would have a negative impact on our financial condition and our ability to develop our products.\nBecause of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with product development and commercialization, we are unable to predict the timing or amount of increased expenses or when or if we will be able to achieve or maintain profitability. Even if we are able to generate revenues from the sale of our products, we may not become profitable. If we fail to become profitable or are unable to sustain profitability on a continuing basis, then we may be unable to continue our operations at planned levels and be forced to reduce our operations.\nBusiness update\nBeginning in late 2019, the outbreak of a novel strain of coronavirus (COVID-19) has evolved into a global pandemic. As a result, we continue to experience disruptions and increased risk in our operations and those of third parties upon whom we rely, which may materially and adversely affect our business. These include disruptions and risks related to the conduct of our clinical trials, manufacturing, and commercialization efforts, as policies at various clinical sites and federal, state, local and foreign laws, rules and regulations continue to evolve, including quarantines, travel restrictions, and direction of healthcare resources toward pandemic response efforts. The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted the timing of patient treatment in the\ncommercial context, and the timing of our ongoing clinical studies, with the result of slower patient enrollment and treatment in our clinical studies and delays in post-treatment follow up visits, the impact of which has varied by clinical study and by program. It has also affected our activities with and operations at our third-party manufacturers. It is unknown how long these disruptions could continue. In addition, we expect the COVID-19 pandemic to delay our ability to achieve market access and reimbursement for ZYNTEGLO in Europe due to shifting priorities of the local authorities and healthcare system. As a result of the demands upon healthcare regulatory authorities, review, inspection, and other activities related to review of regulatory submissions in drug development may be impacted, and may result in delays for an unknown period of time.\nWe continue to evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 global pandemic on patients, healthcare providers and our employees, as well as our operations and the operations of our business partners and healthcare communities. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have implemented policies at our locations to mitigate the risk of exposure to COVID-19 by our personnel, including restrictions on the number of staff in any given research and development laboratory or manufacturing facility, a work-from-home policy applicable to the majority of our personnel, and a phased approach to bringing personnel back to our locations over time. Given the importance of supporting our patients, we are diligently working with our suppliers, healthcare providers and partners to provide patients with access to ZYNTEGLO, while taking into account regulatory, institutional, and government guidance, policies and protocols. Further, we are working with our clinical study sites to understand the duration and scope of the impact on enrollment, develop protocols to help mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, and other activities for our ongoing clinical studies. However, the ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business operations is highly uncertain and subject to change and will depend on future developments which are difficult to predict.\nWe expect our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $1.27 billion as of December 31, 2020, will be sufficient to fund planned operations for at least the next twelve months from the date of issuance of these financial statements, though we may pursue additional cash resources through public or private equity or debt financings or by establishing additional collaborations with other companies.\nIn January 2021, we announced our intent to separate our severe genetic disease and oncology programs into two separate, independent publicly traded companies, bluebird bio, Inc. and a new company, which we refer to as Oncology NewCo in this annual report on Form 10-K. bluebird bio, Inc. intends to retain focus on our severe genetic disease programs and Oncology NewCo is expected to focus on our oncology programs. The transaction is expected to be completed in late 2021 and is anticipated to be tax-free, subject to receipt of a favorable IRS ruling.\nFinancial operations overview\nRevenue\nTo date, we have not generated any revenues from the sale of products. Our revenues have been derived from collaboration arrangements, out-licensing arrangements, research fees, and grant revenues.\nTo date, revenue recognized under our collaborative arrangements has been primarily generated from our collaboration arrangement with BMS. The terms of the arrangement with respect to ide-cel contain multiple promised goods or services, which include at inception: (i) research and development services, (ii) a license to ide-cel, and (iii) manufacture of vectors and associated payload for incorporation into ide-cel under the license. As of September 2017, the collaboration also included the following promised goods or services with respect to bb21217: (i) research and development services, (ii) a license to bb21217, and (iii) manufacture of vectors and associated payload for incorporation into bb21217 under the license. We entered into an agreement with BMS to co-develop and co-promote ide-cel in March 2018, which was subsequently amended in May 2020, in which both parties will share equally in U.S. costs and profits. Revenue from our collaborative arrangements is recognized as the underlying performance obligations are satisfied.\nWe analyze our collaboration arrangements to assess whether they are within the scope of ASC 808, Collaborative Arrangements ( ASC 808\u201d) to determine whether such arrangements involve joint operating activities performed by parties that are both active participants in the activities and exposed to significant risks and rewards dependent on the commercial success of such activities. This assessment is performed throughout the life of the arrangement based on changes in the responsibilities of all parties in the arrangement. For collaboration arrangements within the scope of ASC 808, we first determine which elements of the collaboration are deemed to be within the scope of ASC 808 and those that are more reflective of a vendor-customer relationship and therefore within the scope of ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers ( Topic 606\u201d or \"ASC 606\"). For elements of collaboration arrangements that are accounted for pursuant to ASC 808, an appropriate recognition method is determined and applied consistently, generally by analogy to Topic 606. Amounts that are owed to collaboration partners are recognized as an offset to collaborative arrangement revenues as such amounts are incurred by the\ncollaboration partner. Where amounts owed to a collaboration partner exceed our collaborative arrangement revenues in a quarterly period, such amounts in excess are classified as research and development expense. For those elements of the arrangement that are accounted for pursuant to Topic 606, we apply the five-step model prescribed in Topic 606.\nEffective January 1, 2020, we adopted Accounting Standards Update (\"ASU\") No. 2018-18, Collaborative Arrangements (Topic 808): Clarifying the Interaction between Topic 808 and Topic 606 (\"ASU 2018-18\") on a retrospective basis. As a result, prior periods are presented in accordance with the new standard. Prior to the adoption of ASU 2018-18, we presented all revenue recognized under our collaborative arrangements as collaboration revenue on our consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss. However, as we recognize revenue under our collaborative arrangements both within and outside the scope of Topic 606, we have revised our presentation of revenue on our consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss as follows: service revenue includes revenue from collaborative partners recognized within the scope of Topic 606 and collaborative arrangement revenue includes only revenue from collaborative partners recognized outside the scope of Topic 606.\nNonrefundable license fees are recognized as revenue upon delivery of the license provided there are no unsatisfied performance obligations in the arrangement. License revenue has historically been generated from out-license agreements, under which we may also recognize revenue from potential future milestone payments and royalties.\nFor arrangements with licenses of intellectual property that include sales-based royalties, including milestone payments based on the level of sales, and the license is deemed to be the predominant item to which the royalties relate, we recognize revenue at the later of (i) when the related sales occur, or (ii) when the performance obligation to which the royalty has been allocated has been satisfied.\nResearch and development expenses\nResearch and development expenses consist primarily of costs incurred for the development of our product candidates, which include:\n\u2022employee-related expenses, including salaries, benefits, travel and stock-based compensation expense;\n\u2022expenses incurred under agreements with clinical research organizations ( CROs\u201d) and clinical sites that conduct our clinical studies;\n\u2022costs of acquiring, developing, and manufacturing inventory;\n\u2022reimbursable costs to our partners for collaborative activities;\n\u2022facilities, depreciation, and other expenses, which include direct and allocated expenses for rent and maintenance of facilities, information technology, insurance, and other supplies in support of research and development activities;\n\u2022costs associated with our research platform and preclinical activities;\n\u2022milestones and upfront license payments;\n\u2022costs associated with our regulatory, quality assurance and quality control operations; and\n\u2022amortization of certain intangible assets.\nResearch and development costs are expensed as incurred. Costs for certain development activities are recognized based on an evaluation of the progress to completion of specific tasks using information and data provided to us by our vendors and our clinical sites. We cannot determine with certainty the duration and completion costs of the current or future clinical studies of our product candidates or if, when, or to what extent we will generate revenues from the commercialization and sale of any of our product candidates that obtain regulatory approval. We may not succeed in achieving regulatory approval for all of our product candidates. The duration, costs, and timing of clinical studies and development of our product candidates will depend on a variety of factors, any of which could mean a significant change in the costs and timing associated with the development of our product candidates including:\n\u2022the scope, rate of progress, and expense of our ongoing as well as any additional clinical studies and other research and development activities we undertake;\n\u2022future clinical study results;\n\u2022uncertainties in clinical study enrollment rates;\n\u2022new manufacturing processes or protocols that we may choose to or be required to implement in the manufacture of our lentiviral vector or drug product;\n\u2022regulatory feedback on requirements for regulatory approval, as well as changing standards for regulatory approval; and\n\u2022the timing and receipt of any regulatory approvals.\nWe plan to increase our research and development expenses for the foreseeable future as we continue to advance the development of beti-cel, eli-cel, and LentiGlobin for SCD, conduct research and development activities in severe genetic diseases and oncology, fund our share of the costs of development of ide-cel and bb21217 (if we exercise our option to co-develop and co-commercialize this product candidate) in collaboration with BMS, and continue the research and discovery of product candidates using our gene editing technology platform. Our research and development expenses include expenses associated with the following activities:\n\u2022Northstar-2 Study (HGB-207) - a multi-site, international phase 3 study to examine the safety and efficacy of beti-cel in the treatment of patients with TDT and a non-\u03b20/\u03b20 genotype.\n\u2022Northstar-3 Study (HGB-212) - a multi-site, international phase 3 study to examine the safety and efficacy of beti-cel in the treatment of patients with TDT and a \u03b20/\u03b20 genotype or an IVS-I-110 mutation.\n\u2022HGB-206 study - a multi-site phase 1/2 study in the United States to study the safety and efficacy of LentiGlobin in the treatment of patients with SCD.\n\u2022HGB-210 study - our multi-site, international phase 3 study of LentiGlobin in patients with SCD and a history of vaso-occlusive events.\n\u2022Starbeam Study (ALD-102) - a multi-site, international phase 2/3 study to examine the safety and efficacy of eli-cel in the treatment of patients with CALD.\n\u2022ALD-104 study - our multi-site, international phase 3 study to examine the safety and efficacy of eli-cel after myeloablative conditioning using busulfan and fludarabine in the treatment of patients with CALD.\n\u2022CRB-401 study - an open label, single-arm, multi-center, phase 1 study to examine the safety and efficacy of ide-cel in the treatment of patients with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma.\n\u2022KarMMA study - an open label, single-arm, multi-center phase 2 study to examine the efficacy and safety of ide-cel in the treatment of patients with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma.\n\u2022KarMMa-2 study - a multi-cohort, open-label, multicenter phase 2 study to examine the safety and efficacy of ide-cel in the treatment of patients with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma and in high-risk multiple myeloma.\n\u2022KarMMa-3 study - a multicenter, randomized, open-label phase 3 study comparing the efficacy and safety of ide-cel versus standard triplet regimens in patients with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma.\n\u2022KarMMa-4 study -, a multi-cohort, open-label, multicenter phase 1 study intended to determine the optimal target dose and safety of ide-cel in subjects with newly-diagnosed multiple myeloma.\n\u2022CRB-402 study - an open label, single-arm, multicenter, phase 1 study to examine the safety and efficacy of the bb21217 product candidate in the treatment of patients with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma.\n\u2022We will continue to incur costs related to the manufacture of clinical study materials in support of our clinical studies.\nWe expect that the timing of investment in our ongoing clinical studies will reflect COVID-19 related delays in these studies.\nOur direct research and development expenses consist principally of external costs, such as fees paid to investigators, consultants, central laboratories and CROs in connection with our clinical studies, and costs related to acquiring and manufacturing clinical study materials. We allocate salary and benefit costs directly related to specific programs. We do not allocate personnel-related discretionary bonus or stock-based compensation costs, laboratory and related expenses, certain license and other collaboration costs, depreciation or other indirect costs that are deployed across multiple projects under development and, as such, the costs are separately classified as other research and development expenses in the table below:\nTable 11: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(in thousands) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>beti-cel(1)\n</td> <td>$ </td> <td>66,141 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>73,896 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>92,193 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>LentiGlobin for SCD </td> <td>58,862 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>50,796 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>32,865 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>eli-cel </td> <td>48,028 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>40,352 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>38,244 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>ide-cel </td> <td>105,240 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>121,182 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>75,667 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>bb21217 </td> <td>23,511 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>19,827 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15,624 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Preclinical programs </td> <td>45,888 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>49,700 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>50,115 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total direct research and development expense </td> <td>347,670 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>355,753 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>304,708 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Employee- and contractor-related expenses </td> <td>63,840 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>52,617 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>35,697 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Stock-based compensation expense </td> <td>72,239 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>80,139 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>54,422 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Laboratory and related expenses(2)\n</td> <td>16,689 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12,208 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,311 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>License and other collaboration expenses(2)\n</td> <td>15,285 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,021 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9,876 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Facility expenses </td> <td>67,464 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>67,274 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>32,158 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other expenses </td> <td>4,769 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,401 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,417 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total other research and development expenses </td> <td>240,286 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>226,660 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>143,881 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total research and development expense </td> <td>$ </td> <td>587,956 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>582,413 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>448,589 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1)Following our receipt of conditional approval for the marketing authorization of ZYNTEGLO by the European Commission in June 2019, all manufacturing costs associated with the production of LentiGlobin for use in the commercial sale of ZYNTEGLO in the European Union will be evaluated for capitalization as inventory on our consolidated balance sheets.\n(2)Prior to 2020, costs within these categories were disclosed as \"platform-related expenses.\"\nSelling, general and administrative expenses\nSelling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related costs for personnel, including stock-based compensation and travel expenses for our employees in executive, operational, finance, legal, business development, commercial, information technology, and human resource functions. Other selling, general and administrative expenses include facility-related costs, professional fees for accounting, tax, legal and consulting services, directors' fees and expenses associated with obtaining and maintaining patents.\nWe anticipate that our selling, general and administrative expenses, including payroll and sales and marketing expenses, will continue to increase in the future relative to current levels as we execute on our commercial launch plans in Europe for ZYNTEGLO, and perform commercial readiness activities in the United States for our product candidates.\nCost of royalty and other revenue\nCost of royalty and other revenue represents expense associated with amounts owed to third-party licensors as a result of revenue recognized under our out-license arrangements.\nChange in fair value of contingent consideration\nOn June 30, 2014, we acquired Precision Genome Engineering, Inc., or Pregenen. The agreement provided for up to $135.0 million in future contingent cash payments by us upon the achievement of certain preclinical, clinical and commercial milestones related to the Pregenen technology.\nAs of December 31, 2020, there are $120.0 million in future contingent cash payments, of which $20.1 million relates to clinical milestones and $99.9 million relates to commercial milestones. We estimate future contingent cash payments have a fair value of $1.5 million as of December 31, 2020, which are classified within other non-current liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet.\nInterest income, net\nFor the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, interest income, net consists primarily of interest income earned on investments. For the year ended December 31, 2018, interest income, net consisted primarily of interest income earned on investments and interest expense on the financing lease obligation for our headquarters at 60 Binney Street in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Upon adoption of ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) ( ASU 2016-02\u201d or ASC 842\u201d) on January 1, 2019, we de-recognized the financing lease obligation and, as a result, no longer recognize interest expense associated with the financing lease obligation.\nOther (expense) income, net\nOther (expense) income, net consists primarily of gains and losses on equity securities held by us, gains and losses on disposal of fixed assets, and gains and losses on foreign currency transactions.\nCritical accounting policies and significant judgments and estimates\nOur management's discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our financial statements. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and judgments, including expected business and operational changes, sensitivity and volatility associated with the assumptions used in developing estimates, and whether historical trends are expected to be representative of future trends. We base our estimates on historical experience, known trends and events and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. In making estimates and judgments, management employs critical accounting policies.\nWhile our significant accounting policies are described in more detail in the notes to our financial statements appearing elsewhere in this annual report, we believe the following accounting policies to be most critical to the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements.\nRevenue recognition\nRevenue recognition\nUnder Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, an entity recognizes revenue when its customer obtains control of promised goods or services, in an amount that reflects the consideration that the entity expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. To determine revenue recognition for arrangements that an entity determines are within the scope of Topic 606, the entity performs the following five steps: (i) identify the contract(s) with a customer; (ii) identify the performance obligations in the contract; (iii) determine the transaction price, including variable consideration, if any; (iv) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and (v) recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation. We only apply the five-step model to contracts when it is probable that the entity will collect the consideration to which it is entitled in exchange for the goods or services it transfers to the customer.\nOnce a contract is determined to be within the scope of Topic 606, we assess the goods or services promised within each contract and determine those that are performance obligations. Arrangements that include rights to additional goods or services that are exercisable at a customer's discretion are generally considered options. We assess if these options provide a material right to the customer and if so, they are considered performance obligations. The identification of material rights requires judgments related to the determination of the value of the underlying license relative to the option exercise price, including assumptions about technical feasibility and the probability of developing a candidate that would be subject to the option rights. The exercise of a material right is accounted for as a contract modification for accounting purposes.\nWe assess whether each promised good or service is distinct for the purpose of identifying the performance obligations in the contract. This assessment involves subjective determinations and requires management to make judgments about the individual promised goods or services and whether such are separable from the other aspects of the contractual relationship. Promised goods and services are considered distinct provided that: (i) the customer can benefit from the good or service either on its own or together with other resources that are readily available to the customer (that is, the good or service is capable of being distinct) and (ii) the entity's promise to transfer the good or service to the customer is separately identifiable from other promises in the contract (that is, the promise to transfer the good or service is distinct within the context of the contract). In assessing whether a promised good or service is distinct, we consider factors such as the research, manufacturing and\ncommercialization capabilities of the collaboration partner and the availability of the associated expertise in the general marketplace. We also consider the intended benefit of the contract in assessing whether a promised good or service is separately identifiable from other promises in the contract. If a promised good or service is not distinct, an entity is required to combine that good or service with other promised goods or services until it identifies a bundle of goods or services that is distinct.\nThe transaction price is then determined and allocated to the identified performance obligations in proportion to their standalone selling prices ( SSP\u201d) on a relative SSP basis. SSP is determined at contract inception and is not updated to reflect changes between contract inception and when the performance obligations are satisfied. Determining the SSP for performance obligations requires significant judgment. In developing the SSP for a performance obligation, we consider applicable market conditions and relevant entity-specific factors, including factors that were contemplated in negotiating the agreement with the customer and estimated costs. We validate the SSP for performance obligations by evaluating whether changes in the key assumptions used to determine the SSP will have a significant effect on the allocation of arrangement consideration between multiple performance obligations.\nIf the consideration promised in a contract includes a variable amount, we estimate the amount of consideration to which we will be entitled in exchange for transferring the promised goods or services to a customer. We determine the amount of variable consideration by using the expected value method or the most likely amount method. We include the unconstrained amount of estimated variable consideration in the transaction price. The amount included in the transaction price is constrained to the amount for which it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur. At the end of each subsequent reporting period, we re-evaluate the estimated variable consideration included in the transaction price and any related constraint, and if necessary, adjust our estimate of the overall transaction price. Any such adjustments are recorded on a cumulative catch-up basis in the period of adjustment.\nIf an arrangement includes development and regulatory milestone payments, we evaluate whether the milestones are considered probable of being reached and estimate the amount to be included in the transaction price using the most likely amount method. If it is probable that a significant revenue reversal would not occur, the associated milestone value is included in the transaction price. Milestone payments that are not within our control or the licensee's control, such as regulatory approvals, are generally not considered probable of being achieved until those approvals are received.\nFor arrangements with licenses of intellectual property that include sales-based royalties, including milestone payments based on the level of sales, and the license is deemed to be the predominant item to which the royalties relate, we recognize royalty revenue and sales-based milestones at the later of (i) when the related sales occur, or (ii) when the performance obligation to which the royalty has been allocated has been satisfied.\nIn determining the transaction price, we adjust consideration for the effects of the time value of money if the timing of payments provides us with a significant benefit of financing. We do not assess whether a contract has a significant financing component if the expectation at contract inception is such that the period between payment by the licensees and the transfer of the promised goods or services to the licensees will be one year or less. We assessed each of our revenue generating arrangements in order to determine whether a significant financing component exists and concluded that a significant financing component does not exist in any of our arrangements.\nWe then recognize as revenue the amount of the transaction price that is allocated to the respective performance obligation when (or as) each performance obligation is satisfied, either at a point in time or over time, and if over time recognition is based on the use of an output or input method.\nWe recognize revenue within the following financial statement captions:\nService revenue\nTo date, our service revenue has primarily been generated from the elements of our collaboration arrangement with BMS that are accounted for pursuant to Topic 606, using the five-step model described above. As discussed further below, we analyze our collaboration arrangement to assess whether they are within the scope of ASC 808, Collaborative Arrangements ( ASC 808\u201d) or Topic 606. For the elements of the arrangement which are more reflective of a vendor-customer relationship and therefore within the scope of Topic 606, we record the related revenue as service revenue on the consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss. Refer below for additional discussion around our policy for recognizing collaborative arrangement revenue and the determination of whether elements of a collaboration arrangement are within the scope of ASC 808 or Topic 606.\nCollaborative arrangement revenue\nTo date, collaborative arrangement revenue has been primarily generated from our collaboration arrangements with BMS and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (\"Regeneron\"), as further described in Note 11, Collaborative arrangements in the notes to consolidated financial statements.\nWe analyze our collaboration arrangements to assess whether they are within the scope of ASC 808 to determine whether such arrangements involve joint operating activities performed by parties that are both active participants in the activities and exposed to significant risks and rewards dependent on the commercial success of such activities. This assessment is performed throughout the life of the arrangement based on changes in the responsibilities of all parties in the arrangement. For collaboration arrangements within the scope of ASC 808 that contain multiple elements, we first determine which elements of the collaboration are deemed to be within the scope of ASC 808 and those that are more reflective of a vendor-customer relationship and therefore within the scope of Topic 606 (refer above for further discussion of the Company's policy for recognizing service revenue). For elements of collaboration arrangements that are accounted for pursuant to ASC 808, an appropriate recognition method is determined and applied consistently, generally by analogy to Topic 606. Amounts that are owed to collaboration partners are recognized as an offset to collaborative arrangement revenues as such amounts are incurred by the collaboration partner. Where amounts owed to a collaboration partner exceed our collaborative arrangement revenues in each quarterly period, such amounts are classified as research and development expense.\nThe recognition of service revenue and collaborative arrangement revenue (expense) require management judgment due to the fact that the terms of our collaboration arrangements are complicated and the nature of the collaborative activities change over time. This process includes the identification of costs that we incur that relate to each particular collaboration arrangement, evaluating the nature of these costs (for example, whether the costs relate to a particular geography or territory or whether the costs relate to clinical or commercial activities), and applying the terms of the respective collaborative arrangement to determine the portion of such costs that are the responsibility of the collaboration partner, which in certain circumstances requires significant judgment.\nLeases\nEffective January 1, 2019, we adopted ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), ( ASU 2016-02\u201d or ASC 842\u201d), using the required modified retrospective approach and utilizing the effective date as the date of initial application. As a result, prior periods are presented in accordance with the previous guidance in ASC 840, Leases ( ASC 840\u201d).\nAt the inception of an arrangement, we determine whether the arrangement is or contains a lease based on the unique facts and circumstances present in the arrangement. Leases with a term greater than one year are recognized on the balance sheet as right-of-use assets and short-term and long-term lease liabilities, as applicable. We do not have material financing leases.\nOperating lease liabilities and their corresponding right-of-use assets are initially recorded based on the present value of lease payments over the expected remaining lease term. Certain adjustments to the right-of-use asset may be required for items such as incentives received. The interest rate implicit in lease contracts is typically not readily determinable. As a result, we utilize our incremental borrowing rate to discount lease payments, which reflects the fixed rate at which we could borrow on a collateralized basis the amount of the lease payments in the same currency, for a similar term, in a similar economic environment. To estimate our incremental borrowing rate, a credit rating applicable to us is estimated using a synthetic credit rating analysis since we do not currently have a rating agency-based credit rating. Prospectively, we will adjust the right-of-use assets for straight-line rent expense or any incentives received and remeasure the lease liability at the net present value using the same incremental borrowing rate that was in effect as of the lease commencement or transition date.\nWe have elected not to recognize leases with an original term of one year or less on the balance sheet. We typically only includes an initial lease term in our assessment of a lease arrangement. Options to renew a lease are not included in our assessment unless there is reasonable certainty that we will renew.\nAssumptions that we made at the commencement date are re-evaluated upon occurrence of certain events, including a lease modification. A lease modification results in a separate contract when the modification grants the lessee an additional right of use not included in the original lease and when lease payments increase commensurate with the standalone price for the additional right of use. When a lease modification results in a separate contract, it is accounted for in the same manner as a new lease.\nASC 842 transition practical expedients and application of transition provisions to leases at the transition date\nWe elected the following practical expedients, which must be elected as a package and applied consistently to all of our leases at the transition date (including those for which we are a lessee or a lessor): i) we did not reassess whether any expired or existing contracts are or contain leases; ii) we did not reassess the lease classification for any expired or existing leases (that is, all existing leases that were classified as operating leases in accordance with ASC 840 are classified as operating leases, and all existing leases that were classified as capital leases in accordance with ASC 840 are classified as finance leases); and iii) we did not reassess initial direct costs for any existing leases.\nFor leases that existed prior to the date of initial application of ASC 842 (which were previously classified as operating leases), a lessee may elect to use either the total lease term measured at lease inception under ASC 840 or the remaining lease term as of the date of initial application of ASC 842 in determining the period for which to measure its incremental borrowing rate. In transition to ASC 842, we utilized the remaining lease term of its leases in determining the appropriate incremental borrowing rates.\nApplication of ASC 842 policy elections to leases post adoption\nWe have made certain policy elections to apply to our leases executed post adoption, or subsequent to January 1, 2019, as further described below.\nIn accordance with ASC 842, components of a lease should be split into three categories: lease components, non-lease components, and non-components. The fixed and in-substance fixed contract consideration (including any consideration related to non-components) must be allocated based on the respective relative fair values to the lease components and non-lease components.\nEntities may elect not to separate lease and non-lease components. Rather, entities would account for each lease component and related non-lease component together as a single lease component. We have elected to account for lease and non-lease components together as a single lease component for all underlying assets and allocate all of the contract consideration to the lease component only.\nASC 842 allows for the use of judgment in determining whether the assumed lease term is for a major part of the remaining economic life of the underlying asset and whether the present value of lease payments represents substantially all of the fair value of the underlying asset. We apply the bright line thresholds referenced in ASC 842-10-55-2 to assist in evaluating leases for appropriate classification. The aforementioned bright lines are applied consistently to our entire portfolio of leases.\nAccrued research and development expenses\nAs part of the process of preparing our financial statements, we are required to estimate our accrued expenses. This process involves reviewing open contracts and purchase orders, communicating with our personnel to identify services that have been performed on our behalf and estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred for the service when we have not yet been invoiced or otherwise notified of the actual cost. The majority of our service providers invoice us monthly in arrears for services performed or when contractual milestones are met. We make estimates of our accrued expenses as of each balance sheet date in our financial statements based on facts and circumstances known to us at that time.\nWe recognize expenses related to clinical studies based on our estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to contracts with multiple CROs that conduct and manage clinical studies on our behalf. The financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation, vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows. There may be instances in which payments made to our vendors will exceed the level of services provided and result in a prepayment of the clinical expense. Payments under some of these contracts depend on factors such as the successful enrollment of subjects and the completion of clinical study milestones. In accruing service fees, we estimate the time period over which services will be performed and the level of effort to be expended in each period and adjust accordingly.\nOther examples of estimated accrued research and development expenses include fees paid to:\n\u2022investigative sites in connection with clinical studies;\n\u2022vendors in connection with preclinical development activities; and\n\u2022vendors related to the development, manufacturing, and distribution of clinical trial materials.\nStock-based compensation\nWe issue stock-based awards to employees and non-employees, generally in the form of stock options and restricted stock units. We account for our stock-based awards in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718, Compensation-Stock Compensation, or ASC 718. ASC 718 requires all stock-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options and modifications to existing stock options, to be recognized in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss based on their fair values. Prior to the adoption of Accounting Standards Update ( ASU\u201d) No. 2018-07, Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Nonemployee Share-Based Payment Accounting ( ASU 2018-07\u201d), the measurement date for non-employee awards was generally the date the services are completed, resulting in financial reporting period adjustments to stock-based compensation during the vesting terms for changes in the fair value of the awards. After the adoption of ASU 2018-07, the measurement date for non-employee awards is the date of grant without changes in the fair value of the award. Stock-based compensation costs for non-employees are recognized as expense over the vesting period on a straight-line basis.\nOur stock-based awards are subject to either service or performance-based vesting conditions. Compensation expense related to awards to employees, non-employees, and directors, with service-based vesting conditions is recognized on a straight-line basis based on the grant date fair value over the associated service period of the award, which is generally the vesting term. Compensation expense related to awards to employees and non-employees with performance-based vesting conditions is recognized based on the grant date fair value over the requisite service period using the accelerated attribution method to the extent achievement of the performance condition is probable. We estimate the probability that certain performance criteria will be met and do not recognize compensation expense until it is probable that the performance-based vesting condition will be achieved.\nWe estimate the fair value of our stock-based awards to employees, non-employees, and directors, using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, which requires the input of subjective assumptions, including (i) the expected volatility of our stock, (ii) the expected term of the award, (iii) the risk-free interest rate, and (iv) expected dividends. Effective January 1, 2020, we eliminated the use of a representative peer group and use only our own historical volatility data in our estimate of expected volatility given that there is now a sufficient amount of historical information regarding the volatility of our own stock price. We estimate the expected life of our employee stock options using the simplified\u201d method, whereby, the expected life equals the average of the vesting term and the original contractual term of the option. The risk-free interest rates for periods within the expected life of the option were based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect during the period the options were granted.\nRecent accounting pronouncements\nSee Note 2, Summary of significant accounting policies and basis of presentation, in the notes to consolidated financial statements for a description of recent accounting pronouncements applicable to our business.\nResults of Operations\nComparison of the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019:\nTable 12: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(in thousands) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenue: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Service revenue </td> <td>$ </td> <td>114,064 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>30,729 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>83,335 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Collaborative arrangement revenue </td> <td>115,594 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,740 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>109,854 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Royalty and other revenue </td> <td>21,076 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,205 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12,871 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total revenues </td> <td>250,734 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>44,674 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>206,060 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating expenses: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Research and development </td> <td>587,956 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>582,413 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,543 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling, general and administrative </td> <td>286,896 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>271,362 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15,534 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of royalty and other revenue </td> <td>5,396 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,978 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,418 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Change in fair value of contingent consideration </td> <td>(6,468) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,747 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(9,215) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total operating expenses </td> <td>873,780 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>859,500 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14,280 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss from operations </td> <td>(623,046) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(814,826) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>191,780 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest income, net </td> <td>11,539 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>34,761 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(23,222) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other expense, net </td> <td>(6,502) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(10,088) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,586 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss before income taxes </td> <td>(618,009) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(790,153) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>172,144 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax (expense) benefit </td> <td>(686) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>545 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,231) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net loss </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(618,695) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(789,608) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>170,913 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenue. Total revenue was $250.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $44.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase of $206.1 million was primarily attributable to a cumulative catch-up adjustment to revenue recorded in connection with the May 2020 BMS contract modification, as well as an increase in royalty and other revenue primarily attributable to revenue recognized under an out-license agreement with Juno Therapeutics, Inc.\nResearch and development expenses. Research and development expenses were $588.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $582.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase of $5.5 million was primarily attributable to the following:\n\u2022$12.8 million of increased collaboration research funding costs, primarily due to an increase in collaboration costs incurred by BMS as a result of BMS assuming the contract manufacturing agreements relating to ide-cel adherent lentiviral vector under the May 2020 contract modification;\n\u2022$8.2 million of increased net employee compensation, benefit, and other headcount related expenses, which is primarily driven by an increase in headcount in the quality and manufacturing organizations to support overall growth and includes a $7.9 million decrease in stock-based compensation expense due to the recognition of expense on performance-based restricted stock units that vested in June 2019. Refer to Note 14, Stock-based compensation, in the notes to consolidated financial statements for discussion of stock-based compensation expense recognized on the performance-based restricted stock units;\n\u2022$7.0 million of increased license and milestone fees primarily due to a sublicense fee upon execution of the May 2020 BMS contract modification; and\n\u2022$5.3 million of increased consulting fees primarily related to the quality and manufacturing organizations.\nThese increased costs were partially offset by:\n\u2022$17.6 million of decreased material production and other platform costs, primarily due to BMS assuming the contract manufacturing agreements relating to ide-cel adherent lentiviral vector under the May 2020 contract modification;\n\u2022$7.0 million of decreased value-added taxes; and\n\u2022$2.1 million of decreased medical research costs.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses were $286.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $271.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase of $15.5 million was primarily due to the following:\n\u2022$14.7 million of increased employee compensation, benefit, and other headcount related expenses, which is primarily driven by an increase in headcount in the information technology and human resource organizations to support overall growth, including an increase of $3.9 million in stock-based compensation expense; and\n\u2022$10.6 million of increased information technology and facility-related costs primarily due to increased investment in software applications and technology.\nThese increased costs were partially offset by:\n\u2022$6.8 million of decreased costs related to commercial readiness activities due to delays in commercial launch activities during 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic; and\n\u2022$2.3 million of decreased consulting fees primarily related to commercial strategy and product marketing.\nCost of royalty and other revenue. Cost of royalty and other revenue was $5.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $3.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase is attributable to increased royalty revenue in the same periods.\nChange in fair value of contingent consideration. The change in fair value of contingent consideration was primarily due to the change in significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of contingent consideration, including the probabilities of successful achievement of clinical and commercial milestones and discount rates.\nInterest income, net. The decrease in interest income, net was primarily related to decreased interest income earned on investments due to an overall decrease in interest rates.\nOther expense, net. The decrease in other expense, net was primarily related to changes in fair value on equity securities.\nComparison of the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018:\nTable 13: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(in thousands) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenue: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Service revenue </td> <td>$ </td> <td>30,729 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>44,533 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(13,804) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Collaborative arrangement revenue </td> <td>5,740 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,820 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2,080) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Royalty and other revenue </td> <td>8,205 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,226 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,979 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total revenues </td> <td>44,674 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>54,579 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(9,905) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating expenses: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Research and development </td> <td>582,413 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>448,589 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>133,824 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling, general and administrative </td> <td>271,362 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>174,129 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>97,233 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of royalty and other revenue </td> <td>2,978 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>885 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,093 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Change in fair value of contingent consideration </td> <td>2,747 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,999 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(252) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total operating expenses </td> <td>859,500 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>626,602 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>232,898 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss from operations </td> <td>(814,826) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(572,023) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(242,803) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest income, net </td> <td>34,761 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14,624 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>20,137 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other (expense) income, net </td> <td>(10,088) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,961 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(12,049) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss before income taxes </td> <td>(790,153) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(555,438) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(234,715) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax benefit (expense) </td> <td>545 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(187) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>732 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net loss </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(789,608) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(555,625) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(233,983) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenue. Total revenue was $44.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $54.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The decrease of $9.9 million was primarily attributable to a decrease in service revenue recognized for the ide-cel license and manufacturing services under our agreement with BMS. This decrease was partially offset by an\nincrease in royalty and other revenue and an increase in collaborative arrangement revenue under our agreement with Regeneron.\nResearch and development expenses. Research and development expenses were $582.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $448.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase of $133.8 million was primarily attributable to the following:\n\u2022$66.1 million of increased employee compensation, benefit, and other headcount related expenses, which is primarily driven by an increase in research and development headcount to support overall growth, including an increase of $25.7 million in stock-based compensation expense. Refer to Note 14, Stock-based compensation, in the notes to consolidated financial statements for discussion of stock-based compensation expense recognized on the performance-based restricted stock units;\n\u2022$34.8 million of increased IT and facility related costs, which includes the impact of adopting ASU 2016-02;\n\u2022$26.3 million of increased collaboration research funding costs;\n\u2022$13.1 million of increased laboratory expenses, material production, and other platform costs;\n\u2022$9.7 million of increased research consulting and medical research costs; and\n\u2022$3.6 million of increased clinical trial costs.\nThese increased costs were partially offset by $20.6 million of decreased license and milestone fees.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses were $271.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $174.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase of approximately $97.2 million was primarily due to the following:\n\u2022$65.3 million of increased employee compensation, benefit, and other headcount related expenses, which is primarily driven by an increase in selling, general, and administrative headcount to support overall growth, including an increase of $24.1 million in stock-based compensation expense. Refer to Note 14, Stock-based compensation, in the notes to consolidated financial statements for discussion of stock-based compensation expense recognized on the performance-based restricted stock units;\n\u2022$18.4 million of increased costs related to commercial-readiness activities; and\n\u2022$13.2 million of increased consulting fees.\nCost of royalty and other revenue. Cost of royalty and other revenue was $3.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $0.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase is attributable to increased royalty revenue in the same periods.\nChange in fair value of contingent consideration. The change in fair value of contingent consideration was primarily due to the change in significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of contingent consideration, including the probabilities of successful achievement of clinical and commercial milestones and discount rates.\nInterest income, net. The change in interest income, net was primarily related to increased interest income earned on investments, as well as a decrease in interest expense incurred due to the de-recognition of the financing lease obligation associated with our corporate headquarters at 60 Binney Street related to the adoption of ASU 2016-02 on January 1, 2019.\nOther (expense) income, net. The change in other (expense) income, net was primarily related to changes in fair value on equity securities.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of approximately $1.27 billion. We expect our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities will be sufficient to fund planned operations for at least the next twelve months from the date of issuance of these financial statements, though we may pursue additional cash resources through public or private equity or debt financings or by establishing additional collaborations with other companies.
