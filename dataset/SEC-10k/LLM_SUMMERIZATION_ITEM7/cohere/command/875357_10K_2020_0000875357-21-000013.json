This discussion should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and footnotes and selected financial data presented elsewhere in this report.\nAfter completing its 11th consecutive year of expansion in 2019, the U.S. economy experienced extreme volatility throughout 2020. The worldwide spread of COVID-19 affected every part of the economic environment. Economic conditions in the U.S. declined drastically in March and April of 2020 following the initial U.S. COVID-19 outbreak. Congress quickly passed the CARES Act economic relief package, which alleviated some of the downturn. With the government stimulus package and some time to settle into the current new normal, the economy rebounded significantly in the second half of the year.\nThe Federal Reserve lowered the federal funds rate to near zero by April, 2020 and has initiated additional programs to infuse liquidity and stimulate economic activity. The Federal Reserve is expected to keep the federal funds rate at or near zero until the labor market has fully recovered and inflation has stabilized at 2%. See \"Summary of Credit Loss Experience\" section of Management's Discussion and Analysis for additional discussion around our economic forecast.\nPerformance Summary\nNet income for the year ended December 31, 2020 totaled $435.0 million or $6.19 per diluted share compared with net income of $500.8 million or $7.03 per diluted share for the year ended December 31, 2019. A pre-tax provision for expected credit losses of $222.6 million was included in 2020 while a pre-tax provision for incurred losses of $44.0 million was included in 2019. The Company adopted the current expected credit loss (\"CECL\") model on January 1, 2020.\nPre-provision net revenue, a non-GAAP measure, was $786.4 million for 2020 compared to $674.9 million in the prior year. This is a measure of revenue less expenses, and is calculated before provision for credit losses and income tax expense. Pre-provision net revenue is a financial measure frequently used by investors and analysts that enables them to assess a company's ability to generate earnings to cover credit losses through a credit cycle. It also provides an additional basis for comparing the results of operations between periods by isolating the impact of the provision for credit losses, which can vary significantly between periods.\nWe incurred $17.2 million of integration costs in 2019 related to the acquisition of CoBiz Financial, Inc. (\"CoBiz\") on October 1, 2018, which resulted in an $0.18 per share reduction in 2019. The fluctuation discussion in the highlights below excludes this impact.\nHighlights of 2020 included:\n\u2022Net interest revenue totaled $1.1 billion for 2020, consistent with the prior year. Net interest margin was 2.83% for 2020 compared to 3.11% for 2019. The Federal Reserve reduced the federal funds rate to near zero early in the year putting pressure on the margin in 2020. Average earning assets were $40.7 billion for 2020, up $4.3 billion over 2019. The increase was largely due to increased trading securities, loans primarily related to the Small Business Administration's Paycheck Protection Program (\"PPP\"), and the expansion of the available for sale securities portfolio as we repositioned the balance sheet for a lower rate environment.\n\u2022Fees and commissions revenue was $810.3 million for 2020, up $108.1 million compared to 2019. Mortgage banking revenue increased $74.8 million and brokerage and trading revenue increased $62.0 million. Lower mortgage interest rates increased both mortgage loan production and related trading activities. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in deposit service charges of $15.7 million and fiduciary and asset management revenue of $9.6 million.\n\u2022Other operating expense totaled $1.2 billion, a $50.8 million increase compared to 2019. Personnel expense increased $30.8 million, primarily due to higher incentive compensation expense due to expanded trading activities. This was partially offset by lower employee benefits costs. Increased data processing and communications expense, occupancy and equipment expense, mortgage banking costs and charitable contributions were partially offset by lower business promotions expense.\n\u2022The net economic benefit of the changes in the fair value of mortgage servicing rights and related economic hedges was $24.9 million during 2020 compared to an economic cost of $17.9 million during 2019.\n\u2022The allowance for loan losses totaled $389 million or 1.69% of outstanding loans at December 31, 2020. The combined allowance for loan losses and accrual for off-balance sheet credit risk from unfunded loan commitments was $426 million or 1.85% of outstanding loans at December 31, 2020. Excluding PPP loans, which are fully guaranteed by a U.S. government agency, the allowance for loan losses was 1.82% of outstanding loans and the combined allowance for loan losses and accrual for off-balance sheet credit risk from unfunded loan commitments was 2.00%. The allowance for loan losses was $211 million or 0.97% of outstanding loans and the combined allowance for loan losses and accrual for off-balance sheet credit risk from unfunded loan commitments was $212 million or 0.98% of outstanding loans at December 31, 2019.\n\u2022Period-end outstanding loan balances were $23.0 billion at December 31, 2020, a $1.3 billion increase over the prior year, primarily due to the inflow of PPP loans. Average loans were $23.4 billion, a $1.3 billion increase compared to 2019.\n\u2022Period-end deposits totaled $36.1 billion at December 31, 2020, an $8.5 billion increase compared to December 31, 2019. Interest-bearing transaction deposits increased $5.8 billion, while demand deposit balances increased $2.8 billion. Average deposits increased $7.1 billion to $32.8 billion. Deposit growth was largely due to customers retaining higher balances in the current economic environment combined with increases due to various COVID-19 related government program stimulus payments.\n\u2022Common equity Tier 1 capital ratio was 11.95% at December 31, 2020. In addition, the Tier 1 capital ratio was 11.95%, total capital ratio was 13.82% and leverage ratio was 8.28% at December 31, 2020. At December 31, 2019, the Tier 1 capital ratio was 11.39%, the total capital ratio was 12.94% and the leverage ratio was 8.40%.\n\u2022The Company repurchased 1,107,100 shares at an average price of $68.49 per share during 2020 and 1,572,322 shares at an average price of $82.35 during 2019.\n\u2022The Company paid cash dividends of $2.05 per common share during 2020 and $2.01 per common share in 2019.\nNet income for the fourth quarter of 2020 totaled $154.2 million or $2.21 per diluted share, compared to $110.4 million or $1.56 per diluted share for the fourth quarter of 2019.\nHighlights of the fourth quarter of 2020 included:\n\u2022Net interest revenue totaled $297.2 million for the fourth quarter of 2020, an increase of $27.0 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2019, largely due to a $5.2 billion increase in average trading securities. We saw a shift from trading revenue to interest income on trading securities in the fourth quarter of 2020. Net interest margin was 2.72% for the fourth quarter of 2020 and 2.88% for the fourth quarter of 2019. The increase in the trading securities portfolio combined with the repricing of our available for sale securities portfolio decreased the net interest margin.\n\u2022Fees and commissions revenue totaled $181.1 million, up $1.6 million over the fourth quarter of 2019. Increased mortgage banking revenue stemming from the low interest rate environment was largely offset by decreased brokerage and trading revenue, fiduciary and asset management revenue, and deposit service charges.\n\u2022Operating expenses in the fourth quarter totaled $300.7 million, an $11.9 million increase compared to the prior year. Personnel expense increased $7.8 million primarily due to higher incentive compensation expense, partially offset by regular compensation expense. Non-personnel expenses increased $4.1 million, largely due to increased data processing and communications expense and higher charitable contributions, partially offset by lower business promotion expense.\n\u2022Based on an evaluation of economic forecasts and loan portfolio characteristics, the Company recorded a $6.5 million negative provision for expected credit losses in the fourth quarter of 2020 and a $19.0 million provision for incurred credit losses in the fourth quarter of 2019.\nCritical Accounting Policies & Estimates\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America ( GAAP\u201d). The Company's accounting policies are more fully described in Note 1 of the Consolidated Financial Statements. Management makes significant assumptions and estimates in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes in conformity with GAAP that may be highly subjective, complex and subject to variability. Actual results could differ significantly from these assumptions and estimates. The following discussion addresses the most critical areas where these assumptions and estimates could affect the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the Company. These critical accounting policies and estimates have been discussed with the appropriate committees of the Board of Directors.\nAllowance for Loan Losses and Accrual for Off-Balance Sheet Credit Risk from Loan Commitments\nThe allowance for loan losses and accrual for off-balance sheet credit risk from unfunded loan commitments represent the portion of amortized cost basis of loans and related unfunded commitments we do not expect to collect over the asset's contractual life, considering past events, current conditions, as well as reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic conditions. Appropriateness of the allowance for loan losses and accrual for off-balance sheet credit risk from unfunded loan commitments is determined by a senior management Allowance Committee which requires judgment about effects of uncertain matters, resulting in a subjective calculation which is inherently imprecise. Because of the subjective forward-looking nature of the calculation, changes in these measures may not directly correlate with actual economic events. In future periods, management judgment may consider new or changed information which may cause significant changes in these allowances in those future periods.\nAs of January 1, 2020 BOK Financial's accounting policies have changed significantly with the adoption of Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-13 Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Assets Measured at Amortized Cost (\"ASU 2016-13\" or \"CECL\"). Prior years are not restated. Prior to January 1, 2020, general allowances and nonspecific allowances were based on incurred credit losses. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the description of the expected credit losses calculation of the allowance for loan losses and accrual for off-balance sheet credit risk from unfunded loan commitments.\nFor the majority of risk-graded loans, the accruing loan's expected credit loss estimate is sensitive to management judgment, particularly probability of default and loss given default assumptions, changes in specific macroeconomic factor forecasts and the probability weight assigned to each economic scenario.\nProbability of default and loss given default measurements are based on historical data that may not be a good predictor of future performance or actual losses. Probability of default is based on risk grades, a subjective measurement of the risk of a loan. This subjective assessment of risk may not reflect actual risk of loss.\nOther subjective measures include the forecast for each relevant economic loss driver and the probability weighting of economic scenarios, both of which are overseen by a senior management Economic Forecast Committee which includes members independent of the allowance process. The Allowance Committee may increase or decrease the allowance based on factors that include, for example, new lines of business, market conditions that have not been previously encountered, observed changes in credit risk that are not yet reflected in macroeconomic factors, or economic conditions that impact loss given default assumptions.\nAlthough the resulting expected credit loss estimate represents management's best estimates at the time, actual credit losses will differ from management's estimate. Portfolio composition will change over time, actual economic conditions will differ from probability-weighted assumptions, borrower-specific circumstances will change, as well as other factors. Differences between actual losses and management's estimates may materially affect the Company's results of operations.\nFair Value Measurement\nCertain assets and liabilities are recorded at fair value in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Fair value is defined by applicable accounting guidance as the price to sell an asset or transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants in the principal markets for the given asset or liability at the measurement date based on market conditions at that date. An orderly transaction assumes exposure to the market for a customary period for marketing activities prior to the measurement date and not a forced liquidation or distressed sale.\nA hierarchy for fair value has been established that prioritizes the inputs of valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad categories: unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1), other observable inputs that can be observed either directly or indirectly (Level 2) and unobservable inputs for assets or liabilities (Level 3). Fair value may be recorded for certain assets and liabilities every reporting period on a recurring basis or under certain circumstances on a non-recurring basis. Fair value measurements of significant assets or liabilities that are based on unobservable inputs (Level 3) are considered Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates. Additional discussion of fair value measurement and disclosure is included in Notes 7 and 19 of the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nMortgage Servicing Rights\nWe have a significant investment in mortgage servicing rights. Our mortgage servicing rights are primarily retained from sales in the secondary market of residential mortgage loans we have originated or purchased from correspondent lenders. Occasionally, mortgage servicing rights may be purchased from other lenders. Both originated and purchased mortgage servicing rights are initially recognized at fair value. We carry all mortgage servicing rights at fair value. Changes in fair value are recognized in earnings as they occur.\nMortgage servicing rights are not traded in active markets. The fair value of mortgage servicing rights is determined by discounting the projected cash flows. Certain significant assumptions and estimates used in valuing mortgage servicing rights are based on current market sources including projected prepayment speeds, assumed servicing costs, earnings on escrow deposits, ancillary income and discount rates. Assumptions used to value our mortgage servicing rights are considered significant unobservable inputs and represent our best estimate of assumptions that market participants would use to value this asset. A separate third party model is used to estimate prepayment speeds based on interest rates, housing turnover rates, estimated loan curtailment, anticipated defaults and other relevant factors. The prepayment model is updated periodically for changes in market conditions and adjusted to better correlate with actual performance of our servicing portfolio. The discount rate is based on benchmark rates for mortgage loans plus a market spread expected by investors in servicing rights. Significant assumptions used to determine the fair value of our mortgage servicing rights are presented in Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. At least annually, we request estimates of fair value from outside sources to corroborate the results of the valuation model.\nThe assumptions used in this model are primarily based on mortgage interest rates. Evaluation of the effect of a change in one assumption without considering the effect of that change on other assumptions is not meaningful. Considering all related assumptions, we expect a 50 basis point increase in primary mortgage interest rates to increase the fair value of our servicing rights by $29 million. We expect a $15 million decrease in the fair value of our mortgage servicing rights from a 50 basis point decrease in primary mortgage interest rates.\nValuation of Impaired Loans and Real Estate and Other Repossessed Assets\nThe fair value of collateral for certain impaired loans and real estate and other repossessed assets is measured on a non-recurring basis. The fair value of real estate is generally based on unadjusted third-party appraisals derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data. Fair value measurements based on these appraisals are considered to be based on Level 2 inputs. Fair value measurements based on appraisals that are not based on observable inputs or that require significant adjustments by us or fair value measurements that are not based on third-party appraisals are considered to be based on Level 3 inputs. Significant unobservable inputs include listing prices for comparable assets, uncorroborated expert opinions or management's knowledge of the collateral or industry.\nThe fair value of mineral rights is generally determined by our internal staff of engineers based on projected cash flows from proven oil and gas reserves under existing economic and operating conditions. Proven oil and gas reserves are estimated quantities that geological and engineering data demonstrate, with reasonable certainty, to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs using existing prices and costs. Projected cash flows incorporate assumptions related to a number of factors including production, sales prices, operating expenses, severance, ad valorem taxes, capital costs and appropriate discount rate. Fair values determined through this process are considered to be based on Level 3 inputs.\nIncome Taxes\nDetermination of income tax expense and related assets and liabilities is complex and requires estimates and judgments when applying tax laws, rules, regulations and interpretations. It also requires judgments as to future earnings and the timing of future events. Accrued income taxes represent an estimate of net amounts due to or from taxing jurisdictions based upon these estimates, interpretations and judgments.\nManagement evaluates the Company's current tax expense or benefit based upon estimates of taxable income, tax credits and statutory tax rates. Annually, we file tax returns with each jurisdiction where we conduct business and adjust recognized income tax expense or benefit to filed tax returns.\nWe recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based upon the differences between the values of assets and liabilities as recognized in the financial statements and their related tax basis using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to be recovered or settled. A valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that some portion of the entire deferred tax asset may not be realized.\nWe also recognize the benefit of uncertain tax positions when based upon all relevant evidence, it is more-likely-than-not that our position would prevail upon examination, including resolution of related appeals or litigation, based upon the technical merits of the position. Unrecognized tax benefits, including estimated interest and penalties, are part of our current accrued income tax liability. Estimated penalties and interest are recognized in income tax expense. Income tax expense in future periods may decrease if an uncertain tax position is favorably resolved, generally upon completion of an examination by the taxing authorities, expiration of a statute of limitations, or changes in facts and circumstances.\nGoodwill Impairment\nGoodwill for each reporting unit is evaluated for impairment annually as of October 1st or more frequently if conditions indicate that impairment may have occurred. The evaluation of possible goodwill impairment involves significant judgment based upon short-term and long-term projections of future performance.\nDuring the evaluation for impairment, management qualitatively assesses whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting units is less than their carrying value, including goodwill. Reporting unit carrying value includes sufficient capital to exceed regulatory requirements. This assessment includes consideration of relevant events and circumstances including, but not limited to, macroeconomic conditions, industry and market conditions, the financial and stock performance of the Company and other relevant factors. Specifically, the analysis may include:\n\u2022General economic conditions including overall economic activity, consumer spending and mobility, unemployment rates, consumer confidence, and duration and severity of any current market moving instability.\n\u2022Global health concerns including ongoing pandemics or potential for widespread health issues, the future course of a pandemic and the potential for medical advances.\n\u2022Regional economic conditions including demand for oil and price stability of oil, other overarching conditions that may be affecting any of the Company's primary states such as weather or other catastrophes, pandemics and health related lockdowns, or other state mandates.\n\u2022Industry conditions including federal funds rate movement by the Federal Reserve, the interest rate environment and the resulting effect on net interest revenue and operating revenue, and regulatory mandates that hinder or provide relief to the financial services industry.\n\u2022Company specific conditions including current and forecasted income, changes in stock price, the Company's stock price compared to peers and other indexes, book value per share compared to fair value per share, goodwill compared to total shareholders' equity, current capital and liquidity position, demand for products and services, health of the loan portfolio and other credit related factors, and current credit ratings with the ratings agencies, and regulatory ratings.\n\u2022Reporting unit performance and forecasts including any event that may significantly impact a reporting unit.\nIf management concludes based on the qualitative assessment that goodwill may be impaired, a quantitative impairment test will be applied to goodwill at all reporting units. The quantitative analysis compares the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying value, including goodwill. The fair value of each reporting unit is estimated by the discounted future earnings method. Goodwill is considered impaired if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value of the reporting unit, including goodwill.\nBoth the qualitative assessment and quantitative analysis require significant management judgment, including estimates of changes in future economic conditions and their underlying causes and duration, the reasonableness and effectiveness of management's responses to those changes, changes in governmental fiscal and monetary policies, and fair value measurements based largely on significant unobservable inputs. The results of these judgments may have a significant impact on the Company's reported results of operations.\nSee Note 6, \"Goodwill and Intangible Assets\" for breakout of goodwill by reporting unit.\nResults of Operations\nNet Interest Revenue and Net Interest Margin\nNet interest revenue is the interest earned on debt securities, loans and other interest-earning assets less interest paid for interest-bearing deposits and other borrowings. The net interest margin is calculated by dividing tax-equivalent net interest revenue by average interest-earning assets. Net interest spread is the difference between the average rate earned on interest-earning assets and the average rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities. Net interest margin is typically greater than net interest spread due to interest income earned on assets funded by non-interest bearing liabilities such as demand deposits and equity.\nTax-equivalent net interest revenue totaled $1.1 billion for 2020, consistent with the prior year. This includes $26.0 million of net purchase discount accretion for 2020 and $37.8 million for 2019. Approximately $48 million of purchase accounting discount remains to be accreted. Net interest revenue decreased $108.7 million due to changes in interest rates and increased $102.8 million from growth in earning assets. Table 2 shows the effects on net interest revenue due to changes in average balances and interest rates for the various types of earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. In addition, see the Annual and Quarterly Financial Summary of consolidated daily average balances, yields and rates following the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nNet interest margin was 2.83% for 2020 and 3.11% for 2019. The tax-equivalent yield on earning assets was 3.24% for 2020 compared to 4.27% in 2019. In response to the anticipated impact to the economy from the COVID-19 pandemic, the Federal Reserve reduced the federal funds rate to near zero in March, 2020. The resulting impact on market interest rates has compressed the net interest margin. The company has been proactive in reducing deposit costs and implementing LIBOR floors in loan agreements; however, funds received from available for sale securities have been reinvested at lower rates. Loan yields decreased 129 basis points to 3.84%. The available for sale securities portfolio yield decreased 37 basis points to 2.21%. The yield on trading securities fell 80 basis points to 2.75%. The yield on interest-bearing cash and cash equivalents decreased 183 basis points to 0.45%.\nFunding costs decreased 108 basis points compared to 2019. The cost of interest-bearing deposits decreased 69 basis points. The cost of other short-term borrowings decreased 161 basis points. The benefit to net interest margin from earning assets funded by non-interest bearing liabilities was 12 basis points for 2020, down from 45 basis points for 2019.\nAverage earning assets for 2020 increased $4.3 billion or 12% over 2019, largely due to the expansion of the available for sale securities portfolio, loans originated as part of the Small Business Administration's Paycheck Protection Program (\"PPP\"), and an increase in our trading of U.S. government issued mortgage-backed securities. The average balance of available for sale securities, which consists largely of residential and commercial mortgage-backed securities guaranteed by U.S. government agencies, increased $2.3 billion. We purchase securities to supplement earnings and to manage interest rate risk. We increased the size of our bond portfolio during the latter half of 2019 and first quarter 2020 in order to reduce our exposure to falling short-term interest rates. Average loans, net of allowance for loan losses, increased $1.1 billion, primarily related to $1.4 billion in average PPP loans. Trading securities balances increased $1.3 billion.\nTotal average deposits grew by $7.1 billion over the prior year. This increase is largely due to the combination of focused deposit gathering initiatives, stimulus-related deposits, and customers retaining elevated balances in the current economic environment. Average interest-bearing transaction account balances increased $5.6 billion. Average demand deposit balances increased $1.4 billion. Average short-term borrowings decreased $1.7 billion.\nOur overall objective is to manage the Company's balance sheet to be relatively neutral to changes in interest rates as is further described in the Market Risk section of this report. As shown in Table 21, approximately 70% of our commercial and commercial real estate loan portfolios are either variable rate loans or fixed rate loans that will re-price within one year. These loans are funded primarily by deposit accounts that are either non-interest bearing, or that re-price more slowly than the loans. The result is a balance sheet that would be asset sensitive, which means that assets generally re-price more quickly than liabilities. Among the strategies that we use to manage toward a relatively rate-neutral position, we purchase fixed rate residential mortgage-backed securities issued primarily by U.S. government agencies and fund them with market rate sensitive liabilities. The liability-sensitive nature of this strategy provides an offset to the asset-sensitive characteristics of our loan portfolio. We also may use derivative instruments to manage our interest rate risk.\nThe effectiveness of these strategies is reflected in the overall change in net interest revenue due to changes in interest rates as shown in Table 2 and in the interest rate sensitivity projections as shown in the Market Risk section of this report.\nFourth Quarter 2020 Net Interest Revenue\nTax-equivalent net interest revenue totaled $299.6 million for the fourth quarter of 2020, an increase of $26.7 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2019. Net interest revenue increased $44.5 million, primarily due to the increase in trading securities, available for sale securities and loan balances. This was partially offset by a decrease of $17.8 million primarily due to lower market interest rates in 2020.\nNet interest margin was 2.72% for the fourth quarter of 2020 compared to 2.88% for the fourth quarter of 2019. The tax-equivalent yield on earning assets was 2.92% for the fourth quarter of 2020, a decrease of 101 basis points compared to the fourth quarter of 2019, primarily due to the impact on interest rates related to the federal funds rate cuts in 2020. Loan yields decreased 107 basis points to 3.68%. Yield on available for sale securities decreased 54 basis points to 1.98%. Yield on trading securities decreased 117 basis points to 2.02%.\nFunding costs decreased 112 basis points compared to the fourth quarter of 2019. The cost of other short-term borrowings decreased 145 basis points. The cost of interest-bearing deposits decreased 90 basis points. The benefit to net interest margin from earning assets funded by non-interest bearing liabilities was 8 basis points in the fourth quarter of 2020, down from 35 basis points in the fourth quarter of 2019.\nAverage earning assets for the fourth quarter of 2020 increased $6.3 billion over the fourth quarter of 2019. Trading securities balances increased $5.2 billion as we increased our trading of U.S. government issued mortgage-backed securities. Available for sale securities increased $1.6 billion as the balance sheet was repositioned for the current rate environment. Average loans, net of allowance for loan losses, increased $1.0 billion, largely due to the loans related to the PPP. Fair value option securities held as an economic hedge of our mortgage servicing rights decreased $1.4 billion.\nAverage deposits increased $8.4 billion over the fourth quarter of 2019, largely due to the combination of government stimulus payments and customers choosing to retain elevated balances in the current environment. Average interest-bearing transaction accounts increased $6.0 billion and average demand deposit balances increased $2.5 billion. Average short-term borrowings decreased $3.0 billion.\n2019 Net Interest Revenue\nTax-equivalent net interest revenue for 2019 was $1.1 billion, up from $993.8 million for 2018. The acquisition of CoBiz in the fourth quarter of 2018 added $158.5 million to net interest revenue in 2019 and $43.1 million to net interest revenue in 2018. This includes $37.8 million of net purchase discount accretion for 2019 and $6.4 million for 2018. Net interest revenue decreased $13.7 million due to rates and increased $144.4 million from growth in earning assets.\nNet interest margin was 3.11% for 2019 compared to 3.20% for 2018. The tax-equivalent yield on average earning assets increased 29 basis points over 2018. Short-term rate increases during the first half of 2019 resulting from four 25 basis point increases in the federal funds rate by the Federal Reserve during 2018 were partially offset by three 25 basis point decreases in the federal funds rate in the second half of 2019. Loan yields increased 33 basis points. The available for sale securities portfolio yield increased 23 basis points.The yield on interest-bearing cash and cash equivalents increased 48 basis points. The yield on trading securities fell 29 basis points. The cost of interest-bearing liabilities increased 42 basis points. The cost of interest-bearing deposits increased 39 basis points and the cost of other short-term borrowings increased 35 basis points. The benefit to net interest margin from earning assets funded by non-interest bearing liabilities was 45 basis points for 2019, compared to 41 basis points for 2018.\nAverage earning assets increased $5.4 billion or 18% over 2018, largely due to acquired loans from the CoBiz acquisition combined with the expansion of the available for sale securities portfolio. Average loans, net of allowance for loan losses, increased $3.4 billion. The average balance of available for sale securities increased $1.8 billion. Total average deposits grew by $2.8 billion over 2018, largely related to acquired deposits. Average interest-bearing transaction deposits increased $2.5 billion. Average short-term borrowings increased $2.9 billion, primarily from increased borrowings from federal funds purchased and the Federal Home Loan Banks.\nTable 2 - Volume/Rate Analysis\n(In

and data processing and communications expense as a result of the revenue recognition standard implemented January 1, 2018. This measure has no effect on net income or earnings per share.\nFees and commissions revenue\nDiversified sources of fees and commissions revenue are a significant part of our business strategy and represented 42% of total revenue for 2020, excluding provision for credit losses and gains and losses on asset sales, securities and derivatives and the change in the fair value of mortgage servicing rights. We believe that a variety of fee revenue sources provides an offset to changes in interest rates, values in the equity markets, commodity prices and consumer spending, all of which can be volatile. As an example of this strength, many of the economic factors such as rising interest rates resulting in growth in net interest revenue or fiduciary and asset management revenue may also decrease mortgage banking production volumes and related trading. We expect growth in other operating revenue to come through offering new products and services and by further development of our presence in other markets. However, current and future economic conditions, including the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, regulatory constraints, increased competition and saturation in our existing markets could affect the rate of future increases.\nBrokerage and trading revenue, which includes revenues from trading, customer hedging, retail broker and investment banking, increased $62.0 million or 39% over the prior year.\nTrading revenue includes net realized and unrealized gains and losses primarily related to sales of residential mortgage-backed securities guaranteed by U.S. government agencies and related derivative instruments that enable our mortgage-banking customers to manage their production risk. Trading revenue also includes net realized and unrealized gains and losses on municipal securities, asset-backed securities and other financial instruments that we sell to institutional customers, along with changes in the fair value of financial instruments we hold as economic hedges against market risk of our trading securities. Trading revenue was $144.3 million for 2020, an increase of $55.7 million over 2019. Industry-wide mortgage loan production increased in 2020 driven by lower interest rates as the Federal Reserve stepped in to provide market stability. We increased our bond trading pipeline to provide greater liquidity to the housing market during a time of record loan production volumes.\nCustomer hedging revenue is based primarily on realized and unrealized changes in the fair value of derivative contracts held for customer risk management programs. As more fully discussed under Customer Derivative Programs in Note 3 of the Consolidated Financial Statements, we offer commodity, interest rate, foreign exchange and equity derivatives to our customers. Derivative contracts executed with customers are offset with contracts between selected counterparties and exchanges to minimize market risk from changes in commodity prices, interest rates or foreign exchange rates. Customer hedging revenue totaled $22.7 million for 2020, an increase of $3.8 million or 20% compared to 2019. Customer hedging revenue on energy derivatives is up $12.2 million as energy customers have increased hedging activity in the volatile commodity price environment. This is offset by a $9.6 million decrease on to-be-announced derivatives reflecting a shift in the mix of our to-be-announced residential mortgage-backed securities contracts from our customer hedging program to our trading program.\nRevenue earned from retail brokerage transactions totaled $15.7 million for 2020, relatively consistent with the prior year. Retail brokerage revenue is primarily based on fees and commissions earned on sales of fixed income securities, annuities, mutual funds and other financial instruments to retail customers. Revenue is primarily based on the volume of customer transactions and applicable commission rate for each type of product.\nInsurance brokerage fees were $12.7 million for 2020, a decrease of $1.2 million compared to the prior year.\nInvestment banking, which includes fees earned upon completion of underwriting, financial advisory services and loan syndication fees, totaled $26.4 million for 2020, an increase of $4.1 million or 18% compared to 2019, related to the timing and volume of completed transactions.\nTransaction card revenue depends largely on the volume and amount of transactions processed, the number of TransFund automated teller machine ( ATM\u201d) locations and the number of merchants served. Transaction card revenue totaled $90.2 million for 2020, a $3.0 million or 3% increase over 2019. Revenues from the processing of transactions on behalf of the members of our TransFund electronic funds transfer (\"EFT\") network totaled $78.4 million, up $1.0 million or 1% over 2019. The number of TransFund ATM locations totaled 2,599 at December 31, 2020 compared to 2,463 at December 31, 2019. Merchant services fees paid by customers for account management and electronic processing of card transactions totaled $9.2 million, relatively consistent with the prior year.\nFiduciary and asset management revenue is earned through managing or holding of assets for customers and executing transactions or providing related services. Approximately 90% of fiduciary and asset management revenue is primarily based on the fair value of assets. Rates applied to those asset values vary based on the nature of the relationship. Fiduciary and managed asset relationships generally have a higher fee rate than non-fiduciary and/or managed relationships.\nFiduciary and asset management revenue decreased $9.6 million or 5% compared to 2019. The low rate environment has put pressure on our mutual fund revenue streams, partially offset by increased trust and managed account fees from higher client asset balances.We also had approximately $5.6 million in fee waivers during 2020 as a result of the significant decline in interest rates. We have voluntarily waived certain administration fees on the Cavanal Hill money market funds in order to maintain positive yields on these funds in the current low short-term interest rate environment.\nA distribution of assets under management or administration and related fiduciary and asset management revenue follows:\nTable 4 -- Assets Under Management or Administration\nTable 13:

or 70% increase compared to 2019. Mortgage production revenue increased $83.1 million. Production volume is up $1.0 billion as average primary interest rates decreased 84 basis points compared to 2019. Gain on sale margin also increased 172 basis points to 3.16%. A rapid decrease in interest rates has led to increased application demand and industry-wide capacity constraints. Mortgage servicing revenue was $56.5 million, an $8.3 million decrease compared to the prior year. The outstanding principal balance of mortgage loans serviced for others totaled $16.2 billion at December 31, 2020, a $4.5 billion decrease compared to December 31, 2019, largely due to our strategic decision to focus on higher-margin products and distribution channels along with a sale of mortgage servicing rights. During the second quarter of 2020, we completed a sale of mortgage servicing rights on $1.6 billion of unpaid principal balance, primarily related to loans guaranteed by the Veteran's Administration. Completion of this sale meaningfully reduced the future expected credit losses in the servicing portfolio.\nTable 6 - Mortgage Banking Revenue\n(In thousands)\nTable 15: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Mortgage production revenue\n</td> <td>$ </td> <td>125,848 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>42,720 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>31,690 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>38,498 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>69,628 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Mortgage loans funded for sale\n</td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,764,112 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,973,291 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,587,297 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,286,873 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>6,117,417 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Add: Current year end outstanding commitments\n</td> <td>380,637 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>158,460 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>160,848 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>222,919 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>318,359 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less: Prior year end outstanding commitments\n</td> <td>158,460 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>160,848 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>222,919 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>318,359 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>601,147 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total mortgage production volume\n</td> <td>3,986,289 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,970,903 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,525,226 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,191,433 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,834,629 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain on sale margin\n</td> <td>3.16 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>1.44 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>1.25 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>1.21 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>1.19 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Mortgage loan refinances to mortgage loans funded for sale\n</td> <td>58 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>44 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>28 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>40 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>51 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Primary mortgage interest rates:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average\n</td> <td>3.10 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>3.94 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>4.54 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>3.99 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>3.65 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Period end\n</td> <td>2.67 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>3.74 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>4.55 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>3.99 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>4.32 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Mortgage servicing revenue\n</td> <td>$ </td> <td>56,512 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>64,821 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>66,097 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>66,221 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>64,286 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average outstanding principal balance of mortgage loans serviced for others\n</td> <td>18,422,210 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>21,257,462 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>21,891,749 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>22,055,002 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>20,837,897 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average mortgage servicing fee rates\n</td> <td>0.31 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>0.30 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>0.30 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>0.30 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>0.31 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nPrimary rates disclosed in Table 6 above represent rates generally available to borrowers on 30 year conforming mortgage loans.\nNet gains on securities, derivatives and other assets\nAs discussed in the Market Risk section following, the fair value of our mortgage servicing rights (\"MSRs\") changes in response to changes in primary mortgage loan rates and other assumptions. We attempt to mitigate the earnings volatility caused by changes in the fair value of MSRs by designating certain financial instruments as an economic hedge. Changes in the fair value of these instruments are generally expected to partially offset changes in the fair value of MSRs.\nThe net economic benefit of the changes in fair value of mortgage servicing rights and related economic hedges was $24.9 million in 2020, including a $95.3 million increase in the fair value of securities and derivative contracts held as an economic hedge, offset by a $79.5 million decrease in the fair value of mortgage servicing rights and $9.1 million of related net interest revenue.\nThe net economic cost of changes in the fair value of mortgage servicing rights and related economic hedges was $17.9 million in 2019. The fair value of mortgage servicing rights decreased $53.5 million. The fair value of securities and interest rate derivative contracts held as an economic hedge increased $30.4 million. Net interest earned on securities held as an economic hedge was $5.2 million.\nThe significant improvement in results versus 2019 was due to the combination of a more favorable mortgage servicing rights risk profile; increased volume and carry on the hedge portfolio; positive hedge strategy performance; and positive economics on the sale of GNMA servicing rights.\nTable 7 - Gain (Loss) on Mortgage Servicing Rights, Net of Economic Hedge\n(In thousands)\nTable 16: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain (loss) on mortgage hedge derivative contracts, net </td> <td>$ </td> <td>42,096 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>14,589 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>551 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>681 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(15,696) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain (loss) on fair value option securities, net </td> <td>53,248 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15,787 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(25,572) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2,733) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(10,555) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain (loss) on economic hedge of mortgage servicing rights </td> <td>95,344 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>30,376 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(25,021) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2,052) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(26,251) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain (loss) on change in fair value of mortgage servicing rights </td> <td>(79,524) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(53,517) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,668 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>172 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2,193) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain (loss) on changes in fair value of mortgage servicing rights, net of economic hedges included in other operating revenue\n</td> <td>15,820 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(23,141) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(20,353) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,880) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(28,444) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net interest revenue on fair value option securities1\n</td> <td>9,085 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,214 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,798 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,435 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,356 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total economic benefit (cost) of changes in the fair value of mortgage servicing rights, net of economic hedges\n</td> <td>$ </td> <td>24,905 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(17,927) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(15,555) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>6,555 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(24,088) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n1 Actual interest earned on fair value option securities less internal transfer-priced cost of funds.\nFourth Quarter 2020 Other Operating Revenue\nOther operating revenue was $196.8 million for the fourth quarter of 2020, an $18.2 million or 10% increase over the fourth quarter of 2019.\nMortgage banking revenue was $39.3 million for the fourth quarter of 2020, an increase of $13.9 million. A decrease in mortgage interest rates in 2020 increased mortgage loan production. Mortgage loan production volumes were $819 million for the fourth quarter of 2020, compared to $635 million in the fourth quarter of 2019. The fourth quarter of 2020 included a $6.0 million increase in the fair value of mortgage servicing rights, net of economic hedges, while the fourth quarter of 2019 included a $3.7 million decrease.\nOther gains and losses, net, increased $7.0 million largely due to changes in the fair value of assets related to the deferred compensation plan and equity securities not held for trading purposes.\nBrokerage and trading revenue was $39.5 million for the fourth quarter of 2020, a decrease of $4.3 million, largely due to the shift of brokerage and trading fee revenue to net interest revenue partially offset by increased customer hedging fees and investment banking revenue. Fiduciary and asset management revenue decreased $3.2 million while deposit service charges decreased $3.0 million.\n2019 Other Operating Revenue\nOther operating revenue totaled $694.4 million for 2019, an increase of $77.6 million or 13% compared to 2018 driven by growth in brokerage and trading revenue and mortgage banking revenue. A $15.4 million fee earned through the sale of client assets was recognized as fiduciary and asset management revenue in 2018. This fee is excluded from the fluctuation discussion below.\nBrokerage and trading revenue for 2019 increased $51.5 million compared to 2018. Lower mortgage interest rates during 2019 increased customer mortgage-backed trading activities. Trading revenue increased $60.5 million in 2019. Customer hedging revenue decreased $19.9 million compared to 2018. This is reflective of a shift in the mix of our to-be-announced residential mortgage-backed securities contracts from our customer hedging program to our trading program. Insurance brokerage fees increased $9.7 million compared to 2018 due to a full of year of operations with the addition of CoBiz in October, 2018.\nTransaction card revenue grew by $3.2 million over 2018, primarily due to growth in transaction volumes. Fiduciary and asset management revenue grew $7.7 million over 2018, primarily due to growth in managed fiduciary assets.\nMortgage banking revenue increased by $9.8 million over 2018. Lower mortgage interest rates led to an increase in the supply of mortgage applications.\nOther Operating Expense\nOther operating expense for 2020 totaled $1.2 billion, a $33.6 million or 3% increase over the prior year. CoBiz added $17.2 million in integration costs during 2019. Excluding those costs, operating expense increased $50.8 million, largely related to incentive compensation. The fluctuation discussion below excludes the impact of closing and integration costs.\nTable 8 - Other Operating Expense\n(In thousands)\nTable 17: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

2016-2017 between transaction card revenue and data processing and communications expense as a result of the revenue recognition standard implemented January 1, 2018. This measure has no effect on net income or earnings per share.\nPersonnel expense\nPersonnel expense increased $30.8 million in 2020. Incentive compensation increased $41.8 million or 25% over 2019. Cash-based incentive compensation plans, which are either intended to provide current rewards to employees who generate long-term business opportunities for the Company based on growth in loans, deposits, customer relationships and other measurable metrics or intended to compensate employees with commissions on completed transactions, grew $41.6 million or 29% over 2019, largely related to the growth in mortgage-backed securities trading activities. This increase was partially offset by lower employee benefits costs of $7.2 million or 8%, largely related to decreased employee healthcare costs.\nNon-personnel expense\nNon-personnel expense increased $20.0 million or 4% over the prior year.\nData processing and communications expense increased $12.5 million or 10% primarily due to technology project costs. Occupancy and equipment expense increased $6.4 million or 6%, largely due to increased cleaning costs during the pandemic as well as increased depreciation costs. Mortgage banking expense increased $6.0 million or 12%, primarily due to an increase in prepayments and accruals related to default servicing and loss mitigation costs on loans serviced for others. Charitable contributions to the BOKF Foundation increased $6.0 million as we focus on the communities we serve and the extreme needs created by the pandemic. Professional fees increased $5.0 million or 10%. Net losses and operating expenses of repossessed assets increased $4.0 million or 60% over the prior year mainly due to write-downs on a set of oil and gas properties and a retail commercial real estate property during the year.\nBusiness promotion costs, consisting largely of travel and entertainment and advertising costs, were down $19.5 million or 57%, primarily due to the effects of the current pandemic.\nFourth Quarter 2020 Operating Expenses\nOther operating expense for the fourth quarter of 2020 totaled $300.7 million, an increase of $11.9 million over the fourth quarter of 2019.\nPersonnel expense increased $7.8 million over the fourth quarter of 2019 An increase in incentive compensation costs of $12.2 million was partially offset by a decrease of $3.4 million in regular compensation. Cash-based incentive compensation increased $11.4 million due to increased activity, particularly in the mortgage banking and trading areas. Deferred compensation expense increased $3.1 million, which is largely offset by changes in the fair value of assets held in rabbi trusts for the benefit of participants. Share-based compensation expense, which represents expense for equity awards based on the grant date fair value, decreased $2.3 million due to changes in vesting assumptions related to performance-based share awards.\nNon-personnel expense increased $4.1 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2019. Data processing and communications costs increased $3.2 million related to technology projects. Charitable contributions to the BOKF Foundation increased $4.0 million. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in business promotion expense of $5.1 million, largely related to lower travel and entertainment costs during the pandemic.\n2019 Operating Expenses\nOther operating expense totaled $1.1 billion for 2019, a $104.2 million or 10% increase over 2018. CoBiz added $17.2 million in closing and integration costs in 2019 and $16.6 million in 2018. The fluctuation discussion below excludes these costs.\nPersonnel expense increased $80.3 million in 2019. Regular compensation expense increased $36.0 million, largely related to the addition of CoBiz employees. Incentive compensation grew $37.6 million, primarily related to increased sales activities and the addition of CoBiz employees. Cash based incentive compensation grew $16.5 million over 2018. Share-based incentive compensation increased $11.3 million due to an increase in the vesting probability of certain performance-based share awards. Deferred compensation expense increased $9.8 million. This expense is largely offset by changes in the fair value of assets held in rabbi trusts for the benefit of participants, which is included in other gains (losses).\nNon-personnel expense increased $23.3 million or 5% over 2018. Intangible asset amortization increased $11.0 million due to the addition of CoBiz. Occupancy and equipment expense increased $8.4 million, primarily related to the addition of CoBiz operations. Data processing and communications expense increased $8.5 million due to technology project costs. Mortgage banking costs increased $4.4 million, largely due to an increase in prepayments.\nNet losses and operating expenses of repossessed assets decreased $10.3 million compared to 2018 mainly due to write-downs on a set of oil and gas properties and a healthcare property in 2018. Insurance expense decreased $2.6 million, largely due to the elimination of a large bank deposit insurance surcharge assessed by the FDIC in the fourth quarter of 2018.\nIncome Taxes\nIncome tax expense was $128.8 million or 22.8% of net income before taxes for 2020, $130.2 million or 20.6% of net income before taxes for 2019 and $119.1 million or 21.1% of net income before taxes for 2018.\nNet deferred tax liabilities totaled $9.5 million at December 31, 2020 compared to net deferred tax liabilities of $26 million at December 31, 2019. We have evaluated the recoverability of our deferred tax assets based on the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible and determined that no valuation allowance was required in 2020 and 2019.\nIncome tax expense was $45.1 million or 22.6% of net income before taxes for the fourth quarter of 2020 compared to $30.3 million or 21.5% of net income before taxes for the fourth quarter of 2019.\nTable 9 - Selected Quarterly Financial Data (Unaudited)\n(In thousands, except per share data)\nTable 18: <table><tr><td> </td>

Consumer Banking and Wealth Management. Commercial Banking includes lending, treasury and cash management services and customer risk management products for small businesses, middle market and larger commercial customers. Commercial Banking also includes the TransFund EFT network. Consumer Banking includes retail lending and deposit services, lending and deposit services to small business customers served through our consumer branch network and all mortgage loan origination and servicing activities. Wealth Management provides fiduciary services, private bank services, insurance and investment advisory services in all markets. Wealth Management also underwrites state and municipal securities and engages in brokerage and trading activities.\nIn addition to our lines of business, we have a Funds Management unit. The primary purpose of this unit is to manage our overall liquidity needs and interest rate risk. Each line of business borrows funds from and provides funds to the Funds Management unit as needed to support their operations. Operating results for Funds Management and other include the effect of interest rate risk positions and risk management activities, securities gains and losses including impairment charges, the provision for credit losses in excess of net loans charged off, tax planning strategies and certain executive compensation costs that are not attributed to the lines of business. The Funds Management unit also initially recognizes accruals for loss contingencies when losses become probable. Actual losses are recognized by the lines of business if the accruals are settled.\nWe allocate resources and evaluate the performance of our lines of business using the net direct contribution, which includes the allocation of funds, actual net credit losses and capital costs. In addition, we measure the performance of our business lines after allocations of certain indirect expenses and taxes based on statutory rates.\nThe cost of funds borrowed from the Funds Management unit by the operating lines of business is transfer priced at rates that approximate market rates for funds with similar repricing and cash flow characteristics. Market rates are generally based on the applicable LIBOR or interest rate swap rates, adjusted for prepayment risk and liquidity risk. This method of transfer-pricing funds that support assets of the operating lines of business tends to insulate them from interest rate risk.\nThe value of funds provided by the operating lines of business to the Funds Management unit is also based on rates that approximate wholesale market rates for funds with similar repricing and cash flow characteristics. Market rates are generally based on LIBOR or interest rate swap rates. The funds credit formula applied to deposit products with indeterminate maturities is established based on their repricing characteristics reflected in a combination of the short-term LIBOR rate and a moving average of an intermediate term swap rate, with an appropriate spread applied to both. Shorter duration products are weighted towards the short term LIBOR rate and longer duration products are weighted towards the intermediate swap rates. The expected duration ranges from 30 days for certain rate-sensitive deposits to five years. During 2018, the funds transfer pricing rates for non-maturity deposits became inverted due to the flattening of the yield curve. Short term rates continued to increase while long term rates remained relatively flat. In order to appropriately reflect the organizational value of these deposits to the lines of business, we increased the funding credit to reflect the upward rate moves. Those adjustments are set annually each January. During 2019, short-term rates moved down materially, which was reflected in the funding credit to the business lines beginning in January, 2020.\nEconomic capital is assigned to the business units by a capital allocation model that reflects management's assessment of risk. This model assigns capital based upon credit, operating, interest rate and other market risk inherent in our business lines and recognizes the diversification benefits among the units. The level of assigned economic capital is a combination of the risk taken by each business line, based on its actual exposures and calibrated to its own loss history where possible. Average invested capital includes economic capital and amounts we have invested in the lines of business.\nAs shown in Table 10 following, net income attributable to our lines of business decreased $9.8 million or 2% compared to the prior year. Net interest revenue decreased by $119.0 million compared to the prior year, primarily due to decreases in the short-term interest rate related to a 225 basis point reduction in the federal funds rate by the Federal Reserve since the middle of 2019. Net charge-offs were up $27.1 million over the prior year. Other operating revenue increased $130.6 million led by our brokerage and trading and mortgage banking businesses. Other operating expense increased $57.3 million compared to prior year, largely due to increased incentive compensation related to trading activities. The increase in net loss attributed to Funds Management and other is largely due to the excess provision for expected credit losses over net charge-offs.\nTable 10 - Net Income by Line of Business\n(In thousands)\nTable 20: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial Banking </td> <td>$ </td> <td>306,005 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>374,806 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>333,515 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consumer Banking </td> <td>95,360 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>56,606 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>25,399 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Wealth Management </td> <td>115,628 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>95,331 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>86,027 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Subtotal </td> <td>516,993 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>526,743 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>444,941 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Funds Management and other </td> <td>(81,963) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(25,985) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>705 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total </td> <td>$ </td> <td>435,030 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>500,758 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>445,646 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nCommercial Banking\nCommercial Banking contributed $306.0 million to consolidated net income in 2020, a decrease of $68.8 million or 18% compared to prior year.\nTable 11 -

Yields on deposits sold to the Funds Management unit decreased as the value of deposits was impacted by falling interest rates. Net loans charged-off increased $30.5 million.\nFees and commissions revenue increased $18.5 million or 11% due to growth in customer energy hedging revenue and an increase in revenues from the processing of transactions on behalf of the members of our TransFund EFT network.\nOperating expense increased $6.4 million or 3% over 2019. Non-personnel expense increased $10.4 million or 12%. Increases in data processing and communications expense, occupancy and equipment expense, intangible amortization and deposit insurance costs were partially offset by a decrease in business promotion expense. Personnel expense decreased $3.9 million or 2%. An decrease in incentive compensation costs was partially offset by an increase in regular compensation. Corporate expense allocations decreased $18.2 million or 42% compared to the prior year.\nThe average outstanding balance of loans attributed to Commercial Banking was up $621 million or 3% over 2019 to $18.7 billion, primarily due to the full year benefit of acquired loans from CoBiz. Prior to April 1, 2019, CoBiz loans were attributed to Funds Management and other. See the Loans section of Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial condition following for additional discussion of changes in commercial and commercial real estate loans, which are primarily attributed to the Commercial Banking segment.\nAverage deposits attributed to Commercial Banking were $14.3 billion for 2020, a 39% increase over the prior year. See Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital for further discussion of change.\nConsumer Banking\nConsumer Banking services are provided through four primary distribution channels: traditional branches, the 24-hour ExpressBank call center, Internet banking and mobile banking. Consumer Banking also conducts mortgage banking activities through offices located outside of our Consumer Banking markets. In the first quarter of 2019, the strategic decision was made to exit our online lead buying business, HomeDirect, to focus more on our core competency of developing complete, long-term relationships with our clients through our traditional mortgage origination channel.\nNet income attributed to Consumer Banking totaled $95.4 million for 2020, compared to $56.6 million in the prior year. Improved performance by Consumer Banking was largely due to the effect of lower mortgage interest rates, which has increased mortgage banking activity and related revenue.\nTable 12 - Consumer Banking\n(Dollars in thousands)\nTable 22: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net interest revenue from external sources\n</td> <td>$ </td> <td>78,004 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>99,679 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>83,231 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net interest revenue from internal sources\n</td> <td>69,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>95,775 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>73,448 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total net interest revenue </td> <td>147,004 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>195,454 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>156,679 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net loans charged off </td> <td>2,805 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,271 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,143 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net interest revenue after net loans charged off\n</td> <td>144,199 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>189,183 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>151,536 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fees and commissions revenue </td> <td>245,554 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>187,996 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>178,174 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other losses, net\n</td> <td>(1,835) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(496) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(51) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other operating revenue </td> <td>243,719 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>187,500 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>178,123 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Personnel expense </td> <td>93,966 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>96,518 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>96,234 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other non-personnel expense </td> <td>139,459 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>134,398 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>134,841 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total other operating expense </td> <td>233,425 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>230,916 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>231,075 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net direct contribution </td> <td>154,493 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>145,767 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>98,584 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain (loss) on financial instruments, net </td> <td>95,344 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>30,375 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(25,021) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Change in fair value of mortgage servicing rights </td> <td>(79,524) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(53,517) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,668 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain on repossessed assets, net </td> <td>276 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>496 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>247 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Corporate expense allocations </td> <td>42,638 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>47,169 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>44,398 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income before taxes </td> <td>127,951 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>75,952 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>34,080 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Federal and state income taxes </td> <td>32,591 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>19,346 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,681 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income </td> <td>$ </td> <td>95,360 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>56,606 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>25,399 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average assets </td> <td>$ </td> <td>9,842,125 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>9,301,341 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>8,303,263 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average loans </td> <td>1,764,682 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,762,915 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,731,894 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average deposits </td> <td>7,599,937 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,876,676 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,560,145 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average invested capital </td> <td>259,333 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>294,923 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>292,791 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet interest revenue from Consumer Banking activities decreased by $48.5 million or 25% compared to 2019, primarily due to a decrease in the yield on deposits sold to our Funds Management unit. Average consumer deposits grew $723 million with demand deposit balances up by $470 million or 22%.\nFees and commissions revenue increased $57.6 million or 31% over the prior year. Lower mortgage interest rates increased mortgage loan origination volumes. Mortgage production volume increased $1.0 billion or 34% and gain on sale margin increased 172 basis points due to industry-wide capacity constraints. Deposit service charges decreased $15.4 million. During these uncertain times, we proactively waived certain fees. In addition, the pandemic has resulted in customers retaining cash and not maintaining the usual level of spending, which has decreased overdraft fees compared to the prior year. Operating expense increased $2.5 million or 1% over 2019. An increase in mortgage banking costs was largely offset by lower business promotion expenses. Corporate expense allocations were $4.5 million or 10% lower than the prior year.\nChanges in the fair value of our mortgage servicing rights, net of economic hedges, as more fully presented in Table 7, resulted in a $15.8 million increase to pre-tax net income for 2020 compared to a $23.1 million decrease to pre-tax net income in 2019.\nWealth Management\nWealth Management contributed $115.6 million to consolidated net income in 2020, up $20.3 million or 21% over the prior year. Increased fees and commissions revenue, primarily from U.S. agency residential mortgage-backed securities and related derivatives trading, was partially offset by related incentive compensation costs.\nTable 13 - Wealth Management\n(Dollars in thousands)\nTable 23: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net interest revenue from external sources\n</td> <td>$ </td> <td>130,818 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>61,277 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>81,528 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net interest revenue from internal sources\n</td> <td>(13,528) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>38,815 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>31,480 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total net interest revenue </td> <td>117,290 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100,092 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>113,008 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net loans recovered </td> <td>(209) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(308) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(288) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net interest revenue after net loans recovered\n</td> <td>117,499 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100,400 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>113,296 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fees and commissions revenue </td> <td>399,229 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>341,333 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>296,465 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other gains (losses), net\n</td> <td>(395) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>56 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(96) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other operating revenue </td> <td>398,834 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>341,389 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>296,369 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Personnel expense </td> <td>243,461 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>201,368 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>184,144 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other non-personnel expense </td> <td>82,147 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>75,899 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>73,506 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other operating expense </td> <td>325,608 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>277,267 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>257,650 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net direct contribution </td> <td>190,725 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>164,522 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>152,015 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain on financial instruments, net </td> <td>4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Corporate expense allocations </td> <td>35,331 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>36,239 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>35,920 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income before taxes </td> <td>155,398 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>128,285 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>116,102 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Federal and state income tax </td> <td>39,770 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>32,954 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>30,075 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income </td> <td>$ </td> <td>115,628 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>95,331 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>86,027 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average assets </td> <td>$ </td> <td>15,695,646 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>10,204,426 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>8,447,784 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average loans </td> <td>1,758,226 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,609,464 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,423,126 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average deposits </td> <td>8,676,047 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,447,987 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,617,325 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average invested capital </td> <td>300,860 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>274,599 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>251,401 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenue attributed to the Wealth Management segment totaled $516.1 million for 2020, a $74.6 million or 17% increase over the previous year. Net interest revenue increased $17.2 million and fees and commissions revenue increased $57.9 million.\nDemand for mortgage loans and related derivative contracts increased significantly due to a decrease in mortgage interest rates that began in early 2020 and continued throughout the year. We expanded trading activities that provide liquidity to our mortgage banking customers and enable them to manage their market risk. Our expanded trading activities are subject to limits established by the Board of Directors as discussed in the Market Risk section following. Growth in transaction volumes resulted in an $89.7 million increase in combined net interest revenue and trading revenue. Our level of trading volume is largely dependent on industry-wide mortgage loan production.\nGrowth in total revenue from expanded trading activities was partially offset by decreased net interest revenue generated by deposits sold to our Funds Management unit and loans attributed to the Wealth Management segment, and fiduciary and asset management fees. Both were negatively affected by the current low short-term interest rate environment.\nOperating expense increased $48.3 million or 17% over the prior year. Personnel expense increased $42.1 million or 21% primarily related to incentive compensation as a result of higher trading activity. Non-personnel expense increased $6.2 million or 8% over 2019. Corporate expense allocations were relatively consistent compared to the prior year.\nFinancial Condition\nSecurities\nWe maintain a securities portfolio to enhance profitability, manage interest rate risk, provide liquidity and comply with regulatory requirements.

</tr>\n</table>\n1 Effective with the adoption of FASB ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326) on January 1, 2020.\nWe maintain an inventory of trading securities in support of sales to a variety of customers, including banks, corporations, insurance companies, money managers and others. As discussed in the Market Risk section of this report, trading activities involve risk of loss from adverse price movement. We mitigate this risk within board-approved limits through the use of derivative contracts, short-sales and other techniques. These limits remain unchanged from levels set before our expanded trading activities. For further discussion of growth in trading securities, see \"Lines of Business\" section of Management's Discussion and Analysis.\nInvestment securities consist primarily of intermediate and long-term, fixed rate Oklahoma and Texas municipal bonds and taxable Texas school construction bonds. The investment security portfolio is diversified among issuers.\nAvailable for sale securities, which may be sold prior to maturity, are carried at fair value. Unrealized gains or losses, net of deferred taxes, are recorded as accumulated other comprehensive income in shareholders' equity. The amortized cost of available for sale securities totaled $12.6 billion at December 31, 2020, an increase of $1.5 billion compared to December 31, 2019. Available for sale securities consist primarily of U.S. government agency residential mortgage-backed securities and U.S. government agency commercial mortgage-backed securities. Both residential and commercial mortgage-backed securities have credit risk from delinquency or default of the underlying loans. We mitigate this risk by primarily investing in securities issued by U.S. government agencies. Principal and interest payments on the underlying loans are fully guaranteed. Commercial mortgage-backed securities have prepayment penalties similar to commercial loans. At December 31, 2020, residential mortgage-backed securities represented 72% of total available for sale securities.\nA primary risk of holding residential mortgage-backed securities comes from extension during periods of rising interest rates or prepayment during periods of falling interest rates. We evaluate this risk through extensive modeling of risk both before making an investment and throughout the life of the security. Our best estimate of the effective duration of the combined residential mortgage-backed securities portfolio held in investment and available for sale securities portfolios at December 31, 2020 is 2.3 years. Management estimates the combined portfolios' duration extends to 4.0 years assuming an immediate 200 basis point upward shock. The estimated duration contracts to 1.9 years assuming a 100 basis point decline in the current low rate environment.\nThe aggregate gross amount of unrealized losses on available for sale securities totaled $8.8 million at December 31, 2020, an $11.4 million decrease compared to December 31, 2019. On a quarterly basis, we perform an evaluation on debt securities to determine if the unrealized losses are temporary as more fully described in Note 2 of the Consolidated Financial Statements. No other-than-temporary impairment charges were recognized in earnings in 2020.\nCertain residential mortgage-backed securities issued by U.S. government agencies and included in Fair value option securities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets have been segregated and designated as economic hedges of changes in the fair value of our mortgage servicing rights. We have elected to carry these securities at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in current period income. These securities are held with the intent that gains or losses will offset changes in the fair value of mortgage servicing rights and related derivative contracts. Fair value option securities totaled $115 million, a decrease of $984 million. See Market Risk section for further details.\nBank-Owned Life Insurance\nWe have approximately $399 million of bank-owned life insurance at December 31, 2020. This investment is expected to provide a long-term source of earnings to support existing employee benefit programs. Approximately $308 million is held in separate accounts. Our separate account holdings are invested in diversified portfolios of investment-grade fixed income securities and cash equivalents, including U.S. Treasury and Agency securities, residential mortgage-backed securities, corporate debt, asset-backed and commercial mortgage-backed securities. The portfolios are managed by unaffiliated professional managers within parameters established in the portfolio's investment guidelines. The cash surrender value of certain life insurance policies is further supported by a stable value wrap, which protects against changes in the fair value of the investments. As of December 31, 2020, the fair value of investments held in separate accounts was approximately $331 million. As the underlying fair value of the investments held in a separate account at December 31, 2020 exceeded the net book value of the investments, no cash surrender value was supported by the stable value wrap. The stable value wrap is provided by a domestic financial institution. The remaining cash surrender value of $91 million primarily represents the cash surrender value of policies held in general accounts and other amounts due from various insurance companies.\nLoans\nThe aggregate loan portfolio before allowance for loan losses totaled $23.0 billion at December 31, 2020, an increase of $1.3 billion over December 31, 2019, primarily due to PPP loans, partially offset by commercial loan paydowns.\nTable 15 - Loans\n(In thousands)\nTable 25: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

and other needs of commercial customers primarily located within our geographical footprint. Commercial loans are underwritten individually and represent ongoing relationships based on a thorough knowledge of the customer, the customer's industry and market. While commercial loans are generally secured by the customer's assets including real property, inventory, accounts receivable, operating equipment, interests in mineral rights and other property and may also include personal guarantees of the owners and related parties, the primary source of repayment of the loans is the on-going cash flow from operations of the customer's business. Inherent lending risks are centrally monitored on a continuous basis from underwriting throughout the life of the loan for compliance with commercial lending policies.\nCommercial loans totaled $13.1 billion or 57% of the loan portfolio at December 31, 2020, decreasing $954 million or 7% compared to December 31, 2019. Borrowers continue to reduce leverage during this time of economic uncertainty.\nApproximately 78% of loans in this segment are located within our geographic footprint, based on collateral location. Loans for which the collateral location is less relevant, such as unsecured loans and reserve-based energy loans are categorized by the borrower's primary operating location. The largest concentration of loans in this segment outside of our footprint is California, totaling 5% of the segment.\nSupporting the energy industry with loans to producers and other energy-related entities has been a hallmark of the Company since its founding and represents a large portion of our commercial loan portfolio. In addition, energy production and related industries have a significant impact on the economy in our primary markets. Loans collateralized by oil and gas properties are subject to a semi-annual engineering review by our internal staff of petroleum engineers. This review is used as the basis for developing the expected cash flows supporting the loan amount. The projected cash flows are discounted according to risk characteristics of the underlying oil and gas properties. Loans are evaluated to demonstrate with reasonable certainty that crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids can be recovered from known oil and gas reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions at current pricing levels and with existing conventional equipment and operating methods and costs. As part of our evaluation of credit quality, we analyze rigorous stress tests over a range of commodity prices and take proactive steps to mitigate risk when appropriate.\nOutstanding energy loans totaled $3.5 billion or 15% of total loans at December 31, 2020. Approximately $2.6 billion or 76% of energy loans were to oil and gas producers, a $497 million decrease compared to December 31, 2019. The majority of this portfolio is first lien, senior secured, reserve-based lending, which we believe is the lowest risk form of energy lending. Approximately 67% of the committed production loans are secured by properties primarily producing oil and 33% of the committed production loans are secured by properties primarily producing natural gas.\nLoans to midstream oil and gas companies totaled $700 million or 20% of energy loans, an increase of $91 million over the prior year. Loans to borrowers that provide services to the energy industry totaled $110 million or 3% of energy loans, a decrease of $68 million during 2020. Loans to other energy borrowers, including those engaged in wholesale or retail energy sales totaled $36 million or 1% of energy loans, a decrease of $31 million compared to the prior year.\nUnfunded energy loan commitments were $2.4 billion at December 31, 2020, down $524 million compared to December 31, 2019 as a result of the semi-annual borrowing base redetermination process in the second and fourth quarters of 2020.\nThe healthcare sector of the loan portfolio totaled $3.3 billion or 14% of total loans. Healthcare loans increased $272 million over December 31, 2019, primarily due to growth in loans to senior housing and care facilities. Healthcare sector loans consist primarily of loans for the development and operation of senior housing and care facilities, including independent living, assisted living and skilled nursing. Generally we loan to borrowers with a portfolio of multiple facilities that serves to help diversify risks specific to a single facility. Healthcare also includes loans to hospitals and other medical service providers impacted by a deferral of elective procedures. The CARES Act includes multiple revenue enhancement measures for both hospitals and skilled nursing facilities as they manage through the risks of the virus.\nThe services sector of the loan portfolio decreased $323 million to $3.5 billion or 15% of total loans. Service sector loans consist of a large number of loans to a variety of businesses, including Native American tribal and state and local governments, Native American tribal casino operations, educational services, foundations and not-for-profit organizations and specialty trade contractors. Approximately $1.9 billion of the services category is made up of loans with individual balances of less than $10 million. Service sector loans are generally secured by the assets of the borrower with repayment coming from the cash flows of ongoing operations of the customer's business.\nGeneral business loans decreased $399 million to $2.8 billion or 12% of total loans. General business loans primarily consist of $1.6 billion of wholesale/retail loans and $701 million of loans from other commercial industries.\nOur services and general business loans include areas we consider to be more exposed to the economic slowdown as a result of the social distancing measures in place to combat the COVID-19 pandemic such as entertainment and recreation, retail, hotels, churches, airline travel, and higher education that are dependent on large social gatherings to remain profitable. This represents less than 7 percent of our total portfolio. Some of these borrowers have participated in the PPP, which has provided some measure of relief. We will continue to monitor these areas closely in the coming months.\nWe participate in shared national credits when appropriate to obtain or maintain business relationships with local customers. Shared national credits are defined by banking regulators as credits of more than $100 million and with three or more non-affiliated banks as participants. At December 31, 2020, the outstanding principal balance of these loans totaled $4.1 billion, including $1.8 billion in the energy sector. Approximately 85% of shared national credits are to borrowers with local market relationships. We serve as the agent lender in approximately 21% of our shared national credits, based on dollars committed.\nWe hold shared national credits to the same standard of analysis and perform the same level of review as internally originated credits. Our lending policies generally avoid loans in which we do not have the opportunity to maintain or achieve other business relationships with the customer. In addition to management's quarterly assessment of credit risk, banking regulators annually review a sample of shared national credits for proper risk grading.\nCommercial Real Estate\nCommercial real estate represents loans for the construction of buildings or other improvements to real estate and property held by borrowers for investment purposes generally within our geographical footprint. We require collateral values in excess of the loan amounts, demonstrated cash flows in excess of expected debt service requirements, equity investment in the project and a portion of the project already sold, leased or permanent financing already secured. The expected cash flows from all significant new or renewed income producing property commitments are stress tested to reflect the risks in varying interest rates, vacancy rates and rental rates. As with commercial loans, inherent lending risks are centrally monitored on a continuous basis from underwriting throughout the life of the loan for compliance with applicable lending policies.\nThe commercial real estate loan balance as a percentage of our total loan portfolio has ranged from 20% to 22% over the past five years. The outstanding balance of commercial real estate loans increased $265 million over 2019. Continued friction in the permanent financing market continued to constrain paydown activity. Loans secured by office buildings increased $157 million or 17%. Other real estate loans increased $102 million or 22%. Loans secured by multifamily real estate increased $62 million or 5%. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $46 million or 5% in loans secured by industrial facilities and a decrease of $31 million or 21% in construction and land development loans.\nApproximately 67% of loans in this segment are in our geographic footprint based on collateral location. The largest concentration of loans in this segment outside our footprint is Utah, totaling 8% of the segment, followed by California at 7%. All other states represent less than 5% individually.\nLoans secured by retail facilities and office buildings may be adversely impacted by measures being taken to hinder the spread of the virus as well as changes in consumer behavior.\nPaycheck Protection Program\nWe are actively participating in programs initiated by the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act (\"CARES Act\"), including the Small Business Administration's (\"SBA\") Paycheck Protection Program (\"PPP\") that began on April 3, 2020. PPP provided fully forgivable loans when utilized for qualified expenditures, including to help small business maintain payrolls during the COVID-19 pandemic. These loans generally have a contractual term of two years, though most are expected to be forgiven prior to maturity after completion of a compliance period. Loans are guaranteed and amounts forgiven will be reimbursed to the Company by the SBA. The loans carry a rate of 1 percent. Interest plus loan fees, which vary depending on loan size, are accrued over the contractual life of the loan. Any unaccreted origination fees will be recognized when the loan is paid. Unaccreted origination fees totaled $24 million at December 31, 2020.\nPPP loan balances decreased $415 million to $1.7 billion or 7% of total loans. The complexity of the forgiveness process and borrowers' reluctance to apply for forgiveness in hopes of further legislative action that would relax the requirements has made the forgiveness process slower than initially anticipated. The recent Economic Aid Act will provide substantial forgiveness process relief, particularly for those clients with existing loans of less than $150 thousand, which represents more the 70% of our total PPP loan volume. The Company expects to participate in the newest round of PPP, with largely the same strategy of focusing on our existing client base in order to timely meet our existing clients' needs.\nLoans to Individuals\nLoans to individuals include residential mortgage and personal loans. Residential mortgage loans provide funds for our customers to purchase or refinance their primary residence or to borrow against the equity in their home. These loans are secured by a first or second mortgage on the customer's primary residence. These loans are made in accordance with underwriting policies we believe to be conservative and are fully documented. Loans may be individually underwritten or credit scored based on size and other criteria. Credit scoring is assessed based on significant credit characteristics including credit history, residential and employment stability.\nIn general, we sell the majority of our conforming fixed rate loan originations in the secondary market and retain the majority of our non-conforming and adjustable-rate mortgage loans. Our mortgage loan portfolio does not include payment option adjustable rate mortgage loans or adjustable rate mortgage loans with initial rates that are below market. Home equity loans are primarily first-lien and fully amortizing.\nResidential mortgage, which includes home equity loans, and personal loans are made in accordance with underwriting policies we believe to be conservative and are fully documented. Loans may be individually underwritten or credit scored based on size and other criteria. Credit scoring is assessed based on significant credit characteristics including credit history, residential and employment stability.\nPersonal loans consist primarily of loans to Wealth Management clients secured by the cash surrender value of insurance policies and marketable securities. It also includes direct loans secured by and for the purchase of automobiles, recreational and marine equipment as well as unsecured loans.\nApproximately 91% of the loans in this segment are secured by collateral located within our geographical footprint. Loans for which the collateral location is less relevant, such as unsecured loans are categorized by the borrower's primary operating location.\nResidential mortgage loans guaranteed by U.S. government agencies have limited credit exposure because of the agency guarantee. This amount includes residential mortgage loans previously sold into GNMA mortgage pools that the Company may repurchase when certain defined delinquency criteria are met. Because of this repurchase right, the Company is deemed to have regained effective control over these loans and must include them on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Residential mortgage loans guaranteed by U.S. government agencies increased $211 million compared to December 31, 2019, primarily due to increased delinquencies and CARES Act forbearance. The balances of residential mortgage loans guaranteed by U.S. government agencies are expected to decline during the next few quarters as new forbearance plan requests have remained muted, which will reduce the Company's repurchase activity relative to 2020. Loans that have exited forbearance and have met GNMA requirements will be re-pooled into GNMA mortgage pools.\nThe Company secondarily evaluates loan portfolio performance based on the primary geographical market managing the loan. Loans attributed to a geographical market may not represent the location of the borrower or the collateral. All permanent mortgage loans serviced by our mortgage banking unit and held for investment by the Company are centrally managed by the Oklahoma market.\nTable 20 - Loans Managed by Primary

Loan commitments may be unconditional obligations to provide financing or conditional obligations that depend on the borrower's financial condition, collateral value or other factors. Standby letters of credit are unconditional commitments to guarantee the performance of our customer to a third party. Since some of these commitments are expected to expire before being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements.\nWe have off-balance sheet commitments related to certain residential mortgage loans sold into mortgage-backed securities as part of our mortgage banking activities. We retain off-balance sheet credit risk related to losses in excess of amounts guaranteed by the U.S. Department of Veteran's Affairs (\"VA\"). During the second quarter of 2020, we sold mortgage servicing rights related to residential mortgage loans primarily guaranteed by the VA with an unpaid principal balance of $1.6 billion.\nWe also have off-balance sheet credit risk related to certain residential mortgage loans primarily originated under community development loan programs that were sold to a U.S. government agency with full recourse prior to 2007. We are obligated to repurchase these loans for the life of these loans in the event of foreclosure for the unpaid principal and interest at the time of foreclosure. The majority of our conforming fixed rate loan originations are sold in the secondary market and we only retain repurchase obligations under standard underwriting representations and warranties.\nThe CARES Act provided protections for borrowers with agency-backed residential mortgages that are serviced by the Company. Forbearance must be granted upon receiving a request from a borrower and the borrower's attestation to a financial hardship associated with the COVID-19 emergency. The Bank is required to offer up to a 6 month forbearance, with the possibility of an additional 6 month extension. This program was available to all current and delinquent borrowers, including those in bankruptcy and/or foreclosure. As of December 31, 2020, agency-serviced loans in forbearance included 3,258 borrowers with an unpaid principal balance of $511 million. For certain contracts, we must advance principal and interest payments during the forbearance period. Advances as of December 31, 2020 totaled $5.4 million. Advances are generally reimbursed to us by the appropriate agencies. Loans in forbearance are considered delinquent when payments are not made for purposes of valuing mortgage servicing rights and for purposes of determining GNMA loans that are eligible to be repurchased. As of December 31, 2020, 23% of borrowers in forbearance remained current.\nTable 22 - Off-Balance Sheet Credit Commitments\n(In thousands)\nTable 28: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loan commitments </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>10,967,546 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>11,065,649 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>11,944,525 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>9,958,080 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>9,404,665 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Standby letters of credit </td> <td> </td> <td>681,467 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>645,505 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>582,196 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>647,653 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>585,472 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unpaid principal balance of residential mortgage loans sold with recourse\n</td> <td> </td> <td>73,055 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>88,808 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>98,623 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>125,127 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>139,486 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unpaid principal balance of residential mortgage loans transferred into mortgage-backed securities guaranteed by U.S. Dept. of Veteran's Affairs\n</td> <td> </td> <td>1,442,504 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,375,451 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,585,321 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,337,377 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,822,368 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nCustomer Derivative Programs\nWe offer programs that permit our customers to hedge various risks, including fluctuations in energy, cattle and other agricultural product prices, interest rates and foreign exchange rates. Each of these programs work essentially the same way. Derivative contracts are executed between the customers and the Company. Offsetting contracts are executed between the Company and selected counterparties or exchanges to minimize market risk to us from changes in commodity prices, interest rates or foreign exchange rates. The counterparty contracts are identical to the customer contracts, except for a fixed pricing spread or a fee paid to us as compensation for administrative costs, credit risk and profit.\nThe customer derivative programs create credit risk for potential amounts due to the Company from our customers and from the counterparties. Customer credit risk is monitored through existing credit policies and procedures. The effects of changes in commodity prices, interest rates or foreign exchange rates are evaluated across a range of possible options to determine the maximum exposure we are willing to have individually to any customer. Customers may also be required to provide cash margin or other collateral in conjunction with our credit agreements to further limit our credit risk.\nCounterparty credit risk is evaluated through existing policies and procedures. This evaluation considers the total relationship between BOK Financial and each of the counterparties. Individual limits are established by management, approved by Credit Administration and reviewed by the Asset/Liability Committee. Margin collateral is required if the exposure between the Company and any counterparty exceeds established limits. Based on declines in the counterparties' credit ratings, these limits may be reduced and additional margin collateral may be required.\nA deterioration of the credit standing of one or more of the customers or counterparties to these contracts may result in BOK Financial recognizing a loss as the fair value of the affected contracts may no longer move in tandem with the offsetting contracts. This occurs if the credit standing of the customer or counterparty deteriorated such that either the fair value of underlying collateral no longer supports the contract or the customer or counterparty's ability to provide margin collateral was impaired. Credit losses on customer derivatives reduce brokerage and trading revenue in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings.\nDerivative contracts are carried at fair value. At December 31, 2020, the net fair values of derivative contracts, before consideration of cash margin, reported as assets under these programs totaled $625 million compared to $302 million at December 31, 2019. Derivative contracts carried as assets include foreign exchange contracts with fair values of $332 million, energy contracts with fair values of $175 million and interest rate swaps primarily sold to loan customers with fair values of $113 million. Before consideration of cash margin paid to counterparties, the aggregate net fair values of derivative contracts held under these programs reported as liabilities totaled $600 million.\nAt December 31, 2020, total derivative assets were reduced by $705 thousand of cash collateral received from counterparties and total derivative liabilities were reduced by $223 million of cash collateral paid to counterparties related to instruments executed with the same counterparty under a master netting agreement.\nA table showing the notional and fair value of derivative assets and liabilities on both a gross and net basis is presented in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nThe fair value of derivative contracts reported as assets under these programs, net of cash margin held by the Company, by category of debtor at December 31, 2020 follows in Table 23.\nTable 23 - Fair Value of Derivative Contracts\n(In thousands)\nTable 29: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Customers </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>415,021 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Banks and other financial institutions </td> <td> </td> <td>209,532 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fair value of customer hedge asset derivative contracts, net </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>624,553 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe largest exposure to a single counterparty was to a customer for an energy swap which totaled $28 million at December 31, 2020.\nOur customer derivative program also introduces liquidity and capital risk. We are required to provide cash margin to certain counterparties when the net negative fair value of the contracts exceeds established limits. Also, changes in commodity prices affect the amount of regulatory capital we are required to hold as support for the fair value of our derivative assets. These risks are modeled as part of the management of these programs. Based on current prices, a decrease in market prices equal to the equivalent of $35.09 per barrel of oil would decrease the fair value of derivative assets by $85 million, with dealer counterparties comprising the bulk of the assets. An increase in prices equal to the equivalent of $61.71 per barrel of oil would increase the fair value of derivative assets by $506 million. Liquidity requirements of this program are also affected by our credit rating. A decrease in credit rating to below investment grade would increase our obligation to post cash margin on existing contracts by approximately $10 million. The fair value of our to-be-announced residential mortgage-backed securities and interest rate swap derivative contracts is affected by changes in interest rates. Based on our assessment as of December 31, 2020, changes in interest rates would not materially impact regulatory capital or liquidity needed to support this portion of our customer derivative program.\nSummary of Credit Loss Experience\nTable 24 - Summary of Loan Loss Experience\n(In thousands)\nTable 30: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

Off-Balance Sheet Credit Risk from Unfunded Loan Commitments\nThe Company adopted FASB Accounting Standard Update No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Assets Measured at Amortized Cost (\"CECL\") on January 1, 2020 through a pre-tax cumulative-effect adjustment to equity of $61.4 million. CECL requires recognition of expected credit losses on assets carried at amortized cost over their expected lives. The previous incurred loss model incorporated only known information as of the balance sheet date. Prior years reported under the incurred loss model have not been restated. CECL uses models to measure the probability of default and loss given default over a 12-month reasonable and supportable forecast period. Models incorporate base case, downside, and upside macroeconomic variables such as real gross domestic product (\"GDP\") growth, civilian unemployment rate and West Texas Intermediate (\"WTI\") oil prices on a probability weighted basis. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion of methodology of allowance for loan losses.\nThe provision for expected credit losses was $222.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. A $234.2 million provision related to lending activities was partially offset by a decrease in the accrual for expected credit losses from mortgage banking activities and allowance for credit losses from investment securities. During the second quarter of 2020, the Company sold certain mortgage servicing rights related to residential mortgage loans transferred to mortgage-backed securities. These servicing rights expose the Company to credit risk for amounts that exceed the U.S. government agency guarantees.\nChanges in our reasonable and supportable forecasts of macroeconomic variables, primarily due to the anticipated impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, resulted in a $99.1 million provision for credit losses from lending activities. Economic conditions were volatile during the year, including changes in unemployment rates, GDP and energy commodity prices, causing the 2020 provision to occur in the first half of the year as our allowance grew for expected losses. While this volatility moderated in the latter half of the year, the embedded impact of these risks continue to remain in our portfolio at December 31, 2020. Changes in the loan portfolio characteristics, including specific impairment and losses, loan balances and risk grading resulted in a $135.1 million increase in the provision for credit losses from lending activities during 2020.\nWe recorded a $6.5 million negative provision for credit losses in the fourth quarter of 2020. Changes in our reasonable and supportable forecasts of macroeconomic variables, primarily due to an improved economic outlook related to the anticipated impact of the on-going COVID-19 pandemic offset by changes in the probability weighting of the economic scenarios and other assumptions, resulted in a $3.0 million increase in the provision for credit losses from lending activities. Changes in the loan portfolio characteristics, including specific impairment and losses, risk grading and loan balances resulted in an $8.6 million decrease in the provision for credit losses from lending activities.\nOur reasonable and supportable forecast of macroeconomic variables is significantly influenced by the COVID-19 pandemic developments and related government stimulus policies, which remain highly uncertain. A summary of macroeconomic variables considered in developing our estimate of expected credit losses at December 31, 2020 follows:\nTable 32: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Base </td> <td>Downside </td> <td>Upside </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Scenario probability weighting </td> <td>60% </td> <td>30% </td> <td>10% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>COVID-19 trajectory </td> <td>Trajectory of COVID-19 maintains current level with localized and state-level hotspots resulting in isolated shutdowns; FDA approval of several more vaccines in the first half of 2021, with a large share of U.S. population vaccinated by the end of the third quarter of 2021. </td> <td>Trajectory of COVID-19 pandemic worsens during winter months; additional waves and hotspots emerge through the first half of 2021.

This provision was partially offset by a change in outstanding loan balances used to measure the provision for credit losses related to changes in loan portfolio characteristics. A summary of outstanding loan balances by risk grade is included in Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Non-pass grade loans include other loans especially mentioned, defined by regulatory guidelines as loans that are currently performing in compliance with original terms but may have a potential weakness that deserves management's close attention, accruing substandard loans, and nonaccruing loans. Non-pass grade loans totaled $1.0 billion at December 31, 2020, composed primarily of $650 million or 19% of energy loans, $133 million or 4% of commercial services loans, $84 million or 3% of commercial general business loans, $58 million or 1% of commercial real estate loans and $53 million or 2% of commercial healthcare loans. Non-pass grade loans totaled $551 million at December 31, 2019.\nAlthough fiscal stimulus through PPP, SBA support and other CARES Act programs have had a positive impact on credit quality, we received a number of deferral or forbearance requests beginning in the second quarter of 2020. All requests were evaluated on a case-by-case basis and all loans greater than $1 million that requested forbearance were reviewed for proper grading. At the peak, deferral requests totaled $1.6 billion or 8% of total loans. At December 31, 2020, loans in deferral status have dropped to just below 1% of total loans. More than 90% of the loans that were deferred have now moved back to payment status and are making payments pursuant to an updated payment schedule.\nThe allowance for loan losses totaled $389 million or 1.69% of outstanding loans and 171% of nonaccruing loans at December 31, 2020, excluding residential mortgage loans guaranteed by U.S. government agencies. The combined allowance for loan losses and accrual for off-balance sheet credit risk from unfunded loan commitments was $426 million or 1.85% of outstanding loans and 188% of nonaccruing loans at December 31, 2020. Excluding PPP loans, the allowance for loan losses was 1.82% of outstanding loans and the combined allowance for loan losses and accrual for off-balance sheet credit risk from unfunded loan commitments was 2.00%.\nThe allowance for credit losses attributed to energy was 3.61% of outstanding energy loans at December 31, 2020. Our most recent semi-annual borrowing base redetermination was completed during the fourth quarter of 2020 based on forward pricing curves that existed at that time. While forward prices subsequently improved, the pricing environment remains fragile and tied to the continued economic recovery from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. We believe the duration of the downturn is a more significant factor affecting performance than the level of prices.\nWe also conduct quarterly stress tests of our energy borrowers with more than 50% funding on their lines of credit and all non-pass graded loans using a current price deck discounted at 20%. This stress test helps us identify potential issues, although the most recent test corroborated the risk grading of energy borrowers evaluated once hedging was taken into consideration. Of all the energy customers that we stress test, which makes up 96% of production loans outstanding, 96% of our customers have some level of hedging in the 12-month range and many of them carry into the 24-month range.\nThe company recorded a $44 million provision for credit losses under the previous incurred loss model in 2019. The allowance for loan losses under the incurred loss model was $211 million or 0.97% of outstanding loans and 121% of nonaccruing loans, excluding loans guaranteed by U.S. government agencies at December 31, 2019. The combined allowance for loan losses and accrual for off-balance sheet credit risk from unfunded loan commitments was $212 million or 0.98% of outstanding loans and 121% of core nonaccruing loans.\nTable 25 - Allowance for Loan Losses Allocation\n(Dollars in thousands)\nTable 33: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Allowance </td> <td> </td> <td>% of Loans1\n</td> <td> </td> <td>Allowance2\n</td> <td> </td> <td>% of Loans1\n</td> <td> </td> <td>Allowance2\n</td> <td> </td> <td>% of Loans1\n</td> <td> </td> <td>Allowance2\n</td> <td> </td> <td>% of Loans1\n</td> <td> </td> <td>Allowance2\n</td> <td> </td> <td>% of Loans1\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loan category: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial </td> <td>$ </td> <td>254,934 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>56.84 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>118,187 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>64.51 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>102,226 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>62.97 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>124,269 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>62.58 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>140,213 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>61.16 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial real estate\n</td> <td>86,558 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>20.42 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>51,805 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>20.38 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>60,026 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>22.00 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>56,621 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>20.29 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>50,749 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>22.42 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Paycheck protection program </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7.31 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loans to individuals </td> <td>47,148 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15.43 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>23,572 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15.11 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>27,437 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15.03 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>27,575 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17.13 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>26,997 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16.42 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Nonspecific allowance\n</td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17,195 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17,768 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>22,217 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>28,200 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total </td> <td>$ </td> <td>388,640 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.00 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>210,759 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.00 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>207,457 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.00 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>230,682 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.00 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>246,159 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.00 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\n1 Represents ratio of loan category balance to total loans.\n2 Calculated under previous incurred loss method. The Company adopted FASB Accounting Standard Update No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Assets Measured at Amortized Cost (\"CECL\") on January 1, 2020\nNet Loans Charged Off\nNet loans charged off totaled $70 million or 0.32% of average loans, excluding PPP loans, in 2020. Net loans charged off were $41 million or 0.19% of average loans in 2019.\nIn 2020, net charge-offs of commercial loans were $69 million, primarily related to energy borrowers. Net commercial real estate loan charge-offs were $1.0 million and net loan charge-offs of loans to individuals were $620 thousand. Net charge-offs of loans to individuals include deposit account overdraft losses.\nAccrual for Off-Balance Sheet Credit Risk Associated with Mortgage Banking Activities\nThe accrual for off-balance sheet credit risk associated with mortgage banking activities includes consideration of credit risk related to certain residential mortgage loans sold into mortgage-backed securities in excess of amounts guaranteed by the U.S. Department of Veteran's Affairs (\"VA\") and mortgage loans originated under community development loan programs that were sold to a U.S. government agency with full recourse.\nWe use publicly available long-term national data to estimate total loss given default for our off-balance sheet credit risk related to losses in excess of amounts guaranteed by the VA. This result is combined with probability of default output from our mortgage servicing rights model to estimate total expected loss. Then, we estimate the VA's guarantee percentage to determine our portion of the credit risk. Qualitative adjustment may be used, if necessary.\nAllowance for Credit Losses Related to Held-to-Maturity (Investment) Securities\nThe expected credit losses principles apply to all financial assets measured at cost, including our held-to-maturity (investment) debt securities portfolio. Our investment portfolio includes municipal and other tax-exempt securities and other debt securities. Expected credit losses for these assets is based on probability of default and loss given default assumptions that align with similarly graded loans. Qualitative adjustment may be used, if necessary.\nNonperforming Assets\nAs more fully described in Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, loans are generally classified as nonaccruing when it becomes probable that we will not collect the full contractual principal and interest. Accruing renegotiated loans guaranteed by U.S. government agencies represent residential mortgage loans that have been modified in troubled debt restructurings. Interest continues to accrue based on the modified terms of the loan and loans may be sold once they become eligible according to U.S. government agency guidelines. Real estate and other repossessed assets are assets acquired in partial or total forgiveness of loans. The assets are carried at the lower of cost as determined by fair value at the date of foreclosure or current fair value, less estimated selling costs.

Newly identified nonaccruing loans totaled $305 million, partially offset by $85 million of foreclosures, $79 million of charge-offs and $74 million in payments. The Company generally retains nonperforming assets to maximize potential recovery, which may cause future nonperforming assets to decrease more slowly.\nA rollforward of nonperforming assets for the

Principal is guaranteed by agencies of the U.S. government, subject to limitations and credit risk is limited. These properties will be conveyed to the agencies and receivables collected once applicable criteria have been met.\nReal Estate and Other Repossessed Assets\nReal estate and other repossessed assets totaled $91 million at December 31, 2020, composed primarily of $64 million of oil and gas properties, including $41 million of repossessed oil & gas properties included in a consolidated limited liability corporation that is 60% owned by the Company and 40% owned by an unrelated financial institution. The remaining balance of real estate and other repossessed assets included $21 million of developed commercial real estate, $3.4 million of undeveloped land primarily zoned for commercial development and $625 thousand of 1-4 family residential properties. The residential properties and undeveloped land are widely disbursed across our geographical footprint. Real estate and other repossessed assets increased $73 million compared to December 31, 2019.\nLiquidity and Capital\nBased on the average balances for 2020, approximately 67% of our funding was provided by deposit accounts, 17% from borrowed funds, less than 1% from long-term subordinated debt and 10% from equity. Our funding sources, which primarily include deposits and borrowings from the Federal Home Loan Banks, provide adequate liquidity to meet our operating needs.\nSubsidiary Bank\nDeposits and borrowed funds are the primary sources of liquidity for the subsidiary bank. Deposit accounts represent our largest funding source. We compete for retail and commercial deposits by offering a broad range of products and services and focusing on customer convenience. Retail deposit growth is supported through personal and small business checking, online bill paying services, mobile banking services, an extensive network of branch locations and ATMs and our ExpressBank call center. Commercial deposit growth is supported by offering treasury management and lockbox services. We also acquire brokered deposits when the cost of funds is advantageous to other funding sources.\nTable 29 - Average Deposits by Line of Business\n(In thousands)\nTable 36: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial Banking </td> <td>$ </td> <td>14,319,729 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>10,319,677 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consumer Banking </td> <td>7,599,937 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,876,676 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Wealth Management </td> <td>8,676,047 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,447,987 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Subtotal </td> <td>30,595,713 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>23,644,340 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Funds Management and other </td> <td>2,169,285 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,006,941 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total </td> <td>$ </td> <td>32,764,998 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>25,651,281 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nAverage deposits for 2020 totaled $32.8 billion and represented approximately 67% of total liabilities and capital compared to $25.7 billion and 61% of total liabilities and capital for 2019. Average deposits increased $7.1 billion over the prior year. Inflows resulting from PPP loans and government stimulus payments during the pandemic, along with additional core deposit growth as customers maintain higher balances during the current economic environment, have all contributed to the significant increase in deposits. Interest-bearing transaction deposit account balances increased by $5.6 billion and demand deposits grew by $1.4 billion.\nAverage deposits attributed to Commercial Banking were $14.3 billion for 2020, a $4.0 billion or 39% increase over 2019. Interest-bearing transaction account balances increased $2.5 billion or 60% and demand deposit balances increased $1.3 billion or 22%. Commercial customers continue to retain large cash reserves primarily due to a combination of factors including uncertainty about the economic environment and potential for growth, lack of preferable liquid alternatives and a desire to minimize deposit charges through the earnings credit. The earnings credit is a non-cash method that enables commercial customers to offset deposit service charges based on account balances. Commercial deposit balances may decrease as the economic outlook improves and if short-term rates move higher, enhancing their investment alternatives.\nAverage Consumer Banking deposit balances increased $723 million or 11% over the prior year. Average demand deposit balances grew by $470 million or 22% while average interest-bearing transaction accounts increased $253 million or 5%. Time deposit balances decreased $15 million or 2%.\nAverage Wealth Management deposit balances grew by $2.2 billion or 35% over the prior year.

primarily by federal funds purchased, securities repurchase agreements and Federal Home Loan Bank borrowings. Federal funds purchased consist primarily of unsecured, overnight funds acquired from other financial institutions. Funds are primarily purchased from bankers' banks and Federal Home Loan Banks from across the country. The largest source of wholesale federal funds purchased totaled $200 million at December 31, 2020 and $600 million at December 31, 2019. Securities repurchase agreements generally mature within 90 days and are secured by certain available for sale securities. Federal Home Loan Bank borrowings are generally short term and are secured by a blanket pledge of eligible collateral (generally unencumbered U.S. Treasury and mortgage-backed securities, 1-4 family residential mortgage loans, multifamily and other qualifying commercial real estate loans). Amounts borrowed from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Topeka averaged $3.4 billion during 2020 and $7.1 billion during 2019.\nOn April 13, 2020, the banking agencies published an interim final rule which permits banking organizations to exclude from regulatory capital requirements PPP covered loans pledged to the Federal Reserve's Paycheck Protection Program Liquidity Facility (\"PPLF\"). The Company initially funded PPP loans from deposits and Federal Home Loan Bank borrowings, but transitioned to the PPLF in June of 2020 in order to realize this regulatory capital relief.\nAt December 31, 2020, the estimated unused credit available to BOKF, NA from collateralized sources was approximately $16.5 billion.\nBOKF, NA also has a liability related to the repurchase of certain delinquent residential mortgage loans previously sold in GNMA mortgage pools. Interest is payable monthly at rates contractually due to investors. The average balance of this liability increased over the prior year primarily due to GNMA loans serviced by the Company that are participating in the forbearance program included in the CARES Act, which began in the second quarter. As delinquencies increase, the GNMA repurchase liability will also increase.\nParent Company and Other Non-Bank Subsidiaries\nThe primary sources of liquidity for BOK Financial are cash on hand and dividends from the subsidiary bank. Cash and cash equivalents totaled $184 million at December 31, 2020. Dividends from the subsidiary bank are limited by various banking regulations to net profits, as defined, for the year plus retained profits for the two preceding years. Dividends are further restricted by minimum capital requirements. At December 31, 2020, based on the most restrictive limitations as well as management's internal capital policy, BOKF, NA could declare up to $370 million of dividends without regulatory approval. Dividend constraints may be alleviated through increases in retained earnings, capital issuances or changes in risk weighted assets. Future losses or increases in required regulatory capital could also affect its ability to pay dividends to the parent company.\nOn June 27, 2016, the parent company issued $150 million of subordinated debt that will mature on June 30, 2056. This debt bears interest at the rate of 5.375%, payable quarterly. On June 30, 2021, we will have the option to redeem the debt at the principal amount plus accrued interest, subject to regulatory approval.\nAs a result of the acquisition of CoBiz Financial, we obtained $60 million of subordinated debt issued in June 2015 that will mature on June 25, 2030. This debt bears interest at the rate of 5.625% through June 25, 2025 and thereafter, the notes will bear an annual floating rate equal to 3-month LIBOR plus 317 basis points. We also acquired $72 million of junior subordinated debentures. Interest is based on spreads over 3 month LIBOR ranging from 145 basis points to 295 basis points and mature September 17, 2033 through September 30, 2035. The junior subordinated debentures are subject to early redemption prior to maturity.\nShareholders' equity at December 31, 2020 was $5.3 billion, an increase of $410 million over December 31, 2019. Net income less cash dividends paid increased equity $357 million during 2020. Changes in interest rates resulted in accumulated other comprehensive income of $336 million at December 31, 2020, compared to $105 million at December 31, 2019. Capital is managed to maximize long-term value to the shareholders. Factors considered in managing capital include projections of future earnings, asset growth and acquisition strategies, and regulatory and debt covenant requirements. Capital management may include subordinated debt issuance, share repurchase and stock and cash dividends.\nOn April 30, 2019, the Board of Directors authorized the Company to purchase up to five million common shares, subject to market conditions, securities laws and other regulatory compliance limitations. As of December 31, 2020, a cumulative total of 1,973,813 shares have been repurchased under this authorization. The Company repurchased 1,107,100 shares during 2020 at an average price of $68.49 per share.\nBOK Financial and the subsidiary bank are subject to various capital requirements administered by federal agencies. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements, including capital conservation buffer, can result in certain mandatory and additional discretionary actions by regulators that could have a material impact on operations including restrictions on capital distributions from dividends and share repurchases and executive bonus payments. These capital requirements include quantitative measures of assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet items. The capital standards are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators.\nA summary of minimum capital requirements follows for BOK Financial on a consolidated basis in Table 32.\nTable 32 - Capital Ratios\nTable 41: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Minimum Capital Requirement </td> <td> </td> <td>Capital Conservation Buffer </td> <td> </td> <td>Minimum Capital Requirement Including Capital Conservation Buffer </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Risk-based capital: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Common equity Tier 1 </td> <td>4.50 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>2.50 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>7.00 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>11.95 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>11.39 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tier 1 capital </td> <td>6.00 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>2.50 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>8.50 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>11.95 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>11.39 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total capital </td> <td>8.00 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>2.50 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>10.50 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>13.82 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>12.94 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tier 1 Leverage </td> <td>4.00 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>N/A </td> <td> </td> <td>4.00 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>8.28 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>8.40 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average total equity to average assets </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10.46 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>11.11 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tangible common equity ratio </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9.02 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>8.98 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn March 2020, in response to the impact on the financial markets by the COVID-19 pandemic, the banking agencies issued an interim final rule permitting banking organizations that implement CECL the option to delay for two years an estimate of the CECL methodology's effect on regulatory capital, followed by a three-year transition period. The estimate includes the implementation date adjustment as of January 1, 2020 plus an estimate of the impact of the change for a two year period following implementation of CECL. We have elected to delay the regulatory capital impact of the transition in accordance with the interim final rule. Deferral of the impact of CECL added 26 basis points to the Company's Common equity Tier 1 capital at December 31, 2020.\nCapital resources of financial institutions are also regularly measured by the tangible common shareholders' equity ratio. Tangible common shareholders' equity is shareholders' equity as defined by generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America ( GAAP\u201d), including unrealized gains and losses on available for sale securities, less intangible assets and equity which does not benefit common shareholders. Equity that does not benefit common shareholders includes preferred equity. This non-GAAP measure is a valuable indicator of a financial institution's capital strength since it eliminates intangible assets from shareholders' equity and retains the effect of unrealized losses on securities and other components of accumulated other comprehensive income in shareholders' equity.\nTable 33 following provides a reconciliation of the non-GAAP measures with financial measures defined by GAAP.\nTable 33 - Non-GAAP Measures\n(Dollars in thousands)\nTable 42: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tangible common equity ratio: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total shareholders' equity </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,266,266 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,855,795 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less: Goodwill and intangible assets, net </td> <td> </td> <td>1,161,527 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,173,362 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tangible common equity </td> <td> </td> <td>4,104,739 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,682,433 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total assets </td> <td> </td> <td>46,671,088 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>42,172,021 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less: Goodwill and intangible assets, net </td> <td> </td> <td>1,161,527 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,173,362 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tangible assets </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>45,509,561 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>40,998,659 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tangible common equity ratio </td> <td> </td> <td>9.02 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>8.98 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Pre-provision net revenue: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income before taxes </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>563,864 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>630,868 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Add: Provision for expected credit losses </td> <td> </td> <td>222,592 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>44,000 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less: Net income (loss) attributable to non-controlling interests </td> <td> </td> <td>41 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(73) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Pre-provision net revenue </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>786,415 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>674,941 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nSee Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of the Company's significant off-balance sheet commitments.\nAggregate Contractual Obligations\nBOK Financial has numerous contractual obligations in the normal course of business. These obligations include time deposits and other borrowed funds, premises used under various operating leases, commitments to extend credit to borrowers and to purchase securities, derivative contracts and contracts for services such as data processing that are integral to our operations.

These obligations may have variable interest rates and actual payments will differ from the amounts shown on this table.\nPayments on time deposits are based on contractual maturity dates. These funds may be withdrawn prior to maturity. We may charge the customer a penalty for early withdrawal.\nLease commitments generally represent real property we rent for branch offices, corporate offices and operations facilities. Payments presented represent the minimum lease payments and exclude related costs such as utilities and property taxes.\nObligations under derivative contracts are used in customer hedging programs. As previously discussed, we have entered into derivative contracts which are expected to substantially offset the cash payments due on these obligations.\nData processing and communications contracts represent the minimum obligations under the contracts. Additional payments that are based on the volume of transactions processed are excluded.\nLoan commitments represent legally binding obligations to provide financing to our customers. Some of these commitments are expected to expire before being drawn upon and the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. Approximately $2.1 billion of the loan commitments expire within one year.\nThe Company has commitments to fund an additional $94 million for various alternative investments. Alternative investments primarily consist of limited partnership interests in entities that invest in low income housing projects. Legally binding commitments to fund alternative investments are recognized as liabilities in the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nRecently Issued Accounting Standards\nSee Note 1 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for disclosure of newly adopted and pending accounting standards.\nTable 45: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis 10-K contains forward-looking statements that are based on management's beliefs, assumptions, current expectations, estimates and projections about BOK Financial, the financial services industry, the economy generally and the expected or potential impact of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, and the related responses of the government, consumers, and others, on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Words such as anticipates,\u201d believes,\u201d estimates,\u201d expects,\u201d forecasts,\u201d plans,\u201d projects,\u201d will,\u201d intends,\u201d variations of such words and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward-looking statements. Management judgments relating to and discussion of the provision and allowance for credit losses, allowance for uncertain tax positions, accruals for loss contingencies and valuation of mortgage servicing rights involve judgments as to expected events and are inherently forward-looking statements. Assessments that acquisitions and growth endeavors will be profitable are necessary statements of belief as to the outcome of future events based in part on information provided by others which BOK Financial has not independently verified. These various forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve certain risks, uncertainties, and assumptions which are difficult to predict with regard to timing, extent, likelihood and degree of occurrence. Therefore, actual results and outcomes may materially differ from what is expected, implied or forecasted in such forward-looking statements. Internal and external factors that might cause such a difference include, but are not limited to changes in government, consumer or business responses to, and ability to treat or prevent further outbreak of, the COVID-19 pandemic, commodity prices, interest rates and interest rate relationships, inflation, demand for products and services, the degree of competition by traditional and nontraditional competitors, changes in banking regulations, tax laws, prices, levies and assessments, the impact of technological advances, and trends in customer behavior as well as their ability to repay loans. BOK Financial and its affiliates undertake no obligation to update, amend or clarify forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise.\nAnnualized, pro forma, projected and estimated numbers are used for illustrative purpose only, are not forecasts and may not reflect actual results.\nLegal Notice\nAs used in this report, the term BOK Financial\u201d and such terms as the Company,\u201d the Corporation,\u201d our,\u201d we\u201d and us\u201d may refer to one or more of the consolidated subsidiaries or all of them taken as a whole.

Excludes loans past due 90 days or more and still accruing.\n3 Excludes residential mortgage loans guaranteed by agencies of the U.S. government.\n4 Includes allowance for loan losses and accrual for off-balance sheet credit risk.\n5 Metric meaningful due to the U.S. government agency guarantee and short-term nature of the PPP loans.\nManagement's Assessment of Operations and Financial Condition\nOverview\nThe following discussion is management's analysis to assist in the understanding and evaluation of the financial condition and results of operations of BOK Financial Corporation (\"BOK Financial\" or \"the Company\"). This discussion should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and footnotes and selected financial data presented elsewhere in this report.\nAfter completing its 11th consecutive year of expansion in 2019, the U.S. economy experienced extreme volatility throughout 2020. The worldwide spread of COVID-19 affected every part of the economic environment. Economic conditions in the U.S. declined drastically in March and April of 2020 following the initial U.S. COVID-19 outbreak. Congress quickly passed the CARES Act economic relief package, which alleviated some of the downturn. With the government stimulus package and some time to settle into the current new normal, the economy rebounded significantly in the second half of the year.\nThe Federal Reserve lowered the federal funds rate to near zero by April, 2020 and has initiated additional programs to infuse liquidity and stimulate economic activity. The Federal Reserve is expected to keep the federal funds rate at or near zero until the labor market has fully recovered and inflation has stabilized at 2%. See \"Summary of Credit Loss Experience\" section of Management's Discussion and Analysis for additional discussion around our economic forecast.\nPerformance Summary\nNet income for the year ended December 31, 2020 totaled $435.0 million or $6.19 per diluted share compared with net income of $500.8 million or $7.03 per diluted share for the year ended December 31, 2019. A pre-tax provision for expected credit losses of $222.6 million was included in 2020 while a pre-tax provision for incurred losses of $44.0 million was included in 2019. The Company adopted the current expected credit loss (\"CECL\") model on January 1, 2020.\nPre-provision net revenue, a non-GAAP measure, was $786.4 million for 2020 compared to $674.9 million in the prior year. This is a measure of revenue less expenses, and is calculated before provision for credit losses and income tax expense. Pre-provision net revenue is a financial measure frequently used by investors and analysts that enables them to assess a company's ability to generate earnings to cover credit losses through a credit cycle. It also provides an additional basis for comparing the results of operations between periods by isolating the impact of the provision for credit losses, which can vary significantly between periods.\nWe incurred $17.2 million of integration costs in 2019 related to the acquisition of CoBiz Financial, Inc. (\"CoBiz\") on October 1, 2018, which resulted in an $0.18 per share reduction in 2019. The fluctuation discussion in the highlights below excludes this impact.\nHighlights of 2020 included:\n\u2022Net interest revenue totaled $1.1 billion for 2020, consistent with the prior year. Net interest margin was 2.83% for 2020 compared to 3.11% for 2019. The Federal Reserve reduced the federal funds rate to near zero early in the year putting pressure on the margin in 2020. Average earning assets were $40.7 billion for 2020, up $4.3 billion over 2019. The increase was largely due to increased trading securities, loans primarily related to the Small Business Administration's Paycheck Protection Program (\"PPP\"), and the expansion of the available for sale securities portfolio as we repositioned the balance sheet for a lower rate environment.\n\u2022Fees and commissions revenue was $810.3 million for 2020, up $108.1 million compared to 2019. Mortgage banking revenue increased $74.8 million and brokerage and trading revenue increased $62.0 million. Lower mortgage interest rates increased both mortgage loan production and related trading activities. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in deposit service charges of $15.7 million and fiduciary and asset management revenue of $9.6 million.\n\u2022Other operating expense totaled $1.2 billion, a $50.8 million increase compared to 2019. Personnel expense increased $30.8 million, primarily due to higher incentive compensation expense due to expanded trading activities. This was partially offset by lower employee benefits costs. Increased data processing and communications expense, occupancy and equipment expense, mortgage banking costs and charitable contributions were partially offset by lower business promotions expense.\n\u2022The net economic benefit of the changes in the fair value of mortgage servicing rights and related economic hedges was $24.9 million during 2020 compared to an economic cost of $17.9 million during 2019.\n\u2022The allowance for loan losses totaled $389 million or 1.69% of outstanding loans at December 31, 2020. The combined allowance for loan losses and accrual for off-balance sheet credit risk from unfunded loan commitments was $426 million or 1.85% of outstanding loans at December 31, 2020. Excluding PPP loans, which are fully guaranteed by a U.S. government agency, the allowance for loan losses was 1.82% of outstanding loans and the combined allowance for loan losses and accrual for off-balance sheet credit risk from unfunded loan commitments was 2.00%. The allowance for loan losses was $211 million or 0.97% of outstanding loans and the combined allowance for loan losses and accrual for off-balance sheet credit risk from unfunded loan commitments was $212 million or 0.98% of outstanding loans at December 31, 2019.\n\u2022Period-end outstanding loan balances were $23.0 billion at December 31, 2020, a $1.3 billion increase over the prior year, primarily due to the inflow of PPP loans. Average loans were $23.4 billion, a $1.3 billion increase compared to 2019.\n\u2022Period-end deposits totaled $36.1 billion at December 31, 2020, an $8.5 billion increase compared to December 31, 2019. Interest-bearing transaction deposits increased $5.8 billion, while demand deposit balances increased $2.8 billion. Average deposits increased $7.1 billion to $32.8 billion. Deposit growth was largely due to customers retaining higher balances in the current economic environment combined with increases due to various COVID-19 related government program stimulus payments.\n\u2022Common equity Tier 1 capital ratio was 11.95% at December 31, 2020. In addition, the Tier 1 capital ratio was 11.95%, total capital ratio was 13.82% and leverage ratio was 8.28% at December 31, 2020. At December 31, 2019, the Tier 1 capital ratio was 11.39%, the total capital ratio was 12.94% and the leverage ratio was 8.40%.\n\u2022The Company repurchased 1,107,100 shares at an average price of $68.49 per share during 2020 and 1,572,322 shares at an average price of $82.35 during 2019.\n\u2022The Company paid cash dividends of $2.05 per common share during 2020 and $2.01 per common share in 2019.\nNet income for the fourth quarter of 2020 totaled $154.2 million or $2.21 per diluted share, compared to $110.4 million or $1.56 per diluted share for the fourth quarter of 2019.\nHighlights of the fourth quarter of 2020 included:\n\u2022Net interest revenue totaled $297.2 million for the fourth quarter of 2020, an increase of $27.0 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2019, largely due to a $5.2 billion increase in average trading securities. We saw a shift from trading revenue to interest income on trading securities in the fourth quarter of 2020. Net interest margin was 2.72% for the fourth quarter of 2020 and 2.88% for the fourth quarter of 2019. The increase in the trading securities portfolio combined with the repricing of our available for sale securities portfolio decreased the net interest margin.\n\u2022Fees and commissions revenue totaled $181.1 million, up $1.6 million over the fourth quarter of 2019. Increased mortgage banking revenue stemming from the low interest rate environment was largely offset by decreased brokerage and trading revenue, fiduciary and asset management revenue, and deposit service charges.\n\u2022Operating expenses in the fourth quarter totaled $300.7 million, an $11.9 million increase compared to the prior year. Personnel expense increased $7.8 million primarily due to higher incentive compensation expense, partially offset by regular compensation expense. Non-personnel expenses increased $4.1 million, largely due to increased data processing and communications expense and higher charitable contributions, partially offset by lower business promotion expense.\n\u2022Based on an evaluation of economic forecasts and loan portfolio characteristics, the Company recorded a $6.5 million negative provision for expected credit losses in the fourth quarter of 2020 and a $19.0 million provision for incurred credit losses in the fourth quarter of 2019.\nCritical Accounting Policies & Estimates\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America ( GAAP\u201d). The Company's accounting policies are more fully described in Note 1 of the Consolidated Financial Statements. Management makes significant assumptions and estimates in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes in conformity with GAAP that may be highly subjective, complex and subject to variability. Actual results could differ significantly from these assumptions and estimates. The following discussion addresses the most critical areas where these assumptions and estimates could affect the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the Company. These critical accounting policies and estimates have been discussed with the appropriate committees of the Board of Directors.\nAllowance for Loan Losses and Accrual for Off-Balance Sheet Credit Risk from Loan Commitments\nThe allowance for loan losses and accrual for off-balance sheet credit risk from unfunded loan commitments represent the portion of amortized cost basis of loans and related unfunded commitments we do not expect to collect over the asset's contractual life, considering past events, current conditions, as well as reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic conditions. Appropriateness of the allowance for loan losses and accrual for off-balance sheet credit risk from unfunded loan commitments is determined by a senior management Allowance Committee which requires judgment about effects of uncertain matters, resulting in a subjective calculation which is inherently imprecise. Because of the subjective forward-looking nature of the calculation, changes in these measures may not directly correlate with actual economic events. In future periods, management judgment may consider new or changed information which may cause significant changes in these allowances in those future periods.\nAs of January 1, 2020 BOK Financial's accounting policies have changed significantly with the adoption of Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-13 Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Assets Measured at Amortized Cost (\"ASU 2016-13\" or \"CECL\"). Prior years are not restated. Prior to January 1, 2020, general allowances and nonspecific allowances were based on incurred credit losses. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the description of the expected credit losses calculation of the allowance for loan losses and accrual for off-balance sheet credit risk from unfunded loan commitments.\nFor the majority of risk-graded loans, the accruing loan's expected credit loss estimate is sensitive to management judgment, particularly probability of default and loss given default assumptions, changes in specific macroeconomic factor forecasts and the probability weight assigned to each economic scenario.\nProbability of default and loss given default measurements are based on historical data that may not be a good predictor of future performance or actual losses. Probability of default is based on risk grades, a subjective measurement of the risk of a loan. This subjective assessment of risk may not reflect actual risk of loss.\nOther subjective measures include the forecast for each relevant economic loss driver and the probability weighting of economic scenarios, both of which are overseen by a senior management Economic Forecast Committee which includes members independent of the allowance process. The Allowance Committee may increase or decrease the allowance based on factors that include, for example, new lines of business, market conditions that have not been previously encountered, observed changes in credit risk that are not yet reflected in macroeconomic factors, or economic conditions that impact loss given default assumptions.\nAlthough the resulting expected credit loss estimate represents management's best estimates at the time, actual credit losses will differ from management's estimate. Portfolio composition will change over time, actual economic conditions will differ from probability-weighted assumptions, borrower-specific circumstances will change, as well as other factors. Differences between actual losses and management's estimates may materially affect the Company's results of operations.\nFair Value Measurement\nCertain assets and liabilities are recorded at fair value in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Fair value is defined by applicable accounting guidance as the price to sell an asset or transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants in the principal markets for the given asset or liability at the measurement date based on market conditions at that date. An orderly transaction assumes exposure to the market for a customary period for marketing activities prior to the measurement date and not a forced liquidation or distressed sale.\nA hierarchy for fair value has been established that prioritizes the inputs of valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad categories: unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1), other observable inputs that can be observed either directly or indirectly (Level 2) and unobservable inputs for assets or liabilities (Level 3). Fair value may be recorded for certain assets and liabilities every reporting period on a recurring basis or under certain circumstances on a non-recurring basis. Fair value measurements of significant assets or liabilities that are based on unobservable inputs (Level 3) are considered Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates. Additional discussion of fair value measurement and disclosure is included in Notes 7 and 19 of the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nMortgage Servicing Rights\nWe have a significant investment in mortgage servicing rights. Our mortgage servicing rights are primarily retained from sales in the secondary market of residential mortgage loans we have originated or purchased from correspondent lenders. Occasionally, mortgage servicing rights may be purchased from other lenders. Both originated and purchased mortgage servicing rights are initially recognized at fair value. We carry all mortgage servicing rights at fair value. Changes in fair value are recognized in earnings as they occur.\nMortgage servicing rights are not traded in active markets. The fair value of mortgage servicing rights is determined by discounting the projected cash flows. Certain significant assumptions and estimates used in valuing mortgage servicing rights are based on current market sources including projected prepayment speeds, assumed servicing costs, earnings on escrow deposits, ancillary income and discount rates. Assumptions used to value our mortgage servicing rights are considered significant unobservable inputs and represent our best estimate of assumptions that market participants would use to value this asset. A separate third party model is used to estimate prepayment speeds based on interest rates, housing turnover rates, estimated loan curtailment, anticipated defaults and other relevant factors. The prepayment model is updated periodically for changes in market conditions and adjusted to better correlate with actual performance of our servicing portfolio. The discount rate is based on benchmark rates for mortgage loans plus a market spread expected by investors in servicing rights. Significant assumptions used to determine the fair value of our mortgage servicing rights are presented in Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. At least annually, we request estimates of fair value from outside sources to corroborate the results of the valuation model.\nThe assumptions used in this model are primarily based on mortgage interest rates. Evaluation of the effect of a change in one assumption without considering the effect of that change on other assumptions is not meaningful. Considering all related assumptions, we expect a 50 basis point increase in primary mortgage interest rates to increase the fair value of our servicing rights by $29 million. We expect a $15 million decrease in the fair value of our mortgage servicing rights from a 50 basis point decrease in primary mortgage interest rates.\nValuation of Impaired Loans and Real Estate and Other Repossessed Assets\nThe fair value of collateral for certain impaired loans and real estate and other repossessed assets is measured on a non-recurring basis. The fair value of real estate is generally based on unadjusted third-party appraisals derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data. Fair value measurements based on these appraisals are considered to be based on Level 2 inputs. Fair value measurements based on appraisals that are not based on observable inputs or that require significant adjustments by us or fair value measurements that are not based on third-party appraisals are considered to be based on Level 3 inputs. Significant unobservable inputs include listing prices for comparable assets, uncorroborated expert opinions or management's knowledge of the collateral or industry.\nThe fair value of mineral rights is generally determined by our internal staff of engineers based on projected cash flows from proven oil and gas reserves under existing economic and operating conditions. Proven oil and gas reserves are estimated quantities that geological and engineering data demonstrate, with reasonable certainty, to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs using existing prices and costs. Projected cash flows incorporate assumptions related to a number of factors including production, sales prices, operating expenses, severance, ad valorem taxes, capital costs and appropriate discount rate. Fair values determined through this process are considered to be based on Level 3 inputs.\nIncome Taxes\nDetermination of income tax expense and related assets and liabilities is complex and requires estimates and judgments when applying tax laws, rules, regulations and interpretations. It also requires judgments as to future earnings and the timing of future events. Accrued income taxes represent an estimate of net amounts due to or from taxing jurisdictions based upon these estimates, interpretations and judgments.\nManagement evaluates the Company's current tax expense or benefit based upon estimates of taxable income, tax credits and statutory tax rates. Annually, we file tax returns with each jurisdiction where we conduct business and adjust recognized income tax expense or benefit to filed tax returns.\nWe recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based upon the differences between the values of assets and liabilities as recognized in the financial statements and their related tax basis using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to be recovered or settled. A valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that some portion of the entire deferred tax asset may not be realized.\nWe also recognize the benefit of uncertain tax positions when based upon all relevant evidence, it is more-likely-than-not that our position would prevail upon examination, including resolution of related appeals or litigation, based upon the technical merits of the position. Unrecognized tax benefits, including estimated interest and penalties, are part of our current accrued income tax liability. Estimated penalties and interest are recognized in income tax expense. Income tax expense in future periods may decrease if an uncertain tax position is favorably resolved, generally upon completion of an examination by the taxing authorities, expiration of a statute of limitations, or changes in facts and circumstances.\nGoodwill Impairment\nGoodwill for each reporting unit is evaluated for impairment annually as of October 1st or more frequently if conditions indicate that impairment may have occurred. The evaluation of possible goodwill impairment involves significant judgment based upon short-term and long-term projections of future performance.\nDuring the evaluation for impairment, management qualitatively assesses whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting units is less than their carrying value, including goodwill. Reporting unit carrying value includes sufficient capital to exceed regulatory requirements. This assessment includes consideration of relevant events and circumstances including, but not limited to, macroeconomic conditions, industry and market conditions, the financial and stock performance of the Company and other relevant factors. Specifically, the analysis may include:\n\u2022General economic conditions including overall economic activity, consumer spending and mobility, unemployment rates, consumer confidence, and duration and severity of any current market moving instability.\n\u2022Global health concerns including ongoing pandemics or potential for widespread health issues, the future course of a pandemic and the potential for medical advances.\n\u2022Regional economic conditions including demand for oil and price stability of oil, other overarching conditions that may be affecting any of the Company's primary states such as weather or other catastrophes, pandemics and health related lockdowns, or other state mandates.\n\u2022Industry conditions including federal funds rate movement by the Federal Reserve, the interest rate environment and the resulting effect on net interest revenue and operating revenue, and regulatory mandates that hinder or provide relief to the financial services industry.\n\u2022Company specific conditions including current and forecasted income, changes in stock price, the Company's stock price compared to peers and other indexes, book value per share compared to fair value per share, goodwill compared to total shareholders' equity, current capital and liquidity position, demand for products and services, health of the loan portfolio and other credit related factors, and current credit ratings with the ratings agencies, and regulatory ratings.\n\u2022Reporting unit performance and forecasts including any event that may significantly impact a reporting unit.\nIf management concludes based on the qualitative assessment that goodwill may be impaired, a quantitative impairment test will be applied to goodwill at all reporting units. The quantitative analysis compares the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying value, including goodwill. The fair value of each reporting unit is estimated by the discounted future earnings method. Goodwill is considered impaired if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value of the reporting unit, including goodwill.\nBoth the qualitative assessment and quantitative analysis require significant management judgment, including estimates of changes in future economic conditions and their underlying causes and duration, the reasonableness and effectiveness of management's responses to those changes, changes in governmental fiscal and monetary policies, and fair value measurements based largely on significant unobservable inputs. The results of these judgments may have a significant impact on the Company's reported results of operations.\nSee Note 6, \"Goodwill and Intangible Assets\" for breakout of goodwill by reporting unit.\nResults of Operations\nNet Interest Revenue and Net Interest Margin\nNet interest revenue is the interest earned on debt securities, loans and other interest-earning assets less interest paid for interest-bearing deposits and other borrowings. The net interest margin is calculated by dividing tax-equivalent net interest revenue by average interest-earning assets. Net interest spread is the difference between the average rate earned on interest-earning assets and the average rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities. Net interest margin is typically greater than net interest spread due to interest income earned on assets funded by non-interest bearing liabilities such as demand deposits and equity.\nTax-equivalent net interest revenue totaled $1.1 billion for 2020, consistent with the prior year. This includes $26.0 million of net purchase discount accretion for 2020 and $37.8 million for 2019. Approximately $48 million of purchase accounting discount remains to be accreted. Net interest revenue decreased $108.7 million due to changes in interest rates and increased $102.8 million from growth in earning assets. Table 2 shows the effects on net interest revenue due to changes in average balances and interest rates for the various types of earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. In addition, see the Annual and Quarterly Financial Summary of consolidated daily average balances, yields and rates following the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nNet interest margin was 2.83% for 2020 and 3.11% for 2019. The tax-equivalent yield on earning assets was 3.24% for 2020 compared to 4.27% in 2019. In response to the anticipated impact to the economy from the COVID-19 pandemic, the Federal Reserve reduced the federal funds rate to near zero in March, 2020. The resulting impact on market interest rates has compressed the net interest margin. The company has been proactive in reducing deposit costs and implementing LIBOR floors in loan agreements; however, funds received from available for sale securities have been reinvested at lower rates. Loan yields decreased 129 basis points to 3.84%. The available for sale securities portfolio yield decreased 37 basis points to 2.21%. The yield on trading securities fell 80 basis points to 2.75%. The yield on interest-bearing cash and cash equivalents decreased 183 basis points to 0.45%.\nFunding costs decreased 108 basis points compared to 2019. The cost of interest-bearing deposits decreased 69 basis points. The cost of other short-term borrowings decreased 161 basis points. The benefit to net interest margin from earning assets funded by non-interest bearing liabilities was 12 basis points for 2020, down from 45 basis points for 2019.\nAverage earning assets for 2020 increased $4.3 billion or 12% over 2019, largely due to the expansion of the available for sale securities portfolio, loans originated as part of the Small Business Administration's Paycheck Protection Program (\"PPP\"), and an increase in our trading of U.S. government issued mortgage-backed securities. The average balance of available for sale securities, which consists largely of residential and commercial mortgage-backed securities guaranteed by U.S. government agencies, increased $2.3 billion. We purchase securities to supplement earnings and to manage interest rate risk. We increased the size of our bond portfolio during the latter half of 2019 and first quarter 2020 in order to reduce our exposure to falling short-term interest rates. Average loans, net of allowance for loan losses, increased $1.1 billion, primarily related to $1.4 billion in average PPP loans. Trading securities balances increased $1.3 billion.\nTotal average deposits grew by $7.1 billion over the prior year. This increase is largely due to the combination of focused deposit gathering initiatives, stimulus-related deposits, and customers retaining elevated balances in the current economic environment. Average interest-bearing transaction account balances increased $5.6 billion. Average demand deposit balances increased $1.4 billion. Average short-term borrowings decreased $1.7 billion.\nOur overall objective is to manage the Company's balance sheet to be relatively neutral to changes in interest rates as is further described in the Market Risk section of this report. As shown in Table 21, approximately 70% of our commercial and commercial real estate loan portfolios are either variable rate loans or fixed rate loans that will re-price within one year. These loans are funded primarily by deposit accounts that are either non-interest bearing, or that re-price more slowly than the loans. The result is a balance sheet that would be asset sensitive, which means that assets generally re-price more quickly than liabilities. Among the strategies that we use to manage toward a relatively rate-neutral position, we purchase fixed rate residential mortgage-backed securities issued primarily by U.S. government agencies and fund them with market rate sensitive liabilities. The liability-sensitive nature of this strategy provides an offset to the asset-sensitive characteristics of our loan portfolio. We also may use derivative instruments to manage our interest rate risk.\nThe effectiveness of these strategies is reflected in the overall change in net interest revenue due to changes in interest rates as shown in Table 2 and in the interest rate sensitivity projections as shown in the Market Risk section of this report.\nFourth Quarter 2020 Net Interest Revenue\nTax-equivalent net interest revenue totaled $299.6 million for the fourth quarter of 2020, an increase of $26.7 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2019. Net interest revenue increased $44.5 million, primarily due to the increase in trading securities, available for sale securities and loan balances. This was partially offset by a decrease of $17.8 million primarily due to lower market interest rates in 2020.\nNet interest margin was 2.72% for the fourth quarter of 2020 compared to 2.88% for the fourth quarter of 2019. The tax-equivalent yield on earning assets was 2.92% for the fourth quarter of 2020, a decrease of 101 basis points compared to the fourth quarter of 2019, primarily due to the impact on interest rates related to the federal funds rate cuts in 2020. Loan yields decreased 107 basis points to 3.68%. Yield on available for sale securities decreased 54 basis points to 1.98%. Yield on trading securities decreased 117 basis points to 2.02%.\nFunding costs decreased 112 basis points compared to the fourth quarter of 2019. The cost of other short-term borrowings decreased 145 basis points. The cost of interest-bearing deposits decreased 90 basis points. The benefit to net interest margin from earning assets funded by non-interest bearing liabilities was 8 basis points in the fourth quarter of 2020, down from 35 basis points in the fourth quarter of 2019.\nAverage earning assets for the fourth quarter of 2020 increased $6.3 billion over the fourth quarter of 2019. Trading securities balances increased $5.2 billion as we increased our trading of U.S. government issued mortgage-backed securities. Available for sale securities increased $1.6 billion as the balance sheet was repositioned for the current rate environment. Average loans, net of allowance for loan losses, increased $1.0 billion, largely due to the loans related to the PPP. Fair value option securities held as an economic hedge of our mortgage servicing rights decreased $1.4 billion.\nAverage deposits increased $8.4 billion over the fourth quarter of 2019, largely due to the combination of government stimulus payments and customers choosing to retain elevated balances in the current environment. Average interest-bearing transaction accounts increased $6.0 billion and average demand deposit balances increased $2.5 billion. Average short-term borrowings decreased $3.0 billion.\n2019 Net Interest Revenue\nTax-equivalent net interest revenue for 2019 was $1.1 billion, up from $993.8 million for 2018. The acquisition of CoBiz in the fourth quarter of 2018 added $158.5 million to net interest revenue in 2019 and $43.1 million to net interest revenue in 2018. This includes $37.8 million of net purchase discount accretion for 2019 and $6.4 million for 2018. Net interest revenue decreased $13.7 million due to rates and increased $144.4 million from growth in earning assets.\nNet interest margin was 3.11% for 2019 compared to 3.20% for 2018. The tax-equivalent yield on average earning assets increased 29 basis points over 2018. Short-term rate increases during the first half of 2019 resulting from four 25 basis point increases in the federal funds rate by the Federal Reserve during 2018 were partially offset by three 25 basis point decreases in the federal funds rate in the second half of 2019. Loan yields increased 33 basis points. The available for sale securities portfolio yield increased 23 basis points.The yield on interest-bearing cash and cash equivalents increased 48 basis points. The yield on trading securities fell 29 basis points. The cost of interest-bearing liabilities increased 42 basis points. The cost of interest-bearing deposits increased 39 basis points and the cost of other short-term borrowings increased 35 basis points. The benefit to net interest margin from earning assets funded by non-interest bearing liabilities was 45 basis points for 2019, compared to 41 basis points for 2018.\nAverage earning assets increased $5.4 billion or 18% over 2018, largely due to acquired loans from the CoBiz acquisition combined with the expansion of the available for sale securities portfolio. Average loans, net of allowance for loan losses, increased $3.4 billion. The average balance of available for sale securities increased $1.8 billion. Total average deposits grew by $2.8 billion over 2018, largely related to acquired deposits. Average interest-bearing transaction deposits increased $2.5 billion. Average short-term borrowings increased $2.9 billion, primarily from increased borrowings from federal funds purchased and the Federal Home Loan Banks.\nTable 2 - Volume/Rate Analysis\n(In thousands)\n\n1 Changes attributable to both volume and yield/rate are allocated to both volume and yield/rate on an equal basis.\nTable 2 - Volume/Rate Analysis (continued)\n(In thousands)\n\n1 Changes attributable to both volume and yield/rate are allocated to both volume and yield/rate on an equal basis.\nOther Operating Revenue\nOther operating revenue was $843.9 million for 2020, an increase of $149.6 million or 22% over 2019 driven by growth in mortgage banking revenue and brokerage and trading revenue.\nTable 3 - Other Operating Revenue\n(In thousands)\n\n1 Non-GAAP measure to net interchange charges for 2016-2017 between transaction card revenue and data processing and communications expense as a result of the revenue recognition standard implemented January 1, 2018. This measure has no effect on net income or earnings per share.\nFees and commissions revenue\nDiversified sources of fees and commissions revenue are a significant part of our business strategy and represented 42% of total revenue for 2020, excluding provision for credit losses and gains and losses on asset sales, securities and derivatives and the change in the fair value of mortgage servicing rights. We believe that a variety of fee revenue sources provides an offset to changes in interest rates, values in the equity markets, commodity prices and consumer spending, all of which can be volatile. As an example of this strength, many of the economic factors such as rising interest rates resulting in growth in net interest revenue or fiduciary and asset management revenue may also decrease mortgage banking production volumes and related trading. We expect growth in other operating revenue to come through offering new products and services and by further development of our presence in other markets. However, current and future economic conditions, including the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, regulatory constraints, increased competition and saturation in our existing markets could affect the rate of future increases.\nBrokerage and trading revenue, which includes revenues from trading, customer hedging, retail broker and investment banking, increased $62.0 million or 39% over the prior year.\nTrading revenue includes net realized and unrealized gains and losses primarily related to sales of residential mortgage-backed securities guaranteed by U.S. government agencies and related derivative instruments that enable our mortgage-banking customers to manage their production risk. Trading revenue also includes net realized and unrealized gains and losses on municipal securities, asset-backed securities and other financial instruments that we sell to institutional customers, along with changes in the fair value of financial instruments we hold as economic hedges against market risk of our trading securities. Trading revenue was $144.3 million for 2020, an increase of $55.7 million over 2019. Industry-wide mortgage loan production increased in 2020 driven by lower interest rates as the Federal Reserve stepped in to provide market stability. We increased our bond trading pipeline to provide greater liquidity to the housing market during a time of record loan production volumes.\nCustomer hedging revenue is based primarily on realized and unrealized changes in the fair value of derivative contracts held for customer risk management programs. As more fully discussed under Customer Derivative Programs in Note 3 of the Consolidated Financial Statements, we offer commodity, interest rate, foreign exchange and equity derivatives to our customers. Derivative contracts executed with customers are offset with contracts between selected counterparties and exchanges to minimize market risk from changes in commodity prices, interest rates or foreign exchange rates.", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7.

This discussion should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and footnotes and selected financial data presented elsewhere in this report.\nAfter completing its 11th consecutive year of expansion in 2019, the U.S. economy experienced extreme volatility throughout 2020. The worldwide spread of COVID-19 affected every part of the economic environment. Economic conditions in the U.S. declined drastically in March and April of 2020 following the initial U.S. COVID-19 outbreak. Congress quickly passed the CARES Act economic relief package, which alleviated some of the downturn. With the government stimulus package and some time to settle into the current new normal, the economy rebounded significantly in the second half of the year.\nThe Federal Reserve lowered the federal funds rate to near zero by April, 2020 and has initiated additional programs to infuse liquidity and stimulate economic activity. The Federal Reserve is expected to keep the federal funds rate at or near zero until the labor market has fully recovered and inflation has stabilized at 2%. See \"Summary of Credit Loss Experience\" section of Management's Discussion and Analysis for additional discussion around our economic forecast.\nPerformance Summary\nNet income for the year ended December 31, 2020 totaled $435.0 million or $6.19 per diluted share compared with net income of $500.8 million or $7.03 per diluted share for the year ended December 31, 2019. A pre-tax provision for expected credit losses of $222.6 million was included in 2020 while a pre-tax provision for incurred losses of $44.0 million was included in 2019. The Company adopted the current expected credit loss (\"CECL\") model on January 1, 2020.\nPre-provision net revenue, a non-GAAP measure, was $786.4 million for 2020 compared to $674.9 million in the prior year. This is a measure of revenue less expenses, and is calculated before provision for credit losses and income tax expense. Pre-provision net revenue is a financial measure frequently used by investors and analysts that enables them to assess a company's ability to generate earnings to cover credit losses through a credit cycle. It also provides an additional basis for comparing the results of operations between periods by isolating the impact of the provision for credit losses, which can vary significantly between periods.\nWe incurred $17.2 million of integration costs in 2019 related to the acquisition of CoBiz Financial, Inc. (\"CoBiz\") on October 1, 2018, which resulted in an $0.18 per share reduction in 2019. The fluctuation discussion in the highlights below excludes this impact.\nHighlights of 2020 included:\n\u2022Net interest revenue totaled $1.1 billion for 2020, consistent with the prior year. Net interest margin was 2.83% for 2020 compared to 3.11% for 2019. The Federal Reserve reduced the federal funds rate to near zero early in the year putting pressure on the margin in 2020. Average earning assets were $40.7 billion for 2020, up $4.3 billion over 2019. The increase was largely due to increased trading securities, loans primarily related to the Small Business Administration's Paycheck Protection Program (\"PPP\"), and the expansion of the available for sale securities portfolio as we repositioned the balance sheet for a lower rate environment.\n\u2022Fees and commissions revenue was $810.3 million for 2020, up $108.1 million compared to 2019. Mortgage banking revenue increased $74.8 million and brokerage and trading revenue increased $62.0 million. Lower mortgage interest rates increased both mortgage loan production and related trading activities. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in deposit service charges of $15.7 million and fiduciary and asset management revenue of $9.6 million.\n\u2022Other operating expense totaled $1.2 billion, a $50.8 million increase compared to 2019. Personnel expense increased $30.8 million, primarily due to higher incentive compensation expense due to expanded trading activities. This was partially offset by lower employee benefits costs. Increased data processing and communications expense, occupancy and equipment expense, mortgage banking costs and charitable contributions were partially offset by lower business promotions expense.\n\u2022The net economic benefit of the changes in the fair value of mortgage servicing rights and related economic hedges was $24.9 million during 2020 compared to an economic cost of $17.9 million during 2019.\n\u2022The allowance for loan losses totaled $389 million or 1.69% of outstanding loans at December 31, 2020. The combined allowance for loan losses and accrual for off-balance sheet credit risk from unfunded loan commitments was $426 million or 1.85% of outstanding loans at December 31, 2020. Excluding PPP loans, which are fully guaranteed by a U.S. government agency, the allowance for loan losses was 1.82% of outstanding loans and the combined allowance for loan losses and accrual for off-balance sheet credit risk from unfunded loan commitments was 2.00%. The allowance for loan losses was $211 million or 0.97% of outstanding loans and the combined allowance for loan losses and accrual for off-balance sheet credit risk from unfunded loan commitments was $212 million or 0.98% of outstanding loans at December 31, 2019.\n\u2022Period-end outstanding loan balances were $23.0 billion at December 31, 2020, a $1.3 billion increase over the prior year, primarily due to the inflow of PPP loans. Average loans were $23.4 billion, a $1.3 billion increase compared to 2019.\n\u2022Period-end deposits totaled $36.1 billion at December 31, 2020, an $8.5 billion increase compared to December 31, 2019. Interest-bearing transaction deposits increased $5.8 billion, while demand deposit balances increased $2.8 billion. Average deposits increased $7.1 billion to $32.8 billion. Deposit growth was largely due to customers retaining higher balances in the current economic environment combined with increases due to various COVID-19 related government program stimulus payments.\n\u2022Common equity Tier 1 capital ratio was 11.95% at December 31, 2020. In addition, the Tier 1 capital ratio was 11.95%, total capital ratio was 13.82% and leverage ratio was 8.28% at December 31, 2020. At December 31, 2019, the Tier 1 capital ratio was 11.39%, the total capital ratio was 12.94% and the leverage ratio was 8.40%.\n\u2022The Company repurchased 1,107,100 shares at an average price of $68.49 per share during 2020 and 1,572,322 shares at an average price of $82.35 during 2019.\n\u2022The Company paid cash dividends of $2.05 per common share during 2020 and $2.01 per common share in 2019.\nNet income for the fourth quarter of 2020 totaled $154.2 million or $2.21 per diluted share, compared to $110.4 million or $1.56 per diluted share for the fourth quarter of 2019.\nHighlights of the fourth quarter of 2020 included:\n\u2022Net interest revenue totaled $297.2 million for the fourth quarter of 2020, an increase of $27.0 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2019, largely due to a $5.2 billion increase in average trading securities. We saw a shift from trading revenue to interest income on trading securities in the fourth quarter of 2020. Net interest margin was 2.72% for the fourth quarter of 2020 and 2.88% for the fourth quarter of 2019. The increase in the trading securities portfolio combined with the repricing of our available for sale securities portfolio decreased the net interest margin.\n\u2022Fees and commissions revenue totaled $181.1 million, up $1.6 million over the fourth quarter of 2019. Increased mortgage banking revenue stemming from the low interest rate environment was largely offset by decreased brokerage and trading revenue, fiduciary and asset management revenue, and deposit service charges.\n\u2022Operating expenses in the fourth quarter totaled $300.7 million, an $11.9 million increase compared to the prior year. Personnel expense increased $7.8 million primarily due to higher incentive compensation expense, partially offset by regular compensation expense. Non-personnel expenses increased $4.1 million, largely due to increased data processing and communications expense and higher charitable contributions, partially offset by lower business promotion expense.\n\u2022Based on an evaluation of economic forecasts and loan portfolio characteristics, the Company recorded a $6.5 million negative provision for expected credit losses in the fourth quarter of 2020 and a $19.0 million provision for incurred credit losses in the fourth quarter of 2019.\nCritical Accounting Policies & Estimates\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America ( GAAP\u201d). The Company's accounting policies are more fully described in Note 1 of the Consolidated Financial Statements. Management makes significant assumptions and estimates in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes in conformity with GAAP that may be highly subjective, complex and subject to variability. Actual results could differ significantly from these assumptions and estimates. The following discussion addresses the most critical areas where these assumptions and estimates could affect the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the Company. These critical accounting policies and estimates have been discussed with the appropriate committees of the Board of Directors.\nAllowance for Loan Losses and Accrual for Off-Balance Sheet Credit Risk from Loan Commitments\nThe allowance for loan losses and accrual for off-balance sheet credit risk from unfunded loan commitments represent the portion of amortized cost basis of loans and related unfunded commitments we do not expect to collect over the asset's contractual life, considering past events, current conditions, as well as reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic conditions. Appropriateness of the allowance for loan losses and accrual for off-balance sheet credit risk from unfunded loan commitments is determined by a senior management Allowance Committee which requires judgment about effects of uncertain matters, resulting in a subjective calculation which is inherently imprecise. Because of the subjective forward-looking nature of the calculation, changes in these measures may not directly correlate with actual economic events. In future periods, management judgment may consider new or changed information which may cause significant changes in these allowances in those future periods.\nAs of January 1, 2020 BOK Financial's accounting policies have changed significantly with the adoption of Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-13 Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Assets Measured at Amortized Cost (\"ASU 2016-13\" or \"CECL\"). Prior years are not restated. Prior to January 1, 2020, general allowances and nonspecific allowances were based on incurred credit losses. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the description of the expected credit losses calculation of the allowance for loan losses and accrual for off-balance sheet credit risk from unfunded loan commitments.\nFor the majority of risk-graded loans, the accruing loan's expected credit loss estimate is sensitive to management judgment, particularly probability of default and loss given default assumptions, changes in specific macroeconomic factor forecasts and the probability weight assigned to each economic scenario.\nProbability of default and loss given default measurements are based on historical data that may not be a good predictor of future performance or actual losses. Probability of default is based on risk grades, a subjective measurement of the risk of a loan. This subjective assessment of risk may not reflect actual risk of loss.\nOther subjective measures include the forecast for each relevant economic loss driver and the probability weighting of economic scenarios, both of which are overseen by a senior management Economic Forecast Committee which includes members independent of the allowance process. The Allowance Committee may increase or decrease the allowance based on factors that include, for example, new lines of business, market conditions that have not been previously encountered, observed changes in credit risk that are not yet reflected in macroeconomic factors, or economic conditions that impact loss given default assumptions.\nAlthough the resulting expected credit loss estimate represents management's best estimates at the time, actual credit losses will differ from management's estimate. Portfolio composition will change over time, actual economic conditions will differ from probability-weighted assumptions, borrower-specific circumstances will change, as well as other factors. Differences between actual losses and management's estimates may materially affect the Company's results of operations.\nFair Value Measurement\nCertain assets and liabilities are recorded at fair value in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Fair value is defined by applicable accounting guidance as the price to sell an asset or transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants in the principal markets for the given asset or liability at the measurement date based on market conditions at that date. An orderly transaction assumes exposure to the market for a customary period for marketing activities prior to the measurement date and not a forced liquidation or distressed sale.\nA hierarchy for fair value has been established that prioritizes the inputs of valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad categories: unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1), other observable inputs that can be observed either directly or indirectly (Level 2) and unobservable inputs for assets or liabilities (Level 3). Fair value may be recorded for certain assets and liabilities every reporting period on a recurring basis or under certain circumstances on a non-recurring basis. Fair value measurements of significant assets or liabilities that are based on unobservable inputs (Level 3) are considered Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates. Additional discussion of fair value measurement and disclosure is included in Notes 7 and 19 of the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nMortgage Servicing Rights\nWe have a significant investment in mortgage servicing rights. Our mortgage servicing rights are primarily retained from sales in the secondary market of residential mortgage loans we have originated or purchased from correspondent lenders. Occasionally, mortgage servicing rights may be purchased from other lenders. Both originated and purchased mortgage servicing rights are initially recognized at fair value. We carry all mortgage servicing rights at fair value. Changes in fair value are recognized in earnings as they occur.\nMortgage servicing rights are not traded in active markets. The fair value of mortgage servicing rights is determined by discounting the projected cash flows. Certain significant assumptions and estimates used in valuing mortgage servicing rights are based on current market sources including projected prepayment speeds, assumed servicing costs, earnings on escrow deposits, ancillary income and discount rates. Assumptions used to value our mortgage servicing rights are considered significant unobservable inputs and represent our best estimate of assumptions that market participants would use to value this asset. A separate third party model is used to estimate prepayment speeds based on interest rates, housing turnover rates, estimated loan curtailment, anticipated defaults and other relevant factors. The prepayment model is updated periodically for changes in market conditions and adjusted to better correlate with actual performance of our servicing portfolio. The discount rate is based on benchmark rates for mortgage loans plus a market spread expected by investors in servicing rights. Significant assumptions used to determine the fair value of our mortgage servicing rights are presented in Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. At least annually, we request estimates of fair value from outside sources to corroborate the results of the valuation model.\nThe assumptions used in this model are primarily based on mortgage interest rates. Evaluation of the effect of a change in one assumption without considering the effect of that change on other assumptions is not meaningful. Considering all related assumptions, we expect a 50 basis point increase in primary mortgage interest rates to increase the fair value of our servicing rights by $29 million. We expect a $15 million decrease in the fair value of our mortgage servicing rights from a 50 basis point decrease in primary mortgage interest rates.\nValuation of Impaired Loans and Real Estate and Other Repossessed Assets\nThe fair value of collateral for certain impaired loans and real estate and other repossessed assets is measured on a non-recurring basis. The fair value of real estate is generally based on unadjusted third-party appraisals derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data. Fair value measurements based on these appraisals are considered to be based on Level 2 inputs. Fair value measurements based on appraisals that are not based on observable inputs or that require significant adjustments by us or fair value measurements that are not based on third-party appraisals are considered to be based on Level 3 inputs. Significant unobservable inputs include listing prices for comparable assets, uncorroborated expert opinions or management's knowledge of the collateral or industry.\nThe fair value of mineral rights is generally determined by our internal staff of engineers based on projected cash flows from proven oil and gas reserves under existing economic and operating conditions. Proven oil and gas reserves are estimated quantities that geological and engineering data demonstrate, with reasonable certainty, to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs using existing prices and costs. Projected cash flows incorporate assumptions related to a number of factors including production, sales prices, operating expenses, severance, ad valorem taxes, capital costs and appropriate discount rate. Fair values determined through this process are considered to be based on Level 3 inputs.\nIncome Taxes\nDetermination of income tax expense and related assets and liabilities is complex and requires estimates and judgments when applying tax laws, rules, regulations and interpretations. It also requires judgments as to future earnings and the timing of future events. Accrued income taxes represent an estimate of net amounts due to or from taxing jurisdictions based upon these estimates, interpretations and judgments.\nManagement evaluates the Company's current tax expense or benefit based upon estimates of taxable income, tax credits and statutory tax rates. Annually, we file tax returns with each jurisdiction where we conduct business and adjust recognized income tax expense or benefit to filed tax returns.\nWe recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based upon the differences between the values of assets and liabilities as recognized in the financial statements and their related tax basis using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to be recovered or settled. A valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that some portion of the entire deferred tax asset may not be realized.\nWe also recognize the benefit of uncertain tax positions when based upon all relevant evidence, it is more-likely-than-not that our position would prevail upon examination, including resolution of related appeals or litigation, based upon the technical merits of the position. Unrecognized tax benefits, including estimated interest and penalties, are part of our current accrued income tax liability. Estimated penalties and interest are recognized in income tax expense. Income tax expense in future periods may decrease if an uncertain tax position is favorably resolved, generally upon completion of an examination by the taxing authorities, expiration of a statute of limitations, or changes in facts and circumstances.\nGoodwill Impairment\nGoodwill for each reporting unit is evaluated for impairment annually as of October 1st or more frequently if conditions indicate that impairment may have occurred. The evaluation of possible goodwill impairment involves significant judgment based upon short-term and long-term projections of future performance.\nDuring the evaluation for impairment, management qualitatively assesses whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting units is less than their carrying value, including goodwill. Reporting unit carrying value includes sufficient capital to exceed regulatory requirements. This assessment includes consideration of relevant events and circumstances including, but not limited to, macroeconomic conditions, industry and market conditions, the financial and stock performance of the Company and other relevant factors. Specifically, the analysis may include:\n\u2022General economic conditions including overall economic activity, consumer spending and mobility, unemployment rates, consumer confidence, and duration and severity of any current market moving instability.\n\u2022Global health concerns including ongoing pandemics or potential for widespread health issues, the future course of a pandemic and the potential for medical advances.\n\u2022Regional economic conditions including demand for oil and price stability of oil, other overarching conditions that may be affecting any of the Company's primary states such as weather or other catastrophes, pandemics and health related lockdowns, or other state mandates.\n\u2022Industry conditions including federal funds rate movement by the Federal Reserve, the interest rate environment and the resulting effect on net interest revenue and operating revenue, and regulatory mandates that hinder or provide relief to the financial services industry.\n\u2022Company specific conditions including current and forecasted income, changes in stock price, the Company's stock price compared to peers and other indexes, book value per share compared to fair value per share, goodwill compared to total shareholders' equity, current capital and liquidity position, demand for products and services, health of the loan portfolio and other credit related factors, and current credit ratings with the ratings agencies, and regulatory ratings.\n\u2022Reporting unit performance and forecasts including any event that may significantly impact a reporting unit.\nIf management concludes based on the qualitative assessment that goodwill may be impaired, a quantitative impairment test will be applied to goodwill at all reporting units. The quantitative analysis compares the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying value, including goodwill. The fair value of each reporting unit is estimated by the discounted future earnings method. Goodwill is considered impaired if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value of the reporting unit, including goodwill.\nBoth the qualitative assessment and quantitative analysis require significant management judgment, including estimates of changes in future economic conditions and their underlying causes and duration, the reasonableness and effectiveness of management's responses to those changes, changes in governmental fiscal and monetary policies, and fair value measurements based largely on significant unobservable inputs. The results of these judgments may have a significant impact on the Company's reported results of operations.\nSee Note 6, \"Goodwill and Intangible Assets\" for breakout of goodwill by reporting unit.\nResults of Operations\nNet Interest Revenue and Net Interest Margin\nNet interest revenue is the interest earned on debt securities, loans and other interest-earning assets less interest paid for interest-bearing deposits and other borrowings. The net interest margin is calculated by dividing tax-equivalent net interest revenue by average interest-earning assets. Net interest spread is the difference between the average rate earned on interest-earning assets and the average rate paid on interest-bearing liabilities. Net interest margin is typically greater than net interest spread due to interest income earned on assets funded by non-interest bearing liabilities such as demand deposits and equity.\nTax-equivalent net interest revenue totaled $1.1 billion for 2020, consistent with the prior year. This includes $26.0 million of net purchase discount accretion for 2020 and $37.8 million for 2019. Approximately $48 million of purchase accounting discount remains to be accreted. Net interest revenue decreased $108.7 million due to changes in interest rates and increased $102.8 million from growth in earning assets. Table 2 shows the effects on net interest revenue due to changes in average balances and interest rates for the various types of earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. In addition, see the Annual and Quarterly Financial Summary of consolidated daily average balances, yields and rates following the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nNet interest margin was 2.83% for 2020 and 3.11% for 2019. The tax-equivalent yield on earning assets was 3.24% for 2020 compared to 4.27% in 2019. In response to the anticipated impact to the economy from the COVID-19 pandemic, the Federal Reserve reduced the federal funds rate to near zero in March, 2020. The resulting impact on market interest rates has compressed the net interest margin. The company has been proactive in reducing deposit costs and implementing LIBOR floors in loan agreements; however, funds received from available for sale securities have been reinvested at lower rates. Loan yields decreased 129 basis points to 3.84%. The available for sale securities portfolio yield decreased 37 basis points to 2.21%. The yield on trading securities fell 80 basis points to 2.75%. The yield on interest-bearing cash and cash equivalents decreased 183 basis points to 0.45%.\nFunding costs decreased 108 basis points compared to 2019. The cost of interest-bearing deposits decreased 69 basis points. The cost of other short-term borrowings decreased 161 basis points. The benefit to net interest margin from earning assets funded by non-interest bearing liabilities was 12 basis points for 2020, down from 45 basis points for 2019.\nAverage earning assets for 2020 increased $4.3 billion or 12% over 2019, largely due to the expansion of the available for sale securities portfolio, loans originated as part of the Small Business Administration's Paycheck Protection Program (\"PPP\"), and an increase in our trading of U.S. government issued mortgage-backed securities. The average balance of available for sale securities, which consists largely of residential and commercial mortgage-backed securities guaranteed by U.S. government agencies, increased $2.3 billion. We purchase securities to supplement earnings and to manage interest rate risk. We increased the size of our bond portfolio during the latter half of 2019 and first quarter 2020 in order to reduce our exposure to falling short-term interest rates. Average loans, net of allowance for loan losses, increased $1.1 billion, primarily related to $1.4 billion in average PPP loans. Trading securities balances increased $1.3 billion.\nTotal average deposits grew by $7.1 billion over the prior year. This increase is largely due to the combination of focused deposit gathering initiatives, stimulus-related deposits, and customers retaining elevated balances in the current economic environment. Average interest-bearing transaction account balances increased $5.6 billion. Average demand deposit balances increased $1.4 billion. Average short-term borrowings decreased $1.7 billion.\nOur overall objective is to manage the Company's balance sheet to be relatively neutral to changes in interest rates as is further described in the Market Risk section of this report. As shown in Table 21, approximately 70% of our commercial and commercial real estate loan portfolios are either variable rate loans or fixed rate loans that will re-price within one year. These loans are funded primarily by deposit accounts that are either non-interest bearing, or that re-price more slowly than the loans. The result is a balance sheet that would be asset sensitive, which means that assets generally re-price more quickly than liabilities. Among the strategies that we use to manage toward a relatively rate-neutral position, we purchase fixed rate residential mortgage-backed securities issued primarily by U.S. government agencies and fund them with market rate sensitive liabilities. The liability-sensitive nature of this strategy provides an offset to the asset-sensitive characteristics of our loan portfolio. We also may use derivative instruments to manage our interest rate risk.\nThe effectiveness of these strategies is reflected in the overall change in net interest revenue due to changes in interest rates as shown in Table 2 and in the interest rate sensitivity projections as shown in the Market Risk section of this report.\nFourth Quarter 2020 Net Interest Revenue\nTax-equivalent net interest revenue totaled $299.6 million for the fourth quarter of 2020, an increase of $26.7 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2019. Net interest revenue increased $44.5 million, primarily due to the increase in trading securities, available for sale securities and loan balances. This was partially offset by a decrease of $17.8 million primarily due to lower market interest rates in 2020.\nNet interest margin was 2.72% for the fourth quarter of 2020 compared to 2.88% for the fourth quarter of 2019. The tax-equivalent yield on earning assets was 2.92% for the fourth quarter of 2020, a decrease of 101 basis points compared to the fourth quarter of 2019, primarily due to the impact on interest rates related to the federal funds rate cuts in 2020. Loan yields decreased 107 basis points to 3.68%. Yield on available for sale securities decreased 54 basis points to 1.98%. Yield on trading securities decreased 117 basis points to 2.02%.\nFunding costs decreased 112 basis points compared to the fourth quarter of 2019. The cost of other short-term borrowings decreased 145 basis points. The cost of interest-bearing deposits decreased 90 basis points. The benefit to net interest margin from earning assets funded by non-interest bearing liabilities was 8 basis points in the fourth quarter of 2020, down from 35 basis points in the fourth quarter of 2019.\nAverage earning assets for the fourth quarter of 2020 increased $6.3 billion over the fourth quarter of 2019. Trading securities balances increased $5.2 billion as we increased our trading of U.S. government issued mortgage-backed securities. Available for sale securities increased $1.6 billion as the balance sheet was repositioned for the current rate environment. Average loans, net of allowance for loan losses, increased $1.0 billion, largely due to the loans related to the PPP. Fair value option securities held as an economic hedge of our mortgage servicing rights decreased $1.4 billion.\nAverage deposits increased $8.4 billion over the fourth quarter of 2019, largely due to the combination of government stimulus payments and customers choosing to retain elevated balances in the current environment. Average interest-bearing transaction accounts increased $6.0 billion and average demand deposit balances increased $2.5 billion. Average short-term borrowings decreased $3.0 billion.\n2019 Net Interest Revenue\nTax-equivalent net interest revenue for 2019 was $1.1 billion, up from $993.8 million for 2018. The acquisition of CoBiz in the fourth quarter of 2018 added $158.5 million to net interest revenue in 2019 and $43.1 million to net interest revenue in 2018. This includes $37.8 million of net purchase discount accretion for 2019 and $6.4 million for 2018. Net interest revenue decreased $13.7 million due to rates and increased $144.4 million from growth in earning assets.\nNet interest margin was 3.11% for 2019 compared to 3.20% for 2018. The tax-equivalent yield on average earning assets increased 29 basis points over 2018. Short-term rate increases during the first half of 2019 resulting from four 25 basis point increases in the federal funds rate by the Federal Reserve during 2018 were partially offset by three 25 basis point decreases in the federal funds rate in the second half of 2019. Loan yields increased 33 basis points. The available for sale securities portfolio yield increased 23 basis points.The yield on interest-bearing cash and cash equivalents increased 48 basis points. The yield on trading securities fell 29 basis points. The cost of interest-bearing liabilities increased 42 basis points. The cost of interest-bearing deposits increased 39 basis points and the cost of other short-term borrowings increased 35 basis points. The benefit to net interest margin from earning assets funded by non-interest bearing liabilities was 45 basis points for 2019, compared to 41 basis points for 2018.\nAverage earning assets increased $5.4 billion or 18% over 2018, largely due to acquired loans from the CoBiz acquisition combined with the expansion of the available for sale securities portfolio. Average loans, net of allowance for loan losses, increased $3.4 billion. The average balance of available for sale securities increased $1.8 billion. Total average deposits grew by $2.8 billion over 2018, largely related to acquired deposits. Average interest-bearing transaction deposits increased $2.5 billion. Average short-term borrowings increased $2.9 billion, primarily from increased borrowings from federal funds purchased and the Federal Home Loan Banks.\nTable 2 - Volume/Rate Analysis\n(In

and data processing and communications expense as a result of the revenue recognition standard implemented January 1, 2018. This measure has no effect on net income or earnings per share.\nFees and commissions revenue\nDiversified sources of fees and commissions revenue are a significant part of our business strategy and represented 42% of total revenue for 2020, excluding provision for credit losses and gains and losses on asset sales, securities and derivatives and the change in the fair value of mortgage servicing rights. We believe that a variety of fee revenue sources provides an offset to changes in interest rates, values in the equity markets, commodity prices and consumer spending, all of which can be volatile. As an example of this strength, many of the economic factors such as rising interest rates resulting in growth in net interest revenue or fiduciary and asset management revenue may also decrease mortgage banking production volumes and related trading. We expect growth in other operating revenue to come through offering new products and services and by further development of our presence in other markets. However, current and future economic conditions, including the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, regulatory constraints, increased competition and saturation in our existing markets could affect the rate of future increases.\nBrokerage and trading revenue, which includes revenues from trading, customer hedging, retail broker and investment banking, increased $62.0 million or 39% over the prior year.\nTrading revenue includes net realized and unrealized gains and losses primarily related to sales of residential mortgage-backed securities guaranteed by U.S. government agencies and related derivative instruments that enable our mortgage-banking customers to manage their production risk. Trading revenue also includes net realized and unrealized gains and losses on municipal securities, asset-backed securities and other financial instruments that we sell to institutional customers, along with changes in the fair value of financial instruments we hold as economic hedges against market risk of our trading securities. Trading revenue was $144.3 million for 2020, an increase of $55.7 million over 2019. Industry-wide mortgage loan production increased in 2020 driven by lower interest rates as the Federal Reserve stepped in to provide market stability. We increased our bond trading pipeline to provide greater liquidity to the housing market during a time of record loan production volumes.\nCustomer hedging revenue is based primarily on realized and unrealized changes in the fair value of derivative contracts held for customer risk management programs. As more fully discussed under Customer Derivative Programs in Note 3 of the Consolidated Financial Statements, we offer commodity, interest rate, foreign exchange and equity derivatives to our customers. Derivative contracts executed with customers are offset with contracts between selected counterparties and exchanges to minimize market risk from changes in commodity prices, interest rates or foreign exchange rates."}
