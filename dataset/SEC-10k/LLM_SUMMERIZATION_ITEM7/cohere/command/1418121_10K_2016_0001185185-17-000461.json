Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with Item 8, the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto, the introduction of Part I regarding Forward-Looking Statements,\u201d and Item 1A, Risk Factors\u201d appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOverview\nThe Company is a Virginia corporation that has elected to be treated as a real estate investment trust ( REIT\u201d) for federal income tax purposes. The Company is self-advised and invests in income-producing real estate, primarily in the lodging sector, in the United States. As of December 31, 2016, the Company owned 235 hotels with an aggregate of 30,073 rooms located in 33 states, including one hotel with 224 rooms classified as held for sale. All of the Company's hotels operate under Marriott or Hilton brands. The hotels are operated and managed under separate management agreements with 22 hotel management companies, none of which are affiliated with the Company. The Company's common shares are listed on the New York Stock Exchange ( NYSE\u201d) under the ticker symbol APLE.\u201d\n2016 Investing Activities\nMerger with Apple REIT Ten, Inc.\nEffective September 1, 2016, the Company completed its previously announced merger with Apple REIT Ten, Inc. ( Apple Ten\u201d), which merger and related transaction proposals were approved by each company's respective shareholders, as applicable, on August 31, 2016. Pursuant to the definitive merger agreement dated April 13, 2016, as amended on July 13, 2016 (the Merger Agreement\u201d), Apple Ten merged with and into a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company (the merger\u201d or Apple Ten merger\u201d). As a result of the merger, the Company acquired the business of Apple Ten, a real estate investment trust, which immediately prior to the merger, owned 56 hotels located in 17 states with an aggregate of 7,209 rooms. Upon completion of the merger, each issued and outstanding unit of Apple Ten (consisting of a common share and related Series A preferred share) (each, an Apple Ten unit\u201d) was converted into the right to receive (i) 0.522 (the unit exchange ratio\u201d) common shares of the Company, with cash in lieu of fractional shares, and (ii) $1.00 in cash, and each issued and outstanding Series B convertible preferred share of Apple Ten received the same consideration described above on an as-converted basis, resulting in the issuance of a total of approximately 48.7 million common shares of the Company and a total payment of approximately $93.6 million in cash, including $0.2 million for fractional shares, to Apple Ten shareholders. The cash payment was funded through borrowings on the Company's revolving credit facility. Based on the closing price of the Company's common shares on August 31, 2016 (the date the merger was approved), the estimated aggregate value of the merger consideration paid to Apple Ten shareholders was approximately $1.0 billion. The Company's common shares totaling 174.7 million prior to the merger remained outstanding following the merger, resulting in approximately 223.4 million common shares outstanding upon completion of the merger. Also, as a result of the merger, the Company, through a wholly-owned subsidiary, assumed all of Apple Ten's assets and liabilities at closing.\nAs more fully described in Note 6 titled Debt\u201d in Part II, Item 8, of the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto, appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, effective September 1, 2016, upon completion of the merger, the Company assumed approximately $145.7 million in mortgage debt, prior to any fair value adjustments, secured by nine properties. The Company also assumed the outstanding balance on Apple Ten's credit facility totaling $111.1 million, which was terminated and repaid in full on September 1, 2016 with borrowings on the Company's revolving credit facility.\nAll costs related to the merger are being expensed in the period they are incurred and are included in transaction and litigation costs in the Company's consolidated statements of operations. In connection with the merger, the Company has incurred approximately $29.2 million in merger costs (including approximately $25.1 million of costs incurred to defend and settle the lawsuit related to the merger, which is net of approximately $10.0 million of reimbursements from the Company's directors and officers insurance carriers, which is discussed in Note 15 titled Legal Proceedings\u201d in Part II, Item 8, of the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto, appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K) for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nAs contemplated in the Merger Agreement, in connection with the completion of the merger, the advisory and related party arrangements with respect to Apple Ten and its advisors were terminated.\nIndex\nSee Note 2 titled Merger with Apple REIT Ten, Inc.\u201d in Part II, Item 8, of the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto, appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information concerning the merger with Apple Ten.\nOther Acquisitions and Dispositions\nThe Company continually monitors market conditions and attempts to maximize shareholder value by investing in properties that it believes provide superior value in the long term. Consistent with this strategy and the Company's focus on investing in select service hotels, in addition to completing the Apple Ten merger in the third quarter of 2016, the Company also acquired a newly constructed 128-room Home2 Suites hotel in Atlanta, Georgia on July 1, 2016, the same day the hotel opened for business, for a purchase price of approximately $24.6 million. The purchase price for this property was funded through borrowings on the Company's revolving credit facility. As of December 31, 2016, the Company had outstanding contracts for the potential purchase of four additional hotels for a total purchase price of $100.6 million. One of the four, the newly constructed Fort Worth, Texas Courtyard hotel, was acquired on February 2, 2017, the same day the hotel opened for business. The remaining three hotels are under construction and are planned to be completed and opened for business over the next nine to 18 months from December 31, 2016, at which time closing on these hotels is expected to occur.\nAdditionally, for its existing portfolio, the Company monitors each property's profitability, market conditions and capital requirements and attempts to maximize shareholder value by disposing of properties when it believes that superior value can be provided by the proceeds from the sale of the property. As a result, during the third quarter of 2016, the Company identified two properties for potential sale (its 224-room Hilton hotel in Dallas, Texas and its 226-room Marriott hotel in Chesapeake, Virginia), and in October 2016, the Company entered into separate contracts for the sale of these properties. Due to the change in the anticipated hold period for each of these hotels, the Company recognized an impairment loss of approximately $5.5 million during the third quarter of 2016 to adjust the basis of the Chesapeake, Virginia Marriott to its estimated fair value. In December 2016, the Company completed the sale of the Chesapeake, Virginia Marriott, resulting in a loss of approximately $0.2 million, which is included in the Company's consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2016. At December 31, 2016, the Dallas, Texas Hilton was under contract to be sold for approximately $56.1 million and was classified as held for sale in the Company's consolidated balance sheet. Under the contract, at closing, which is expected to be during the first half of 2017, the mortgage loan secured by the Dallas, Texas Hilton hotel with an outstanding balance of approximately $27.2 million as of December 31, 2016 will be assumed by the buyer with the buyer receiving a credit for the amount assumed. The sale of these properties does not represent a strategic shift that has, or will have, a major effect on the Company's operations and financial results, and therefore the operating results of these properties are included in income from continuing operations for the three years ended December 31, 2016. The proceeds from the sales were or will be used to pay down borrowings on the Company's $540 million revolving credit facility. See Note 4 titled Investment in Real Estate\u201d and Note 5 titled Assets Held for Sale and Dispositions\u201d in Part II, Item 8, of the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto, appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information concerning these dispositions.\nHotel Operations\nAlthough hotel performance can be influenced by many factors including local competition, local and general economic conditions in the United States and the performance of individual managers assigned to each hotel, performance of the Company's hotels as compared to other hotels within their respective local markets, in general, has met the Company's expectations for the period owned. Although improvement was moderate in the latter half of 2016, the hotel industry and the Company's hotels overall continue to experience improvement in both revenues and operating results as compared to the prior year. Economic conditions in the United States have been generally favorable, however there is no way to predict future economic conditions, and there are certain factors that could negatively affect the lodging industry and the Company, including but not limited to, increased hotel supply in certain markets, labor uncertainty both for the economy as a whole and the lodging industry in particular, global volatility and government fiscal policies. The Company, on a comparable basis (as defined below), and industry are forecasting a low single digit percentage increase in revenue for 2017 as compared to 2016. Based on recent revenue trends, the Company's revenue growth rate for comparable hotels in 2017 is anticipated to be similar to the growth achieved in the second half of 2016 (total revenue per available room ( RevPAR\u201d) growth for the Company was approximately 1.7% for comparable hotels in the second half of 2016 compared to the second half of 2015), primarily due to inconsistent demand in certain markets and increased hotel supply meeting demand growth in others, limiting the Company's ability to increase rates.\nIndex\nIn evaluating financial condition and operating performance, the most important indicators on which the Company focuses are revenue measurements, such as average occupancy, average daily rate ( ADR\u201d) and RevPAR, and expenses, such as hotel operating expenses, general and administrative expenses and other expenses described below.\nThe following is a summary of the results from operations of the Company's hotels for their respective periods of ownership by the Company.\nTable 84: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (in thousands, except statistical data)\n</td> <td> </td>

For the hotels acquired during the reporting periods shown, the Company has included, as applicable, results of those hotels for periods prior to the Company's ownership using information provided by the properties' prior owners at the time of acquisition and not adjusted by the Company. This information has not been audited, either for the periods owned or prior to ownership by the Company.

Economic indicators in the United States have generally been favorable, which continues to positively impact the overall lodging industry. As a result, the Company's revenue and operating results for its Comparable Hotels improved in 2016 as compared to 2015 and 2014. The Company expects continued improvement in revenue and operating results for its Comparable Hotels in 2017 as compared to 2016, although at a slower rate than in recent years. The Company's hotels in general have shown results consistent with industry and brand averages for the period of ownership.\nResults of Operations for Years 2016 and 2015\nAs of December 31, 2016, the Company owned 235 hotels with 30,073 rooms as compared to 179 hotels with a total of 22,961 rooms as of December 31, 2015. Results of operations are included only for the period of ownership for hotels acquired or disposed of during 2016 and 2015. During 2016, the Company acquired 56 hotels in the Apple Ten merger effective September 1, 2016, acquired one additional newly constructed hotel on July 1, 2016 and sold one hotel on December 6, 2016. During 2015, the Company acquired one new and six existing hotels (between June 1, 2015 and October 31, 2015) and sold 19 hotels (18 of which were sold on February 26, 2015 and one of which was sold on June 1, 2015). As a result, the comparability of results for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 as discussed below is significantly impacted by these transactions.\nRevenues\nThe Company's principal source of revenue is hotel revenue consisting of room and other related revenue. For the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, the Company had total revenue of $1.0 billion and $898.3 million, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, Comparable Hotels achieved combined average occupancy of 77.0% and 76.9%, ADR of $133.47 and $130.05 and RevPAR of $102.81 and $100.07. ADR is calculated as room revenue divided by the number of rooms sold, and RevPAR is calculated as occupancy multiplied by ADR.\nDuring 2016, the Company experienced stable occupancy combined with an increase in ADR as compared to 2015, resulting in a modest increase in RevPAR. Overall, the Company's Comparable Hotels' RevPAR growth for 2016 was in line with industry averages. Although certain markets will vary based on local supply/demand dynamics and local market economic conditions, with continued overall room rate improvement combined with expected stable overall demand growth compared to supply growth, the Company, on a comparable basis, and industry are forecasting a low single digit percentage increase in revenue for 2017 as compared to 2016. During the fourth quarter of 2016, the Company's Comparable Hotels' RevPAR increased approximately 1.8% compared to the fourth quarter of 2015. Markets such as Houston, Miami and Chicago continue to show weakness due to specific market economic weakness and/or supply increases. With the Company's geographic diversity, these markets were offset by strength in other markets such as Los Angeles, Tampa and Phoenix.\nHotel Operating Expense\nHotel operating expense consists of direct room operating expense, hotel administrative expense, sales and marketing expense, utilities expense, repair and maintenance expense, franchise fees and management fees. For the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, hotel operating expense totaled $582.8 million and $507.1 million or 56.0% and 56.4% of total revenue for each respective period. Overall hotel operational expenses for\nIndex\n2016 include the results of the 56 hotels acquired in the Apple Ten merger for the last four months of the year, one hotel acquired on July 1, 2016 from the date of acquisition, the results of the seven hotels acquired between June 1, 2015 and October 31, 2015 for the full year, and the results of one hotel sold on December 6, 2016 until the date of sale. Expenses for 2015 include the results of the 19 hotels sold in 2015 until the respective dates of sale and the seven hotels acquired in 2015 from their respective dates of acquisition. For the Company's Comparable Hotels, hotel operating expense as a percentage of revenue decreased approximately 20 basis points for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily due to the overall increase in ADR for these hotels, favorable utility costs and the relatively fixed nature of certain operating costs such as management costs, certain utility costs and minimum supply and maintenance costs, which decline as a percentage of revenue as revenue increases, partially offset by increasing labor costs. The Company anticipates labor costs are likely to grow at increased rates due to government regulations surrounding wages, healthcare and other benefits and other government-related initiatives, such as the living wage\u201d increase, which could negatively impact operating expenses in certain markets moving forward. Additionally, labor costs have been and could be impacted in certain markets due to lower unemployment rates. With less qualified available labor, costs have increased. Although operating expenses will increase as revenue increases, the Company will continue to work with its management companies to reduce costs as a percentage of revenue where possible while maintaining quality and service levels at each property.\nProperty Taxes, Insurance and Other Expense\nProperty taxes, insurance and other expense for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 totaled $56.9 million and $46.0 million, respectively, or 5.5% and 5.1% of total revenue, respectively. The increase as a percent of revenue from 2015 is due primarily to the receipt in 2015 of approximately $1.8 million in settlement proceeds, net of costs, from the Deepwater Horizon Economic and Property Damages Settlement Program related to damages suffered at several of the Company's hotels as a result of the Gulf of Mexico oil spill in 2010. For the Company's Comparable Hotels, real estate taxes increased in 2016 compared to 2015, with tax increases at certain locations due to the reassessment of property values by localities related to the improved economy, partially offset by decreases at other locations due to successful appeals of tax assessments. With the economy continuing to improve, the Company anticipates continued increases in property tax assessments in 2017. The Company will continue to appeal tax assessments in certain jurisdictions to attempt to minimize tax increases as warranted.\nGround Lease Expense\nGround lease expense for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 was $10.4 million and $10.0 million, respectively. Ground lease expense primarily represents the expense incurred by the Company to lease land for 14 of its hotel properties, including four hotels acquired in the Apple Ten merger effective September 1, 2016.\nGeneral and Administrative Expense\nGeneral and administrative expense for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 was $17.0 million and $19.6 million, respectively, or 1.6% and 2.2% of total revenue, respectively. The principal components of general and administrative expense are payroll and related benefit costs, legal fees, accounting fees and reporting expenses. In addition, through August 31, 2016, the Company provided to Apple Ten the advisory services contemplated under its advisory agreement, and the Company received fees and reimbursement of expenses payable under the advisory agreement from Apple Ten, both of which were reductions to general and administrative expenses. Effective September 1, 2016, in connection with the completion of the Apple Ten merger, the advisory agreement was terminated and the Company no longer receives the fees and reimbursement of expenses payable under the advisory agreement from Apple Ten. Although expense for the Company in total dollars increased, since both the advisory fees and reimbursed costs received by the Company from Apple Ten were recorded as general and administrative expense by Apple Ten and as reductions to general and administrative expense by the Company, the termination of the advisory agreement had no financial impact on the combined company after the effective time of the merger.\nThe decrease in general and administrative expense for 2016 as compared to 2015 was due primarily to a decrease in compensation expense partially offset by increased costs due to the acquisition of Apple Ten. Based on the Company's performance in 2016 in relation to the operational performance and shareholder return metrics of the executive compensation incentive plan effective January 1, 2016 ( 2016 Incentive Plan\u201d), the amounts earned under the 2016 Incentive Plan were lower than the comparable compensation under the 2015 executive incentive plan ( 2015 Incentive Plan\u201d), resulting in a decrease in executive compensation expense for 2016 of approximately $5.6\nIndex\nmillion, as compared to 2015. However, the decrease in compensation expense was partially offset by the addition of a time-based vesting component to the 2015 Incentive Plan. As a result of listing the Company's common shares on the NYSE effective May 18, 2015 (the Listing\u201d), the Company added a time-based vesting component to its 2015 Incentive Plan in addition to the performance metrics, with compensation recognized over a two year period and, as a result, 2016 executive compensation expense includes recognition of share based compensation from both the 2015 and 2016 executive compensation incentive plans.\nTransaction and Litigation Costs\nTransaction and litigation costs for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 were $35.0 million and $7.2 million, respectively. Transaction and litigation costs for 2016 consist primarily of (i) costs related to the Apple Ten merger discussed herein totaling approximately $29.2 million (including approximately $25.1 million of costs incurred to defend and settle the lawsuit related to the Apple Ten merger, which is net of approximately $10.0 million of reimbursements from the Company's directors and officers insurance carriers, discussed herein), (ii) $5.5 million of costs incurred to settle the previously disclosed lawsuit related to Apple REIT Seven, Inc.'s ( Apple Seven\u201d) and Apple REIT Eight, Inc.'s ( Apple Eight\u201d) terminated Dividend Reinvestment Plans, discussed herein, and (iii) other acquisition related costs totaling approximately $0.4 million. Transaction and litigation costs for 2015 consist primarily of (i) costs related to the Board of Directors' review and evaluation of strategic alternatives, including the Listing, totaling approximately $5.8 million, (ii) costs related to the Company's merger with Apple Seven and Apple Eight on March 1, 2014 ( A7 and A8 mergers\u201d) totaling approximately $0.1 million, which consisted primarily of costs incurred to defend the A7 and A8 mergers class action lawsuit, dismissed in 2016, net of reimbursements received from the Company's directors and officers insurance carriers related to these costs and (iii) acquisition related costs totaling approximately $1.2 million.\nLoss on Impairment of Depreciable Real Estate Assets\nLoss on impairment of depreciable real estate assets was approximately $5.5 million and $45.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and consisted of impairment charges for (a) its Marriott hotel in Chesapeake, Virginia recorded during the third quarter of 2016, resulting from a change in the anticipated hold period for this asset, which was later sold in December 2016, and (b) its Renaissance hotel in New York, New York recorded in the fourth quarter of 2015, as a result of declines in the hotel's current and projected operations. See Note 4 titled Investment in Real Estate\u201d in Part II, Item 8, of the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto, appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information concerning these impairment losses.\nDepreciation Expense\nDepreciation expense for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 was $148.2 million and $127.4 million, respectively. Depreciation expense primarily represents expense of the Company's hotel buildings and related improvements, and associated personal property (furniture, fixtures, and equipment) for their respective periods owned. The increase was primarily due to the increase in the number of properties owned as a result of the Apple Ten merger effective September 1, 2016, the acquisition of one hotel on July 1, 2016 and seven hotels in 2015 and renovations completed throughout 2016 and 2015.\nInterest and Other Expense, net\nInterest and other expense, net for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 was $40.0 million and $33.1 million, respectively, and is net of approximately $1.6 million and $1.5 million of interest capitalized associated with renovation and construction projects, respectively. The increase in interest expense was primarily due to an increase in the Company's average outstanding borrowings during 2016 as compared to 2015 which is primarily attributable to (a) mortgage debt assumed in the Apple Ten merger effective September 1, 2016 and (b) borrowings to fund (i) the cash payment portion of the Apple Ten merger, (ii) the repayment of Apple Ten's outstanding balance on its extinguished credit facility assumed in the merger, (iii) the acquisition of eight hotels (seven between June 1, 2015 and October 31, 2015 and one on July 1, 2016) and (iv) the Company's tender offer and other share repurchases in 2016 and 2015. The impact of higher debt balances was partially offset by a reduction in the average interest rate incurred on the Company's total outstanding debt. Also, interest expense in 2015 includes a loss of approximately $0.4 million recorded to interest and other expense, net related to the change in fair value in the Company's interest\nIndex\nrate swap terminated in May 2015, from the time that it was no longer designated as a cash flow hedge during the first quarter of 2015 through the termination date.\nResults of Operations for Years 2015 and 2014\nAs of December 31, 2015, the Company owned 179 hotels with 22,961 rooms as compared to 191 hotels with a total of 23,790 rooms as of December 31, 2014. Results of operations are included only for the period of ownership for hotels acquired or disposed of during 2015 and 2014. During 2015, the Company acquired one new and six existing hotels (between June 1, 2015 and October 31, 2015) and sold 19 hotels (18 of which were sold on February 26, 2015 and one of which was sold on June 1, 2015). During 2014, the Company acquired 100 hotels, including 99 continuing hotels with the A7 and A8 mergers, effective March 1, 2014, and opened two newly constructed hotels during 2014. As a result, the comparability of results for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 as discussed below is significantly impacted by these transactions.\nRevenues\nFor the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, the Company had total revenue of $898.3 million and $803.9 million, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, Comparable Hotels achieved combined average occupancy of 76.9% and 75.6%, ADR of $130.05 and $123.95 and RevPAR of $100.07 and $93.72. During 2015, as the United States economy continued to strengthen, the Company experienced an increase in average occupancy of approximately 1.7% and an increase in ADR of approximately 4.9% for its Comparable Hotels as compared to 2014.\nHotel Operating Expense\nFor the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, hotel operating expense totaled $507.1 million and $455.9 million or 56.4% and 56.7% of total revenue for each respective period. Overall hotel operational expenses for 2015 primarily reflect the impact of the A7 and A8 mergers and the two newly constructed hotels that opened in December 2014 for the entire period, the 19 hotels sold until the respective dates of sale, and the seven hotels acquired in 2015 from their respective dates of acquisition; and for 2014 reflect the A7 and A8 mergers only for the months of March through December and the 19 hotels sold in 2015 (of which 13 were acquired in the A7 and A8 mergers) for the entire period. For the Company's Comparable Hotels, operating expense as a percentage of revenue decreased slightly for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 primarily due to the overall increase in ADR for these hotels and the Company's success in reducing, relative to revenue increases, certain labor costs, hotel supply costs, maintenance costs and utility costs. The improvements in hotel operating expenses as a percentage of revenue were negatively impacted by disruption from and costs related to the Company's transition of six management contracts to consolidate management within specific markets and to better access regional expertise during 2015.\nProperty Taxes, Insurance and Other Expense\nProperty taxes, insurance and other expense for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 totaled $46.0 million and $40.0 million, respectively, or 5.1% and 5.0% of total revenue, respectively. For the Company's Comparable Hotels, real estate taxes during 2015 increased due to the reassessment of property values by localities related to the improved economy, partially offset by a decrease due to successful appeals of tax assessments for other locations. Property taxes, insurance and other expense in 2015 and 2014 was reduced by approximately $1.8 million and $0.2 million, respectively, in settlement proceeds received, net of costs, from the Deepwater Horizon Economic and Property Damages Settlement Program.\nGround Lease Expense\nGround lease expense for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 was $10.0 million and $8.3 million, respectively. Ground lease expense primarily represents the expense incurred by the Company to lease land for 10 of its hotel properties as of December 31, 2015, nine of which were acquired effective March 1, 2014 with the A7 and A8 mergers.\nIndex\nGeneral and Administrative Expense\nGeneral and administrative expense for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 was $19.6 million and $20.9 million, respectively, or 2.2% and 2.6% of total revenue, respectively. Included in general and administrative expenses are advisory fees and reimbursable expenses incurred prior to the A7 and A8 mergers, and thereafter, payroll and related benefits. Effective March 1, 2014, upon completion of the A7 and A8 mergers, the Company became self-advised and the advisory agreements between the Company and its advisors were terminated. As a result, the employees, including management, became employed by the Company at that time, rather than the Company's former external advisor. In addition, from and after the A7 and A8 mergers until the Apple Ten merger, the Company provided to Apple Ten the advisory services contemplated under their advisory agreement, and the Company received fees and reimbursement of expenses payable under the advisory agreement from Apple Ten, both of which were reductions to general and administrative expenses. The reduction in general and administrative expense during 2015 as compared to 2014 was primarily due to an increase of approximately $1.3 million in advisory fees from Apple Ten, which reached the top fee tier under its advisory agreement due to improved results of operations of Apple Ten in 2015. The increase in advisory fee income for the year ended December 31, 2015 also included two additional months of advisory fees in 2015 as compared to 2014.\nTransaction and Litigation Costs\nTransaction and litigation costs for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 were $7.2 million and $5.1 million, respectively. These costs consist primarily of costs related to the Company's Listing effective May 18, 2015 and associated evaluation of strategic alternatives prior to the Listing, costs related to the A7 and A8 mergers, effective March 1, 2014, and acquisition related costs. Listing and evaluation of strategic alternative costs incurred by the Company totaled approximately $5.8 million and $1.2 million during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Merger costs totaled approximately $0.1 million and $3.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, which include costs incurred to defend the A7 and A8 mergers class action lawsuit, dismissed in 2016, net of reimbursements received from the Company's directors and officers insurance carriers related to these costs. In addition, the Company incurred approximately $1.2 million and $0.6 million of acquisition related costs and pre-opening expenses (related to the opening of two hotels in December 2014) during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nLoss on Impairment of Depreciable Real Estate Assets\nLoss on impairment of depreciable real estate assets was approximately $45.0 million and $11.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, and consisted of impairment charges (a) for its Renaissance hotel in New York, New York recorded in the fourth quarter of 2015 as a result of declines in the hotel's current and projected operations, and (b) resulting from a change in the anticipated hold period for three of 22 properties that were identified by the Company for potential sale, of which 19 of these properties were sold during 2015. See Note 4 titled Investment in Real Estate\u201d in Part II, Item 8, of the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto, appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information concerning these impairment losses.\nDepreciation Expense\nDepreciation expense for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 was $127.4 million and $113.1 million, respectively. The increase was due to the increase in the number of properties owned primarily as a result of the A7 and A8 mergers and hotel acquisitions, as well as renovations completed throughout 2015 and 2014. These increases were partially offset by the sale of 19 hotels in 2015, of which 18 of the hotels were classified as held for sale as of December 31, 2014 and therefore no depreciation was recorded for these properties during the year ended December 31, 2015.\nInterest and Other Expense, net\nInterest and other expense, net for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 was $33.1 million and $23.5 million, respectively and is net of approximately $1.5 million and $1.9 million of interest capitalized associated with renovation and construction projects. The increase in interest expense during 2015 as compared to 2014 was due primarily to (a) an increase in the Company's average outstanding borrowings during 2015 as compared to 2014,\nIndex\nwhich is attributable to debt assumed with the A7 and A8 mergers and increased borrowings to fund the Company's tender offer and share repurchase program, (b) in 2015, the Company recorded a loss totaling $0.4 million related to a terminated interest rate swap in May 2015 and (c) in 2014, the Company recognized a $0.7 million gain on a foreclosure transaction, which was recorded as a reduction to interest and other expense, net. The impact of higher debt balances was partially offset by a reduction in the average interest rate incurred under the Company's outstanding debt.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nThe Company considers the following non-GAAP financial measures useful to investors as key supplemental measures of its operating performance: Funds from Operations ( FFO\u201d), Modified FFO ( MFFO\u201d), Earnings before Interest, Income Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization ( EBITDA\u201d), and Adjusted EBITDA ( Adjusted EBITDA\u201d). These non-GAAP financial measures should be considered along with, but not as alternatives to, net income, cash flow from operations or any other operating GAAP measure. FFO, MFFO, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not necessarily indicative of funds available to fund the Company's cash needs, including its ability to make cash distributions. Although FFO, MFFO, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, as calculated by the Company, may not be comparable to FFO, MFFO, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as reported by other companies that do not define such terms exactly as the Company defines such terms, the Company believes these supplemental measures are useful to investors when comparing the Company's results between periods and with other REITs.\nFFO and MFFO\nThe Company calculates and presents FFO in accordance with standards established by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ( NAREIT\u201d), which defines FFO as net income (computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP\u201d)), excluding gains or losses from sales of real estate, extraordinary items as defined by GAAP, the cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles, plus real estate related depreciation, amortization and impairments, and adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. Historical cost accounting for real estate assets implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. Since real estate values instead have historically risen or fallen with market conditions, most real estate industry investors consider FFO to be helpful in evaluating a real estate company's operations. The Company further believes that by excluding the effects of these items, FFO is useful to investors in comparing its operating performance between periods and between REITs that report FFO using the NAREIT definition. FFO as presented by the Company is applicable only to its common shareholders, but does not represent an amount that accrues directly to common shareholders.\nThe Company further adjusts FFO for certain additional items that are not in NAREIT's definition of FFO, including: (i) the exclusion of the non-cash Series B convertible preferred share conversion expense and transaction and litigation costs as these do not represent ongoing operations and (ii) the exclusion of non-cash straight-line ground lease expense as this expense does not reflect the underlying performance of the related hotels. The Company presents MFFO when evaluating its performance because it believes that it provides further useful supplemental information to investors regarding its ongoing operating performance.\nThe following table reconciles the Company's GAAP net income to FFO and MFFO for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 (in thousands).\nTable 88: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net income\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 144,652\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 117,288\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 6,833\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Depreciation of real estate owned\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 147,244\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 126,530\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 112,346\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (Gain) loss on sale of real estate\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (15,286\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loss on impairment of depreciable real estate assets\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 5,471\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 45,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 10,988\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Amortization of favorable and unfavorable leases, net\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2,422\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1,056\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Funds from operations\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 298,194\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 275,954\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 131,223\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Series B convertible preferred share expense\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 117,133\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Transaction and litigation costs\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 34,989\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 7,181\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 5,142\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Non-cash straight-line ground lease expense\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 3,419\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 3,347\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2,883\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Modified funds from operations\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 336,602\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 286,482\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 256,381\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nIndex\nEBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA\nEBITDA is a commonly used measure of performance in many industries and is defined as net income excluding interest, income taxes and depreciation and amortization. The Company believes EBITDA is useful to investors because it helps the Company and its investors evaluate the ongoing operating performance of the Company by removing the impact of its capital structure (primarily interest expense) and its asset base (primarily depreciation and amortization). In addition, certain covenants included in the Company's indebtedness use EBITDA, as defined in the specific credit agreement, as a measure of financial compliance.\nThe Company considers the exclusion or inclusion of certain additional items from EBITDA useful, including (i) the exclusion of the non-cash Series B convertible preferred share conversion expense, transaction and litigation costs, gains or losses from sales of real estate and the loss on impairment of depreciable real estate assets as these do not represent ongoing operations, and (ii) the exclusion of non-cash straight-line ground lease expense as this expense does not reflect the underlying performance of the related hotels.\nThe following table reconciles the Company's GAAP net income to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 (in thousands).\nTable 89: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net income\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 144,652\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 117,288\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 6,833\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Depreciation\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 148,163\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 127,449\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 113,112\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Amortization of favorable and unfavorable leases, net\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2,422\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1,056\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest and other expense, net\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 40,026\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 33,132\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 23,523\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income tax expense\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1,969\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> EBITDA\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 333,946\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 281,189\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 146,493\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Series B convertible preferred share expense\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 117,133\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Transaction and litigation costs\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 34,989\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 7,181\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 5,142\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (Gain) loss on sale of real estate\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (15,286\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loss on impairment of depreciable real estate assets\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 5,471\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 45,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 10,988\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Non-cash straight-line ground lease expense\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 3,419\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 3,347\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2,883\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Adjusted EBITDA\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 377,978\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 321,431\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 282,639\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nHotels Owned\nAs of December 31, 2016, the Company owned 235 hotels with an aggregate of 30,073 rooms located in 33 states, including one hotel with 224 rooms classified as held for sale.

Subject to certain conditions and fees, the maturity of the $540 million revolving credit facility may be extended one year and the total $965 million credit facility may be increased to $1.25 billion. The revolving credit facility, which as of December 31, 2016 had unused borrowing capacity of approximately $270.0 million, is available for share repurchases, acquisitions, hotel renovations and development, working capital and other general corporate funding purposes, including the payment of distributions to shareholders. As of December 31, 2016, the Company's $540 million revolving credit facility had an outstanding principal balance of approximately $270.0 million with an annual variable interest rate of approximately 2.32%.\nThe credit agreement governing the $965 million credit facility contains mandatory prepayment requirements, customary affirmative covenants, negative covenants and events of default. The credit agreement requires that the Company comply with various covenants, which include, among others, a minimum tangible net worth, maximum debt limits, minimum interest and fixed charge coverage ratios, limits on dividend payments and share repurchases and restrictions on certain investments. See Note 6 titled Debt\u201d in Part II, Item 8, of the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto, appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a summary of the financial and restrictive covenants as defined in the credit agreement and a description of the Company's other debt instruments. The Company was in compliance with the applicable covenants at December 31, 2016 and anticipates being in compliance during 2017.\nIn addition, the Company filed a universal shelf registration statement on Form S-3 (No. 333-210174) that was automatically effective upon filing on March 14, 2016. The Company may offer an indeterminate number or amount, as the case may be, of (1) common shares, no par value per share; (2) preferred shares, no par value per share; (3) depository shares representing its preferred shares; (4) warrants exercisable for the Company's common shares, preferred shares or depository shares representing preferred shares; (5) rights to purchase common shares; and (6) unsecured senior or subordinate debt securities, all of which may be issued from time to time on a delayed or continuous basis pursuant to Rule 415 under the Securities Act. As of December 31, 2016, the Company had not issued any securities under the universal shelf registration statement.\nCapital Uses\nThe Company anticipates that cash flow from operations, availability under its $540 million revolving credit facility and additional borrowings will be adequate to meet its anticipated liquidity requirements, including debt service, hotel acquisitions, hotel renovations, required distributions to shareholders (the Company is not required to make distributions at its current rate for REIT purposes) and share repurchases.\nDistributions\nTo maintain its REIT status the Company is required to distribute at least 90% of its ordinary income. Distributions paid during the year ended December 31, 2016 totaled approximately $229.1 million or\nIndex\n$1.20 per common share and were paid at a monthly rate of $0.10 per common share. For the same period, the Company's net cash generated from operations was approximately $332.0 million. Distributions paid during the year ended December 31, 2015 totaled $229.1 million or $1.27 per common share and net cash from operations was approximately $281.1 million. Distributions paid during the year ended December 31, 2014 totaled $233.4 million or $1.39 per common share and net cash from operations was approximately $252.2 million.\nThe Company's current annual distribution rate, payable monthly, is $1.20 per common share. As it has done historically, due to seasonality, the Company may use its $540 million revolving credit facility to maintain the consistency of the monthly distribution rate, taking into consideration any acquisitions, dispositions, capital improvements and economic cycles. Any distribution will be subject to approval of the Company's Board of Directors and there can be no assurance of the classification or duration of distributions at the current annual distribution rate. The Board of Directors monitors the Company's distribution rate relative to the performance of the hotels on an ongoing basis and may make adjustments to the distribution rate as determined to be prudent in relation to other cash requirements of the Company. If cash flow from operations and the $540 million revolving credit facility are not adequate to meet liquidity requirements, the Company may utilize additional financing sources to make distributions. Although the Company has relatively low levels of debt, there can be no assurances it will be successful with this strategy and may need to reduce its distributions to required levels. If the Company were unable to extend its maturing debt in future periods or if it were to default on its debt, it may be unable to make distributions.\nShare Repurchases\nDuring 2016, the Company's Board of Directors authorized an extension of its share repurchase program to repurchase up to $475 million of its common shares, which program will end in July 2017, if not terminated earlier. The program may be suspended or terminated at any time by the Company. As part of the implementation of the program, the Company has utilized written trading plans, with the plans providing for share repurchases in open market transactions. Since inception of the share repurchase program in July 2015 through December 31, 2016, the Company has purchased approximately 1.7 million of its common shares at a weighted-average market purchase price of approximately $17.64 per common share, for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $29.9 million, including the purchase of approximately 0.4 million of its common shares in 2016, at a weighted-average market purchase price of approximately $17.72 per common share for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $7.9 million and approximately 1.2 million of its common shares in 2015, at a weighted-average market purchase price of approximately $17.61 per common share for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $22.0 million. The timing of share repurchases and the number of common shares to be repurchased under the program will depend upon prevailing market conditions, regulatory requirements and other factors. Repurchases under the program have been funded, and the Company intends to fund future repurchases under the program, with availability under its revolving credit facility.\nIn connection with the Listing, the Company completed a modified Dutch Auction\u201d tender offer in June 2015 and purchased approximately 10.5 million of its common shares, which were retired, at a purchase price of $19.00 per common share, for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $200 million, excluding fees and expenses related to the tender offer. The Company funded the tender offer and all related costs primarily from borrowings under its $965 million credit facility.\nPrior to the Listing, during 2015, the Company redeemed approximately 0.8 million common shares at a price of $18.40 per common share, or a total of approximately $14.9 million, under its previous share redemption program that was terminated following the April 2015 redemption. No common shares were redeemed under the program during 2014.\nCapital Improvements\nThe Company has ongoing capital commitments to fund its capital improvements. To maintain and enhance each property's competitive position in its market, the Company has invested in and plans to continue to reinvest in its hotels. Under certain loan and management agreements, the Company is required to place in escrow funds for the repair, replacement and refurbishing of furniture, fixtures, and equipment, based on a percentage of gross revenues, provided that such amount may be used for the Company's capital expenditures with respect to the hotels. As of December 31, 2016, the Company held approximately $25.4 million in reserve related to these properties. During 2016, the Company invested approximately $63.4 million in capital expenditures and anticipates\nIndex\nspending approximately $65 to $75 million during 2017, which includes various scheduled renovation projects for approximately 30-35 properties. The Company does not currently have any existing or planned projects for development.\nHotel Contract Commitments\nAs of December 31, 2016, the Company had outstanding contracts for the potential purchase of four additional hotels for a total purchase price of $100.6 million. The newly constructed Fort Worth, Texas Courtyard hotel was acquired on February 2, 2017, the same day the hotel opened for business. The three remaining hotels are under construction and are planned to be completed and opened for business over the next nine to 18 months from December 31, 2016, at which time closing on these hotels is expected to occur. Although the Company is working towards acquiring these hotels, there are many conditions to closing that have not yet been satisfied and there can be no assurance that a closing on these hotels will occur under the outstanding purchase contracts. The Company intends to use borrowings under its revolving credit facility to purchase the hotels under contract if a closing occurs.\nCash Management Activities\nAs part of the cost sharing arrangements discussed in Note 8 titled Related Parties\u201d in Part II, Item 8, of the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto, appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, effective September 1, 2016, certain day-to-day transactions may result in amounts due to or from the Company and Apple Realty Group, Inc. ( ARG\u201d). Prior to the Apple Ten merger, Apple Ten, its advisors, Apple Ten Advisors, Inc., and ARG (for activities both related and unrelated to Apple Ten) were part of the cost sharing structure and participated in this cash management process. To efficiently manage cash disbursements, the Company or ARG may make payments for the other company. Under the cash management process, each company may advance or defer up to $1 million at any time. Each quarter, any outstanding amounts are settled between the companies. This process allows each company to minimize its cash on hand and reduces the cost for each company. The amounts outstanding at any point in time are not significant to either of the companies.\nManagement and Franchise Agreements\nEach of the Company's 235 hotels owned as of December 31, 2016 is operated and managed under separate management agreements with 22 hotel management companies, none of which are affiliated with the Company. See Note 11 titled Management and Franchise Agreements\u201d in Part II, Item 8, of the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto, appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a listing of the Company's hotel management companies. The management agreements generally provide for initial terms of one to 30 years. The Company has the option to terminate the management agreements if specified performance thresholds are not satisfied. Effective January 1, 2016, the Company modified its management fee structure for the majority of its hotels, which as of December 31, 2016, included approximately 77% of its hotels. Under the modified management fee structure, the hotel management fee for each hotel will generally be within a range of 2.5% to 3.5% of revenue based on each hotel's performance relative to other hotels owned by the Company. The performance measures are based on various financial and quality performance metrics. Under the modified management agreements, the fee structure replaces the base and incentive fee that was in place under the original fee structure prior to January 1, 2016, as described below. The change, which has not significantly impacted total management fees for the Company, better aligns incentives for each property. The remaining management agreements are under the original fee structure, which generally includes the payment of base management fees and incentive management fees. Base management fees are calculated as a percentage of gross revenues and the incentive management fees are calculated as a percentage of operating profit in excess of a priority return to the Company, as defined in the management agreements. In addition to the above, management fees for all of the Company's hotels generally include accounting fees and other fees for centralized services, which are allocated among all of the hotels that receive the benefit of such services. For the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, the Company incurred approximately $35.6 million, $31.1 million and $27.4 million in management fees, respectively.\nSeventeen of the Company's hotels are managed by affiliates of Marriott or Hilton. The remainder of the Company's hotels are managed by companies that are not affiliated with either Marriott or Hilton, and as a result, the hotels they manage were required to obtain separate franchise agreements with each respective franchisor. The franchise agreements generally provide for initial terms of approximately 10 to 30 years and generally provide for renewals subject to franchise requirements at the time of renewal. The Company pays various fees under these\nIndex\nagreements, including the payment of royalty fees, marketing fees, reservation fees, a communications support fee and other similar fees based on room revenues. For the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, the Company incurred approximately $44.2 million, $38.0 million and $33.5 million, respectively, in franchise royalty fees.\nImpact of Inflation\nOperators of hotels, in general, possess the ability to adjust room rates daily to reflect the effects of inflation. Competitive pressures may, however, limit the operators' ability to raise room rates. Currently the Company is not experiencing any material impact from inflation.\nBusiness Interruption\nBeing in the real estate industry, the Company is exposed to natural disasters on both a local and national scale. Although management believes it has adequate insurance to cover this exposure, there can be no assurance that such events will not have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial position or results of operations.\nSeasonality\nThe hotel industry historically has been seasonal in nature. Seasonal variations in occupancy at the Company's hotels may cause quarterly fluctuations in its revenues. Generally, occupancy rates and hotel revenues are greater in the second and third quarters than in the first and fourth quarters. To the extent that cash flow from operations is insufficient during any quarter, due to temporary or seasonal fluctuations in revenue, the Company expects to utilize cash on hand or available financing sources to meet cash requirements.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe following contains a discussion of what the Company believes to be its critical accounting policies. These items should be read to gain a further understanding of the principles used to prepare the Company's financial statements. These principles include application of judgment; therefore, changes in judgments may have a significant impact on the Company's reported results of operations and financial condition.\nInvestment Policy\nUpon acquisition of real estate properties, the Company estimates the fair value of acquired tangible assets (consisting of land, buildings and improvements, and furniture, fixtures and equipment) and identified intangible assets and liabilities, including in-place leases, and assumed debt based on evaluation of information and estimates available at that date. Fair values for these assets are not directly observable and estimates are based on comparables and other information which is subjective in nature. The Company has not assigned any value to management contracts and franchise agreements as such contracts are generally at current market rates based on the remaining terms of the contracts and any other value attributable to these contracts is not considered material. Prior to January 1, 2017, the Company expensed as incurred all transaction costs associated with the acquisitions of existing businesses, including title, legal, accounting, brokerage commissions and other related costs.\nCapitalization Policy\nThe Company considers expenditures to be capital in nature based on the following criteria: (1) for a single asset, the cost must be at least $500, including all normal and necessary costs to place the asset in service, and the useful life must be at least one year; (2) for group purchases of 10 or more identical assets, the unit cost for each asset must be at least $50, including all normal and necessary costs to place the asset in service, and the useful life must be at least one year; and (3) for major repairs to a single asset, the repair must be at least $2,500 and the useful life of the asset must be substantially extended.\nImpairment Losses Policy\nThe Company records impairment losses on hotel properties used in operations if indicators of impairment are present, and the sum of the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by the respective properties over their estimated remaining useful life, based on historical and industry data, is less than the properties' carrying\nIndex\namount. Indicators of impairment include a property with current or potential losses from operations, when it becomes more likely than not that a property will be sold before the end of its previously estimated useful life or when events, trends, contingencies or changes in circumstances indicate that a triggering event has occurred and an asset's carrying value may not be recoverable. The Company monitors its properties on an ongoing basis by analytically reviewing financial performance and considers each property individually for purposes of reviewing for indicators of impairment. As many indicators of impairment are subjective, such as general economic and market declines, the Company also prepares an annual recoverability analysis for each of its properties to assist with its evaluation of impairment indicators. The analysis compares each property's net book value to each property's estimated operating income using current operating results for each stabilized property and projected stabilized operating results based on the property's market for properties that recently opened, were recently renovated or experienced other short-term business disruption. The Company's planned initial hold period for each property is generally 39 years. If events or circumstances change, such as the Company's intended hold period for a property or if the operating performance of a property declines substantially for an extended period of time, the Company's carrying value for a particular property may not be recoverable, and an impairment loss will be recorded. Impairment losses are measured as the difference between the asset's fair value and its carrying value. The Company's ongoing analyses and annual recoverability analyses have not identified any impairment losses other than the losses on impairment of one property recorded in 2016, one property recorded in 2015 and three properties recorded in 2014 totaling approximately $5.5 million, $45.0 million and $11.0 million, respectively, as discussed herein under Results of Operations\u201d and in Note 4 titled Investment in Real Estate\u201d in Part II, Item 8, of the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto, appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nNew Accounting Standards\nSee Note 1 titled Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d in Part II, Item 8, of the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto, appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for information on the adoption of accounting standards in 2016 and the anticipated adoption of recently issued accounting standards.\nSubsequent Events\nIn both January 2017 and February 2017, the Company paid approximately $22.3 million, or $0.10 per outstanding common share, in distributions to its common shareholders.\nIn January 2017, the Company caused one of its indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries to enter into a purchase contract for the purchase of all of the ownership interests in a limited liability company which plans to construct a hotel in Orlando, Florida. The hotel is planned to be a Home2 Suites by Hilton which is expected to contain 128 guest rooms. The purchase price for the hotel is approximately $20.7 million. Although the Company is working towards acquiring this hotel, there are many conditions to closing that have not yet been satisfied, and there can be no assurance that a closing on this hotel will occur.\nOn February 2, 2017, the Company closed on the purchase of a newly constructed 124-room Courtyard by Marriott in Fort Worth, Texas, the same day the hotel opened for business. The gross purchase price was approximately $18.0 million.\nIn February 2017, the Company declared a regular monthly cash distribution of $0.10 per common share for the month of March 2017. The distribution is payable on March 15, 2017.\nTable 93: <table> <tr> <td>", "summary": "- The provided financial statement information includes the income statement, balance sheet, and statement of

"item_7_text": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with Item 8, the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto, the introduction of Part I regarding Forward-Looking Statements,\u201d and Item 1A, Risk Factors\u201d appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOverview\nThe Company is a Virginia corporation that has elected to be treated as a real estate investment trust ( REIT\u201d) for federal income tax purposes. The Company is self-advised and invests in income-producing real estate, primarily in the lodging sector, in the United States. As of December 31, 2016, the Company owned 235 hotels with an aggregate of 30,073 rooms located in 33 states, including one hotel with 224 rooms classified as held for sale. All of the Company's hotels operate under Marriott or Hilton brands. The hotels are operated and managed under separate management agreements with 22 hotel management companies, none of which are affiliated with the Company. The Company's common shares are listed on the New York Stock Exchange ( NYSE\u201d) under the ticker symbol APLE.\u201d\n2016 Investing Activities\nMerger with Apple REIT Ten, Inc.\nEffective September 1, 2016, the Company completed its previously announced merger with Apple REIT Ten, Inc. ( Apple Ten\u201d), which merger and related transaction proposals were approved by each company's respective shareholders, as applicable, on August 31, 2016. Pursuant to the definitive merger agreement dated April 13, 2016, as amended on July 13, 2016 (the Merger Agreement\u201d), Apple Ten merged with and into a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company (the merger\u201d or Apple Ten merger\u201d). As a result of the merger, the Company acquired the business of Apple Ten, a real estate investment trust, which immediately prior to the merger, owned 56 hotels located in 17 states with an aggregate of 7,209 rooms. Upon completion of the merger, each issued and outstanding unit of Apple Ten (consisting of a common share and related Series A preferred share) (each, an Apple Ten unit\u201d) was converted into the right to receive (i) 0.522 (the unit exchange ratio\u201d) common shares of the Company, with cash in lieu of fractional shares, and (ii) $1.00 in cash, and each issued and outstanding Series B convertible preferred share of Apple Ten received the same consideration described above on an as-converted basis, resulting in the issuance of a total of approximately 48.7 million common shares of the Company and a total payment of approximately $93.6 million in cash, including $0.2 million for fractional shares, to Apple Ten shareholders. The cash payment was funded through borrowings on the Company's revolving credit facility. Based on the closing price of the Company's common shares on August 31, 2016 (the date the merger was approved), the estimated aggregate value of the merger consideration paid to Apple Ten shareholders was approximately $1.0 billion. The Company's common shares totaling 174.7 million prior to the merger remained outstanding following the merger, resulting in approximately 223.4 million common shares outstanding upon completion of the merger. Also, as a result of the merger, the Company, through a wholly-owned subsidiary, assumed all of Apple Ten's assets and liabilities at closing.\nAs more fully described in Note 6 titled Debt\u201d in Part II, Item 8, of the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto, appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, effective September 1, 2016, upon completion of the merger, the Company assumed approximately $145.7 million in mortgage debt, prior to any fair value adjustments, secured by nine properties. The Company also assumed the outstanding balance on Apple Ten's credit facility totaling $111.1 million, which was terminated and repaid in full on September 1, 2016 with borrowings on the Company's revolving credit facility.\nAll costs related to the merger are being expensed in the period they are incurred and are included in transaction and litigation costs in the Company's consolidated statements of operations. In connection with the merger, the Company has incurred approximately $29.2 million in merger costs (including approximately $25.1 million of costs incurred to defend and settle the lawsuit related to the merger, which is net of approximately $10.0 million of reimbursements from the Company's directors and officers insurance carriers, which is discussed in Note 15 titled Legal Proceedings\u201d in Part II, Item 8, of the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto, appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K) for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nAs contemplated in the Merger Agreement, in connection with the completion of the merger, the advisory and related party arrangements with respect to Apple Ten and its advisors were terminated.\nIndex\nSee Note 2 titled Merger with Apple REIT Ten, Inc.\u201d in Part II, Item 8, of the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto, appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information concerning the merger with Apple Ten.\nOther Acquisitions and Dispositions\nThe Company continually monitors market conditions and attempts to maximize shareholder value by investing in properties that it believes provide superior value in the long term. Consistent with this strategy and the Company's focus on investing in select service hotels, in addition to completing the Apple Ten merger in the third quarter of 2016, the Company also acquired a newly constructed 128-room Home2 Suites hotel in Atlanta, Georgia on July 1, 2016, the same day the hotel opened for business, for a purchase price of approximately $24.6 million. The purchase price for this property was funded through borrowings on the Company's revolving credit facility. As of December 31, 2016, the Company had outstanding contracts for the potential purchase of four additional hotels for a total purchase price of $100.6 million. One of the four, the newly constructed Fort Worth, Texas Courtyard hotel, was acquired on February 2, 2017, the same day the hotel opened for business. The remaining three hotels are under construction and are planned to be completed and opened for business over the next nine to 18 months from December 31, 2016, at which time closing on these hotels is expected to occur.\nAdditionally, for its existing portfolio, the Company monitors each property's profitability, market conditions and capital requirements and attempts to maximize shareholder value by disposing of properties when it believes that superior value can be provided by the proceeds from the sale of the property. As a result, during the third quarter of 2016, the Company identified two properties for potential sale (its 224-room Hilton hotel in Dallas, Texas and its 226-room Marriott hotel in Chesapeake, Virginia), and in October 2016, the Company entered into separate contracts for the sale of these properties. Due to the change in the anticipated hold period for each of these hotels, the Company recognized an impairment loss of approximately $5.5 million during the third quarter of 2016 to adjust the basis of the Chesapeake, Virginia Marriott to its estimated fair value. In December 2016, the Company completed the sale of the Chesapeake, Virginia Marriott, resulting in a loss of approximately $0.2 million, which is included in the Company's consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2016. At December 31, 2016, the Dallas, Texas Hilton was under contract to be sold for approximately $56.1 million and was classified as held for sale in the Company's consolidated balance sheet. Under the contract, at closing, which is expected to be during the first half of 2017, the mortgage loan secured by the Dallas, Texas Hilton hotel with an outstanding balance of approximately $27.2 million as of December 31, 2016 will be assumed by the buyer with the buyer receiving a credit for the amount assumed. The sale of these properties does not represent a strategic shift that has, or will have, a major effect on the Company's operations and financial results, and therefore the operating results of these properties are included in income from continuing operations for the three years ended December 31, 2016. The proceeds from the sales were or will be used to pay down borrowings on the Company's $540 million revolving credit facility. See Note 4 titled Investment in Real Estate\u201d and Note 5 titled Assets Held for Sale and Dispositions\u201d in Part II, Item 8, of the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto, appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information concerning these dispositions.\nHotel Operations\nAlthough hotel performance can be influenced by many factors including local competition, local and general economic conditions in the United States and the performance of individual managers assigned to each hotel, performance of the Company's hotels as compared to other hotels within their respective local markets, in general, has met the Company's expectations for the period owned. Although improvement was moderate in the latter half of 2016, the hotel industry and the Company's hotels overall continue to experience improvement in both revenues and operating results as compared to the prior year. Economic conditions in the United States have been generally favorable, however there is no way to predict future economic conditions, and there are certain factors that could negatively affect the lodging industry and the Company, including but not limited to, increased hotel supply in certain markets, labor uncertainty both for the economy as a whole and the lodging industry in particular, global volatility and government fiscal policies. The Company, on a comparable basis (as defined below), and industry are forecasting a low single digit percentage increase in revenue for 2017 as compared to 2016. Based on recent revenue trends, the Company's revenue growth rate for comparable hotels in 2017 is anticipated to be similar to the growth achieved in the second half of 2016 (total revenue per available room ( RevPAR\u201d) growth for the Company was approximately 1.7% for comparable hotels in the second half of 2016 compared to the second half of 2015), primarily due to inconsistent demand in certain markets and increased hotel supply meeting demand growth in others, limiting the Company's ability to increase rates.\nIndex\nIn evaluating financial condition and operating performance, the most important indicators on which the Company focuses are revenue measurements, such as average occupancy, average daily rate ( ADR\u201d) and RevPAR, and expenses, such as hotel operating expenses, general and administrative expenses and other expenses described below.\nThe following is a summary of the results from operations of the Company's hotels for their respective periods of ownership by the Company.\n\nComparable Operating Results\nThe following table reflects certain operating statistics for the Company's 235 hotels owned as of December 31, 2016 ( Comparable Hotels\u201d). The Company defines metrics from Comparable Hotels as results generated by the 235 hotels owned as of the end of the reporting period. For the hotels acquired during the reporting periods shown, the Company has included, as applicable, results of those hotels for periods prior to the Company's ownership using information provided by the properties' prior owners at the time of acquisition and not adjusted by the Company. This information has not been audited, either for the periods owned or prior to ownership by the Company. For dispositions, results have been excluded for the Company's period of ownership.\n\nThe following table reflects certain operating statistics for the 179 hotels owned by the Company prior to the Apple Ten merger, excluding one hotel sold subsequent to the Apple Ten merger, prepared on the same basis as described above for Comparable Hotels.\n\nIndex\nThe following table reflects certain operating statistics for the 56 hotels acquired in the Apple Ten merger, prepared on the same basis as described above for Comparable Hotels.\n\nAs discussed above, hotel performance is impacted by many factors, including the economic conditions in the United States and each individual locality. Economic indicators in the United States have generally been favorable, which continues to positively impact the overall lodging industry. As a result, the Company's revenue and operating results for its Comparable Hotels improved in 2016 as compared to 2015 and 2014. The Company expects continued improvement in revenue and operating results for its Comparable Hotels in 2017 as compared to 2016, although at a slower rate than in recent years. The Company's hotels in general have shown results consistent with industry and brand averages for the period of ownership.\nResults of Operations for Years 2016 and 2015\nAs of December 31, 2016, the Company owned 235 hotels with 30,073 rooms as compared to 179 hotels with a total of 22,961 rooms as of December 31, 2015. Results of operations are included only for the period of ownership for hotels acquired or disposed of during 2016 and 2015. During 2016, the Company acquired 56 hotels in the Apple Ten merger effective September 1, 2016, acquired one additional newly constructed hotel on July 1, 2016 and sold one hotel on December 6, 2016. During 2015, the Company acquired one new and six existing hotels (between June 1, 2015 and October 31, 2015) and sold 19 hotels (18 of which were sold on February 26, 2015 and one of which was sold on June 1, 2015). As a result, the comparability of results for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 as discussed below is significantly impacted by these transactions.\nRevenues\nThe Company's principal source of revenue is hotel revenue consisting of room and other related revenue. For the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, the Company had total revenue of $1.0 billion and $898.3 million, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, Comparable Hotels achieved combined average occupancy of 77.0% and 76.9%, ADR of $133.47 and $130.05 and RevPAR of $102.81 and $100.07. ADR is calculated as room revenue divided by the number of rooms sold, and RevPAR is calculated as occupancy multiplied by ADR.\nDuring 2016, the Company experienced stable occupancy combined with an increase in ADR as compared to 2015, resulting in a modest increase in RevPAR. Overall, the Company's Comparable Hotels' RevPAR growth for 2016 was in line with industry averages. Although certain markets will vary based on local supply/demand dynamics and local market economic conditions, with continued overall room rate improvement combined with expected stable overall demand growth compared to supply growth, the Company, on a comparable basis, and industry are forecasting a low single digit percentage increase in revenue for 2017 as compared to 2016. During the fourth quarter of 2016, the Company's Comparable Hotels' RevPAR increased approximately 1.8% compared to the fourth quarter of 2015. Markets such as Houston, Miami and Chicago continue to show weakness due to specific market economic weakness and/or supply increases. With the Company's geographic diversity, these markets were offset by strength in other markets such as Los Angeles, Tampa and Phoenix.\nHotel Operating Expense\nHotel operating expense consists of direct room operating expense, hotel administrative expense, sales and marketing expense, utilities expense, repair and maintenance expense, franchise fees and management fees. For the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, hotel operating expense totaled $582.8 million and $507.1 million or 56.0% and 56.4% of total revenue for each respective period. Overall hotel operational expenses for\nIndex\n2016 include the results of the 56 hotels acquired in the Apple Ten merger for the last four months of the year, one hotel acquired on July 1, 2016 from the date of acquisition, the results of the seven hotels acquired between June 1, 2015 and October 31, 2015 for the full year, and the results of one hotel sold on December 6, 2016 until the date of sale. Expenses for 2015 include the results of the 19 hotels sold in 2015 until the respective dates of sale and the seven hotels acquired in 2015 from their respective dates of acquisition. For the Company's Comparable Hotels, hotel operating expense as a percentage of revenue decreased approximately 20 basis points for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily due to the overall increase in ADR for these hotels, favorable utility costs and the relatively fixed nature of certain operating costs such as management costs, certain utility costs and minimum supply and maintenance costs, which decline as a percentage of revenue as revenue increases, partially offset by increasing labor costs. The Company anticipates labor costs are likely to grow at increased rates due to government regulations surrounding wages, healthcare and other benefits and other government-related initiatives, such as the living wage\u201d increase, which could negatively impact operating expenses in certain markets moving forward. Additionally, labor costs have been and could be impacted in certain markets due to lower unemployment rates. With less qualified available labor, costs have increased. Although operating expenses will increase as revenue increases, the Company will continue to work with its management companies to reduce costs as a percentage of revenue where possible while maintaining quality and service levels at each property.\nProperty Taxes, Insurance and Other Expense\nProperty taxes, insurance and other expense for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 totaled $56.9 million and $46.0 million, respectively, or 5.5% and 5.1% of total revenue, respectively. The increase as a percent of revenue from 2015 is due primarily to the receipt in 2015 of approximately $1.8 million in settlement proceeds, net of costs, from the Deepwater Horizon Economic and Property Damages Settlement Program related to damages suffered at several of the Company's hotels as a result of the Gulf of Mexico oil spill in 2010. For the Company's Comparable Hotels, real estate taxes increased in 2016 compared to 2015, with tax increases at certain locations due to the reassessment of property values by localities related to the improved economy, partially offset by decreases at other locations due to successful appeals of tax assessments. With the economy continuing to improve, the Company anticipates continued increases in property tax assessments in 2017. The Company will continue to appeal tax assessments in certain jurisdictions to attempt to minimize tax increases as warranted.\nGround Lease Expense\nGround lease expense for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 was $10.4 million and $10.0 million, respectively. Ground lease expense primarily represents the expense incurred by the Company to lease land for 14 of its hotel properties, including four hotels acquired in the Apple Ten merger effective September 1, 2016.\nGeneral and Administrative Expense\nGeneral and administrative expense for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 was $17.0 million and $19.6 million, respectively, or 1.6% and 2.2% of total revenue, respectively. The principal components of general and administrative expense are payroll and related benefit costs, legal fees, accounting fees and reporting expenses. In addition, through August 31, 2016, the Company provided to Apple Ten the advisory services contemplated under its advisory agreement, and the Company received fees and reimbursement of expenses payable under the advisory agreement from Apple Ten, both of which were reductions to general and administrative expenses. Effective September 1, 2016, in connection with the completion of the Apple Ten merger, the advisory agreement was terminated and the Company no longer receives the fees and reimbursement of expenses payable under the advisory agreement from Apple Ten. Although expense for the Company in total dollars increased, since both the advisory fees and reimbursed costs received by the Company from Apple Ten were recorded as general and administrative expense by Apple Ten and as reductions to general and administrative expense by the Company, the termination of the advisory agreement had no financial impact on the combined company after the effective time of the merger.\nThe decrease in general and administrative expense for 2016 as compared to 2015 was due primarily to a decrease in compensation expense partially offset by increased costs due to the acquisition of Apple Ten. Based on the Company's performance in 2016 in relation to the operational performance and shareholder return metrics of the executive compensation incentive plan effective January 1, 2016 ( 2016 Incentive Plan\u201d), the amounts earned under the 2016 Incentive Plan were lower than the comparable compensation under the 2015 executive incentive plan ( 2015 Incentive Plan\u201d), resulting in a decrease in executive compensation expense for 2016 of approximately $5.6\nIndex\nmillion, as compared to 2015. However, the decrease in compensation expense was partially offset by the addition of a time-based vesting component to the 2015 Incentive Plan. As a result of listing the Company's common shares on the NYSE effective May 18, 2015 (the Listing\u201d), the Company added a time-based vesting component to its 2015 Incentive Plan in addition to the performance metrics, with compensation recognized over a two year period and, as a result, 2016 executive compensation expense includes recognition of share based compensation from both the 2015 and 2016 executive compensation incentive plans.\nTransaction and Litigation Costs\nTransaction and litigation costs for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 were $35.0 million and $7.2 million, respectively. Transaction and litigation costs for 2016 consist primarily of (i) costs related to the Apple Ten merger discussed herein totaling approximately $29.2 million (including approximately $25.1 million of costs incurred to defend and settle the lawsuit related to the Apple Ten merger, which is net of approximately $10.0 million of reimbursements from the Company's directors and officers insurance carriers, discussed herein), (ii) $5.5 million of costs incurred to settle the previously disclosed lawsuit related to Apple REIT Seven, Inc.'s ( Apple Seven\u201d) and Apple REIT Eight, Inc.'s ( Apple Eight\u201d) terminated Dividend Reinvestment Plans, discussed herein, and (iii) other acquisition related costs totaling approximately $0.4 million. Transaction and litigation costs for 2015 consist primarily of (i) costs related to the Board of Directors' review and evaluation of strategic alternatives, including the Listing, totaling approximately $5.8 million, (ii) costs related to the Company's merger with Apple Seven and Apple Eight on March 1, 2014 ( A7 and A8 mergers\u201d) totaling approximately $0.1 million, which consisted primarily of costs incurred to defend the A7 and A8 mergers class action lawsuit, dismissed in 2016, net of reimbursements received from the Company's directors and officers insurance carriers related to these costs and (iii) acquisition related costs totaling approximately $1.2 million.\nLoss on Impairment of Depreciable Real Estate Assets\nLoss on impairment of depreciable real estate assets was approximately $5.5 million and $45.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and consisted of impairment charges for (a) its Marriott hotel in Chesapeake, Virginia recorded during the third quarter of 2016, resulting from a change in the anticipated hold period for this asset, which was later sold in December 2016, and (b) its Renaissance hotel in New York, New York recorded in the fourth quarter of 2015, as a result of declines in the hotel's current and projected operations. See Note 4 titled Investment in Real Estate\u201d in Part II, Item 8, of the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto, appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information concerning these impairment losses.\nDepreciation Expense\nDepreciation expense for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 was $148.2 million and $127.4 million, respectively. Depreciation expense primarily represents expense of the Company's hotel buildings and related improvements, and associated personal property (furniture, fixtures, and equipment) for their respective periods owned. The increase was primarily due to the increase in the number of properties owned as a result of the Apple Ten merger effective September 1, 2016, the acquisition of one hotel on July 1, 2016 and seven hotels in 2015 and renovations completed throughout 2016 and 2015.\nInterest and Other Expense, net\nInterest and other expense, net for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 was $40.0 million and $33.1 million, respectively, and is net of approximately $1.6 million and $1.5 million of interest capitalized associated with renovation and construction projects, respectively. The increase in interest expense was primarily due to an increase in the Company's average outstanding borrowings during 2016 as compared to 2015 which is primarily attributable to (a) mortgage debt assumed in the Apple Ten merger effective September 1, 2016 and (b) borrowings to fund (i) the cash payment portion of the Apple Ten merger, (ii) the repayment of Apple Ten's outstanding balance on its extinguished credit facility assumed in the merger, (iii) the acquisition of eight hotels (seven between June 1, 2015 and October 31, 2015 and one on July 1, 2016) and (iv) the Company's tender offer and other share repurchases in 2016 and 2015. The impact of higher debt balances was partially offset by a reduction in the average interest rate incurred on the Company's total outstanding debt. Also, interest expense in 2015 includes a loss of approximately $0.4 million recorded to interest and other expense, net related to the change in fair value in the Company's interest\nIndex\nrate swap terminated in May 2015, from the time that it was no longer designated as a cash flow hedge during the first quarter of 2015 through the termination date.\nResults of Operations for Years 2015 and 2014\nAs of December 31, 2015, the Company owned 179 hotels with 22,961 rooms as compared to 191 hotels with a total of 23,790 rooms as of December 31, 2014. Results of operations are included only for the period of ownership for hotels acquired or disposed of during 2015 and 2014. During 2015, the Company acquired one new and six existing hotels (between June 1, 2015 and October 31, 2015) and sold 19 hotels (18 of which were sold on February 26, 2015 and one of which was sold on June 1, 2015). During 2014, the Company acquired 100 hotels, including 99 continuing hotels with the A7 and A8 mergers, effective March 1, 2014, and opened two newly constructed hotels during 2014. As a result, the comparability of results for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 as discussed below is significantly impacted by these transactions.\nRevenues\nFor the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, the Company had total revenue of $898.3 million and $803.9 million, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, Comparable Hotels achieved combined average occupancy of 76.9% and 75.6%, ADR of $130.05 and $123.95 and RevPAR of $100.07 and $93.72. During 2015, as the United States economy continued to strengthen, the Company experienced an increase in average occupancy of approximately 1.7% and an increase in ADR of approximately 4.9% for its Comparable Hotels as compared to 2014.\nHotel Operating Expense\nFor the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, hotel operating expense totaled $507.1 million and $455.9 million or 56.4% and 56.7% of total revenue for each respective period. Overall hotel operational expenses for 2015 primarily reflect the impact of the A7 and A8 mergers and the two newly constructed hotels that opened in December 2014 for the entire period, the 19 hotels sold until the respective dates of sale, and the seven hotels acquired in 2015 from their respective dates of acquisition; and for 2014 reflect the A7 and A8 mergers only for the months of March through December and the 19 hotels sold in 2015 (of which 13 were acquired in the A7 and A8 mergers) for the entire period. For the Company's Comparable Hotels, operating expense as a percentage of revenue decreased slightly for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 primarily due to the overall increase in ADR for these hotels and the Company's success in reducing, relative to revenue increases, certain labor costs, hotel supply costs, maintenance costs and utility costs. The improvements in hotel operating expenses as a percentage of revenue were negatively impacted by disruption from and costs related to the Company's transition of six management contracts to consolidate management within specific markets and to better access regional expertise during 2015.\nProperty Taxes, Insurance and Other Expense\nProperty taxes, insurance and other expense for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 totaled $46.0 million and $40.0 million, respectively, or 5.1% and 5.0% of total revenue, respectively. For the Company's Comparable Hotels, real estate taxes during 2015 increased due to the reassessment of property values by localities related to the improved economy, partially offset by a decrease due to successful appeals of tax assessments for other locations. Property taxes, insurance and other expense in 2015 and 2014 was reduced by approximately $1.8 million and $0.2 million, respectively, in settlement proceeds received, net of costs, from the Deepwater Horizon Economic and Property Damages Settlement Program.\nGround Lease Expense\nGround lease expense for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 was $10.0 million and $8.3 million, respectively. Ground lease expense primarily represents the expense incurred by the Company to lease land for 10 of its hotel properties as of December 31, 2015, nine of which were acquired effective March 1, 2014 with the A7 and A8 mergers.\nIndex\nGeneral and Administrative Expense\nGeneral and administrative expense for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 was $19.6 million and $20.9 million, respectively, or 2.2% and 2.6% of total revenue, respectively. Included in general and administrative expenses are advisory fees and reimbursable expenses incurred prior to the A7 and A8 mergers, and thereafter, payroll and related benefits. Effective March 1, 2014, upon completion of the A7 and A8 mergers, the Company became self-advised and the advisory agreements between the Company and its advisors were terminated. As a result, the employees, including management, became employed by the Company at that time, rather than the Company's former external advisor. In addition, from and after the A7 and A8 mergers until the Apple Ten merger, the Company provided to Apple Ten the advisory services contemplated under their advisory agreement, and the Company received fees and reimbursement of expenses payable under the advisory agreement from Apple Ten, both of which were reductions to general and administrative expenses. The reduction in general and administrative expense during 2015 as compared to 2014 was primarily due to an increase of approximately $1.3 million in advisory fees from Apple Ten, which reached the top fee tier under its advisory agreement due to improved results of operations of Apple Ten in 2015. The increase in advisory fee income for the year ended December 31, 2015 also included two additional months of advisory fees in 2015 as compared to 2014.\nTransaction and Litigation Costs\nTransaction and litigation costs for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 were $7.2 million and $5.1 million, respectively. These costs consist primarily of costs related to the Company's Listing effective May 18, 2015 and associated evaluation of strategic alternatives prior to the Listing, costs related to the A7 and A8 mergers, effective March 1, 2014, and acquisition related costs. Listing and evaluation of strategic alternative costs incurred by the Company totaled approximately $5.8 million and $1.2 million during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Merger costs totaled approximately $0.1 million and $3.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, which include costs incurred to defend the A7 and A8 mergers class action lawsuit, dismissed in 2016, net of reimbursements received from the Company's directors and officers insurance carriers related to these costs. In addition, the Company incurred approximately $1.2 million and $0.6 million of acquisition related costs and pre-opening expenses (related to the opening of two hotels in December 2014) during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nLoss on Impairment of Depreciable Real Estate Assets\nLoss on impairment of depreciable real estate assets was approximately $45.0 million and $11.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, and consisted of impairment charges (a) for its Renaissance hotel in New York, New York recorded in the fourth quarter of 2015 as a result of declines in the hotel's current and projected operations, and (b) resulting from a change in the anticipated hold period for three of 22 properties that were identified by the Company for potential sale, of which 19 of these properties were sold during 2015. See Note 4 titled Investment in Real Estate\u201d in Part II, Item 8, of the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto, appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information concerning these impairment losses.\nDepreciation Expense\nDepreciation expense for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 was $127.4 million and $113.1 million, respectively. The increase was due to the increase in the number of properties owned primarily as a result of the A7 and A8 mergers and hotel acquisitions, as well as renovations completed throughout 2015 and 2014. These increases were partially offset by the sale of 19 hotels in 2015, of which 18 of the hotels were classified as held for sale as of December 31, 2014 and therefore no depreciation was recorded for these properties during the year ended December 31, 2015.\nInterest and Other Expense, net\nInterest and other expense, net for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 was $33.1 million and $23.5 million, respectively and is net of approximately $1.5 million and $1.9 million of interest capitalized associated with renovation and construction projects. The increase in interest expense during 2015 as compared to 2014 was due primarily to (a) an increase in the Company's average outstanding borrowings during 2015 as compared to 2014,\nIndex\nwhich is attributable to debt assumed with the A7 and A8 mergers and increased borrowings to fund the Company's tender offer and share repurchase program, (b) in 2015, the Company recorded a loss totaling $0.4 million related to a terminated interest rate swap in May 2015 and (c) in 2014, the Company recognized a $0.7 million gain on a foreclosure transaction, which was recorded as a reduction to interest and other expense, net. The impact of higher debt balances was partially offset by a reduction in the average interest rate incurred under the Company's outstanding debt.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nThe Company considers the following non-GAAP financial measures useful to investors as key supplemental measures of its operating performance: Funds from Operations ( FFO\u201d), Modified FFO ( MFFO\u201d), Earnings before Interest, Income Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization ( EBITDA\u201d), and Adjusted EBITDA ( Adjusted EBITDA\u201d). These non-GAAP financial measures should be considered along with, but not as alternatives to, net income, cash flow from operations or any other operating GAAP measure. FFO, MFFO, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not necessarily indicative of funds available to fund the Company's cash needs, including its ability to make cash distributions. Although FFO, MFFO, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, as calculated by the Company, may not be comparable to FFO, MFFO, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as reported by other companies that do not define such terms exactly as the Company defines such terms, the Company believes these supplemental measures are useful to investors when comparing the Company's results between periods and with other REITs.\nFFO and MFFO\nThe Company calculates and presents FFO in accordance with standards established by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ( NAREIT\u201d), which defines FFO as net income (computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP\u201d)), excluding gains or losses from sales of real estate, extraordinary items as defined by GAAP, the cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles, plus real estate related depreciation, amortization and impairments, and adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. Historical cost accounting for real estate assets implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. Since real estate values instead have historically risen or fallen with market conditions, most real estate industry investors consider FFO to be helpful in evaluating a real estate company's operations. The Company further believes that by excluding the effects of these items, FFO is useful to investors in comparing its operating performance between periods and between REITs that report FFO using the NAREIT definition. FFO as presented by the Company is applicable only to its common shareholders, but does not represent an amount that accrues directly to common shareholders.\nThe Company further adjusts FFO for certain additional items that are not in NAREIT's definition of FFO, including: (i) the exclusion of the non-cash Series B convertible preferred share conversion expense and transaction and litigation costs as these do not represent ongoing operations and (ii) the exclusion of non-cash straight-line ground lease expense as this expense does not reflect the underlying performance of the related hotels. The Company presents MFFO when evaluating its performance because it believes that it provides further useful supplemental information to investors regarding its ongoing operating performance.\nThe following table reconciles the Company's GAAP net income to FFO and MFFO for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 (in thousands).\n\nIndex\nEBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA\nEBITDA is a commonly used measure of performance in many industries and is defined as net income excluding interest, income taxes and depreciation and amortization. The Company believes EBITDA is useful to investors because it helps the Company and its investors evaluate the ongoing operating performance of the Company by removing the impact of its capital structure (primarily interest expense) and its asset base (primarily depreciation and amortization). In addition, certain covenants included in the Company's indebtedness use EBITDA, as defined in the specific credit agreement, as a measure of financial compliance.\nThe Company considers the exclusion or inclusion of certain additional items from EBITDA useful, including (i) the exclusion of the non-cash Series B convertible preferred share conversion expense, transaction and litigation costs, gains or losses from sales of real estate and the loss on impairment of depreciable real estate assets as these do not represent ongoing operations, and (ii) the exclusion of non-cash straight-line ground lease expense as this expense does not reflect the underlying performance of the related hotels.\nThe following table reconciles the Company's GAAP net income to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 (in thousands).\n\nHotels Owned\nAs of December 31, 2016, the Company owned 235 hotels with an aggregate of 30,073 rooms located in 33 states, including one hotel with 224 rooms classified as held for sale. The following tables summarize the number of hotels and rooms by brand and by state:\n\nIndex\n\nRefer to Part I, Item 2, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a table summarizing the location, brand, manager, date acquired or completed and number of rooms for each of the 235 hotels the Company owned as of December 31, 2016.\nRelated Parties\nThe Company has, and is expected to continue to engage in, transactions with related parties. These transactions cannot be construed to be at arm's length and the results of the Company's operations may be different if these transactions were conducted with non-related parties. The Company's independent members of the Board of Directors oversee and annually review the Company's related party relationships and are required to approve any significant modifications to the existing relationships, as well as any new significant related party transactions. The Board of Directors is not required to approve", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with Item 8, the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto, the introduction of Part I regarding Forward-Looking Statements,\u201d and Item 1A, Risk Factors\u201d appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOverview\nThe Company is a Virginia corporation that has elected to be treated as a real estate investment trust ( REIT\u201d) for federal income tax purposes. The Company is self-advised and invests in income-producing real estate, primarily in the lodging sector, in the United States. As of December 31, 2016, the Company owned 235 hotels with an aggregate of 30,073 rooms located in 33 states, including one hotel with 224 rooms classified as held for sale. All of the Company's hotels operate under Marriott or Hilton brands. The hotels are operated and managed under separate management agreements with 22 hotel management companies, none of which are affiliated with the Company. The Company's common shares are listed on the New York Stock Exchange ( NYSE\u201d) under the ticker symbol APLE.\u201d\n2016 Investing Activities\nMerger with Apple REIT Ten, Inc.\nEffective September 1, 2016, the Company completed its previously announced merger with Apple REIT Ten, Inc. ( Apple Ten\u201d), which merger and related transaction proposals were approved by each company's respective shareholders, as applicable, on August 31, 2016. Pursuant to the definitive merger agreement dated April 13, 2016, as amended on July 13, 2016 (the Merger Agreement\u201d), Apple Ten merged with and into a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company (the merger\u201d or Apple Ten merger\u201d). As a result of the merger, the Company acquired the business of Apple Ten, a real estate investment trust, which immediately prior to the merger, owned 56 hotels located in 17 states with an aggregate of 7,209 rooms. Upon completion of the merger, each issued and outstanding unit of Apple Ten (consisting of a common share and related Series A preferred share) (each, an Apple Ten unit\u201d) was converted into the right to receive (i) 0.522 (the unit exchange ratio\u201d) common shares of the Company, with cash in lieu of fractional shares, and (ii) $1.00 in cash, and each issued and outstanding Series B convertible preferred share of Apple Ten received the same consideration described above on an as-converted basis, resulting in the issuance of a total of approximately 48.7 million common shares of the Company and a total payment of approximately $93.6 million in cash, including $0.2 million for fractional shares, to Apple Ten shareholders. The cash payment was funded through borrowings on the Company's revolving credit facility. Based on the closing price of the Company's common shares on August 31, 2016 (the date the merger was approved), the estimated aggregate value of the merger consideration paid to Apple Ten shareholders was approximately $1.0 billion. The Company's common shares totaling 174.7 million prior to the merger remained outstanding following the merger, resulting in approximately 223.4 million common shares outstanding upon completion of the merger. Also, as a result of the merger, the Company, through a wholly-owned subsidiary, assumed all of Apple Ten's assets and liabilities at closing.\nAs more fully described in Note 6 titled Debt\u201d in Part II, Item 8, of the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto, appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, effective September 1, 2016, upon completion of the merger, the Company assumed approximately $145.7 million in mortgage debt, prior to any fair value adjustments, secured by nine properties. The Company also assumed the outstanding balance on Apple Ten's credit facility totaling $111.1 million, which was terminated and repaid in full on September 1, 2016 with borrowings on the Company's revolving credit facility.\nAll costs related to the merger are being expensed in the period they are incurred and are included in transaction and litigation costs in the Company's consolidated statements of operations. In connection with the merger, the Company has incurred approximately $29.2 million in merger costs (including approximately $25.1 million of costs incurred to defend and settle the lawsuit related to the merger, which is net of approximately $10.0 million of reimbursements from the Company's directors and officers insurance carriers, which is discussed in Note 15 titled Legal Proceedings\u201d in Part II, Item 8, of the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto, appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K) for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nAs contemplated in the Merger Agreement, in connection with the completion of the merger, the advisory and related party arrangements with respect to Apple Ten and its advisors were terminated.\nIndex\nSee Note 2 titled Merger with Apple REIT Ten, Inc.\u201d in Part II, Item 8, of the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto, appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information concerning the merger with Apple Ten.\nOther Acquisitions and Dispositions\nThe Company continually monitors market conditions and attempts to maximize shareholder value by investing in properties that it believes provide superior value in the long term. Consistent with this strategy and the Company's focus on investing in select service hotels, in addition to completing the Apple Ten merger in the third quarter of 2016, the Company also acquired a newly constructed 128-room Home2 Suites hotel in Atlanta, Georgia on July 1, 2016, the same day the hotel opened for business, for a purchase price of approximately $24.6 million. The purchase price for this property was funded through borrowings on the Company's revolving credit facility. As of December 31, 2016, the Company had outstanding contracts for the potential purchase of four additional hotels for a total purchase price of $100.6 million. One of the four, the newly constructed Fort Worth, Texas Courtyard hotel, was acquired on February 2, 2017, the same day the hotel opened for business. The remaining three hotels are under construction and are planned to be completed and opened for business over the next nine to 18 months from December 31, 2016, at which time closing on these hotels is expected to occur.\nAdditionally, for its existing portfolio, the Company monitors each property's profitability, market conditions and capital requirements and attempts to maximize shareholder value by disposing of properties when it believes that superior value can be provided by the proceeds from the sale of the property. As a result, during the third quarter of 2016, the Company identified two properties for potential sale (its 224-room Hilton hotel in Dallas, Texas and its 226-room Marriott hotel in Chesapeake, Virginia), and in October 2016, the Company entered into separate contracts for the sale of these properties. Due to the change in the anticipated hold period for each of these hotels, the Company recognized an impairment loss of approximately $5.5 million during the third quarter of 2016 to adjust the basis of the Chesapeake, Virginia Marriott to its estimated fair value. In December 2016, the Company completed the sale of the Chesapeake, Virginia Marriott, resulting in a loss of approximately $0.2 million, which is included in the Company's consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2016. At December 31, 2016, the Dallas, Texas Hilton was under contract to be sold for approximately $56.1 million and was classified as held for sale in the Company's consolidated balance sheet. Under the contract, at closing, which is expected to be during the first half of 2017, the mortgage loan secured by the Dallas, Texas Hilton hotel with an outstanding balance of approximately $27.2 million as of December 31, 2016 will be assumed by the buyer with the buyer receiving a credit for the amount assumed. The sale of these properties does not represent a strategic shift that has, or will have, a major effect on the Company's operations and financial results, and therefore the operating results of these properties are included in income from continuing operations for the three years ended December 31, 2016. The proceeds from the sales were or will be used to pay down borrowings on the Company's $540 million revolving credit facility. See Note 4 titled Investment in Real Estate\u201d and Note 5 titled Assets Held for Sale and Dispositions\u201d in Part II, Item 8, of the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto, appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information concerning these dispositions.\nHotel Operations\nAlthough hotel performance can be influenced by many factors including local competition, local and general economic conditions in the United States and the performance of individual managers assigned to each hotel, performance of the Company's hotels as compared to other hotels within their respective local markets, in general, has met the Company's expectations for the period owned. Although improvement was moderate in the latter half of 2016, the hotel industry and the Company's hotels overall continue to experience improvement in both revenues and operating results as compared to the prior year. Economic conditions in the United States have been generally favorable, however there is no way to predict future economic conditions, and there are certain factors that could negatively affect the lodging industry and the Company, including but not limited to, increased hotel supply in certain markets, labor uncertainty both for the economy as a whole and the lodging industry in particular, global volatility and government fiscal policies. The Company, on a comparable basis (as defined below), and industry are forecasting a low single digit percentage increase in revenue for 2017 as compared to 2016. Based on recent revenue trends, the Company's revenue growth rate for comparable hotels in 2017 is anticipated to be similar to the growth achieved in the second half of 2016 (total revenue per available room ( RevPAR\u201d) growth for the Company was approximately 1.7% for comparable hotels in the second half of 2016 compared to the second half of 2015), primarily due to inconsistent demand in certain markets and increased hotel supply meeting demand growth in others, limiting the Company's ability to increase rates.\nIndex\nIn evaluating financial condition and operating performance, the most important indicators on which the Company focuses are revenue measurements, such as average occupancy, average daily rate ( ADR\u201d) and RevPAR, and expenses, such as hotel operating expenses, general and administrative expenses and other expenses described below.\nThe following is a summary of the results from operations of the Company's hotels for their respective periods of ownership by the Company.\nTable 84: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (in thousands, except statistical data)\n</td> <td> </td>

Economic indicators in the United States have generally been favorable, which continues to positively impact the overall lodging industry. As a result, the Company's revenue and operating results for its Comparable Hotels improved in 2016 as compared to 2015 and 2014. The Company expects continued improvement in revenue and operating results for its Comparable Hotels in 2017 as compared to 2016, although at a slower rate than in recent years. The Company's hotels in general have shown results consistent with industry and brand averages for the period of ownership.\nResults of Operations for Years 2016 and 2015\nAs of December 31, 2016, the Company owned 235 hotels with 30,073 rooms as compared to 179 hotels with a total of 22,961 rooms as of December 31, 2015. Results of operations are included only for the period of ownership for hotels acquired or disposed of during 2016 and 2015. During 2016, the Company acquired 56 hotels in the Apple Ten merger effective September 1, 2016, acquired one additional newly constructed hotel on July 1, 2016 and sold one hotel on December 6, 2016. During 2015, the Company acquired one new and six existing hotels (between June 1, 2015 and October 31, 2015) and sold 19 hotels (18 of which were sold on February 26, 2015 and one of which was sold on June 1, 2015). As a result, the comparability of results for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 as discussed below is significantly impacted by these transactions.\nRevenues\nThe Company's principal source of revenue is hotel revenue consisting of room and other related revenue. For the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, the Company had total revenue of $1.0 billion and $898.3 million, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, Comparable Hotels achieved combined average occupancy of 77.0% and 76.9%, ADR of $133.47 and $130.05 and RevPAR of $102.81 and $100.07. ADR is calculated as room revenue divided by the number of rooms sold, and RevPAR is calculated as occupancy multiplied by ADR.\nDuring 2016, the Company experienced stable occupancy combined with an increase in ADR as compared to 2015, resulting in a modest increase in RevPAR. Overall, the Company's Comparable Hotels' RevPAR growth for 2016 was in line with industry averages. Although certain markets will vary based on local supply/demand dynamics and local market economic conditions, with continued overall room rate improvement combined with expected stable overall demand growth compared to supply growth, the Company, on a comparable basis, and industry are forecasting a low single digit percentage increase in revenue for 2017 as compared to 2016. During the fourth quarter of 2016, the Company's Comparable Hotels' RevPAR increased approximately 1.8% compared to the fourth quarter of 2015. Markets such as Houston, Miami and Chicago continue to show weakness due to specific market economic weakness and/or supply increases. With the Company's geographic diversity, these markets were offset by strength in other markets such as Los Angeles, Tampa and Phoenix.\nHotel Operating Expense\nHotel operating expense consists of direct room operating expense, hotel administrative expense, sales and marketing expense, utilities expense, repair and maintenance expense, franchise fees and management fees. For the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, hotel operating expense totaled $582.8 million and $507.1 million or 56.0% and 56.4% of total revenue for each respective period. Overall hotel operational expenses for\nIndex\n2016 include the results of the 56 hotels acquired in the Apple Ten merger for the last four months of the year, one hotel acquired on July 1, 2016 from the date of acquisition, the results of the seven hotels acquired between June 1, 2015 and October 31, 2015 for the full year, and the results of one hotel sold on December 6, 2016 until the date of sale. Expenses for 2015 include the results of the 19 hotels sold in 2015 until the respective dates of sale and the seven hotels acquired in 2015 from their respective dates of acquisition. For the Company's Comparable Hotels, hotel operating expense as a percentage of revenue decreased approximately 20 basis points for the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily due to the overall increase in ADR for these hotels, favorable utility costs and the relatively fixed nature of certain operating costs such as management costs, certain utility costs and minimum supply and maintenance costs, which decline as a percentage of revenue as revenue increases, partially offset by increasing labor costs. The Company anticipates labor costs are likely to grow at increased rates due to government regulations surrounding wages, healthcare and other benefits and other government-related initiatives, such as the living wage\u201d increase, which could negatively impact operating expenses in certain markets moving forward. Additionally, labor costs have been and could be impacted in certain markets due to lower unemployment rates. With less qualified available labor, costs have increased. Although operating expenses will increase as revenue increases, the Company will continue to work with its management companies to reduce costs as a percentage of revenue where possible while maintaining quality and service levels at each property.\nProperty Taxes, Insurance and Other Expense\nProperty taxes, insurance and other expense for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 totaled $56.9 million and $46.0 million, respectively, or 5.5% and 5.1% of total revenue, respectively. The increase as a percent of revenue from 2015 is due primarily to the receipt in 2015 of approximately $1.8 million in settlement proceeds, net of costs, from the Deepwater Horizon Economic and Property Damages Settlement Program related to damages suffered at several of the Company's hotels as a result of the Gulf of Mexico oil spill in 2010. For the Company's Comparable Hotels, real estate taxes increased in 2016 compared to 2015, with tax increases at certain locations due to the reassessment of property values by localities related to the improved economy, partially offset by decreases at other locations due to successful appeals of tax assessments. With the economy continuing to improve, the Company anticipates continued increases in property tax assessments in 2017. The Company will continue to appeal tax assessments in certain jurisdictions to attempt to minimize tax increases as warranted.\nGround Lease Expense\nGround lease expense for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 was $10.4 million and $10.0 million, respectively. Ground lease expense primarily represents the expense incurred by the Company to lease land for 14 of its hotel properties, including four hotels acquired in the Apple Ten merger effective September 1, 2016.\nGeneral and Administrative Expense\nGeneral and administrative expense for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 was $17.0 million and $19.6 million, respectively, or 1.6% and 2.2% of total revenue, respectively. The principal components of general and administrative expense are payroll and related benefit costs, legal fees, accounting fees and reporting expenses. In addition, through August 31, 2016, the Company provided to Apple Ten the advisory services contemplated under its advisory agreement, and the Company received fees and reimbursement of expenses payable under the advisory agreement from Apple Ten, both of which were reductions to general and administrative expenses. Effective September 1, 2016, in connection with the completion of the Apple Ten merger, the advisory agreement was terminated and the Company no longer receives the fees and reimbursement of expenses payable under the advisory agreement from Apple Ten. Although expense for the Company in total dollars increased, since both the advisory fees and reimbursed costs received by the Company from Apple Ten were recorded as general and administrative expense by Apple Ten and as reductions to general and administrative expense by the Company, the termination of the advisory agreement had no financial impact on the combined company after the effective time of the merger.\nThe decrease in general and administrative expense for 2016 as compared to 2015 was due primarily to a decrease in compensation expense partially offset by increased costs due to the acquisition of Apple Ten. Based on the Company's performance in 2016 in relation to the operational performance and shareholder return metrics of the executive compensation incentive plan effective January 1, 2016 ( 2016 Incentive Plan\u201d), the amounts earned under the 2016 Incentive Plan were lower than the comparable compensation under the 2015 executive incentive plan ( 2015 Incentive Plan\u201d), resulting in a decrease in executive compensation expense for 2016 of approximately $5.6\nIndex\nmillion, as compared to 2015. However, the decrease in compensation expense was partially offset by the addition of a time-based vesting component to the 2015 Incentive Plan. As a result of listing the Company's common shares on the NYSE effective May 18, 2015 (the Listing\u201d), the Company added a time-based vesting component to its 2015 Incentive Plan in addition to the performance metrics, with compensation recognized over a two year period and, as a result, 2016 executive compensation expense includes recognition of share based compensation from both the 2015 and 2016 executive compensation incentive plans.\nTransaction and Litigation Costs\nTransaction and litigation costs for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 were $35.0 million and $7.2 million, respectively. Transaction and litigation costs for 2016 consist primarily of (i) costs related to the Apple Ten merger discussed herein totaling approximately $29.2 million (including approximately $25.1 million of costs incurred to defend and settle the lawsuit related to the Apple Ten merger, which is net of approximately $10.0 million of reimbursements from the Company's directors and officers insurance carriers, discussed herein), (ii) $5.5 million of costs incurred to settle the previously disclosed lawsuit related to Apple REIT Seven, Inc.'s ( Apple Seven\u201d) and Apple REIT Eight, Inc.'s ( Apple Eight\u201d) terminated Dividend Reinvestment Plans, discussed herein, and (iii) other acquisition related costs totaling approximately $0.4 million. Transaction and litigation costs for 2015 consist primarily of (i) costs related to the Board of Directors' review and evaluation of strategic alternatives, including the Listing, totaling approximately $5.8 million, (ii) costs related to the Company's merger with Apple Seven and Apple Eight on March 1, 2014 ( A7 and A8 mergers\u201d) totaling approximately $0.1 million, which consisted primarily of costs incurred to defend the A7 and A8 mergers class action lawsuit, dismissed in 2016, net of reimbursements received from the Company's directors and officers insurance carriers related to these costs and (iii) acquisition related costs totaling approximately $1.2 million.\nLoss on Impairment of Depreciable Real Estate Assets\nLoss on impairment of depreciable real estate assets was approximately $5.5 million and $45.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and consisted of impairment charges for (a) its Marriott hotel in Chesapeake, Virginia recorded during the third quarter of 2016, resulting from a change in the anticipated hold period for this asset, which was later sold in December 2016, and (b) its Renaissance hotel in New York, New York recorded in the fourth quarter of 2015, as a result of declines in the hotel's current and projected operations. See Note 4 titled Investment in Real Estate\u201d in Part II, Item 8, of the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto, appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information concerning these impairment losses.\nDepreciation Expense\nDepreciation expense for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 was $148.2 million and $127.4 million, respectively. Depreciation expense primarily represents expense of the Company's hotel buildings and related improvements, and associated personal property (furniture, fixtures, and equipment) for their respective periods owned. The increase was primarily due to the increase in the number of properties owned as a result of the Apple Ten merger effective September 1, 2016, the acquisition of one hotel on July 1, 2016 and seven hotels in 2015 and renovations completed throughout 2016 and 2015.\nInterest and Other Expense, net\nInterest and other expense, net for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 was $40.0 million and $33.1 million, respectively, and is net of approximately $1.6 million and $1.5 million of interest capitalized associated with renovation and construction projects, respectively. The increase in interest expense was primarily due to an increase in the Company's average outstanding borrowings during 2016 as compared to 2015 which is primarily attributable to (a) mortgage debt assumed in the Apple Ten merger effective September 1, 2016 and (b) borrowings to fund (i) the cash payment portion of the Apple Ten merger, (ii) the repayment of Apple Ten's outstanding balance on its extinguished credit facility assumed in the merger, (iii) the acquisition of eight hotels (seven between June 1, 2015 and October 31, 2015 and one on July 1, 2016) and (iv) the Company's tender offer and other share repurchases in 2016 and 2015. The impact of higher debt balances was partially offset by a reduction in the average interest rate incurred on the Company's total outstanding debt. Also, interest expense in 2015 includes a loss of approximately $0.4 million recorded to interest and other expense, net related to the change in fair value in the Company's interest\nIndex\nrate swap terminated in May 2015, from the time that it was no longer designated as a cash flow hedge during the first quarter of 2015 through the termination date.\nResults of Operations for Years 2015 and 2014\nAs of December 31, 2015, the Company owned 179 hotels with 22,961 rooms as compared to 191 hotels with a total of 23,790 rooms as of December 31, 2014. Results of operations are included only for the period of ownership for hotels acquired or disposed of during 2015 and 2014. During 2015, the Company acquired one new and six existing hotels (between June 1, 2015 and October 31, 2015) and sold 19 hotels (18 of which were sold on February 26, 2015 and one of which was sold on June 1, 2015). During 2014, the Company acquired 100 hotels, including 99 continuing hotels with the A7 and A8 mergers, effective March 1, 2014, and opened two newly constructed hotels during 2014. As a result, the comparability of results for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 as discussed below is significantly impacted by these transactions.\nRevenues\nFor the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, the Company had total revenue of $898.3 million and $803.9 million, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, Comparable Hotels achieved combined average occupancy of 76.9% and 75.6%, ADR of $130.05 and $123.95 and RevPAR of $100.07 and $93.72. During 2015, as the United States economy continued to strengthen, the Company experienced an increase in average occupancy of approximately 1.7% and an increase in ADR of approximately 4.9% for its Comparable Hotels as compared to 2014.\nHotel Operating Expense\nFor the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, hotel operating expense totaled $507.1 million and $455.9 million or 56.4% and 56.7% of total revenue for each respective period. Overall hotel operational expenses for 2015 primarily reflect the impact of the A7 and A8 mergers and the two newly constructed hotels that opened in December 2014 for the entire period, the 19 hotels sold until the respective dates of sale, and the seven hotels acquired in 2015 from their respective dates of acquisition; and for 2014 reflect the A7 and A8 mergers only for the months of March through December and the 19 hotels sold in 2015 (of which 13 were acquired in the A7 and A8 mergers) for the entire period. For the Company's Comparable Hotels, operating expense as a percentage of revenue decreased slightly for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 primarily due to the overall increase in ADR for these hotels and the Company's success in reducing, relative to revenue increases, certain labor costs, hotel supply costs, maintenance costs and utility costs. The improvements in hotel operating expenses as a percentage of revenue were negatively impacted by disruption from and costs related to the Company's transition of six management contracts to consolidate management within specific markets and to better access regional expertise during 2015.\nProperty Taxes, Insurance and Other Expense\nProperty taxes, insurance and other expense for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 totaled $46.0 million and $40.0 million, respectively, or 5.1% and 5.0% of total revenue, respectively. For the Company's Comparable Hotels, real estate taxes during 2015 increased due to the reassessment of property values by localities related to the improved economy, partially offset by a decrease due to successful appeals of tax assessments for other locations. Property taxes, insurance and other expense in 2015 and 2014 was reduced by approximately $1.8 million and $0.2 million, respectively, in settlement proceeds received, net of costs, from the Deepwater Horizon Economic and Property Damages Settlement Program.\nGround Lease Expense\nGround lease expense for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 was $10.0 million and $8.3 million, respectively. Ground lease expense primarily represents the expense incurred by the Company to lease land for 10 of its hotel properties as of December 31, 2015, nine of which were acquired effective March 1, 2014 with the A7 and A8 mergers.\nIndex\nGeneral and Administrative Expense\nGeneral and administrative expense for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 was $19.6 million and $20.9 million, respectively, or 2.2% and 2.6% of total revenue, respectively. Included in general and administrative expenses are advisory fees and reimbursable expenses incurred prior to the A7 and A8 mergers, and thereafter, payroll and related benefits. Effective March 1, 2014, upon completion of the A7 and A8 mergers, the Company became self-advised and the advisory agreements between the Company and its advisors were terminated. As a result, the employees, including management, became employed by the Company at that time, rather than the Company's former external advisor. In addition, from and after the A7 and A8 mergers until the Apple Ten merger, the Company provided to Apple Ten the advisory services contemplated under their advisory agreement, and the Company received fees and reimbursement of expenses payable under the advisory agreement from Apple Ten, both of which were reductions to general and administrative expenses. The reduction in general and administrative expense during 2015 as compared to 2014 was primarily due to an increase of approximately $1.3 million in advisory fees from Apple Ten, which reached the top fee tier under its advisory agreement due to improved results of operations of Apple Ten in 2015. The increase in advisory fee income for the year ended December 31, 2015 also included two additional months of advisory fees in 2015 as compared to 2014.\nTransaction and Litigation Costs\nTransaction and litigation costs for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 were $7.2 million and $5.1 million, respectively. These costs consist primarily of costs related to the Company's Listing effective May 18, 2015 and associated evaluation of strategic alternatives prior to the Listing, costs related to the A7 and A8 mergers, effective March 1, 2014, and acquisition related costs. Listing and evaluation of strategic alternative costs incurred by the Company totaled approximately $5.8 million and $1.2 million during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Merger costs totaled approximately $0.1 million and $3.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, which include costs incurred to defend the A7 and A8 mergers class action lawsuit, dismissed in 2016, net of reimbursements received from the Company's directors and officers insurance carriers related to these costs. In addition, the Company incurred approximately $1.2 million and $0.6 million of acquisition related costs and pre-opening expenses (related to the opening of two hotels in December 2014) during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nLoss on Impairment of Depreciable Real Estate Assets\nLoss on impairment of depreciable real estate assets was approximately $45.0 million and $11.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, and consisted of impairment charges (a) for its Renaissance hotel in New York, New York recorded in the fourth quarter of 2015 as a result of declines in the hotel's current and projected operations, and (b) resulting from a change in the anticipated hold period for three of 22 properties that were identified by the Company for potential sale, of which 19 of these properties were sold during 2015. See Note 4 titled Investment in Real Estate\u201d in Part II, Item 8, of the Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes thereto, appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information concerning these impairment losses.\nDepreciation Expense\nDepreciation expense for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 was $127.4 million and $113.1 million, respectively. The increase was due to the increase in the number of properties owned primarily as a result of the A7 and A8 mergers and hotel acquisitions, as well as renovations completed throughout 2015 and 2014. These increases were partially offset by the sale of 19 hotels in 2015, of which 18 of the hotels were classified as held for sale as of December 31, 2014 and therefore no depreciation was recorded for these properties during the year ended December 31, 2015.\nInterest and Other Expense, net\nInterest and other expense, net for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 was $33.1 million and $23.5 million, respectively and is net of approximately $1.5 million and $1.9 million of interest capitalized associated with renovation and construction projects. The increase in interest expense during 2015 as compared to 2014 was due primarily to (a) an increase in the Company's average outstanding borrowings during 2015 as compared to 2014,\nIndex\nwhich is attributable to debt assumed with the A7 and A8 mergers and increased borrowings to fund the Company's tender offer and share repurchase program, (b) in 2015, the Company recorded a loss totaling $0.4 million related to a terminated interest rate swap in May 2015 and (c) in 2014, the Company recognized a $0.7 million gain on a foreclosure transaction, which was recorded as a reduction to interest and other expense, net. The impact of higher debt balances was partially offset by a reduction in the average interest rate incurred under the Company's outstanding debt.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nThe Company considers the following non-GAAP financial measures useful to investors as key supplemental measures of its operating performance: Funds from Operations ( FFO\u201d), Modified FFO ( MFFO\u201d), Earnings before Interest, Income Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization ( EBITDA\u201d), and Adjusted EBITDA ( Adjusted EBITDA\u201d). These non-GAAP financial measures should be considered along with, but not as alternatives to, net income, cash flow from operations or any other operating GAAP measure. FFO, MFFO, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are not necessarily indicative of funds available to fund the Company's cash needs, including its ability to make cash distributions. Although FFO, MFFO, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, as calculated by the Company, may not be comparable to FFO, MFFO, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA as reported by other companies that do not define such terms exactly as the Company defines such terms, the Company believes these supplemental measures are useful to investors when comparing the Company's results between periods and with other REITs.\nFFO and MFFO\nThe Company calculates and presents FFO in accordance with standards established by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ( NAREIT\u201d), which defines FFO as net income (computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP\u201d)), excluding gains or losses from sales of real estate, extraordinary items as defined by GAAP, the cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles, plus real estate related depreciation, amortization and impairments, and adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. Historical cost accounting for real estate assets implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. Since real estate values instead have historically risen or fallen with market conditions, most real estate industry investors consider FFO to be helpful in evaluating a real estate company's operations. The Company further believes that by excluding the effects of these items, FFO is useful to investors in comparing its operating performance between periods and between REITs that report FFO using the NAREIT definition. FFO as presented by the Company is applicable only to its common shareholders, but does not represent an amount that accrues directly to common shareholders.\nThe Company further adjusts FFO for certain additional items that are not in NAREIT's definition of FFO, including: (i) the exclusion of the non-cash Series B convertible preferred share conversion expense and transaction and litigation costs as these do not represent ongoing operations and (ii) the exclusion of non-cash straight-line ground lease expense as this expense does not reflect the underlying performance of the related hotels. The Company presents MFFO when evaluating its performance because it believes that it provides further useful supplemental information to investors regarding its ongoing operating performance.\nThe following table reconciles the Company's GAAP net income to FFO and MFFO for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 (in thousands).\nTable 88: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net income\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 144,652\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 117,288\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 6,833\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Depreciation of real estate owned\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 147,244\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 126,530\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 112,346\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (Gain) loss on sale of real estate\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (15,286\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loss on impairment of depreciable real estate assets\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 5,471\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 45,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 10,988\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Amortization of favorable and unfavorable leases, net\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2,422\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1,056\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Funds from operations\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 298,194\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 275,954\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 131,223\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Series B convertible preferred share expense\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 117,133\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Transaction and litigation costs\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 34,989\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 7,181\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 5,142\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Non-cash straight-line ground lease expense\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 3,419\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 3,347\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2,883\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Modified funds from operations\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 336,602\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 286,482\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 256,381\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nIndex\nEBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA\nEBITDA is a commonly used measure of performance in many industries and is defined as net income excluding interest, income taxes and depreciation and amortization. The Company believes EBITDA is useful to investors because it helps the Company and its investors evaluate the ongoing operating performance of the Company by removing the impact of its capital structure (primarily interest expense) and its asset base (primarily depreciation and amortization). In addition, certain covenants included in the Company's indebtedness use EBITDA, as defined in the specific credit agreement, as a measure of financial compliance.\nThe Company considers the exclusion or inclusion of certain additional items from EBITDA useful, including (i) the exclusion of the non-cash Series B convertible preferred share conversion expense, transaction and litigation costs, gains or losses from sales of real estate and the loss on impairment of depreciable real estate assets as these do not represent ongoing operations, and (ii) the exclusion of non-cash straight-line ground lease expense as this expense does not reflect the underlying performance of the related hotels.\nThe following table reconciles the Company's GAAP net income to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 (in thousands).\nTable 89: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net income\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 144,652\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 117,288\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 6,833\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Depreciation\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 148,163\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 127,449\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 113,112\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Amortization of favorable and unfavorable leases, net\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2,422\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1,056\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest and other expense, net\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 40,026\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 33,132\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 23,523\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income tax expense\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1,969\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> EBITDA\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 333,946\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 281,189\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 146,493\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Series B convertible preferred share expense\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 117,133\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Transaction and litigation costs\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 34,989\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 7,181\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 5,142\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (Gain) loss on sale of real estate\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (15,286\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loss on impairment of depreciable real estate assets\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 5,471\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 45,000\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 10,988\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Non-cash straight-line ground lease expense\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 3,419\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 3,347\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2,883\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Adjusted EBITDA\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 377,978\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 321,431\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 282,639\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nHotels Owned\nAs of December 31, 2016, the Company owned 235 hotels with an aggregate of 30,073 rooms located in 33 states, including one hotel with 224 rooms classified as held for sale.
