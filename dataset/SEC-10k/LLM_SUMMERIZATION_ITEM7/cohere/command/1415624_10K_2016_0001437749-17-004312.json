In addition to historical financial information, the following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates, beliefs and expectations that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results and the timing of events could differ materially from those discussed in these forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those discussed below and elsewhere in this Form 10-K, particularly in Part I, Item 1A: Risk Factors.\u201d\nOverview\nYuMe is a leading independent provider of multi-screen programmatic video advertising technology, connecting brand advertisers, digital media property owners and consumers of video content across a growing range of internet-connected devices. YuMe offers advertising customers full service marketing solutions by combining programmatic buying tools and data-driven technologies with deep insight into audience behavior. In 2015 we announced the launch of YFA, which is our DSP, to find relevant audiences and deliver targeted advertising. YuMe technologies also provide monetization opportunities for global digital media property owners.\nOur digital video advertising solutions are purpose-built for brand advertisers, advertising agencies and digital media property owners. Through a sophisticated platform of proprietary embedded software, data science, machine-learning algorithms, and programmatic tools we deliver video advertising campaigns to relevant, brand-receptive digital audiences. We aggregate these audiences across a wide range of internet-connected devices, which include personal computers, smartphones, tablets, set-top boxes, game consoles and internet-connected TVs, by providing global digital media property owners with proprietary software that monetizes their professionally produced content and applications with our advertising campaigns. Our industry leadership is reflected in our wide audience reach, advanced programmatic capabilities, large customer base and scale in data derived from our large embedded software base.\nFor our advertising customers, we overcome the complexities of delivering digital video brand advertising campaigns in a highly fragmented environment where audiences use an increasing variety of internet-connected devices to access thousands of online and mobile websites and applications. Our solutions deliver brand-optimized video advertising campaigns seamlessly across internet-connected devices, and we deliver those solutions to customers through direct sales and through our programmatic buying platform (both managed and self-service). Our platform optimizes advertising campaign results that are relevant to brand advertisers, such as brand awareness, message recall, brand favorability, and purchase intent. We believe brand advertisers and brand-focused agencies can find particular benefit in our private marketplace programmatic offering through which brand advertisers are able to programmatically manage the audiences and digital media properties where their campaigns will run.\nFor global digital media property owners that supply advertising inventory, we offer technologies that enable us to make their inventory available to advertising customers and deliver digital video ads to the audiences that are optimized for specific advertising customer needs. In order to categorize these audiences our technology stack gathers first party data through our cross-device SDK and incorporates third party data from partners. We then apply our data science capabilities to aggregate audiences that will be relevant to brand advertisers. In combination, these capabilities allow us to deliver ads to audiences that we expect to be receptive to specific brand messages, which drives better monetization for digital media property owners.\nThe core of our business relies on our sophisticated platform that encompasses customized embedded software, programmatic advertising buying tools and data science capabilities. Our YuMe SDKs are embedded by our digital media property owners and collect data that we use for our advanced audience modeling algorithms, continuously improving our ability to optimize advertising campaigns around results that are relevant to brand advertisers. Our Placement Quality Index ( PQI\u201d) inventory scoring system uses YuMe SDKs and other data sources to assess through algorithms the quality of ad placements and optimize placements for maximum brand advertising results. Our Audience Amplifier machine-learning tool uses data gathered by YuMe SDKs in its correlative data models to find audiences that we expect to be receptive to specific brand messages.\nOver our twelve-year operating history we have amassed a vast amount of data derived from our large installed base of YuMe SDKs that are embedded in online and mobile websites and entertainment applications residing on millions of internet-connected devices. This allows us to deliver TV-like ads, enhanced and customized for each specific device type, and collect valuable advertisement viewership data. We collect billions of data points each year from ad impressions we deliver. As we grow our audience and advertiser footprint, we are able to collect even more data, which in turn enables us to improve the efficacy of our targeting models, further improving the utility of our solutions and driving increased adoption of our technology.\nWe generate revenue by delivering digital video ads on internet-connected devices. Our ads run when users choose to view video content on their devices. Advertising campaigns occur when customers submit orders to us directly through our programmatic software or in a managed service and we fulfill those orders by delivering their digital video ads to audiences available through digital media properties and third party ad exchanges, a process that we refer to as an advertising campaign. Advertising customers typically pay us on a CPM basis, of which we generally pay digital media property owners a negotiated percentage. In cases where our programmatic buying platform is used by our advertising customers to source inventory from a third party ad exchange, we may collect a transaction fee known as our take rate.\u201d Our customers primarily consist of large global brands and their advertising agencies. In 2016, we had 846 customers, including 76 of the top 100 U.S. advertisers as ranked by Advertising Age magazine in 2015 ( the AdAge 100\u201d), such as American Express, AT&T, GlaxoSmithKline, Home Depot and McDonald's.\nIn June 2015 we announced the launch of YFA which is our demand-side programmatic video buying technology platform providing advertisers with access to multi-screen video audiences at scale with a full suite of unique branding solutions. YFA is a comprehensive demand-side platform that connects brand advertising buyers to relevant digital media property audiences and inventory. YFA delivers an intuitive user interface, multi-screen breadth, brand performance-driving advertising products and integrated third party technologies to support video branding objectives. In addition to buying inventory in real-time, advertising customers using YFA can create private marketplaces to customize the digital media properties and owners relevant for their specific brands.\nYFA allows advertising customers to access our programmatic platform and use our sales or managed services team to assist in creating, optimizing and running campaigns. Our YFA programmatic platform can run campaigns across multiple internet-connected devices and through multiple digital media property owners and aggregators. When using YFA, advertising customers can access differentiated audiences from YuMe digital media properties and other audiences through third party supply-side platforms, or SSPs, and ad exchanges. This gives customers the flexibility to extend their objectives as needed.\nOn November 8, 2016, our board of directors approved a restructuring plan designed to reduce our operating expenses, realign our cost structure with revenue, better manage our costs and more efficiently manage our business. The restructuring plan was implemented in the fourth quarter of 2016 and completed in the first quarter of 2017. Restructuring expenses totaled $1.6 million and were recorded as restructuring expenses on our consolidated statements of operations in the fourth quarter of 2016. Elements of the restructuring plan included a workforce reduction of approximately 7%, which included employee severance pay and related expenses of $1.2 million, acceleration of our former chief executive officer's stock-based compensation expense of $0.3 million as a result of his termination without cause and facility exit expenses of $0.1 million. We do not expect to incur any additional expenses under the restructuring plan. As of December 31, 2016, we had $0.8 million of restructuring liabilities included in accrued liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet, which consisted primarily of employee severance pay and related expenses. We expect the restructuring liability to be fully paid in the first quarter of 2017.\nOn November 9, 2016, we announced the commencement of a comprehensive review of strategic alternatives and have engaged advisors related to such review. We have not made any determination to enter into any strategic transaction, and there is no assurance that our review of strategic alternatives will result in any transaction being entered into or consummated.\nResults of Operations\nThe following tables set forth our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014.

by the number of advertising impressions delivered on digital media properties. A substantial majority of our customer contracts take the form of ad insertion orders placed by advertising agencies on behalf of their brand advertiser clients, which are typically one to three months in duration. Occasionally, we enter into longer term contracts with customers.\nWe count direct advertising customers in accordance with the following principles: (i) we count each advertiser, not the advertising agencies through which its ad insertion orders may be placed, as the customer; and (ii) entities that are part of the same corporate structure are counted as a single customer. We also generate other revenue from digital media property owners, including platform fees, professional service fees and ad serving fees, and other revenue from intermediaries that have relationships with advertising agencies and advertisers. In calculating revenue per direct advertising customer, we exclude this other revenue.\nOur revenue tends to fluctuate based on seasonal factors that affect the advertising industry. For example, many advertisers devote the largest portion of their budgets to the fourth quarter of the calendar year, to coincide with increased holiday and year-end purchasing activities. Historically, the fourth quarter of the year reflects the highest advertising activity and the first quarter reflects the lowest level of such activity.\nTable 139: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Change\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Change\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $ </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2014 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>160,411 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(12,843 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(7.4 </td> <td> )%\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>173,254 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(4,525 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2.5 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>177,779 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor 2016, revenue decreased $12.8 million, or 7.4%, compared to 2015. The decrease in revenue was driven by a $13.1 million decrease in international revenue, partially offset by a $0.3 million increase in domestic revenue. The decrease in international revenue was primarily driven by a decline in sales through some of our European offices, which was associated largely with personnel turnover. Average revenue per advertising customer for 2016 was $186,100, an increase of 9.1%, compared to $171,000 for 2015. The increase was primarily the result of an increase in the spending of our top 20 advertising customers, which accounted for $69.3 million, or 43.2%, of our 2016 revenue, compared to $65.2 million, or 37.7%, of our 2015 revenue. We had 846 advertising customers in 2016, a decrease of 15.5%, compared to 1,001 customers in 2015. The decrease primarily reflects a decrease in international advertising customers.\nFor 2015, revenue decreased $4.5 million, or 2.5%, compared to 2014. The decrease in revenue was primarily driven by certain brand advertisers spending less on our platform due to the effects of prior operational issues and our currently immaterial participation in the programmatic channel. Additionally, the strengthening of the U.S. dollar during 2015 compared to the British pound and euro contributed to the decrease in revenue. The average revenue per advertising customer for 2015 was $171,000, a decrease of 13.6%, compared to $198,000 for 2014. The decrease in average revenue per advertising customer was primarily the result of the increase in the number of new advertising customers, particularly new customers, which tend to start out deploying smaller digital video advertising budgets through our solutions. We had 1,001 advertising customers in 2015, an increase of 13.8%, compared to 880 in 2014. Our top 20 advertising customers for 2015 accounted for $65.2 million, or 37.7%, of our revenue, compared to $63.3 million, or 35.6%, of our revenue for 2014.\nCost of Revenue and Gross Profit\nOur cost of revenue primarily consists of costs incurred with digital media property owners, typically under revenue-sharing arrangements. We refer to these costs as traffic acquisition costs. Generally, we incur traffic acquisition costs in the period the advertising impressions are delivered. In limited circumstances, we incur costs based on minimum guaranteed impressions. Cost of revenue also includes ad delivery costs such as labor and related costs, depreciation and amortization of acquired technologies, internally developed software and data center assets, and Internet access costs. These expenses are classified as cost of revenue for the period in which the revenue is recognized. As a percentage of revenue, we expect cost of revenues, including our traffic acquisition costs, to be in the 46% to 48% range in 2017.\nTable 140: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Change\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Change\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $ </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $ </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2014 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cost of revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>80,190 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(14,838 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(15.6 </td> <td> )%\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>95,028 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,932 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.1 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>93,096 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gross profit amount\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>80,221 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,995 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.6 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>78,226 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(6,457 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(7.6 </td> <td> )%\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>84,683 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gross profit percentage\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>50.0 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>45.2 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>47.6 </td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor 2016, cost of revenue decreased $14.8 million, or 15.6%, compared to 2015. The decrease was primarily attributable to a $14.6 million decrease in traffic acquisition costs, third party services and ad delivery costs. Additionally, other costs of revenues, including labor costs, decreased $0.2 million. Traffic acquisition costs decreased due to the decline in revenue, improvements in operational efficiency and better targeting of suitable digital media inventory. For 2016, gross profit, as a percentage of revenue, increased to 50.0% from 45.2% for 2015, primarily as a result of an increase in the number of ads run on SDK-enabled inventory resulting in lower traffic acquisition costs.\nFor 2015, cost of revenue increased $1.9 million, or 2.1%, compared to 2014. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase of $6.1 million in traffic acquisition costs, third party service and ad delivery costs, which was partially offset by a $4.2 million decrease in other costs of revenues. For 2015, gross profit, as a percentage of revenue, decreased to 45.2% from 47.6% for 2014, primarily as a result of product mix resulting in higher traffic acquisition costs.\nSales and Marketing\nWe sell to our customers primarily through our direct sales force personnel, who have established relationships with major advertising agencies and direct relationships with advertisers. Our sales and marketing expenses primarily consist of salaries, benefits, stock-based compensation, travel and entertainment expenses, and incentive compensation for our sales and marketing employees. Sales and marketing expenses also include promotional, advertising and public relations costs, as well as depreciation, facilities and other supporting overhead costs. We expect sales and marketing expenses to decline as a percentage of revenue in the near term.\nTable 141: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Change\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Change\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $ </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $ </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2014 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Sales and marketing\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>51,676 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(8,236 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(13.7 </td> <td> )%\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>59,912 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(5,200 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(8.0 </td> <td> )%\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>65,112 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Percentage of revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>32.2 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>34.6 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>36.6 </td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor 2016, sales and marketing expenses decreased $8.2 million, or 13.7%, compared to 2015. The decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease of $7.8 million in employee compensation, benefits and other employee-related expenses, including stock-based compensation, reflecting fewer employees in our sales and marketing organization. Additionally, other sales and marketing expenses including advertising, promotions, tradeshows, sponsorships, recruiting and temporary services, decreased $0.4 million primarily as a result of a decrease in discretionary advertising spending. For 2016, sales and marketing expenses, as a percentage of revenue, decreased to 32.2% from 34.6% for 2015.\nFor 2015, sales and marketing expenses decreased $5.2 million, or 8.0%, compared to 2014. The decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease of $4.8 million in employee compensation, benefits and other employee-related expenses, primarily as a result of a decrease in the number of employees within our sales and marketing organization. Additionally, other sales and marketing expenses including advertising, promotions, tradeshows, sponsorships and consulting services, decreased $0.4 million primarily as a result of a decrease in discretionary advertising spending. For 2015, sales and marketing expenses, as a percentage of revenue, decreased to 34.6% from 36.6% for 2014, primarily as a result of the decrease in the number of sales and marketing employees.\nResearch and Development\nWe engage in research and development efforts to create and enhance our existing, data-science capabilities and proprietary technologies. Our research and development expenses primarily consist of salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation for our engineers, product development and information technology personnel. Research and development expenses also include outside services and consulting, depreciation, facilities and other overhead costs. We capitalize a portion of our research and development costs attributable to internally developed software.\nAs of December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, we had 144, 148 and 91 research and development employees, respectively. As of December 31, 2016, 110 research and development employees were located in our Chennai and Pune, India offices. We expect our research and development expenses to increase as we continue to invest in the research and development of our products, and to increase as a percentage of revenue in the short term. We believe that our twelve-year operating history and our ability to attract and retain the large pool of engineering talent available in India will help us expand our engineering resources and capabilities cost-effectively.\nTable 142: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Change\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Change\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $ </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $ </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2014 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Research and development\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>10,968 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>31 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.3 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>10,937 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,029 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>85.1 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,908 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Percentage of revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6.8 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6.3 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.3 </td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor 2016, research and development expenses increased by $31,000, or 0.3%, compared to 2015. The increase was attributable to an increase of $0.3 million other departmental expenses, including equipment and software support and maintenance. Partially offsetting this increase was a decrease of $0.2 million in employee compensation, benefits and other employee-related expenses, including stock-based compensation, primarily as a result of a decrease in the number of employees in our research and development organization. For 2016, research and development expenses, as a percentage of revenue, increased to 6.8% from 6.3% for 2015, primarily as a result of an increase in other departmental expenses, including equipment and software support and maintenance.\nFor 2015, research and development expenses increased $5.0 million, or 85.1%, compared to 2014. The increase was attributable to an increase of $3.6 million in employee compensation, benefits and other employee-related expenses, including stock-based compensation, as a result of an increase in the number of employees within our research and development organization as it expanded both domestically and internationally. Additionally, other departmental expenses, including equipment support and maintenance and depreciation, including depreciation expense related to capitalized internally developed software, increased $1.4 million. For 2015, research and development expenses, as a percentage of revenue, increased to 6.3% from 3.3% for 2014, primarily as a result of the increase in research and development employee compensation, benefits and other employee-related expenses, including stock-based compensation.\nGeneral and Administrative\nOur general and administrative expenses primarily consist of salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation for our executive, finance, legal, human resources and other administrative employees. General and administrative expenses also include outside consulting, legal and accounting services, and facilities and other supporting overhead costs. We expect general and administrative expenses to remain at current levels in the near term.\nTable 143: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Change\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Change\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $ </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $ </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2014 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> General and administrative\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>22,513 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(1,071 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(4.5 </td> <td> )%\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>23,584 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,848 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8.5 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>21,736 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Percentage of revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14.0 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13.6 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12.2 </td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor 2016, general and administrative expenses decreased $1.1 million, or 4.5%, compared 2015. The decrease was primarily attributable to a $1.2 million decrease in employee compensation, benefits and other employee-related expenses, including stock-based compensation, as a result of a decrease in the number of employees within our general and administrative organization. Partially offsetting this decrease was an increase of $0.1 million in other general and administrative expenses, including rent and outside legal and consulting fees related to our proxy contest. For 2016, general and administrative expenses, as a percentage of revenue, increased to 14.0% from 13.6% for 2015, primarily as a result of the decrease in revenue in 2016.\nFor 2015, general and administrative expenses increased $1.8 million, or 8.5%, compared to 2014. The increase was primarily attributable to a $2.4 million increase in employee compensation, benefits and other employee-related expenses, including stock-based compensation, as a result of an increase in the number of employees within our general and administrative organization. Partially offsetting this increase was a decrease of $0.5 million in professional service fees and consulting services as we placed greater reliance on internal employee labor rather than external consultants. For 2015, general and administrative expenses, as a percentage of revenue, increased by 1.4% to 13.6% from 12.2% for 2014, primarily as a result of the increase in general and administrative employees and the associated increase in employee compensation, benefits and other employee-related expenses, including stock-based compensation.\nAsset Impairment\nFor internally developed software, we perform regular recoverability assessments in order to evaluate any impairment indicators or changes to useful lives. During the fourth quarter of 2016, we determined not to allocate any future resources to market, develop and maintain our YFP 5.0 supply-side platform for publishers since it was not generating sufficient revenue to cover its related costs. Our assessment determined YFP 5.0 to be fully impaired and we recorded a one-time non-cash asset impairment charge of $0.9 million related to YFP 5.0 in operating expenses.\nRestructuring\nOn November 8, 2016, our board of directors approved a restructuring plan designed to reduce our operating expenses, realign our cost structure with revenue, better manage our costs and more efficiently manage our business. The restructuring plan was implemented in the fourth quarter of 2016 and completed in the first quarter of 2017. Restructuring expenses totaled $1.6 million and were recorded as restructuring expenses on our consolidated statements of operations in the fourth quarter of 2016. Elements of the restructuring plan included a workforce reduction of approximately 7%, which included employee severance pay and related expenses, acceleration of our former chief executive officer's stock-based compensation expense as a result of his termination without cause and facility exit expenses. We do not expect to incur any additional expenses under the restructuring plan. As of December 31, 2016, we had $0.8 million of restructuring liabilities included in accrued liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet, which consisted primarily of employee severance pay and related expenses. We expect the restructuring liability to be fully paid in the first quarter of 2017.\nRestructuring expenses incurred in 2016 were as follows (in thousands):\nTable 144: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Workforce Reduction Expenses (1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Stock-Based Compensation Expense Acceleration (2)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Facility Exit Expenses (3)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Restructuring\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,172 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>288 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>117 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,577 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 145: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> (1)\n</td> <td> Workforce reduction expenses include employee severance and temporary health insurance costs under the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 ( COBRA\u201d).\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 146: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> (2)\n</td> <td> In accordance with the 2015 Executive Severance Plan, 25% of the chief executive officer's unvested equity holdings immediately accelerate to become vested if the chief executive officer is terminated for any reason other than cause.

The change was primarily due to $(1.3) million in foreign transaction exchange losses in 2016 compared to a $(0.5) million loss 2015 as a result of fluctuations in the U.S. dollar against the British pound sterling and euro. In addition, we realized a $0.7 million gain on our derivative instruments in 2016 compared to a $57,000 gain in 2015.\nFor 2015, interest and other expense, net decreased by $0.7 million, compared to 2014. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease of $0.5 million in foreign transaction exchange losses as a result of fluctuations in the U.S. dollar against the British pound sterling and euro. In addition, we realized a $0.1 million gain on our derivative instruments in 2015. Our investments in derivative instruments are intended to mitigate a portion of our foreign transaction exchange gains and losses reported as income or expense on our statements of operations. Additionally, amortization and accretion expense on our marketable securities increased $0.1 million.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nProvision for income taxes consists of federal and state income taxes in the U.S. and income taxes in certain foreign jurisdictions, deferred income taxes reflecting the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes, and the realization of net operating loss carryforwards.\nTable 149: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Change\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Change\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2014 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income tax (expense) benefit\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>20 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>320 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(300 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(524 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>224 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor 2016, income tax benefit was priamrily related to the full year net loss before income taxes of $7.7 million. Partially offsetting the federal and state tax benefit were taxes due in foreign jurisdictions. For 2015, income tax (expense) benefit was primarily related to state taxes and taxes due in foreign jurisdictions. For 2014, income tax benefit was primarily related to the full-year net loss before income taxes of $9.0 million. Partially offsetting the federal and state tax benefit were taxes due in foreign jurisdictions.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nTo provide investors with additional information regarding our financial results, we have presented within this Annual Report on Form 10-K adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure. We have provided below a reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA to net income (loss), the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure.\nAdjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure that we calculate as net income (loss), adjusted to exclude expenses for: interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, and one-time proxy contest, asset impairment and restructuring expenses. We believe that adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to investors in understanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as management and the board of directors. This non-GAAP information is not necessarily comparable to non-GAAP information of other companies. Non-GAAP information should not be viewed as a substitute for, or superior to, net income (loss) prepared in accordance with GAAP as a measure of our profitability or liquidity. Users of this financial information should consider the types of events and transactions for which adjustments have been made. The following is a reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA to net income (loss) for the periods indicated below:\nTable 150: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net loss\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(7,721 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(16,745 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(8,745 </td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Adjustments:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest expense\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income tax expense (benefit)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(20 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>300 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(224 </td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Depreciation and amortization expense\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,876 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,006 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,620 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Stock-based compensation expense\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,424 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,879 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,774 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Proxy contest expense\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>815 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Asset impairment\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>922 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Restructuring\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,577 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total Adjustments\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18,601 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15,193 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10,178 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Adjusted EBITDA\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>10,880 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(1,552 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,433 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe have presented adjusted EBITDA in this Annual Report on Form 10-K because it is a key measure used by our management and board of directors to understand and evaluate our core operating performance and trends, to prepare and approve our annual budget, and to develop short- and long-term operational plans. In particular, we believe that the exclusion of the expenses eliminated in calculating adjusted EBITDA can provide a useful measure for period-to-period comparisons of our core business. Additionally, adjusted EBITDA is a key financial measure considered by the compensation committee of our board of directors in connection with the determination of compensation for our executive officers. Accordingly, we believe that adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as our management and board of directors.\nAdjusted EBITDA has limitations as a financial measure, and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations are:\nTable 151: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized may have to be replaced in the future, and adjusted EBITDA does not reflect cash capital expenditure requirements for such replacements or for new capital expenditure requirements;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 152: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> adjusted EBITDA does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 153: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> adjusted EBITDA does not consider the potentially dilutive impact of equity-based compensation;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 154: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> adjusted EBITDA does not reflect tax payments that may represent a reduction in cash available to us; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 155: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate adjusted EBITDA differently, which reduces its usefulness as a comparative measure.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nBecause of these and other limitations, you should consider adjusted EBITDA along with other GAAP-based financial performance measures, including various cash flow metrics, net income or loss, and our other GAAP financial results.\nQuarterly Results of Operations\nThe following tables presenting our unaudited quarterly results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We have prepared the unaudited information on the same basis as our audited consolidated financial statements. Our operating results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of results for any future quarters or for a full year.\nThe following tables present unaudited quarterly results for 2016 and 2015. These tables include all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments, that we consider for the fair statement of our consolidated financial position and operating results for the quarters presented. Seasonality has caused, and is likely to continue to cause fluctuations in our quarterly results.\nSelected summarized quarterly financial information for 2016 and 2015 is as follows (in thousands, except per share amounts):\nTable 156: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Fourth Quarter\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Third Quarter\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Second Quarter\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> First Quarter\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>45,550 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>34,953 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>40,675 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>39,233 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gross profit\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>24,002 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>16,903 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>20,564 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>18,752 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net income (loss)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,827 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(4,464 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(2,486 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(3,598 </td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net income (loss) per share (a):\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Basic\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0.08 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(0.13 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(0.07 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(0.10 </td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Diluted\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0.08 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(0.13 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(0.07 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(0.10 </td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 157: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Fourth Quarter\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Third Quarter\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Second Quarter\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> First Quarter\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>53,836 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>38,870 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>40,403 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>40,145 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gross profit\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>24,980 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>17,400 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>16,987 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>18,859 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net income (loss)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,620 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(6,534 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(5,835 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(5,996 </td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net income (loss) per share (a):\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Basic\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0.05 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(0.19 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(0.17 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(0.18 </td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Diluted\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0.05 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(0.19 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(0.17 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(0.18 </td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 158: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> (a)\n</td> <td> Basic and diluted net income (loss) per share are computed independently for each of the quarters presented.

As of December 31, 2016, we had $65.7 million in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities. Cash equivalents and marketable securities as of December 31, 2016 are comprised of money market funds, corporate bonds, U.S. government and agency bonds and commercial paper. Cash held internationally as of December 31, 2016 totaled $4.2 million.\nOn February 18, 2016, we announced a $10 million share repurchase program. The repurchase program has no set expiration date and all purchases are subject to applicable rules and regulations, market conditions and other factors. Purchases under this repurchase program are made in the open market and are intended to comply with Rule 10b-18 under the Exchange Act. The cost of the repurchased shares is funded from available working capital. Such repurchased shares are held in treasury and are presented using the cost method. As of December 31, 2016, we had purchased 1,952,909 shares of our common stock for $7.1 million (including 27,202 shares repurchased for $0.1 million that had not yet settled as of December 31, 2016) at an average price of $3.64 per share.\nOur future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including our rate of revenue growth, the cost of maintaining and improving our technologies, our operating expenses related to the development and marketing of our solutions, and the cost of repurchasing our common stock. We believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balance will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements through at least the next 12 months. However, our liquidity assumptions may prove to be incorrect, and we could utilize our available financial resources sooner than we currently expect. In addition, we may elect to raise additional funds at any time through equity, equity-linked or debt financing arrangements. Our future capital requirements and the adequacy of available funds will depend on many factors, including those set forth under Part I, Item 1A: Risk Factors\u201d in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We may not be able to secure additional financing to meet our operating requirements on acceptable terms, or at all. If we raise additional funds by issuing equity or equity-linked securities, the ownership of our existing stockholders will be diluted. If we raise additional financing by the incurrence of indebtedness, we will be subject to increased fixed payment obligations and could also be subject to restrictive covenants, such as limitations on our ability to incur additional debt, and other operating restrictions that could adversely impact our ability to conduct our business. If we are unable to obtain needed additional funds, we will have to reduce our operating expenses, which would impair our growth prospects and could otherwise negatively impact our business.\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows for the periods presented:\nTable 159: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows Data: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>18,662 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(1,130 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>6,766 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,799 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(21,108 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(15,509 </td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(6,708 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,086 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,234 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating Activities\nOur primary source of cash from operating activities is receipts from the sale of our advertising solutions to our customers. Our primary uses of cash from operating activities are payments to publishers and other vendors for the purchase of digital media inventory and related costs, employee compensation and related expenses, sales and marketing expenses, general operating expenses, and the purchase of property and equipment.\nWe generated $18.7 million of cash from operating activities during 2016, primarily resulting from a net loss of $7.7 million, as adjusted for non-cash charges related to:\nTable 160: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Depreciation and amortization of $6.9 million;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 161: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Stock-based compensation of $8.7 million;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 162: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Bad debt expense of $0.8 million;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 163: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Amortization of premiums on marketable securities of $0.3 million;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 164: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Non-cash asset impairment charge of $0.9 million;

In addition, we have entered into indemnification agreements with directors and certain officers and employees that will require us, among other things, to indemnify them against certain liabilities that may arise by reason of their status or service as directors, officers or employees.\nContractual Obligations\nWe lease various office facilities, including our corporate headquarters in Redwood City, California, under non-cancellable operating lease agreements that expire through September 2027. The terms of the lease agreements provide for rental payments on a graduated basis. We recognize rent expense on a straight-line basis over the lease periods. Rent expense under operating leases totaled $3.5 million, $3.0 million and $2.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nWe also have capital lease obligations and enter into agreements with digital media property owners that require the purchase of a minimum number of impressions on a monthly or quarterly basis. Our capital lease obligations mature in July 2019 and our purchase commitments expire on various dates through December 2017.\nOur future minimum payments under these arrangements as of December 31, 2016 are as follows (in thousands):\nTable 200: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Payments Due by Period\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Less Than 1 Year\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1 - 3 Years\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 3 - 5 Years\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> More Than 5 Years\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating lease obligations\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>17,282 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,327 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>6,864 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,230 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,861 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Capital lease obligations\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>21 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Traffic acquisition costs and other purchase commitments\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>509 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>509 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total minimum payments\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>17,812 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,844 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>6,877 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,230 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,861 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe contractual commitment amounts in the table above are associated with agreements that are enforceable and legally binding. Obligations under contracts that we can cancel without a significant penalty are not included in the table above. We have determined our uncertain tax positions as of December 31, 2016 will not result in any additional taxes payable by us. As a result, no amounts are shown in the table above relating to uncertain tax positions.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nWe prepared our consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses and related disclosures. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Our estimates are based on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Our actual results could differ from these estimates.\nWe believe that the assumptions and estimates associated with revenue recognition, internal-use software development costs, business combinations, income taxes and stock-based compensation have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements. Therefore, we consider these to be our critical accounting policies and estimates. For further information on all of our significant accounting policies, see Note 2 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements.\nRevenue Recognition\nOur revenue is principally derived from advertising services measured by the number of advertising impressions displayed on digital media properties owned and controlled by third party digital media property owners and priced on a CPM basis. We recognize revenue when: (1) persuasive evidence exists of an arrangement with the customer reflecting the terms and conditions under which products or services will be provided; (2) delivery has occurred or services have been provided; (3) the fee is fixed or determinable; and (4) collection is reasonably assured. For all revenue transactions, we consider a signed agreement, a binding insertion order or other similar documentation to be persuasive evidence of an arrangement. Our arrangements generally do not include a provision for cancellation, termination, or refunds that would significantly impact revenue recognition. Arrangements for these services generally have a term of up to three months and in some cases the term may be up to one year.\nIn the normal course of business, we act as a facilitator in executing transactions with third parties. The determination of whether revenue should be reported on a gross or net basis is based on an assessment of whether we are acting as the principal or an agent in the transaction. In determining whether we act as the principal or an agent, we follow the accounting guidance for principal-agent considerations. While none of the factors identified in this guidance is individually considered presumptive or determinative, because we are the primary obligor and are responsible for (i) identifying and contracting with third party advertisers, (ii) establishing the selling prices of the advertisements sold, (iii) performing all billing and collection activities including retaining credit risk and (iv) bearing sole responsibility for fulfillment of the advertising, we act as the principal in these arrangements and therefore reports revenue earned and costs incurred on a gross basis.\nWe generally recognize revenue based on delivery information from a combination of third party reporting and our proprietary campaign tracking systems. Revenue is attributed to the U.S. and individual foreign countries based on the domicile of the salesperson that facilitated the revenue generating transaction.\nMultiple-element Arrangements\nWe enter into arrangements with customers to sell advertising packages that include different media placements or ad services that are delivered at the same time, or within close proximity of one another.\nAt the inception of an arrangement, we allocate arrangement consideration in multiple-deliverable revenue arrangements to all deliverables, based on the relative selling price method in accordance with the selling price hierarchy, which includes: (1) vendor-specific objective evidence ( VSOE\u201d), if available; (2) third party evidence ( TPE\u201d), if VSOE is not available; and (3) best estimate of selling price ( BESP\u201d) if neither VSOE nor TPE is available.\nVSOE-We evaluate VSOE based on our historical pricing and discounting practices for the specific product or service when sold separately. In determining VSOE, we require that a substantial majority of the standalone selling prices for these services fall within a reasonably narrow pricing range. We historically have not entered into a large volume of single element arrangements, so we have not been able to establish VSOE for any of our advertising products.\nTPE-When VSOE cannot be established for deliverables in multiple element arrangements, we apply judgment with respect to whether we can establish a selling price based on TPE. TPE is determined based on competitor prices for similar deliverables when sold separately. Generally, our go-to-market strategy differs from that of our peers and our offerings contain a significant level of differentiation such that the comparable pricing of services cannot be obtained. Furthermore, we are unable to reliably determine what similar competitor services' selling prices are on a standalone basis. As a result, we have not been able to establish selling price based on TPE.\nBESP-When we are unable to establish selling price using VSOE or TPE, we use BESP in our allocation of arrangement consideration. The objective of BESP is to determine the price at which we would transact a sale if the service were sold on a standalone basis. BESP is generally used to allocate the selling price to deliverables in our multiple element arrangements. We determine BESP for deliverables by considering multiple factors including, but not limited to, prices we charge for similar offerings, class of advertiser, size of transaction, seasonality, observed pricing trends, available online inventory, industry pricing strategies, market conditions and competitive landscape. We limit the amount of allocable arrangement consideration to amounts that are fixed or determinable and that are not contingent on future performance or future deliverables. We will regularly review BESP. Changes in assumptions or judgments or changes to the elements in the arrangement could cause a material increase or decrease in the amount of revenue that we report in a particular period.\nWe recognize revenue for media placements and ad services as they are delivered assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met. Deferred revenue is comprised of contractual billings in excess of recognized revenue and payments received in advance of revenue recognition\nInternal-Use Software Development Costs\nWe capitalize certain costs related to software developed for internal use. In accordance with authoritative guidance, we begin to capitalize our costs to develop software when preliminary development efforts are successfully completed, management has authorized and committed project funding, and it is probable that the project will be completed and the software will be used as intended. Such costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the related asset, generally estimated to be three years. Costs incurred prior to meeting these criteria together with costs incurred for training and maintenance are expensed as incurred and recorded in product development expenses on our consolidated statements of operations. Costs incurred for enhancements that are expected to result in additional features or functionality are capitalized and expensed over the estimated useful life of the enhancements, generally three years.\nFor internally developed software, we perform regular recoverability assessments in order to evaluate any impairment indicators or changes to useful lives. During the fourth quarter of 2016, we determined not to allocate any future resources to market, develop and maintain our YFP 5.0 supply-side platform for publishers since it was not generating sufficient revenue to cover its related costs. Our assessment determined YFP 5.0 to be fully impaired and we recorded a one-time non-cash asset impairment charge of $0.9 million related to YFP 5.0 in operating expenses.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill is not amortized, but is tested for impairment at least annually or as circumstances indicate the value may no longer be recoverable. We evaluate goodwill for impairment annually in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year as of December 31, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable. Triggering events that may indicate impairment include, but are not limited to, a decrease in market capitalization, increasing cost structure, a significant adverse change in customer demand or business climate that could affect the value of goodwill, a significant decrease in expected cash flows, restructuring activities undertaken to reduce increasing future operating expenses, the loss of key personnel, whether voluntarily or involuntarily, and/or a decline revenue forecasts. If we determine any of these qualitative triggering events exist, or that in aggregate they might indicate a goodwill impairment exists, we would then proceed to performing the two-step goodwill impairment test as needed to determine if an impairment exists. As of December 31, 2016, we performed the first step of the goodwill impairment test and determined that the fair value of our goodwill is greater than its carrying value and no impairment of goodwill exists.\nBusiness Combinations\nWhen we acquire a business, we determine the acquisition purchase price as the sum of the consideration we provide. When we issue stock-based awards to an acquired company's selling stockholders, we evaluate whether the awards are contingent consideration or compensation for post-business combination services. Our evaluation includes, among other things, whether the vesting of the stock-based awards is contingent on the continued employment of the selling stockholder beyond the acquisition date. If continued employment is required for vesting, the awards are treated as compensation for post-acquisition services and recognized as future compensation expense over the required service period.\nWe allocate the purchase price in a business combination to the identifiable assets and liabilities of the acquired business at their acquisition date fair values. The excess of the purchase price over the amount allocated to the identifiable assets and liabilities, if any, is recorded as goodwill. To date, the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in our business combinations have primarily consisted of acquired working capital and definite-lived intangible assets. The carrying value of acquired working capital is generally assumed to be equal to its fair value, given the short-term nature of these assets and liabilities.\nIncome Taxes\nWe account for income taxes in accordance with authoritative guidance, which requires the use of the asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined based upon the difference between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rate expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which the differences are expected to be reversed.\nDeferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. A valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized. We maintain a full valuation allowance to offset domestic net deferred tax assets due to the uncertainty of realizing future tax benefits from our net operating loss carry forwards and other deferred tax assets. Our valuation allowance as of December 31, 2016 was attributable to the uncertainty of realizing future tax benefits from U.S. net operating losses, foreign timing differences and other deferred tax assets.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had U.S. federal net operating loss carry forwards of approximately $27.2 million, expiring beginning in 2025. As of December 31, 2016, we had U.S. state net operating loss carry forwards of approximately $20.7 million, which will begin to expire in 2017. As of December 31, 2016 we had federal research and development tax credits of approximately $1.0 million, expiring beginning in 2025. As of December 31, 2016, we had state research and development tax credits of approximately $1.1 million, and other tax credits of $0.3 million, both of which carry forward indefinitely.\nWe operate in various tax jurisdictions and we are subject to audit by various tax authorities. We provide for tax contingencies whenever it is deemed probable that a tax asset has been impaired or a tax liability has been incurred for events such as tax claims or changes in tax laws. Tax contingencies are based upon their technical merits, relative tax law, and the specific facts and circumstances as of each reporting period. Changes in facts and circumstances could result in material changes to the amounts recorded for such tax contingencies.\nWe record uncertain tax positions in accordance with accounting standards on the basis of a two-step process whereby (1) a determination is made as to whether it is more likely than not that the tax positions will be sustained based on the technical merits of the position and (2) for those tax positions that meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold we recognize the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement with the related tax authority.\nStock-based Compensation\nWe account for stock-based compensation in accordance with the authoritative guidance on stock compensation. Under the fair value recognition provisions of this guidance, stock-based compensation is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense, net of estimated forfeitures, over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period of the respective award.\nDetermining the fair value of stock-based awards at the grant date requires judgment. We use the Black-Scholes option valuation model to determine the fair value of stock options. The determination of the grant date fair value of options using an option valuation model is affected by our common stock fair value as well as assumptions regarding a number of other complex and subjective variables. These variables include our expected stock price volatility over the expected term of the options, stock option exercise and cancellation behaviors, risk-free interest rates and expected dividends.\nRecently Issued and Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), which amends the existing accounting standards for revenue recognition. ASU 2014-09 is based on principles that govern the recognition of revenue at an amount an entity expects to be entitled when products are transferred to customers. In addition, the standard requires disclosure of the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. The FASB has recently issued several amendments to the standard, including identifying performance obligations. The new standard, as amended, is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016. We do not plan to early adopt, and thus the new standard will become effective for us on January 1, 2018. As part of this plan, we are currently assessing the impact of the new guidance on our results of operations. However, further analysis is required and we will continue to evaluate this assessment in 2017. We currently expect to apply the modified retrospective method of adoption; however, we have not yet finalized our transition method, but expects to do so in 2017 upon completion of further analysis.\nIn August 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-15, Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity's Ability to Continue as a Going Concern, which requires management to evaluate whether there are conditions and events that raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the financial statements are issued on both an interim and annual basis. Management is required to provide certain footnote disclosures if it concludes that substantial doubt exists or when its plans alleviate substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. ASU 2014-15 becomes effective for annual periods ending after December 15, 2016 and for interim reporting periods thereafter. We adopted this standard for our fiscal year ended December 31, 2016.\nIn April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-05, Customer's Accounting for Fees Paid in a Cloud Computing Arrangement, which clarifies when fees paid in a cloud computing arrangement pertain to the acquisition of a software license, services, or both. ASU 2015-05 provides criteria for customers in a cloud computing arrangement to use to determine whether the arrangement includes a license of software. The criteria are based on existing guidance for cloud service providers. However, the ASU does not change the accounting for cloud service providers. ASU 2015-05 is effective for annual and interim periods in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015. We adopted this standard prospectively as of January 1, 2016 and the impact to our consolidated financial statements was not material.\nIn January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01, Financial Instruments--Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities, which amends the guidance in U.S. GAAP on the classification and measurement of financial instruments. Changes to the current guidance primarily affects the accounting for equity investments, financial liabilities under the fair value option, and the presentation and disclosure requirements for financial instruments. In addition, the standard clarifies guidance related to the valuation allowance assessment when recognizing deferred tax assets resulting from unrealized losses on available-for-sale debt securities. The new standard is effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2017, and upon adoption, an entity should apply the amendments by means of a cumulative-effect adjustment to the balance sheet at the beginning of the first reporting period in which the guidance is effective. Early adoption is not permitted except for the provision to record fair value changes for financial liabilities under the fair value option resulting from instrument-specific credit risk in other comprehensive income. We are currently evaluating the impact of adopting this standard.\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02 Leases (Topic 842). This ASU requires entities that lease assets to recognize on the balance sheet the assets and liabilities for the rights and obligations created by those leases. The standard is effective for fiscal years and the interim periods within those fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018. The guidance is required to be applied by the modified retrospective transition approach. Early adoption is permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of adopting this standard.\nIn March 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-09, Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718). This ASU was issued as part of the FASB's simplification initiative and affects all entities that issue share-based payment awards to their employees. This standard covers accounting for income taxes, forfeitures, and statutory tax withholding requirements, as well as classification in the statement of cash flows and will be effective as of January 1, 2017, with early adoption permitted. We adopted the standard on January 1, 2017 and we are currently evaluating the impact of adopting this standard.\nIn January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-04, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (Topic 350). This ASU is an update to the standard on goodwill, which eliminates the need to calculate the implied fair value of goodwill when an impairment is indicated. The update states that goodwill impairment is measured as the excess of a reporting unit's carrying value over its fair value, not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill. The update is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after January 1, 2020. Early adoption is permitted for any impairment tests performed after January 1, 2017. Upon adoption, entities will be required to apply the update prospectively. We do not expect the adoption of this standard to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.\nTable 201: <table> <tr> <td>", "summary": "- The annual report contains the

YuMe offers advertising customers full service marketing solutions by combining programmatic buying tools and data-driven technologies with deep insight into audience behavior. In 2015 we announced the launch of YFA, which is our DSP, to find relevant audiences and deliver targeted advertising. YuMe technologies also provide monetization opportunities for global digital media property owners.\nOur digital video advertising solutions are purpose-built for brand advertisers, advertising agencies and digital media property owners. Through a sophisticated platform of proprietary embedded software, data science, machine-learning algorithms, and programmatic tools we deliver video advertising campaigns to relevant, brand-receptive digital audiences. We aggregate these audiences across a wide range of internet-connected devices, which include personal computers, smartphones, tablets, set-top boxes, game consoles and internet-connected TVs, by providing global digital media property owners with proprietary software that monetizes their professionally produced content and applications with our advertising campaigns. Our industry leadership is reflected in our wide audience reach, advanced programmatic capabilities, large customer base and scale in data derived from our large embedded software base.\nFor our advertising customers, we overcome the complexities of delivering digital video brand advertising campaigns in a highly fragmented environment where audiences use an increasing variety of internet-connected devices to access thousands of online and mobile websites and applications. Our solutions deliver brand-optimized video advertising campaigns seamlessly across internet-connected devices, and we deliver those solutions to customers through direct sales and through our programmatic buying platform (both managed and self-service). Our platform optimizes advertising campaign results that are relevant to brand advertisers, such as brand awareness, message recall, brand favorability, and purchase intent. We believe brand advertisers and brand-focused agencies can find particular benefit in our private marketplace programmatic offering through which brand advertisers are able to programmatically manage the audiences and digital media properties where their campaigns will run.\nFor global digital media property owners that supply advertising inventory, we offer technologies that enable us to make their inventory available to advertising customers and deliver digital video ads to the audiences that are optimized for specific advertising customer needs. In order to categorize these audiences our technology stack gathers first party data through our cross-device SDK and incorporates third party data from partners. We then apply our data science capabilities to aggregate audiences that will be relevant to brand advertisers. In combination, these capabilities allow us to deliver ads to audiences that we expect to be receptive to specific brand messages, which drives better monetization for digital media property owners.\nThe core of our business relies on our sophisticated platform that encompasses customized embedded software, programmatic advertising buying tools and data science capabilities. Our YuMe SDKs are embedded by our digital media property owners and collect data that we use for our advanced audience modeling algorithms, continuously improving our ability to optimize advertising campaigns around results that are relevant to brand advertisers. Our Placement Quality Index ( PQI\u201d) inventory scoring system uses YuMe SDKs and other data sources to assess through algorithms the quality of ad placements and optimize placements for maximum brand advertising results. Our Audience Amplifier machine-learning tool uses data gathered by YuMe SDKs in its correlative data models to find audiences that we expect to be receptive to specific brand messages.\nOver our twelve-year operating history we have amassed a vast amount of data derived from our large installed base of YuMe SDKs that are embedded in online and mobile websites and entertainment applications residing on millions of internet-connected devices. This allows us to deliver TV-like ads, enhanced and customized for each specific device type, and collect valuable advertisement viewership data. We collect billions of data points each year from ad impressions we deliver. As we grow our audience and advertiser footprint, we are able to collect even more data, which in turn enables us to improve the efficacy of our targeting models, further improving the utility of our solutions and driving increased adoption of our technology.\nWe generate revenue by delivering digital video ads on internet-connected devices. Our ads run when users choose to view video content on their devices. Advertising campaigns occur when customers submit orders to us directly through our programmatic software or in a managed service and we fulfill those orders by delivering their digital video ads to audiences available through digital media properties and third party ad exchanges, a process that we refer to as an advertising campaign. Advertising customers typically pay us on a CPM basis, of which we generally pay digital media property owners a negotiated percentage. In cases where our programmatic buying platform is used by our advertising customers to source inventory from a third party ad exchange, we may collect a transaction fee known as our take rate.\u201d Our customers primarily consist of large global brands and their advertising agencies. In 2016, we had 846 customers, including 76 of the top 100 U.S. advertisers as ranked by Advertising Age magazine in 2015 ( the AdAge 100\u201d), such as American Express, AT&T, GlaxoSmithKline, Home Depot and McDonald's.\nIn June 2015 we announced the launch of YFA which is our demand-side programmatic video buying technology platform providing advertisers with access to multi-screen video audiences at scale with a full suite of unique branding solutions. YFA is a comprehensive demand-side platform that connects brand advertising buyers to relevant digital media property audiences and inventory. YFA delivers an intuitive user interface, multi-screen breadth, brand performance-driving advertising products and integrated third party technologies to support video branding objectives. In addition to buying inventory in real-time, advertising customers using YFA can create private marketplaces to customize the digital media properties and owners relevant for their specific brands.\nYFA allows advertising customers to access our programmatic platform and use our sales or managed services team to assist in creating, optimizing and running campaigns. Our YFA programmatic platform can run campaigns across multiple internet-connected devices and through multiple digital media property owners and aggregators. When using YFA, advertising customers can access differentiated audiences from YuMe digital media properties and other audiences through third party supply-side platforms, or SSPs, and ad exchanges. This gives customers the flexibility to extend their objectives as needed.\nOn November 8, 2016, our board of directors approved a restructuring plan designed to reduce our operating expenses, realign our cost structure with revenue, better manage our costs and more efficiently manage our business. The restructuring plan was implemented in the fourth quarter of 2016 and completed in the first quarter of 2017. Restructuring expenses totaled $1.6 million and were recorded as restructuring expenses on our consolidated statements of operations in the fourth quarter of 2016. Elements of the restructuring plan included a workforce reduction of approximately 7%, which included employee severance pay and related expenses of $1.2 million, acceleration of our former chief executive officer's stock-based compensation expense of $0.3 million as a result of his termination without cause and facility exit expenses of $0.1 million. We do not expect to incur any additional expenses under the restructuring plan. As of December 31, 2016, we had $0.8 million of restructuring liabilities included in accrued liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet, which consisted primarily of employee severance pay and related expenses. We expect the restructuring liability to be fully paid in the first quarter of 2017.\nOn November 9, 2016, we announced the commencement of a comprehensive review of strategic alternatives and have engaged advisors related to such review. We have not made any determination to enter into any strategic transaction, and there is no assurance that our review of strategic alternatives will result in any transaction being entered into or consummated.\nResults of Operations\nThe following tables set forth our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014. The period-to-period comparison of financial results is not necessarily indicative of future results.\n\n\n (1) Stock-based compensation expense included in the consolidated statements of operations data above is as follows: \n (2) Excludes $537,000, $544,000 and $360,000 of stock-based compensation expense that was capitalized as part of internal-use software development costs for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. \n (3) Cost of revenue excludes restructuring expenses totaling $86,000 in 2016. \n (4) Sale and Marketing excludes restructuring expenses totaling $642,000 in 2016. \n (5) General and administrative excludes restructuring expenses totaling $849,000 in 2016. \nRevenue\nWe derive revenue principally from advertising solutions priced on a CPM basis, and measured by the number of advertising impressions delivered on digital media properties. A substantial majority of our customer contracts take the form of ad insertion orders placed by advertising agencies on behalf of their brand advertiser clients, which are typically one to three months in duration. Occasionally, we enter into longer term contracts with customers.\nWe count direct advertising customers in accordance with the following principles: (i) we count each advertiser, not the advertising agencies through which its ad insertion orders may be placed, as the customer; and (ii) entities that are part of the same corporate structure are counted as a single customer. We also generate other revenue from digital media property owners, including platform fees, professional service fees and ad serving fees, and other revenue from intermediaries that have relationships with advertising agencies and advertisers. In calculating revenue per direct advertising customer, we exclude this other revenue.\nOur revenue tends to fluctuate based on seasonal factors that affect the advertising industry. For example, many advertisers devote the largest portion of their budgets to the fourth quarter of the calendar year, to coincide with increased holiday and year-end purchasing activities. Historically, the fourth quarter of the year reflects the highest advertising activity and the first quarter reflects the lowest level of such activity.\n\nFor 2016, revenue decreased $12.8 million, or 7.4%, compared to 2015. The decrease in revenue was driven by a $13.1 million decrease in international revenue, partially offset by a $0.3 million increase in domestic revenue. The decrease in international revenue was primarily driven by a decline in sales through some of our European offices, which was associated largely with personnel turnover. Average revenue per advertising customer for 2016 was $186,100, an increase of 9.1%, compared to $171,000 for 2015. The increase was primarily the result of an increase in the spending of our top 20 advertising customers, which accounted for $69.3 million, or 43.2%, of our 2016 revenue, compared to $65.2 million, or 37.7%, of our 2015 revenue. We had 846 advertising customers in 2016, a decrease of 15.5%, compared to 1,001 customers in 2015. The decrease primarily reflects a decrease in international advertising customers.\nFor 2015, revenue decreased $4.5 million, or 2.5%, compared to 2014. The decrease in revenue was primarily driven by certain brand advertisers spending less on our platform due to the effects of prior operational issues and our currently immaterial participation in the programmatic channel. Additionally, the strengthening of the U.S. dollar during 2015 compared to the British pound and euro contributed to the decrease in revenue. The average revenue per advertising customer for 2015 was $171,000, a decrease of 13.6%, compared to $198,000 for 2014. The decrease in average revenue per advertising customer was primarily the result of the increase in the number of new advertising customers, particularly new customers, which tend to start out deploying smaller digital video advertising budgets through our solutions. We had 1,001 advertising customers in 2015, an increase of 13.8%, compared to 880 in 2014. Our top 20 advertising customers for 2015 accounted for $65.2 million, or 37.7%, of our revenue, compared to $63.3 million, or 35.6%, of our revenue for 2014.\nCost of Revenue and Gross Profit\nOur cost of revenue primarily consists of costs incurred with digital media property owners, typically under revenue-sharing arrangements. We refer to these costs as traffic acquisition costs. Generally, we incur traffic acquisition costs in the period the advertising impressions are delivered. In limited circumstances, we incur costs based on minimum guaranteed impressions. Cost of revenue also includes ad delivery costs such as labor and related costs, depreciation and amortization of acquired technologies, internally developed software and data center assets, and Internet access costs. These expenses are classified as cost of revenue for the period in which the revenue is recognized. As a percentage of revenue, we expect cost of revenues, including our traffic acquisition costs, to be in the 46% to 48% range in 2017.\n\nFor 2016, cost of revenue decreased $14.8 million, or 15.6%, compared to 2015. The decrease was primarily attributable to a $14.6 million decrease in traffic acquisition costs, third party services and ad delivery costs. Additionally, other costs of revenues, including labor costs, decreased $0.2 million. Traffic acquisition costs decreased due to the decline in revenue, improvements in operational efficiency and better targeting of suitable digital media inventory. For 2016, gross profit, as a percentage of revenue, increased to 50.0% from 45.2% for 2015, primarily as a result of an increase in the number of ads run on SDK-enabled inventory resulting in lower traffic acquisition costs.\nFor 2015, cost of revenue increased $1.9 million, or 2.1%, compared to 2014. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase of $6.1 million in traffic acquisition costs, third party service and ad delivery costs, which was partially offset by a $4.2 million decrease in other costs of revenues. For 2015, gross profit, as a percentage of revenue, decreased to 45.2% from 47.6% for 2014, primarily as a result of product mix resulting in higher traffic acquisition costs.\nSales and Marketing\nWe sell to our customers primarily through our direct sales force personnel, who have established relationships with major advertising agencies and direct relationships with advertisers. Our sales and marketing expenses primarily consist of salaries, benefits, stock-based compensation, travel and entertainment expenses, and incentive compensation for our sales and marketing employees. Sales and marketing expenses also include promotional, advertising and public relations costs, as well as depreciation, facilities and other supporting overhead costs. We expect sales and marketing expenses to decline as a percentage of revenue in the near term.\n\nFor 2016, sales and marketing expenses decreased $8.2 million, or 13.7%, compared to 2015. The decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease of $7.8 million in employee compensation, benefits and other employee-related expenses, including stock-based compensation, reflecting fewer employees in our sales and marketing organization. Additionally, other sales and marketing expenses including advertising, promotions, tradeshows, sponsorships, recruiting and temporary services, decreased $0.4 million primarily as a result of a decrease in discretionary advertising spending. For 2016, sales and marketing expenses, as a percentage of revenue, decreased to 32.2% from 34.6% for 2015.\nFor 2015, sales and marketing expenses decreased $5.2 million, or 8.0%, compared to 2014. The decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease of $4.8 million in employee compensation, benefits and other employee-related expenses, primarily as a result of a decrease in the number of employees within our sales and marketing organization. Additionally, other sales and marketing expenses including advertising, promotions, tradeshows, sponsorships and consulting services, decreased $0.4 million primarily as a result of a decrease in discretionary advertising spending. For 2015, sales and marketing expenses, as a percentage of revenue, decreased to 34.6% from 36.6% for 2014, primarily as a result of the decrease in the number of sales and marketing employees.\nResearch and Development\nWe engage in research and development efforts to create and enhance our existing, data-science capabilities and proprietary technologies. Our research and development expenses primarily consist of salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation for our engineers, product development and information technology personnel. Research and development expenses also include outside services and consulting, depreciation, facilities and other overhead costs. We capitalize a portion of our research and development costs attributable to internally developed software.\nAs of December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, we had 144, 148 and 91 research and development employees, respectively. As of December 31, 2016, 110 research and development employees were located in our Chennai and Pune, India offices. We expect our research and development expenses to increase as we continue to invest in the research and development of our products, and to increase as a percentage of revenue in the short term. We believe that our twelve-year operating history and our ability to attract and retain the large pool of engineering talent available in India will help us expand our engineering resources and capabilities cost-effectively.\n\nFor 2016, research and development expenses increased by $31,000, or 0.3%, compared to 2015. The increase was attributable to an increase of $0.3 million other departmental expenses, including equipment and software support and maintenance. Partially offsetting this increase was a decrease of $0.2 million in employee compensation, benefits and other employee-related expenses, including stock-based compensation, primarily as a result of a decrease in the number of employees in our research and development organization. For 2016, research and development expenses, as a percentage of revenue, increased to 6.8% from 6.3% for 2015, primarily as a result of an increase in other departmental expenses, including equipment and software support and maintenance.\nFor 2015, research and development expenses increased $5.0 million, or 85.1%, compared to 2014. The increase was attributable to an increase of $3.6 million in employee compensation, benefits and other employee-related expenses, including stock-based compensation, as a result of an increase in the number of employees within our research and development organization as it expanded both domestically and internationally. Additionally, other departmental expenses, including equipment support and maintenance and depreciation, including depreciation expense related to capitalized internally developed software, increased $1.4 million. For 2015, research and development expenses, as a percentage of revenue, increased to 6.3% from 3.3% for 2014, primarily as a result of the increase in research and development employee compensation, benefits and other employee-related expenses, including stock-based compensation.\nGeneral and Administrative\nOur general and administrative expenses primarily consist of salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation for our executive, finance, legal, human resources and other administrative employees. General and administrative expenses also include outside consulting, legal and accounting services, and facilities and other supporting overhead costs. We expect general and administrative expenses to remain at current levels in the near term.\n\nFor 2016, general and administrative expenses decreased $1.1 million, or 4.5%, compared 2015. The decrease was primarily attributable to a $1.2 million decrease in employee compensation, benefits and other employee-related expenses, including stock-based compensation, as a result of a decrease in the number of employees within our general and administrative organization. Partially offsetting this decrease was an increase of $0.1 million in other general and administrative expenses, including rent and outside legal and consulting fees related to our proxy contest. For 2016, general and administrative expenses, as a percentage of revenue, increased to 14.0% from 13.6% for 2015, primarily as a result of the decrease in revenue in 2016.\nFor 2015, general and administrative expenses increased $1.8 million, or 8.5%, compared to 2014. The increase was primarily attributable to a $2.4 million increase in employee compensation, benefits and other employee-related expenses, including stock-based compensation, as a result of an increase in the number of employees within our general and administrative organization. Partially offsetting this increase was a decrease of $0.5 million in professional service fees and consulting services as we placed greater reliance on internal employee labor rather than external consultants. For 2015, general and administrative expenses, as a percentage of revenue, increased by 1.4% to 13.6% from 12.2% for 2014, primarily as a result of the increase in general and administrative employees and the associated increase in employee compensation, benefits and other employee-related expenses, including stock-based compensation.\nAsset Impairment\nFor internally developed software, we perform regular recoverability assessments in order to evaluate any impairment indicators or changes to useful lives. During the fourth quarter of 2016, we determined not to allocate any future resources to market, develop and maintain our YFP 5.0 supply-side platform for publishers since it was not generating sufficient revenue to cover its related costs. Our assessment determined YFP 5.0 to be fully impaired and we recorded a one-time non-cash asset impairment charge of $0.9 million related to YFP 5.0 in operating expenses.\nRestructuring\nOn November 8, 2016, our board of directors approved a restructuring plan designed to reduce our operating expenses, realign our cost structure with revenue, better manage our costs and more efficiently manage our business. The restructuring plan was implemented in the fourth quarter of 2016 and completed in the first quarter of 2017. Restructuring expenses totaled $1.6 million and were recorded as restructuring expenses on our consolidated statements of operations in the fourth quarter of 2016. Elements of the restructuring plan included a workforce reduction of approximately 7%, which included employee severance pay and related expenses, acceleration of our former chief executive officer's stock-based compensation expense as a result of his termination without cause and facility exit expenses. We do not expect to incur any additional expenses under the restructuring plan. As of December 31, 2016, we had $0.8 million of restructuring liabilities included in accrued liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet, which consisted primarily of employee severance pay and related expenses. We expect the restructuring liability to be fully paid in the first quarter of 2017.\nRestructuring expenses incurred in 2016 were as follows (in thousands):\n\n (1) Workforce reduction expenses include employee severance and temporary health insurance costs under the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 ( COBRA\u201d). \n (2) In accordance with the 2015 Executive Severance Plan, 25% of the chief executive officer's unvested equity holdings immediately accelerate to become vested if the chief executive officer is terminated for any reason other than cause. Stock-based compensation expense is a non-cash expense. \n (3) We exited a facility located in Redwood City, California on November 11, 2016. Facility exit expenses include rental payments we are required to make on the vacant office space and broker fees we will pay to find a new tenant to sublease the vacated office space. \nInterest and Other Expense, Net\nInterest and other expense, net consists primarily of interest income earned on our cash equivalents and marketable securities, interest expense on our capital lease obligations, accretion and amortization on marketable securities, gains and losses on our derivative instruments and foreign exchange gains and losses.\n\nFor 2016, interest and other expense, net was $(0.3) million compared to $(0.2) million for 2015. The change was primarily due to $(1.3) million in foreign transaction exchange losses in 2016 compared to a $(0.5) million loss 2015 as a result of fluctuations in the U.S. dollar against the British pound sterling and euro. In addition, we realized a $0.7 million gain on our derivative instruments in 2016 compared to a $57,000 gain in 2015.\nFor 2015, interest and other expense, net decreased by $0.7 million, compared to 2014. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease of $0.5 million in foreign transaction exchange losses as a result of fluctuations in the U.S. dollar against the British pound sterling and euro. In addition, we realized a $0.1 million gain on our derivative instruments in 2015. Our investments in derivative instruments are intended to mitigate a portion of our foreign transaction exchange gains and losses reported as income or expense on our statements of operations. Additionally, amortization and accretion expense on our marketable securities increased $0.1 million.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nProvision for income taxes consists of federal and state income taxes in the U.S. and income taxes in certain foreign jurisdictions, deferred income taxes reflecting the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes, and the realization of net operating loss carryforwards.\n\nFor 2016, income tax benefit was priamrily related to the full year net loss before income taxes of $7.7 million. Partially offsetting the federal and state tax benefit were taxes due in foreign jurisdictions. For 2015, income tax (expense) benefit was primarily related to state taxes and taxes due in foreign jurisdictions. For 2014, income tax benefit was primarily related to the full-year net loss before income taxes of $9.0 million. Partially offsetting the federal and state tax benefit were taxes due in foreign jurisdictions.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nTo provide investors with additional information regarding our financial results, we have presented within this Annual Report on Form 10-K adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure. We have provided below a reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA to net income (loss), the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure.\nAdjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure that we calculate as net income (loss), adjusted to exclude expenses for: interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, and one-time proxy contest, asset impairment and restructuring expenses. We believe that adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to investors in understanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as management and the board of directors. This non-GAAP information is not necessarily comparable to non-GAAP information of other companies. Non-GAAP information should not be viewed as a substitute for, or superior to, net income (loss) prepared in accordance with GAAP as a measure of our profitability or liquidity. Users of this financial information should consider the types of events and transactions for which adjustments have been made. The following is a reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA to net income (loss) for the periods indicated below:\n\nWe have presented adjusted EBITDA in this Annual Report on Form 10-K because it is a key measure used by our management and board of directors to understand and evaluate our core operating performance and trends, to prepare and approve our annual budget, and to develop short- and long-term operational plans. In particular, we believe that the exclusion of the expenses eliminated in calculating adjusted EBITDA can provide a useful measure for period-to-period comparisons of our core business. Additionally, adjusted EBITDA is a key financial measure considered by the compensation committee of our board of directors in connection with the determination of compensation for our executive officers. Accordingly, we believe that adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as our management and board of directors.\nAdjusted EBITDA has limitations as a financial measure, and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations are:\n \u2022 although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized may have to be replaced in the future, and adjusted EBITDA does not reflect cash capital expenditure requirements for such replacements or for new capital expenditure requirements; \n \u2022 adjusted EBITDA does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; \n \u2022 adjusted EBITDA does not consider the potentially dilutive impact of equity-based compensation; \n \u2022 adjusted EBITDA does not reflect tax payments that may represent a reduction in cash available to us; and \n \u2022 other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate adjusted EBITDA differently, which reduces its usefulness as a comparative measure. \nBecause of these and other limitations, you should consider adjusted EBITDA along with other GAAP-based financial performance measures, including various cash flow metrics, net income or loss, and our other GAAP financial results.\nQuarterly Results of Operations\nThe following tables presenting our unaudited quarterly results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We have prepared the unaudited information on the same basis as our audited consolidated financial statements. Our operating results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of results for any future quarters or for a full year.\nThe following tables present unaudited quarterly results for 2016 and 2015. These tables include all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments, that we consider for the fair statement of our consolidated financial position and operating results for the quarters presented. Seasonality has caused, and is likely to continue to cause fluctuations in our quarterly results.\nSelected summarized quarterly financial information for 2016 and 2015 is as follows (in thousands, except per share amounts):\n\n\n (a) Basic and diluted net income (loss) per share are computed independently for each of the quarters presented. Therefore, the sum of quarterly basic and diluted per share information may not equal annual basic and diluted earnings per share. \nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur principal sources of liquidity are our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities. As of December 31, 2016, we had $65.7 million in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities. Cash equivalents and marketable securities as of December 31, 2016 are comprised of money market funds, corporate bonds, U.S. government and agency bonds and commercial paper. Cash held internationally as of December 31, 2016 totaled $4.2 million.\nOn February 18, 2016, we announced a $10 million share repurchase program. The repurchase program has no set expiration date and all purchases are subject to applicable rules and regulations, market conditions and other factors. Purchases under this repurchase program are made in the open market and are intended to comply with Rule 10b-18 under the Exchange Act. The cost of the repurchased shares is funded from available working capital. Such repurchased shares are held in treasury and are presented using the cost method. As of December 31, 2016, we had purchased 1,952,909 shares of our common stock for $7.1 million (including 27,202 shares repurchased for $0.1 million that had not yet settled as of December 31, 2016) at an average price of $3.64 per share.\nOur future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including our rate of revenue growth, the cost of maintaining and improving our technologies, our operating expenses related to the development and marketing of our solutions, and the cost of repurchasing our common stock. We believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balance will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements through at least the next 12 months. However, our liquidity assumptions may prove to be incorrect, and we could utilize our available financial resources sooner than we currently expect. In addition, we may elect to raise additional funds at any time through equity, equity-linked or debt financing arrangements. Our future capital requirements and the adequacy of available funds will depend on many factors, including those set forth under Part I, Item 1A: Risk Factors\u201d in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We may not be able to secure additional financing to meet our operating requirements on acceptable terms, or at all. If we raise additional funds by issuing equity or equity-linked securities, the ownership of our existing stockholders will be diluted. If we raise additional financing by the incurrence of indebtedness, we will be subject to increased fixed payment obligations and could also be subject to restrictive covenants, such as limitations on our ability to incur additional debt, and other operating restrictions that could adversely impact our ability to conduct our business. If we are unable to obtain needed additional funds, we will have to reduce our operating expenses, which would impair our growth prospects and could otherwise negatively impact our business.\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows for the periods presented:\n\nOperating Activities\nOur primary source of cash from operating activities is receipts from the sale of our advertising solutions to our customers. Our primary uses of cash from operating activities are payments to publishers and other vendors for the purchase of digital media inventory and related costs, employee compensation and related expenses, sales and marketing expenses, general operating expenses, and the purchase of property and equipment.\nWe generated $18.7 million of cash from operating activities during 2016, primarily resulting from a net loss of $7.7 million, as adjusted for non-cash charges related to:\n \u2022 Depreciation and amortization of $6.9 million; \n \u2022 Stock-based compensation of $8.7 million; \n \u2022 Bad debt expense of $0.8 million; \n \u2022 Amortization of premiums on marketable securities of $0.3 million; \n \u2022 Non-cash asset impairment charge of $0.9 million; and \n \u2022 Deferred income taxes of $(0.2) million. \nIn addition, certain changes in our operating assets and liabilities resulted in significant cash increases (decreases) as follows:\n \u2022 $15.0 million from a decrease in accounts receivable due to the timing of payments received from advertising customers; \n \u2022 $(6.4) million from a decrease in accounts payable, accrued digital media property owner costs and other accrued liabilities as a result of the timing of payments to our vendors; \nTable 168: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> $0.6 million from an increase", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7.\n</td> <td> MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis of our consolidated financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes to the consolidated financial statements included later in this Form 10-K. In addition to historical financial information, the following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates, beliefs and expectations that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results and the timing of events could differ materially from those discussed in these forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those discussed below and elsewhere in this Form 10-K, particularly in Part I, Item 1A: Risk Factors.\u201d\nOverview\nYuMe is a leading independent provider of multi-screen programmatic video advertising technology, connecting brand advertisers, digital media property owners and consumers of video content across a growing range of internet-connected devices. YuMe offers advertising customers full service marketing solutions by combining programmatic buying tools and data-driven technologies with deep insight into audience behavior. In 2015 we announced the launch of YFA, which is our DSP, to find relevant audiences and deliver targeted advertising. YuMe technologies also provide monetization opportunities for global digital media property owners.\nOur digital video advertising solutions are purpose-built for brand advertisers, advertising agencies and digital media property owners. Through a sophisticated platform of proprietary embedded software, data science, machine-learning algorithms, and programmatic tools we deliver video advertising campaigns to relevant, brand-receptive digital audiences. We aggregate these audiences across a wide range of internet-connected devices, which include personal computers, smartphones, tablets, set-top boxes, game consoles and internet-connected TVs, by providing global digital media property owners with proprietary software that monetizes their professionally produced content and applications with our advertising campaigns. Our industry leadership is reflected in our wide audience reach, advanced programmatic capabilities, large customer base and scale in data derived from our large embedded software base.\nFor our advertising customers, we overcome the complexities of delivering digital video brand advertising campaigns in a highly fragmented environment where audiences use an increasing variety of internet-connected devices to access thousands of online and mobile websites and applications. Our solutions deliver brand-optimized video advertising campaigns seamlessly across internet-connected devices, and we deliver those solutions to customers through direct sales and through our programmatic buying platform (both managed and self-service). Our platform optimizes advertising campaign results that are relevant to brand advertisers, such as brand awareness, message recall, brand favorability, and purchase intent. We believe brand advertisers and brand-focused agencies can find particular benefit in our private marketplace programmatic offering through which brand advertisers are able to programmatically manage the audiences and digital media properties where their campaigns will run.\nFor global digital media property owners that supply advertising inventory, we offer technologies that enable us to make their inventory available to advertising customers and deliver digital video ads to the audiences that are optimized for specific advertising customer needs. In order to categorize these audiences our technology stack gathers first party data through our cross-device SDK and incorporates third party data from partners. We then apply our data science capabilities to aggregate audiences that will be relevant to brand advertisers. In combination, these capabilities allow us to deliver ads to audiences that we expect to be receptive to specific brand messages, which drives better monetization for digital media property owners.\nThe core of our business relies on our sophisticated platform that encompasses customized embedded software, programmatic advertising buying tools and data science capabilities. Our YuMe SDKs are embedded by our digital media property owners and collect data that we use for our advanced audience modeling algorithms, continuously improving our ability to optimize advertising campaigns around results that are relevant to brand advertisers. Our Placement Quality Index ( PQI\u201d) inventory scoring system uses YuMe SDKs and other data sources to assess through algorithms the quality of ad placements and optimize placements for maximum brand advertising results. Our Audience Amplifier machine-learning tool uses data gathered by YuMe SDKs in its correlative data models to find audiences that we expect to be receptive to specific brand messages.\nOver our twelve-year operating history we have amassed a vast amount of data derived from our large installed base of YuMe SDKs that are embedded in online and mobile websites and entertainment applications residing on millions of internet-connected devices. This allows us to deliver TV-like ads, enhanced and customized for each specific device type, and collect valuable advertisement viewership data. We collect billions of data points each year from ad impressions we deliver. As we grow our audience and advertiser footprint, we are able to collect even more data, which in turn enables us to improve the efficacy of our targeting models, further improving the utility of our solutions and driving increased adoption of our technology.\nWe generate revenue by delivering digital video ads on internet-connected devices. Our ads run when users choose to view video content on their devices. Advertising campaigns occur when customers submit orders to us directly through our programmatic software or in a managed service and we fulfill those orders by delivering their digital video ads to audiences available through digital media properties and third party ad exchanges, a process that we refer to as an advertising campaign. Advertising customers typically pay us on a CPM basis, of which we generally pay digital media property owners a negotiated percentage. In cases where our programmatic buying platform is used by our advertising customers to source inventory from a third party ad exchange, we may collect a transaction fee known as our take rate.\u201d Our customers primarily consist of large global brands and their advertising agencies. In 2016, we had 846 customers, including 76 of the top 100 U.S. advertisers as ranked by Advertising Age magazine in 2015 ( the AdAge 100\u201d), such as American Express, AT&T, GlaxoSmithKline, Home Depot and McDonald's.\nIn June 2015 we announced the launch of YFA which is our demand-side programmatic video buying technology platform providing advertisers with access to multi-screen video audiences at scale with a full suite of unique branding solutions. YFA is a comprehensive demand-side platform that connects brand advertising buyers to relevant digital media property audiences and inventory. YFA delivers an intuitive user interface, multi-screen breadth, brand performance-driving advertising products and integrated third party technologies to support video branding objectives. In addition to buying inventory in real-time, advertising customers using YFA can create private marketplaces to customize the digital media properties and owners relevant for their specific brands.\nYFA allows advertising customers to access our programmatic platform and use our sales or managed services team to assist in creating, optimizing and running campaigns. Our YFA programmatic platform can run campaigns across multiple internet-connected devices and through multiple digital media property owners and aggregators. When using YFA, advertising customers can access differentiated audiences from YuMe digital media properties and other audiences through third party supply-side platforms, or SSPs, and ad exchanges. This gives customers the flexibility to extend their objectives as needed.\nOn November 8, 2016, our board of directors approved a restructuring plan designed to reduce our operating expenses, realign our cost structure with revenue, better manage our costs and more efficiently manage our business. The restructuring plan was implemented in the fourth quarter of 2016 and completed in the first quarter of 2017. Restructuring expenses totaled $1.6 million and were recorded as restructuring expenses on our consolidated statements of operations in the fourth quarter of 2016. Elements of the restructuring plan included a workforce reduction of approximately 7%, which included employee severance pay and related expenses of $1.2 million, acceleration of our former chief executive officer's stock-based compensation expense of $0.3 million as a result of his termination without cause and facility exit expenses of $0.1 million. We do not expect to incur any additional expenses under the restructuring plan. As of December 31, 2016, we had $0.8 million of restructuring liabilities included in accrued liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet, which consisted primarily of employee severance pay and related expenses. We expect the restructuring liability to be fully paid in the first quarter of 2017.\nOn November 9, 2016, we announced the commencement of a comprehensive review of strategic alternatives and have engaged advisors related to such review. We have not made any determination to enter into any strategic transaction, and there is no assurance that our review of strategic alternatives will result in any transaction being entered into or consummated.\nResults of Operations\nThe following tables set forth our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014.

excludes restructuring expenses totaling $849,000 in 2016. \nRevenue\nWe derive revenue principally from advertising solutions priced on a CPM basis, and measured by the number of advertising impressions delivered on digital media properties. A substantial majority of our customer contracts take the form of ad insertion orders placed by advertising agencies on behalf of their brand advertiser clients, which are typically one to three months in duration. Occasionally, we enter into longer term contracts with customers.\nWe count direct advertising customers in accordance with the following principles: (i) we count each advertiser, not the advertising agencies through which its ad insertion orders may be placed, as the customer; and (ii) entities that are part of the same corporate structure are counted as a single customer. We also generate other revenue from digital media property owners, including platform fees, professional service fees and ad serving fees, and other revenue from intermediaries that have relationships with advertising agencies and advertisers. In calculating revenue per direct advertising customer, we exclude this other revenue.\nOur revenue tends to fluctuate based on seasonal factors that affect the advertising industry. For example, many advertisers devote the largest portion of their budgets to the fourth quarter of the calendar year, to coincide with increased holiday and year-end purchasing activities. Historically, the fourth quarter of the year reflects the highest advertising activity and the first quarter reflects the lowest level of such activity.\nTable 139: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Change\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Change\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $ </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2014 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>160,411 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(12,843 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(7.4 </td> <td> )%\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>173,254 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(4,525 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2.5 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>177,779 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor 2016, revenue decreased $12.8 million, or 7.4%, compared to 2015. The decrease in revenue was driven by a $13.1 million decrease in international revenue, partially offset by a $0.3 million increase in domestic revenue. The decrease in international revenue was primarily driven by a decline in sales through some of our European offices, which was associated largely with personnel turnover. Average revenue per advertising customer for 2016 was $186,100, an increase of 9.1%, compared to $171,000 for 2015. The increase was primarily the result of an increase in the spending of our top 20 advertising customers, which accounted for $69.3 million, or 43.2%, of our 2016 revenue, compared to $65.2 million, or 37.7%, of our 2015 revenue. We had 846 advertising customers in 2016, a decrease of 15.5%, compared to 1,001 customers in 2015. The decrease primarily reflects a decrease in international advertising customers.\nFor 2015, revenue decreased $4.5 million, or 2.5%, compared to 2014. The decrease in revenue was primarily driven by certain brand advertisers spending less on our platform due to the effects of prior operational issues and our currently immaterial participation in the programmatic channel. Additionally, the strengthening of the U.S. dollar during 2015 compared to the British pound and euro contributed to the decrease in revenue. The average revenue per advertising customer for 2015 was $171,000, a decrease of 13.6%, compared to $198,000 for 2014. The decrease in average revenue per advertising customer was primarily the result of the increase in the number of new advertising customers, particularly new customers, which tend to start out deploying smaller digital video advertising budgets through our solutions. We had 1,001 advertising customers in 2015, an increase of 13.8%, compared to 880 in 2014. Our top 20 advertising customers for 2015 accounted for $65.2 million, or 37.7%, of our revenue, compared to $63.3 million, or 35.6%, of our revenue for 2014.\nCost of Revenue and Gross Profit\nOur cost of revenue primarily consists of costs incurred with digital media property owners, typically under revenue-sharing arrangements. We refer to these costs as traffic acquisition costs. Generally, we incur traffic acquisition costs in the period the advertising impressions are delivered. In limited circumstances, we incur costs based on minimum guaranteed impressions. Cost of revenue also includes ad delivery costs such as labor and related costs, depreciation and amortization of acquired technologies, internally developed software and data center assets, and Internet access costs. These expenses are classified as cost of revenue for the period in which the revenue is recognized. As a percentage of revenue, we expect cost of revenues, including our traffic acquisition costs, to be in the 46% to 48% range in 2017.\nTable 140: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Change\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Change\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $ </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $ </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2014 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cost of revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>80,190 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(14,838 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(15.6 </td> <td> )%\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>95,028 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,932 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.1 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>93,096 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gross profit amount\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>80,221 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,995 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.6 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>78,226 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(6,457 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(7.6 </td> <td> )%\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>84,683 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gross profit percentage\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>50.0 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>45.2 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>47.6 </td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor 2016, cost of revenue decreased $14.8 million, or 15.6%, compared to 2015. The decrease was primarily attributable to a $14.6 million decrease in traffic acquisition costs, third party services and ad delivery costs. Additionally, other costs of revenues, including labor costs, decreased $0.2 million. Traffic acquisition costs decreased due to the decline in revenue, improvements in operational efficiency and better targeting of suitable digital media inventory. For 2016, gross profit, as a percentage of revenue, increased to 50.0% from 45.2% for 2015, primarily as a result of an increase in the number of ads run on SDK-enabled inventory resulting in lower traffic acquisition costs.\nFor 2015, cost of revenue increased $1.9 million, or 2.1%, compared to 2014. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase of $6.1 million in traffic acquisition costs, third party service and ad delivery costs, which was partially offset by a $4.2 million decrease in other costs of revenues. For 2015, gross profit, as a percentage of revenue, decreased to 45.2% from 47.6% for 2014, primarily as a result of product mix resulting in higher traffic acquisition costs.\nSales and Marketing\nWe sell to our customers primarily through our direct sales force personnel, who have established relationships with major advertising agencies and direct relationships with advertisers. Our sales and marketing expenses primarily consist of salaries, benefits, stock-based compensation, travel and entertainment expenses, and incentive compensation for our sales and marketing employees. Sales and marketing expenses also include promotional, advertising and public relations costs, as well as depreciation, facilities and other supporting overhead costs. We expect sales and marketing expenses to decline as a percentage of revenue in the near term.\nTable 141: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Change\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Change\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $ </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $ </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2014 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Sales and marketing\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>51,676 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(8,236 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(13.7 </td> <td> )%\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>59,912 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(5,200 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(8.0 </td> <td> )%\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>65,112 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Percentage of revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>32.2 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>34.6 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>36.6 </td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor 2016, sales and marketing expenses decreased $8.2 million, or 13.7%, compared to 2015. The decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease of $7.8 million in employee compensation, benefits and other employee-related expenses, including stock-based compensation, reflecting fewer employees in our sales and marketing organization. Additionally, other sales and marketing expenses including advertising, promotions, tradeshows, sponsorships, recruiting and temporary services, decreased $0.4 million primarily as a result of a decrease in discretionary advertising spending. For 2016, sales and marketing expenses, as a percentage of revenue, decreased to 32.2% from 34.6% for 2015.\nFor 2015, sales and marketing expenses decreased $5.2 million, or 8.0%, compared to 2014. The decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease of $4.8 million in employee compensation, benefits and other employee-related expenses, primarily as a result of a decrease in the number of employees within our sales and marketing organization. Additionally, other sales and marketing expenses including advertising, promotions, tradeshows, sponsorships and consulting services, decreased $0.4 million primarily as a result of a decrease in discretionary advertising spending. For 2015, sales and marketing expenses, as a percentage of revenue, decreased to 34.6% from 36.6% for 2014, primarily as a result of the decrease in the number of sales and marketing employees.\nResearch and Development\nWe engage in research and development efforts to create and enhance our existing, data-science capabilities and proprietary technologies. Our research and development expenses primarily consist of salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation for our engineers, product development and information technology personnel. Research and development expenses also include outside services and consulting, depreciation, facilities and other overhead costs. We capitalize a portion of our research and development costs attributable to internally developed software.\nAs of December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, we had 144, 148 and 91 research and development employees, respectively. As of December 31, 2016, 110 research and development employees were located in our Chennai and Pune, India offices. We expect our research and development expenses to increase as we continue to invest in the research and development of our products, and to increase as a percentage of revenue in the short term. We believe that our twelve-year operating history and our ability to attract and retain the large pool of engineering talent available in India will help us expand our engineering resources and capabilities cost-effectively.\nTable 142: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Change\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Change\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $ </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $ </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2014 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Research and development\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>10,968 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>31 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.3 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>10,937 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,029 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>85.1 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,908 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Percentage of revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6.8 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6.3 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.3 </td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor 2016, research and development expenses increased by $31,000, or 0.3%, compared to 2015. The increase was attributable to an increase of $0.3 million other departmental expenses, including equipment and software support and maintenance. Partially offsetting this increase was a decrease of $0.2 million in employee compensation, benefits and other employee-related expenses, including stock-based compensation, primarily as a result of a decrease in the number of employees in our research and development organization. For 2016, research and development expenses, as a percentage of revenue, increased to 6.8% from 6.3% for 2015, primarily as a result of an increase in other departmental expenses, including equipment and software support and maintenance.\nFor 2015, research and development expenses increased $5.0 million, or 85.1%, compared to 2014. The increase was attributable to an increase of $3.6 million in employee compensation, benefits and other employee-related expenses, including stock-based compensation, as a result of an increase in the number of employees within our research and development organization as it expanded both domestically and internationally. Additionally, other departmental expenses, including equipment support and maintenance and depreciation, including depreciation expense related to capitalized internally developed software, increased $1.4 million. For 2015, research and development expenses, as a percentage of revenue, increased to 6.3% from 3.3% for 2014, primarily as a result of the increase in research and development employee compensation, benefits and other employee-related expenses, including stock-based compensation.\nGeneral and Administrative\nOur general and administrative expenses primarily consist of salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation for our executive, finance, legal, human resources and other administrative employees. General and administrative expenses also include outside consulting, legal and accounting services, and facilities and other supporting overhead costs. We expect general and administrative expenses to remain at current levels in the near term.\nTable 143: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Change\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Change\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $ </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $ </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2014 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (dollars in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> General and administrative\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>22,513 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(1,071 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(4.5 </td> <td> )%\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>23,584 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,848 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8.5 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>21,736 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Percentage of revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14.0 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13.6 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12.2 </td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor 2016, general and administrative expenses decreased $1.1 million, or 4.5%, compared 2015. The decrease was primarily attributable to a $1.2 million decrease in employee compensation, benefits and other employee-related expenses, including stock-based compensation, as a result of a decrease in the number of employees within our general and administrative organization. Partially offsetting this decrease was an increase of $0.1 million in other general and administrative expenses, including rent and outside legal and consulting fees related to our proxy contest. For 2016, general and administrative expenses, as a percentage of revenue, increased to 14.0% from 13.6% for 2015, primarily as a result of the decrease in revenue in 2016.\nFor 2015, general and administrative expenses increased $1.8 million, or 8.5%, compared to 2014. The increase was primarily attributable to a $2.4 million increase in employee compensation, benefits and other employee-related expenses, including stock-based compensation, as a result of an increase in the number of employees within our general and administrative organization. Partially offsetting this increase was a decrease of $0.5 million in professional service fees and consulting services as we placed greater reliance on internal employee labor rather than external consultants. For 2015, general and administrative expenses, as a percentage of revenue, increased by 1.4% to 13.6% from 12.2% for 2014, primarily as a result of the increase in general and administrative employees and the associated increase in employee compensation, benefits and other employee-related expenses, including stock-based compensation.\nAsset Impairment\nFor internally developed software, we perform regular recoverability assessments in order to evaluate any impairment indicators or changes to useful lives. During the fourth quarter of 2016, we determined not to allocate any future resources to market, develop and maintain our YFP 5.0 supply-side platform for publishers since it was not generating sufficient revenue to cover its related costs. Our assessment determined YFP 5.0 to be fully impaired and we recorded a one-time non-cash asset impairment charge of $0.9 million related to YFP 5.0 in operating expenses.\nRestructuring\nOn November 8, 2016, our board of directors approved a restructuring plan designed to reduce our operating expenses, realign our cost structure with revenue, better manage our costs and more efficiently manage our business. The restructuring plan was implemented in the fourth quarter of 2016 and completed in the first quarter of 2017. Restructuring expenses totaled $1.6 million and were recorded as restructuring expenses on our consolidated statements of operations in the fourth quarter of 2016. Elements of the restructuring plan included a workforce reduction of approximately 7%, which included employee severance pay and related expenses, acceleration of our former chief executive officer's stock-based compensation expense as a result of his termination without cause and facility exit expenses. We do not expect to incur any additional expenses under the restructuring plan. As of December 31, 2016, we had $0.8 million of restructuring liabilities included in accrued liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet, which consisted primarily of employee severance pay and related expenses. We expect the restructuring liability to be fully paid in the first quarter of 2017.\nRestructuring expenses incurred in 2016 were as follows (in thousands):\nTable 144: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Workforce Reduction Expenses (1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Stock-Based Compensation Expense Acceleration (2)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Facility Exit Expenses (3)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Restructuring\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,172 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>288 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>117 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,577 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) Workforce reduction expenses include employee severance and temporary health insurance costs under the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 ( COBRA\u201d). \n (2) In accordance with the 2015 Executive Severance Plan, 25% of the chief executive officer's unvested equity holdings immediately accelerate to become vested if the chief executive officer is terminated for any reason other than cause. Stock-based compensation expense is a non-cash expense. \n (3) We exited a facility located in Redwood City, California on November 11, 2016. Facility exit expenses include rental payments we are required to make on the vacant office space and broker fees we will pay to find a new tenant to sublease the vacated office space. \nInterest and Other Expense, Net\nInterest and other expense, net consists primarily of interest income earned on our cash equivalents and marketable securities, interest expense on our capital lease obligations, accretion and amortization on marketable securities, gains and losses on our derivative instruments and foreign exchange gains and losses.\nTable 148: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Change\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Change\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2014 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest income\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>628 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(53 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>681 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>42 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>639 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest expense\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(7 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(8 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(8 </td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Transaction loss on foreign exchange\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,319 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(775 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(544 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>483 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,027 </td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gain on derivative instruments\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>683 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>626 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>57 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>57 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Amortization and accretion of marketable securities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(289 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>131 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(420 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>83 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(503 </td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other non-operating income (loss), net\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(4 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(7 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest and other expense, net\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(306 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(68 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(238 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>658 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(896 </td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor 2016, interest and other expense, net was $(0.3) million compared to $(0.2) million for 2015. The change was primarily due to $(1.3) million in foreign transaction exchange losses in 2016 compared to a $(0.5) million loss 2015 as a result of fluctuations in the U.S. dollar against the British pound sterling and euro. In addition, we realized a $0.7 million gain on our derivative instruments in 2016 compared to a $57,000 gain in 2015.\nFor 2015, interest and other expense, net decreased by $0.7 million, compared to 2014. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease of $0.5 million in foreign transaction exchange losses as a result of fluctuations in the U.S. dollar against the British pound sterling and euro. In addition, we realized a $0.1 million gain on our derivative instruments in 2015. Our investments in derivative instruments are intended to mitigate a portion of our foreign transaction exchange gains and losses reported as income or expense on our statements of operations. Additionally, amortization and accretion expense on our marketable securities increased $0.1 million.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nProvision for income taxes consists of federal and state income taxes in the U.S. and income taxes in certain foreign jurisdictions, deferred income taxes reflecting the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes, and the realization of net operating loss carryforwards.\nTable 149: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Change\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Change\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2014 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income tax (expense) benefit\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>20 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>320 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(300 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(524 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>224 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor 2016, income tax benefit was priamrily related to the full year net loss before income taxes of $7.7 million. Partially offsetting the federal and state tax benefit were taxes due in foreign jurisdictions. For 2015, income tax (expense) benefit was primarily related to state taxes and taxes due in foreign jurisdictions. For 2014, income tax benefit was primarily related to the full-year net loss before income taxes of $9.0 million. Partially offsetting the federal and state tax benefit were taxes due in foreign jurisdictions.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nTo provide investors with additional information regarding our financial results, we have presented within this Annual Report on Form 10-K adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure. We have provided below a reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA to net income (loss), the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure.\nAdjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure that we calculate as net income (loss), adjusted to exclude expenses for: interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, and one-time proxy contest, asset impairment and restructuring expenses. We believe that adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to investors in understanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as management and the board of directors. This non-GAAP information is not necessarily comparable to non-GAAP information of other companies. Non-GAAP information should not be viewed as a substitute for, or superior to, net income (loss) prepared in accordance with GAAP as a measure of our profitability or liquidity. Users of this financial information should consider the types of events and transactions for which adjustments have been made. The following is a reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA to net income (loss) for the periods indicated below:\nTable 150: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Years Ended December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net loss\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(7,721 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(16,745 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(8,745 </td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Adjustments:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest expense\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income tax expense (benefit)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(20 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>300 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(224 </td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Depreciation and amortization expense\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,876 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,006 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,620 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Stock-based compensation expense\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,424 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,879 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,774 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Proxy contest expense\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>815 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Asset impairment\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>922 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Restructuring\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,577 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total Adjustments\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18,601 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15,193 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10,178 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Adjusted EBITDA\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>10,880 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(1,552 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,433 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe have presented adjusted EBITDA in this Annual Report on Form 10-K because it is a key measure used by our management and board of directors to understand and evaluate our core operating performance and trends, to prepare and approve our annual budget, and to develop short- and long-term operational plans. In particular, we believe that the exclusion of the expenses eliminated in calculating adjusted EBITDA can provide a useful measure for period-to-period comparisons of our core business. Additionally, adjusted EBITDA is a key financial measure considered by the compensation committee of our board of directors in connection with the determination of compensation for our executive officers. Accordingly, we believe that adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results in the same manner as our management and board of directors.\nAdjusted EBITDA has limitations as a financial measure, and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations are:\n \u2022 although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized may have to be replaced in the future, and adjusted EBITDA does not reflect cash capital expenditure requirements for such replacements or for new capital expenditure requirements; \n \u2022 adjusted EBITDA does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; \n \u2022 adjusted EBITDA does not consider the potentially dilutive impact of equity-based compensation; \n \u2022 adjusted EBITDA does not reflect tax payments that may represent a reduction in cash available to us; and \n \u2022 other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate adjusted EBITDA differently, which reduces its usefulness as a comparative measure. \nBecause of these and other limitations, you should consider adjusted EBITDA along with other GAAP-based financial performance measures, including various cash flow metrics, net income or loss, and our other GAAP financial results.\nQuarterly Results of Operations\nThe following tables presenting our unaudited quarterly results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We have prepared the unaudited information on the same basis as our audited consolidated financial statements. Our operating results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of results for any future quarters or for a full year.\nThe following tables present unaudited quarterly results for 2016 and 2015. These tables include all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments, that we consider for the fair statement of our consolidated financial position and operating results for the quarters presented. Seasonality has caused, and is likely to continue to cause fluctuations in our quarterly results.\nSelected summarized quarterly financial information for 2016 and 2015 is as follows (in thousands, except per share amounts):\nTable 156: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Fourth Quarter\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Third Quarter\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Second Quarter\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> First Quarter\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>45,550 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>34,953 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>40,675 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>39,233 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gross profit\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>24,002 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>16,903 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>20,564 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>18,752 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net income (loss)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,827 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(4,464 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(2,486 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(3,598 </td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net income (loss) per share (a):\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Basic\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0.08 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(0.13 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(0.07 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(0.10 </td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Diluted\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0.08 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(0.13 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(0.07 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(0.10 </td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 157: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Fourth Quarter\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Third Quarter\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Second Quarter\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> First Quarter\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>53,836 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>38,870 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>40,403 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>40,145 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gross profit\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>24,980 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>17,400 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>16,987 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>18,859 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net income (loss)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,620 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(6,534 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(5,835 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(5,996 </td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net income (loss) per share (a):\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Basic\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0.05 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(0.19 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(0.17 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(0.18 </td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Diluted\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0.05 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(0.19 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(0.17 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(0.18 </td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (a) Basic and diluted net income (loss) per share are computed independently for each of the quarters presented. Therefore, the sum of quarterly basic and diluted per share information may not equal annual basic and diluted earnings per share. \nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur principal sources of liquidity are our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities. As of December 31, 2016, we had $65.7 million in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities. Cash equivalents and marketable securities as of December 31, 2016 are comprised of money market funds, corporate bonds, U.S. government and agency bonds and commercial paper. Cash held internationally as of December 31, 2016 totaled $4.2 million.\nOn February 18, 2016, we announced a $10 million share repurchase program. The repurchase program has no set expiration date and all purchases are subject to applicable rules and regulations, market conditions and other factors. Purchases under this repurchase program are made in the open market and are intended to comply with Rule 10b-18 under the Exchange Act. The cost of the repurchased shares is funded from available working capital. Such repurchased shares are held in treasury and are presented using the cost method. As of December 31, 2016, we had purchased 1,952,909 shares of our common stock for $7.1 million (including 27,202 shares repurchased for $0.1 million that had not yet settled as of December 31, 2016) at an average price of $3.64 per share.\nOur future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including our rate of revenue growth, the cost of maintaining and improving our technologies, our operating expenses related to the development and marketing of our solutions, and the cost of repurchasing our common stock. We believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balance will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements through at least the next 12 months. However, our liquidity assumptions may prove to be incorrect, and we could utilize our available financial resources sooner than we currently expect. In addition, we may elect to raise additional funds at any time through equity, equity-linked or debt financing arrangements. Our future capital requirements and the adequacy of available funds will depend on many factors, including those set forth under Part I, Item 1A: Risk Factors\u201d in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We may not be able to secure additional financing to meet our operating requirements on acceptable terms, or at all. If we raise additional funds by issuing equity or equity-linked securities, the ownership of our existing stockholders will be diluted. If we raise additional financing by the incurrence of indebtedness, we will be subject to increased fixed payment obligations and could also be subject to restrictive covenants, such as limitations on our ability to incur additional debt, and other operating restrictions that could adversely impact our ability to conduct our business. If we are unable to obtain needed additional funds, we will have to reduce our operating expenses, which would impair our growth prospects and could otherwise negatively impact our business.\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows for the periods presented:\nTable 159: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year Ended December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows Data: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>18,662 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(1,130 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>6,766 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,799 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(21,108 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(15,509 </td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(6,708 </td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,086 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,234 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating Activities\nOur primary source of cash from operating activities is receipts from the sale of our advertising solutions to our customers. Our primary uses of cash from operating activities are payments to publishers and other vendors for the purchase of digital media inventory and related costs, employee compensation and related expenses, sales and marketing expenses, general operating expenses, and the purchase of property and equipment.\nWe generated $18.7 million of cash from operating activities during 2016, primarily resulting from a net loss of $7.7 million, as adjusted for non-cash charges related to:\n \u2022 Depreciation and amortization of $6.9 million; \n \u2022 Stock-based compensation of $8.7 million; \n \u2022 Bad debt expense of $0.8 million; \n \u2022 Amortization of premiums on marketable securities of $0.3 million; \n \u2022 Non-cash asset impairment charge of $0.9 million; and \n \u2022 Deferred income taxes of $(0.2) million. \nIn addition, certain changes in our operating assets and liabilities resulted in significant cash increases (decreases) as follows:\n \u2022 $15.0 million from a decrease in accounts receivable due to the timing of payments received from advertising customers; \n \u2022 $(6.4) million from a decrease in accounts payable, accrued digital media property owner costs and other accrued liabilities as a result of the timing of payments to our vendors; \nTable 168: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> $0.6 million from an increase"}
