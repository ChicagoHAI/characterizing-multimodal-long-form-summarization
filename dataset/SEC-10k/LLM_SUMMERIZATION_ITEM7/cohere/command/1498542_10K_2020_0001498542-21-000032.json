See also the Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements section preceding Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. For a comparison of the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, see Item 7 - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nOverview\nWe were formed on July 27, 2010, to acquire and operate a diversified portfolio of commercial properties in the retail, office and industrial sectors that are leased to creditworthy tenants under long-term net leases, and are strategically located throughout the United States, and U.S. government securities, agency securities, corporate debt and other investments for which there is reasonable liquidity. We expect to complement our portfolio of net-lease properties by investing in substantially leased core metropolitan commercial and multi-family properties with growth potential that we believe will help us meet our investment objectives, either directly or through other funds with a proven track record of performance in these investment types, including funds managed by affiliates of our advisor. We commenced our principal operations on December 7, 2011, when we issued the initial $10.0 million in shares of our common stock in the Offering and acquired our first real estate property. When we refer to our share classes in this Annual Report on Form 10-K with respect to dates prior to the Restructure Date, we are referring to our shares under our prior share structure, and when we refer to our share classes in this Annual Report on Form 10-K with respect to dates on or after the Restructure Date, we are referring to our shares under our new share structure. We have no paid employees and are externally advised and managed by CIM Income NAV Management.\nAs we acquire additional commercial real estate, we will be subject to changes in real estate prices and changes in interest rates on any current variable rate debt, refinancings or new indebtedness used to acquire the properties. We may manage our risk of changes in real estate prices on future property acquisitions, when applicable, by entering into purchase agreements and loan commitments simultaneously, or through loan assumptions, so that our operating yield is determinable at the time we enter into a purchase agreement, by contracting with developers for future delivery of properties, or by entering into sale-leaseback transactions. We manage our interest rate risk by monitoring the interest rate environment in connection with our future property acquisitions, when applicable, or upcoming debt maturities to determine the appropriate financing or refinancing terms, which may include fixed rate loans, variable rate loans or interest rate hedges. If we are unable to acquire suitable properties or obtain suitable financing terms for future acquisitions or refinancing, our results of operations may be adversely affected.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we owned 123 properties located in 34 states, comprising 5.3 million rentable square feet of commercial space, which includes the rentable square feet of buildings on land subject to ground leases. Our operating results and cash flows are primarily influenced by rental income from our commercial properties and interest expense on our property indebtedness and acquisition and operating expenses. As 98.1% of our rentable square feet was under lease as of December 31, 2020, with a weighted average remaining lease term of 9.8 years, we believe our exposure to changes in commercial rental rates on our portfolio is substantially mitigated, except for vacancies caused by tenant bankruptcies or other factors, including due to circumstances related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Our advisor regularly monitors the creditworthiness of our tenants by reviewing each tenant's financial results, any available credit rating agency reports on the tenant or guarantor, the operating history of the property with such tenant, the tenant's market share and track record within its industry segment, the general health and outlook of the tenant's industry segment, and other information for changes and possible trends. If our advisor identifies significant changes or trends that may adversely affect the creditworthiness of a tenant, it will gather a more in-depth knowledge of the tenant's financial condition and, if necessary, attempt to mitigate the tenant credit risk by evaluating the possible sale of the property, or identifying a possible replacement tenant should the current tenant fail to perform on the lease.\nEffective April 1, 2020, we modified our Offering and certain other features of our Company from a daily to a monthly NAV REIT. We believe this change will result in greater access to capital to execute on our investment strategy, which will help us to better achieve our investment objectives by driving growth and diversification within the portfolio, creating a stronger balance sheet and enhancing liquidity for the benefit of all stockholders.\nAs part of the change from a daily to a monthly NAV REIT, our Board approved, among other things: (1) a change in the frequency of our NAV calculations from daily to monthly and certain other related changes to our valuation policies; and (2) adopted an amended share redemption program that provides for redemptions on a monthly basis. As a monthly NAV REIT, we\nexpect that investors' subscriptions will be accepted on the first day of each month and the purchase price of each class of shares would generally equal the prior month's NAV for that class divided by the number of shares of such class outstanding, as determined monthly, plus applicable selling commissions and dealer manager fees.\nCOVID-19\nThe COVID-19 outbreak and the associated shelter-in-place\u201d or stay-at-home\u201d orders or other quarantine mandates or public health guidance issued by local, state or federal authorities has adversely affected a number of our tenants' businesses. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic continues to impact our operations and those of our tenants will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence, including the scope, severity and duration of the pandemic, the actions taken to contain the pandemic or mitigate its impact, and the direct and indirect economic effects of the pandemic and containment measures, among others.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, we provided lease concessions, either in the form of rent deferrals or abatements, to certain tenants in response to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on those tenants. As of December 31, 2020, we granted rent deferrals with an aggregate deferral amount of $539,000. Additionally, as of December 31, 2020, we granted rent abatements to tenants with an aggregate abatement amount of $618,000, which reduced revenues during the year ended December 31, 2020.\nAs of March 24, 2021, we have collected approximately 99% of rental payments billed to tenants during the three months ended December 31, 2020. There have been no significant changes in rent collections subsequent to December 31, 2020.\nWe are actively managing our response to the COVID-19 pandemic in collaboration with our tenants and business partners and are assessing potential impacts to our financial position and operating results, as well as potential adverse developments in our business. In order to manage the financial health of the Company, our Board is making its determinations with respect to the declaration of distributions on a monthly, instead of quarterly basis and has approved and adopted an amended and restated share redemption program (the Amended Share Redemption Program\u201d) that, among other changes, provides that the Amended Share Redemption Program may be suspended at any time by majority vote of the Board without prior notice if the Board believes such action is in the best interest of the Company and its stockholders. Given the recent levels of investor subscriptions and increased redemption requests, which we believe has been exacerbated by the challenging economic environment caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, our stated objectives of maintaining target liquidity of 10% of the NAV up to $1 billion, and 5% of the NAV in excess of $1 billion ( Target Liquidity\u201d) and satisfying the redemption plan limits are in conflict. As such, the Company is temporarily redeeming less than the Amended Share Redemption Program limits to maintain this Target Liquidity while the Company seeks to generate additional liquidity through investor subscriptions and execution of an in-process asset disposition program. On August 30, 2020, our Board determined that, effective immediately, monthly redemptions temporarily will be limited to shares whose aggregate value is no more than 0.8% of the aggregate NAV as of the last calendar day of the previous calendar month, and in any calendar quarter, redemptions will be limited to shares whose aggregate value is no more than 2.0% of the aggregate NAV as of the last calendar day of the previous calendar quarter. While no assurances can be made regarding the timing of a return to the redemption plan limits stated in the Company's Amended Share Redemption Program, if at all, the Company is currently targeting the return to the limits under the Amended Share Redemption Program to occur in the third quarter of 2021. Further, in support of our efforts to achieve sustainable liquidity, our Board determined that 50% of the independent directors' quarterly compensation payments for the third quarter of 2020 through the second quarter of 2021 will be paid in the form of D Shares based on the then current NAV per share at the time of issuance. In addition, our Advisor agreed to take 50% of the monthly advisory fee payment from August 2020 through June 30, 2021 in I Shares based on the then current NAV per share of such shares at the time of issuance. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we borrowed $52.0 million in revolving loans in order to increase liquidity during this period of economic uncertainty. See - Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d for a more complete discussion of our financial resources.\nWe further engaged our independent valuation expert, pursuant to an agreement dated May 14, 2020, to provide valuation services on a monthly, instead of a rolling annual, basis, until such time that we had greater visibility into the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our properties' valuations. Given the relative stability of the month-over-month valuation of our real estate assets, our liabilities and our rent collections our Board determined that it is in the best interests of us and our stockholders to cease incurring the additional costs associated with the monthly valuations and to return to valuing our real estate portfolio on a rolling annual basis in accordance with our valuation policies effective September 30, 2020. For further information regarding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company, see Part I, Item 1A titled Risk Factors.\u201d\nOperating Highlights and Key Performance Indicators\n2020 Activity\n\u2022Disposed of five properties, consisting of three retail properties and two anchored shopping centers, for an aggregate gross sales price of $16.8 million.\n\u2022Increased total debt by $99.7 million to $450.7 million, with cash proceeds utilized primarily for investment and redemptions.\n\u2022Invested $50 million of limited partnership interests in CIM UII Onshore.\nPortfolio Information\nReal Estate Portfolio\nAs of December 31, 2020, we owned 123 commercial properties located in 34 states, comprising 5.3 million rentable square feet, which includes the rentable square feet of buildings on land subject to ground leases. As of December 31, 2020, these properties were 98.1% leased (including any month-to-month agreements) with a weighted average remaining lease term of 9.8 years.\nThe following table shows the property statistics of our real estate assets as of December 31, 2020 and 2019: Table 13: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Number of commercial properties </td> <td>123 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>128 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Rentable square feet (in thousands) (1)\n</td> <td>5,288 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,406 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Percentage of rentable square feet leased </td> <td>98.1 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>98.6 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Percentage of investment-grade tenants (2)\n</td> <td>29.5 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>32.1 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n____________________________________\n(1)Includes square feet of buildings on land that are subject to ground leases.\n(2)Investment-grade tenants are those with a credit rating of BBB- or higher by Standard & Poor's or a credit rating of Baa3 or higher by Moody's.

buildings on land parcels subject to ground leases.\nLeases\nAlthough there are variations in the specific terms of the leases of our properties, the following is a summary of the general structure of our current leases. Generally, the leases of the properties acquired provide for initial terms of ten or more years, and provide the tenant with one or more multi-year renewal options, subject to generally the same terms and conditions as the initial lease term. Certain leases also provide that in the event we wish to sell the property subject to that lease, we first must offer the lessee the right to purchase the property on the same terms and conditions as any offer which we intend to accept for the sale of the property. The properties are generally leased under net leases pursuant to which the tenant bears responsibility for substantially all property costs and expenses associated with ongoing maintenance and operation, including utilities, property taxes and insurance, while certain of the leases require us to maintain the roof, structure and parking areas of the building. Additionally, certain leases provide for increases in rent as a result of fixed increases, increases in the consumer price index, and/or increases in the tenant's sales volume.\nOur leases, as of December 31, 2020, provided for annual base rental payments (payable in monthly installments) ranging from $12,000 to $3.3 million, and had an average annual base rental payment of $437,000, with a weighted average remaining lease term of 9.8 years.\nThe following table shows lease expirations of our real estate portfolio as of December 31, 2020, during each of the next ten years and thereafter,

or uncertainties, other than the effects of the recent outbreak of COVID-19, and national economic conditions affecting real estate in general, that may reasonably be expected to have a material impact on our results from the acquisition, management and operations of properties other than those listed in Part I, Item 1A - Risk Factors. Currently, we are unable to predict the impact that the COVID-19 pandemic will have on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows in future periods due to numerous uncertainties.\nFor a comparison of the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, see Item 7 - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nSame Store Analysis\nOur results of operations are influenced by the timing of acquisitions and the operating performance of our real estate assets. We review our stabilized operating results, measured by net operating income ( NOI\u201d), from properties that we owned for the entirety of both the current and prior year reporting periods, referred to as same store\u201d properties, and we believe that the presentation of operating results for same store properties provides useful information to stockholders. NOI is a supplemental non-GAAP financial measure of a real estate company's operating performance. NOI is considered by\nmanagement to be a helpful supplemental performance measure, as it enables management to evaluate the impact of occupancy, rents, leasing activity, and other controllable property operating results at our real estate properties, and it provides a consistent method for the comparison of our properties. We define NOI as operating revenues less operating expenses, which exclude (i) depreciation and amortization, (ii) interest expense and other non-property related revenue and expense items such as (a) general and administrative expenses, (b) advisory fees and expenses, (c) transaction-related expenses (d) real estate impairment (e) gain on disposition or real estate, net and (f) income from marketable securities. Our NOI may not be comparable to that of other REITs and should not be considered to be more relevant or accurate in evaluating our operating performance than the current GAAP methodology used in calculating net income. In determining the same store property pool, we include all properties that were owned for the entirety of both the current and prior reporting periods, except for properties during the current or prior year that were under development or redevelopment.\nComparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2020 and 2019\nThe following table reconciles net income, calculated in accordance with GAAP, to net operating income (dollar amounts in thousands): Table 21: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Total </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>For the Year Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net (loss) income </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(11,011) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>14,791 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(25,802) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense and other, net </td> <td>17,127 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14,337 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,790 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss on investment in CIM UII Onshore </td> <td>2,660 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,660 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income </td> <td>8,776 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>29,128 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(20,352) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain on disposition of real estate, net </td> <td>(627) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(10,213) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9,586 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Real estate impairment </td> <td>13,851 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,090 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10,761 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization </td> <td>27,647 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>29,182 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,535) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Transaction-related expenses </td> <td>726 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,233 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(507) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Advisory fees and expenses </td> <td>6,382 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,902 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,520) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General and administrative expenses </td> <td>5,512 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,021 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,509) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest income on marketable securities </td> <td>(345) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(206) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(139) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net operating income </td> <td>$ </td> <td>61,922 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>67,137 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(5,215) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nA total of 119 properties were acquired before January 1, 2019 and represent our same store\u201d properties during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.

a decrease in the weighted average interest rate from 3.90% as of December 31, 2019 to 3.66% as of December 31, 2020.\nLoss on Investment in CIM UII Onshore\nThe increase in loss on investment in CIM UII Onshore of $2.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to the same period in 2019, was due to our investment in limited partnership interests in CIM UII Onshore, for which we recognized our share of CIM UII Onshore's loss of $2.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2020. No such investments were made during the year ended December 31, 2019.\nGain on Disposition of Real Estate, Net\nThe decrease in gain on disposition of real estate, net of $9.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to the same period in 2019 was primarily due to the disposition of five properties during the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to the disposition of 28 properties during the year ended December 31, 2019.\nImpairment\nThe increase in impairment of $10.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to the same period in 2019, was primarily due to management identifying the carrying value of one anchored shopping center and one retail property to be greater than the estimated fair value of the properties, as well as bankruptcies at one anchored shopping center and three retail properties resulting in an impairment charge of $13.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to an impairment charge of $3.1 million relating to one anchored shopping center and five retail properties due to the carrying value being greater than the estimated fair value of the properties during the year ended December 31, 2019.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nThe decrease in depreciation and amortization expenses of $1.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to the same period in 2019, was primarily due to the disposition of five properties during the year ended December 31, 2020 and 28 properties during the year ended December 31, 2019, partially offset by recognizing a full year of depreciation and amortization expenses on four properties acquired during the year ended December 31, 2019.\nTransaction-Related Expenses\nWe reimburse CIM Income NAV Management or its affiliates for transaction-related expenses incurred in the process of acquiring a property, disposing of a property, or the origination or acquisition of a loan, so long as the total expenses relating to the transaction do not exceed 6.0% of the contract purchase price, unless otherwise approved by a majority of our Board, including a majority of our independent directors, as commercially competitive, fair and reasonable to us. Our acquisitions qualify as asset acquisitions, and, as such, certain acquisition costs related to these asset acquisitions are capitalized.\nThe decrease in transaction-related expenses of $507,000 during the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to the same period in 2019, was primarily due to a decrease in advisor reimbursement expenses related to lower acquisition and disposition activity during the year ended December 31, 2020.\nAdvisory Fees and Expenses\nThe advisory fees and expenses that we pay to our advisor are based upon our NAV. Advisory fees and expenses decreased $1.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to the same period in 2019, primarily due to a decrease in our average total NAV for all share classes of $69.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2020.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nThe primary general and administrative expense items are certain expense reimbursements to our advisor, escrow and trustee fees and professional service fees.\nThe decrease in general and administrative expenses of $1.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to the same period in 2019, was primarily due to a decrease in advisor reimbursements due to reduced reimbursable costs.\nNet Operating Income\nSame store property net operating income decreased $3.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to the same period in 2019. The decrease was primarily due to a reduction in rental and other property income for amounts deemed not probable of collection due to three same store tenants declaring bankruptcy.\nNon-same store property net operating income decreased $1.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to the same period in 2019. The decrease is primarily due to the disposition of 28 properties during the year ended\nDecember 31, 2019, partially offset by recognizing a full period of net operating income for the four properties acquired during the year ended December 31, 2019.\nDistributions\nPrior to April 1, 2020, on a quarterly basis, our Board authorized a daily distribution for the succeeding quarter. Our Board authorized the following daily distribution amounts per share for the periods indicated below:\nTable 23: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Period Commencing </td> <td> </td> <td>Period Ending </td> <td> </td> <td>Daily Distribution Amount (1)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>December 8, 2011 </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, 2011 </td> <td> </td> <td>$0.002260274 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>January 1, 2012 </td> <td> </td> <td>September 30, 2012 </td> <td> </td> <td>$0.002254099 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>October 1, 2012 </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, 2012 </td> <td> </td> <td>$0.002383836 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>January 1, 2013 </td> <td> </td> <td>September 30, 2013 </td> <td> </td> <td>$0.002429042 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>October 1, 2013 </td> <td> </td> <td>March 31, 2014 </td> <td> </td> <td>$0.002563727 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>April 1, 2014 </td> <td> </td> <td>March 31, 2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>$0.002678083 </td> </tr>\n</table>\n______________________\n(1)The daily distribution amount for each class of outstanding common stock is adjusted based on the relative NAV of the various classes each day so that, from day to day, distributions constitute a uniform percentage of the NAV per share of all classes. As a result, from day to day, the per share daily distribution for each outstanding class of common stock may be higher or lower than the daily distribution amount authorized by our Board based on the relative NAV of each class of common stock on that day.\nOn April 20, 2020, our Board decided to make a determination as to the amount and timing of distributions on a monthly, instead of a quarterly, basis until such time that we have greater visibility into the impact that the COVID-19 pandemic will have on our tenants' ability to continue to pay rent on their leases on a timely basis or at all, the degree to which federal, state or local governmental authorities grant rent relief or other relief or amnesty programs applicable to our tenants, our ability to access the capital markets, and on the United States and worldwide financial markets and economy. On March 25, 2021, given the relative stability of our rent collections and cash flow projections, our Board determined to declare monthly distributions for the months of March, April, May and June of 2021.\nSince April of 2020, our Board has authorized the following monthly distribution amounts per share for the periods indicated below:\nTable 24: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Record Date </td> <td> </td> <td>Distribution Amount (1)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>April 30, 2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>$0.0400 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>May 31, 2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>$0.0400 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>June 30, 2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>$0.0777 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>July 30, 2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>$0.0777 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>August 28, 2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>$0.0777 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>September 29, 2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>$0.0777 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>October 29, 2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>$0.0777 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>November 27, 2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>$0.0777 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>December 30, 2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>$0.0777 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>January 28, 2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>$0.0777 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>February 25, 2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>$0.0777 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>March 29, 2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>$0.0777 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>April 29 2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>$0.0777 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>May 28, 2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>$0.0777 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>June 29, 2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>$0.0777 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table> ________________\n(1)The distribution amount for each class of outstanding common stock is adjusted based on the relative NAV of the various classes so that distributions constitute a uniform percentage of the NAV per share of all classes for stockholders of record as of the last business day of the month for which the distribution rate applies.\nOn July 23, 2020, our Board authorized a year-end distribution (the Year-End Distribution\u201d) of $0.0839 per share of our D Shares, T Shares, S Shares and I Shares, which amount would be adjusted based on the relative NAV of our D Shares, T Shares, S Shares and I Shares so that distributions constitute a uniform percentage of the NAV per share of all classes. The Year-End Distribution is payable to stockholders of record as of the close of business on December 30, 2020 and was paid in January 2021 upon a determination by our chief financial officer that as of the payment date of the Year-End Distribution, we were able to pay our debts as they become due in the usual course of business and our assets were not less than the sum of our total liabilities. The Year-End Distribution was paid in cash or reinvested in shares of our common stock for stockholders participating in our distribution reinvestment plan. The Year-End Distribution was paid in addition to the distribution authorized by our Board for the month of December 2020.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had distributions payable of $4.9 million, which is included in distributions and redemptions payable on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.\nThe following table presents distributions and the source of distributions for the periods indicated below (dollars amounts in thousands): Table 25: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Amount </td> <td> </td> <td>Percent </td> <td> </td> <td>Amount </td> <td> </td> <td>Percent </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Distributions paid in cash\n</td> <td>$ </td> <td>14,646 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>53 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>16,816 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>51 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Distributions reinvested </td> <td>13,108 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>47 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>16,201 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>49 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total distributions </td> <td>$ </td> <td>27,754 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>33,017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Source of distributions: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by operating activities (1)\n</td> <td>$ </td> <td>27,754 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>33,017 </td> <td> </td> <td>(2) </td> <td>100 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total sources </td> <td>$ </td> <td>27,754 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>33,017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table> ______________________\n(1)Net cash provided by operating activities for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 was $32.0 million and $32.5 million, respectively.\n(2)Our Distributions for the year ended December 31, 2019 were fully covered by cash flows from operating activities, including cash flows from prior periods of $471,000.\nShare Redemptions\nEffective April 1, 2020, we have adopted the Amended Share Redemption Program to provide limited liquidity whereby, on a monthly basis, stockholders may request that we redeem all or any portion of their shares. Our Amended Share Redemption Program provides that, no later than on the second to last business day of a given month, stockholders may request that we redeem all or any portion of their shares, subject to a minimum redemption amount and certain short-term trading fees. The redemption price per share for each class will be our NAV per share for such class for that month, calculated by the independent fund accountant in accordance with our valuation policies. Prior to April 1, 2020, our share redemption plan provided limited liquidity whereby, on a daily basis, stockholders could request that we redeem all or any portion of their shares.\nOur Amended Share Redemption Program includes certain redemption limits, including a quarterly limit and, in some cases, an individual stockholder limit. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we received redemption requests of approximately 11.3 million shares of our common stock for $188.4 million in excess of our redemption limit. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we received valid redemption requests under our Amended Share Redemption Program totaling approximately 16.8 million shares, of which we redeemed approximately 5.4 million shares as of December 31, 2020 for $93.6 million at an average redemption price of $17.31 per share and 126,000 shares subsequent to December 31, 2020 for $2.1 million at an average redemption price of $16.67. The remaining redemption requests relating to approximately 11.3 million shares went unfulfilled. A valid redemption request is one that complies with the applicable requirements and guidelines of our current share redemption program then in effect. See Note 14 -Stockholders' Equity to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional terms of the share redemption program, including the share redemption plan limits.\nAs of July 2020, the Board determined that monthly redemptions temporarily will be limited to shares whose aggregate value is no more than 0.8% of our aggregate NAV as of the last calendar day of the previous calendar month, and in any calendar quarter, redemptions will be limited to shares whose aggregate value is no more than 2.0% of our aggregate NAV as of the last calendar day of the previous calendar quarter. While no assurances can be made regarding the timing of a return to the\nredemption plan limits stated in our existing share redemption plan, if at all, we are targeting the return to our limits under the Amended Share Redemption Program to occur in the third quarter of 2021. We intend to fund share redemptions with available cash, proceeds from our liquid investments and proceeds from the sale of additional shares. We may, after taking the interests of our Company as a whole and the interests of our remaining stockholders into consideration, use proceeds from any available sources at our disposal to satisfy redemption requests, including, but not limited to, proceeds from sales of additional shares, excess cash flow from operations, sales of our liquid investments, incurrence of indebtedness and, if necessary, proceeds from the disposition of real estate properties or real estate related assets. In an effort to have adequate cash available to support our share redemption plan, CIM Income NAV Management may determine to reserve borrowing capacity under our line of credit. CIM Income NAV Management could then elect to borrow against our line of credit in part to redeem shares presented for redemption during periods when we do not have sufficient proceeds from the sale of shares in the Offering to fund all redemption requests. See the discussion of our share redemption program in Part II, Item 5. Market for Registrant's Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities - Share Redemption Program in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nGeneral\nOur credit facility with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. as administrative agent ( JPMorgan Chase\u201d), provides for borrowings up to $425.0 million, which is comprised of up to $212.5 million in unsecured revolving loans (the Revolving Loans\u201d) and $212.5 million in unsecured term loans (the Term Loans\u201d), collectively, the credit facility (the Credit Facility\u201d). As of December 31, 2020, we had $103.5 million in unused capacity, subject to borrowing availability. We had $32.6 million of available borrowings as of December 31, 2020. As of December 31, 2020, we had cash and cash equivalents of $8.8 million and investments in marketable securities of $15.5 million.\nWe expect to meet our short-term liquidity requirements through available cash, cash provided by property operations, proceeds from the Offering and borrowings from the Credit Facility or other sources. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we borrowed $52.0 million on the Revolving Loans to increase cash liquidity. Additionally, given the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, our Board has decided to make a determination as to the amount and timing of distributions on a monthly, instead of a quarterly, basis until such time that we have greater visibility into the impact that the COVID-19 pandemic will have on our tenants' ability to continue to pay rent on their leases on a timely basis or at all, the degree to which federal, state or local governmental authorities grant rent relief or other relief or amnesty programs applicable to our tenants, our ability to access the capital markets, and on the United States and worldwide financial markets and economy. As of December 31, 2020, we believe we were in compliance with the financial covenants under our various fixed and variable rate debt agreements. During the quarter ended, September 30, 2020, the unsecured debt to unencumbered asset value ratio was 60.8%, which exceeded the 60% maximum permitted under the Second Amended Credit Agreement. Since September 30, 2020, we have taken action so that the unsecured debt to unencumbered asset value ratio was within the requirements of the Second Amended Credit Agreement. During the fourth quarter of 2020 the Company received a waiver from the administrative agent, related to the September 30, 2020, affected financial covenant.\nWe expect to continue to raise capital through the Offering and to utilize such funds and future proceeds from secured or unsecured financing to complete future property acquisitions, other permitted investments and for general corporate uses. The source of our operating cash flows is primarily the rental and other property income received from current and future leased properties. As of December 31, 2020, we had raised $878.2 million of gross proceeds from the Offering before organization and offering costs, upfront selling commissions, dealer manager fees and the current portion of stockholder servicing fees of $32.7 million. Refer to Item 1A - Risk Factors for risks related to our ability to raise capital in the near term.\nOur investment guidelines provide that we will seek to maintain our Target Liquidity in relatively liquid investments, such as U.S. government securities, agency securities, corporate debt, publicly traded debt and equity real estate-related securities, cash, cash equivalents and other short-term investments and, in CIM Income NAV Management's discretion, lines of credit (collectively, the Liquid Assets\u201d). To the extent that CIM Income NAV Management determines that we should maintain borrowing capacity under lines of credit, the amount available under the lines of credit will be included in calculating the Liquid Assets under these guidelines. These are guidelines, and our stockholders should not expect that we will, at all times, hold liquid assets at or above the target levels or that all liquid assets will be available to satisfy redemption requests as we receive them. We anticipate that both our overall allocation to liquid assets as a percentage of our NAV and our allocation to different types of liquid assets will vary. In making these determinations, our advisor will consider our receipt of proceeds from sales of additional shares, our cash flow from operations, available borrowing capacity under lines of credit, if any, or from additional mortgages on our real estate, our receipt of proceeds from sales of assets, and the anticipated use of cash to fund redemptions, as well as the availability and pricing of different investments. The amount of the Liquid Assets is determined by our advisor, in its sole discretion, but is subject to review by our independent directors on a quarterly basis.\nGiven the recent levels of investor subscriptions and increased redemption requests, which we believe has been exacerbated by the challenging economic environment caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, our stated objectives of maintaining Target Liquidity and satisfying the redemption plan limits are in conflict. As such, we are temporarily redeeming less than the Amended Share Redemption Program limits to maintain the Target Liquidity while we seek to generate additional liquidity through investor subscriptions and execution of an in-process asset disposition program. On August 30, 2020, our Board determined that, effective immediately, monthly redemptions temporarily will be limited to shares whose aggregate value is no more than 0.8% of the aggregate NAV as of the last calendar day of the previous calendar month, and in any calendar quarter, redemptions will be limited to shares whose aggregate value is no more than 2.0% of the aggregate NAV as of the last calendar day of the previous calendar quarter. While no assurances can be made regarding the timing of a return to the Redemption Pan Limits stated in our existing share redemption plan, if at all, we are targeting the return to our limits under the Amended Share Redemption Program to occur in the third quarter of 2021.\nFurther, in support of our efforts to achieve sustainable liquidity, our Board has further agreed to support our efforts towards achieving sustainable liquidity by agreeing to take 50% of their quarterly Board compensation in common stock, based on the then current NAV per share at the time of issuance, for the third quarter of 2020 through the second quarter of 2021. In addition, our Advisor has determined to take 50% of its monthly advisory fees in common stock, based on the then current NAV per share at the time of issuance, through June 30, 2021.\nShort-term Liquidity and Capital Resources\nOn a short-term basis, our principal demands for funds will be for property acquisitions or other permitted investments, operating expenses, distributions and redemptions to stockholders and interest on our outstanding debt, including principal repayments of $129.4 million due within the next 12 months. Pursuant to the Credit Facility, we may elect to extend the maturity date of such loans for up to two successive six-month periods, subject to satisfying certain conditions, including providing notice of the election and paying an extension fee of 0.10% of the maximum amount of the Revolving Loans (the Extension Fee\u201d). We expect to extend the maturity date of the Revolving Loans through September 6, 2022, subject to payment of the Extension Fee. We expect to meet our short-term liquidity requirements through available cash, cash provided by property operations, proceeds from the Offering and borrowings from the Credit Facility or other sources, such as proceeds from dispositions.\nWe believe that the resources stated above will be sufficient to satisfy our operating requirements for the foreseeable future, and we do not anticipate a need to raise funds from sources other than those described above within the next 12 months.\nLong-term Liquidity and Capital Resources\nOn a long-term basis, our principal demands for funds are for property acquisitions or other permitted investments and the payment of tenant improvements, operating expenses, including debt service payments on any outstanding indebtedness, and distributions and redemptions to our stockholders. We expect to meet our long-term liquidity requirements through proceeds from the Offering, secured or unsecured financings from banks and other lenders, any available capacity on the Credit Facility by the addition of properties to the borrowing base, proceeds from the sale of marketable securities, proceeds from dispositions and net cash flows provided by operations.\nWe expect that substantially all net cash flows from operations will be used to pay distributions to our stockholders after certain capital expenditures, including tenant improvements and leasing commissions, are paid; however, we have used, and may continue to use, other sources to fund distributions, as necessary, including proceeds from the Offering, borrowings on the Credit Facility and/or future borrowings on our unencumbered assets. To the extent that cash flows from operations are lower due to fewer properties being acquired or lower than expected returns on the properties, distributions paid to our stockholders may be lower. We expect that substantially all net cash flows from the Offering or debt financings will be used to fund acquisitions, certain capital expenditures, repayments of outstanding debt or distributions and redemptions to our stockholders.\nContractual Obligations\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had debt outstanding with a carrying value of $450.7 million and a weighted average interest rate of 3.66%. See Note 9 - Credit Facility and Notes Payable to our consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a description of certain terms of the debt.\nOur contractual obligations as of December 31, 2020 were as follows (in thousands):\nTable 26: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Payments due by period (1)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>Less Than 1\nYear </td> <td> </td> <td>1-3 Years </td> <td> </td> <td>3-5 Years </td> <td> </td> <td>More Than\n5 Years </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Principal payments - credit facility(2)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>321,500 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>109,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>212,500 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest payments - credit facility(3)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>16,797 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10,661 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,136 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Principal payments - fixed debt rate </td> <td> </td> <td>129,219 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>20,442 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>91,827 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16,950 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest payments - fixed debt rate(4)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>8,685 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,937 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,981 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>767 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>476,201 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>145,040 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>313,444 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>17,717 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table> ____________________________________\n(1)The table does not include amounts due to our advisor or its affiliates pursuant to our advisory agreement because such amounts are not fixed and determinable.\n(2)The table does not include the impact of any extension. We may elect to extend the maturity of the Revolving Loans to no later than September 6, 2022, subject to satisfying certain conditions contained in the second amended credit agreement, or refinance the debt or enter into the new financing arrangement.\n(3)As of December 31, 2020, the Term Loans outstanding totaled $212.5 million, all of which are subject to interest rate swap agreements. The weighted average all-in interest rate for the Swapped Terms Loans was 4.25%. The remaining $109.0 million in Revolving Loans outstanding under the Credit Facility has a weighted average interest rate of 2.20% as of December 31, 2020.\n(4)As of December 31, 2020, we had $69.0 million of variable rate mortgage notes effectively fixed through the use of interest rate swap agreements. We used the effective interest rates fixed under our interest rate swap agreements to calculate the debt payment obligations in future periods.\nOur charter prohibits us from incurring debt that would cause our borrowings to exceed 75% of our gross assets, valued at the aggregate cost (before depreciation and other non-cash reserves), unless approved by a majority of our independent directors and disclosed to our stockholders in our next quarterly report. In addition to this limitation in our charter, our Board has adopted a policy to further limit our borrowings to 60% of the greater of cost (before depreciation or other non-cash reserves) or fair market value of our gross assets, unless excess borrowing is approved by a majority of our Board (including a majority of the independent directors) and disclosed to our stockholders in the next quarterly report along with a justification for such excess borrowing. As of December 31, 2020, our ratio of debt to total gross assets net of gross intangible lease liabilities was 49.6%, and our ratio of debt to the fair market value of our gross assets net of gross intangible lease liabilities was 50.9%. Fair market value is based on the estimated market value of our real estate assets as of December 31, 2020 used to determine our estimated per share NAV.\nOur management reviews net debt as part of its management of our overall liquidity, financial flexibility, capital structure and leverage, and we therefore believe that the presentation of net debt provides useful information to stockholders. Net debt is a non-GAAP measure used to show our outstanding principal debt balance, excluding certain GAAP adjustments, such as financing and issuance costs and related accumulated amortization, less all cash and cash equivalents. As of December 31, 2020, our net debt leverage ratio, which is the ratio of net debt to total gross real estate assets net of gross intangible lease liabilities, was 48.6%.\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of the Credit Facility and notes payable, net balance, as reported on our consolidated balance sheet, to net debt as of December 31, 2020 (dollar amounts in thousands): Table 27: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Balance as of December 31, 2020 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Credit facility and notes payable, net </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>449,378 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Deferred costs, net (1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>1,341 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less: Cash and cash equivalents </td> <td> </td> <td>(8,805) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net debt </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>441,914 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross real estate assets, net (2) and investment in CIM UII Onshore\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>909,493 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net debt leverage ratio </td> <td> </td> <td>48.6 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table> ____________________________\n(1)Deferred costs relate to mortgage notes payable and the term portion of the Credit Facility.\n(2)Net of gross intangible lease liabilities.\nCash Flow Analysis\nYear Ended December 31, 2020 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2019\nOperating Activities. Net cash provided by operating activities decreased by $573,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to the same period in 2019. The decrease was primarily due to the timing of payments of accrued expenses and accounts payable, and amounts payable to affiliates during the year ended December 31, 2020. See - Results of Operations\u201d for a more complete discussion of the factors impacting our operating performance.\nInvesting Activities. Net cash used in investing activities increased by $32.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to the same period in 2019, primarily due to our investment in CIM UII Onshore for $50.0 million, partially offset by an increase in net proceeds from real estate-related activity and from investments in marketable securities.\nFinancing Activities. Net cash provided by financing activities was $7.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to net cash used in financing activities of $27.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase of net cash provided by financing activities of $35.0 million was primarily due to an increase in net proceeds from borrowing facilities of $105.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to the same period in 2019, as well as a decrease in distributions to stockholders of $2.2 million, partially offset by a decrease in net proceeds from the issuance of common stock of $72.8 million.\nElection as a REIT\nWe have elected to be taxed, and currently qualify, as a REIT under the Code. To maintain our qualification as a REIT, we must continue to meet certain requirements relating to our organization, sources of income, nature of assets, distributions of income to our stockholders and recordkeeping. As a REIT, we generally are not subject to federal income tax on taxable income that we distribute to our stockholders so long as we distribute at least 90% of our annual taxable income (computed without regard to the dividends paid deduction and excluding certain non-cash items and net capital gains).\nIf we fail to maintain our qualification as a REIT for any reason in a taxable year and applicable relief provisions do not apply, we will be subject to tax on our taxable income at regular corporate rates. We will not be able to deduct distributions paid to our stockholders in any year in which we fail to maintain our qualification as a REIT. We also will be disqualified for the four taxable years following the year during which qualification was lost unless we are entitled to relief under specific statutory provisions. Such an event could materially adversely affect our net income and net cash available for distribution to stockholders. However, we believe that we are organized and operate in such a manner as to maintain our qualification as a REIT for federal income tax purposes. No provision for federal income taxes has been made in our accompanying consolidated financial statements. We are subject to certain state and local taxes related to the operations of properties in certain locations, which, if applicable, have been provided for in our accompanying consolidated financial statements.\nInflation\nWe are exposed to inflation risk as income from long-term leases is the primary source of our cash flows from operations. There are, and we expect that there will continue to be, provisions in many of our tenant leases that are intended to protect us from, and mitigate the risk of, the impact of inflation. These provisions include rent steps and clauses enabling us to receive payment of additional rent calculated as a percentage of the tenant's gross sales above pre-determined thresholds. In addition, most of our leases require the tenant to pay all or a majority of the property's operating expenses, including real estate taxes, special assessments and sales and use taxes, utilities, insurance and building repairs. However, due to the long-term nature of leases for real property, such leases may not reset frequently enough to adequately offset the effects of inflation.\nRelated-Party Transactions and Agreements\nWe have entered into agreements with CIM Income NAV Management or its affiliates, whereby we agree to pay certain fees, or reimburse certain expenses of, CIM Income NAV Management or its affiliates, primarily advisory and performance fees and expenses, organization and offering costs, sales commissions, dealer manager fees and expenses, ongoing stockholder servicing fees, and reimbursement of certain acquisition and operating costs. In addition, the Company purchased $50.0 million of limited partnership interests of CIM UII Onshore, which is affiliated with CIM. See Note 12 - Related-Party Transactions and Agreements to our consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a further explanation of the various related-party transactions, agreements and fees.\nConflicts of Interest\nRichard S. Ressler, the chairman of our Board, chief executive officer and president, who is also a founder and principal of CIM and is an officer/director of certain of its affiliates including CIM Income NAV Management, is the chairman of the board, chief executive officer and president of CMFT and vice president of our advisor. One of our directors, Avraham Shemesh, who is also a founder and principal of CIM and is an officer/director of certain of its affiliates including CIM Income NAV Management, serves as a director of CMFT. One of our directors, Elaine Y. Wong, who is also a principal of CIM, serves as a director of CMFT. One of our independent directors, W. Brian Kretzmer, also serves as an independent director of CMFT. Our chief financial officer and treasurer, Nathan D. DeBacker, who is also an officer of other real estate programs sponsored by CCO Group, is a vice president of CIM Income NAV Management and is an officer of certain of its affiliates. As such, there are conflicts of interest where CIM Income NAV Management or its affiliates, while serving in the capacity as sponsor, general partner, officer, director, key personnel and/or advisor for CIM or another real estate program sponsored or operated by CIM or CCO Group, including other real estate offerings in registration, may be in conflict with us in connection with providing services to other real estate-related programs related to property acquisitions, property dispositions, and property management among others. The compensation arrangements between affiliates of CIM Income NAV Management and these other real estate programs sponsored or operated by CCO Group could influence the advice provided to us. See Part I, Item 1. Business - Conflicts of Interest of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs of December 31, 2020 and 2019, we had no material off-balance sheet arrangements that had or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity or capital resources.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Significant Accounting Estimates\nOur accounting policies have been established to conform with GAAP. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to use judgment in the application of accounting policies, including making estimates and assumptions. These judgments affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. Management believes that we have made these estimates and assumptions in an appropriate manner and in a way that accurately reflects our financial condition. We continually test and evaluate these estimates and assumptions using our historical knowledge of the business, as well as other factors, to ensure that they are reasonable for reporting purposes. However, actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions. If our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions had been different, it is possible that different accounting policies would have been applied, thus resulting in a different presentation of the financial statements. Additionally, other companies may utilize different estimates that may impact comparability of our results of operations to those of companies in similar businesses. We believe the following critical accounting policies govern the significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements, which should be read in conjunction with the more complete discussion of our accounting policies and procedures included in Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to our consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nRecoverability of Real Estate Assets\nWe acquire real estate assets and subsequently monitor those assets quarterly for impairment, including the review of real estate properties subject to direct financing leases, if applicable. Additionally, we record depreciation and amortization related to our assets. The risks and uncertainties involved in applying the principles related to real estate assets include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\u2022The estimated useful lives of our depreciable assets affects the amount of depreciation and amortization recognized on our assets;\n\u2022The review of impairment indicators and subsequent determination of the undiscounted future cash flows could require us to reduce the carrying value of assets held and used to a fair value estimated by management and recognize an impairment loss. The process for evaluating real estate impairment requires management to make significant assumptions related to certain inputs, including holding periods;\n\u2022The fair value of held for sale assets is estimated by management. This estimated value could result in a reduction of the carrying value of the asset; and\n\u2022Changes in assumptions based on actual results may have a material impact on our financial results.\nAllocation of Purchase Price of Real Estate Assets\nIn connection with our acquisition of properties, we allocate the purchase price to the tangible and intangible assets and liabilities acquired based on their respective relative fair values. Tangible assets consist of land, buildings, and tenant improvements. Intangible assets consist of above- and below-market lease values and the value of in-place leases. Our purchase price allocations are developed utilizing third-party appraisal reports, industry standards and management experience. The risks and uncertainties involved in applying the principles related to purchase price allocations include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\u2022The value allocated to land, as opposed to buildings and tenant improvements, affects the amount of depreciation expense we record. If more value is attributed to land, depreciation expense is lower than if more value is attributed to buildings and tenant improvements;\n\u2022Intangible lease assets and liabilities can be significantly affected by estimates including market rent, lease term including renewal options at rental rates below estimated market rental rates, carrying costs of the property during a hypothetical expected lease-up period, and current market conditions and costs, including tenant improvement allowances and rent concessions; and\n\u2022We determine whether any financing assumed is above- or below-market based upon comparison to similar financing terms for similar types of debt financing with similar maturities.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nRecently issued accounting pronouncements are described in Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to our consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.", "summary": "- This is a detailed financial report generated by the property management software for a commercial property with several tenants in 2023.\n- The report divides the property into several categories based on the type of store, such as AAA, All Other, Discount Store, and Office.\n- For each category, the report shows the rental income for 2020 and the percentage of the rental income that each tenant contributes in 2020.\n- The report then provides projections for rental income in 2023 to 2030 based on the historical data from 2020 to 2022, as well as the estimated percentage of rental income that each tenant is expected to contribute in those years.\n- The report also includes a summary of the rental income and the percentage of rental income that each tenant is expected to contribute in the given period.\n- Finally, the report provides a break-even analysis, which shows the minimum rental income required to cover all expenses, and the rental income at which the property starts generating profits. \n\nIs there anything else I can help you extract from this report?", "item_7_tables": "Table 13: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our accompanying consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto. See also the Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements section preceding Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. For a comparison of the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, see Item 7 - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nOverview\nWe were formed on July 27, 2010, to acquire and operate a diversified portfolio of commercial properties in the retail, office and industrial sectors that are leased to creditworthy tenants under long-term net leases, and are strategically located throughout the United States, and U.S. government securities, agency securities, corporate debt and other investments for which there is reasonable liquidity. We expect to complement our portfolio of net-lease properties by investing in substantially leased core metropolitan commercial and multi-family properties with growth potential that we believe will help us meet our investment objectives, either directly or through other funds with a proven track record of performance in these investment types, including funds managed by affiliates of our advisor. We commenced our principal operations on December 7, 2011, when we issued the initial $10.0 million in shares of our common stock in the Offering and acquired our first real estate property. When we refer to our share classes in this Annual Report on Form 10-K with respect to dates prior to the Restructure Date, we are referring to our shares under our prior share structure, and when we refer to our share classes in this Annual Report on Form 10-K with respect to dates on or after the Restructure Date, we are referring to our shares under our new share structure. We have no paid employees and are externally advised and managed by CIM Income NAV Management.\nAs we acquire additional commercial real estate, we will be subject to changes in real estate prices and changes in interest rates on any current variable rate debt, refinancings or new indebtedness used to acquire the properties. We may manage our risk of changes in real estate prices on future property acquisitions, when applicable, by entering into purchase agreements and loan commitments simultaneously, or through loan assumptions, so that our operating yield is determinable at the time we enter into a purchase agreement, by contracting with developers for future delivery of properties, or by entering into sale-leaseback transactions. We manage our interest rate risk by monitoring the interest rate environment in connection with our future property acquisitions, when applicable, or upcoming debt maturities to determine the appropriate financing or refinancing terms, which may include fixed rate loans, variable rate loans or interest rate hedges. If we are unable to acquire suitable properties or obtain suitable financing terms for future acquisitions or refinancing, our results of operations may be adversely affected.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we owned 123 properties located in 34 states, comprising 5.3 million rentable square feet of commercial space, which includes the rentable square feet of buildings on land subject to ground leases. Our operating results and cash flows are primarily influenced by rental income from our commercial properties and interest expense on our property indebtedness and acquisition and operating expenses. As 98.1% of our rentable square feet was under lease as of December 31, 2020, with a weighted average remaining lease term of 9.8 years, we believe our exposure to changes in commercial rental rates on our portfolio is substantially mitigated, except for vacancies caused by tenant bankruptcies or other factors, including due to circumstances related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Our advisor regularly monitors the creditworthiness of our tenants by reviewing each tenant's financial results, any available credit rating agency reports on the tenant or guarantor, the operating history of the property with such tenant, the tenant's market share and track record within its industry segment, the general health and outlook of the tenant's industry segment, and other information for changes and possible trends. If our advisor identifies significant changes or trends that may adversely affect the creditworthiness of a tenant, it will gather a more in-depth knowledge of the tenant's financial condition and, if necessary, attempt to mitigate the tenant credit risk by evaluating the possible sale of the property, or identifying a possible replacement tenant should the current tenant fail to perform on the lease.\nEffective April 1, 2020, we modified our Offering and certain other features of our Company from a daily to a monthly NAV REIT. We believe this change will result in greater access to capital to execute on our investment strategy, which will help us to better achieve our investment objectives by driving growth and diversification within the portfolio, creating a stronger balance sheet and enhancing liquidity for the benefit of all stockholders.\nAs part of the change from a daily to a monthly NAV REIT, our Board approved, among other things: (1) a change in the frequency of our NAV calculations from daily to monthly and certain other related changes to our valuation policies; and (2) adopted an amended share redemption program that provides for redemptions on a monthly basis. As a monthly NAV REIT, we\nexpect that investors' subscriptions will be accepted on the first day of each month and the purchase price of each class of shares would generally equal the prior month's NAV for that class divided by the number of shares of such class outstanding, as determined monthly, plus applicable selling commissions and dealer manager fees.\nCOVID-19\nThe COVID-19 outbreak and the associated shelter-in-place\u201d or stay-at-home\u201d orders or other quarantine mandates or public health guidance issued by local, state or federal authorities has adversely affected a number of our tenants' businesses. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic continues to impact our operations and those of our tenants will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence, including the scope, severity and duration of the pandemic, the actions taken to contain the pandemic or mitigate its impact, and the direct and indirect economic effects of the pandemic and containment measures, among others.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, we provided lease concessions, either in the form of rent deferrals or abatements, to certain tenants in response to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on those tenants. As of December 31, 2020, we granted rent deferrals with an aggregate deferral amount of $539,000. Additionally, as of December 31, 2020, we granted rent abatements to tenants with an aggregate abatement amount of $618,000, which reduced revenues during the year ended December 31, 2020.\nAs of March 24, 2021, we have collected approximately 99% of rental payments billed to tenants during the three months ended December 31, 2020. There have been no significant changes in rent collections subsequent to December 31, 2020.\nWe are actively managing our response to the COVID-19 pandemic in collaboration with our tenants and business partners and are assessing potential impacts to our financial position and operating results, as well as potential adverse developments in our business. In order to manage the financial health of the Company, our Board is making its determinations with respect to the declaration of distributions on a monthly, instead of quarterly basis and has approved and adopted an amended and restated share redemption program (the Amended Share Redemption Program\u201d) that, among other changes, provides that the Amended Share Redemption Program may be suspended at any time by majority vote of the Board without prior notice if the Board believes such action is in the best interest of the Company and its stockholders. Given the recent levels of investor subscriptions and increased redemption requests, which we believe has been exacerbated by the challenging economic environment caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, our stated objectives of maintaining target liquidity of 10% of the NAV up to $1 billion, and 5% of the NAV in excess of $1 billion ( Target Liquidity\u201d) and satisfying the redemption plan limits are in conflict. As such, the Company is temporarily redeeming less than the Amended Share Redemption Program limits to maintain this Target Liquidity while the Company seeks to generate additional liquidity through investor subscriptions and execution of an in-process asset disposition program. On August 30, 2020, our Board determined that, effective immediately, monthly redemptions temporarily will be limited to shares whose aggregate value is no more than 0.8% of the aggregate NAV as of the last calendar day of the previous calendar month, and in any calendar quarter, redemptions will be limited to shares whose aggregate value is no more than 2.0% of the aggregate NAV as of the last calendar day of the previous calendar quarter. While no assurances can be made regarding the timing of a return to the redemption plan limits stated in the Company's Amended Share Redemption Program, if at all, the Company is currently targeting the return to the limits under the Amended Share Redemption Program to occur in the third quarter of 2021. Further, in support of our efforts to achieve sustainable liquidity, our Board determined that 50% of the independent directors' quarterly compensation payments for the third quarter of 2020 through the second quarter of 2021 will be paid in the form of D Shares based on the then current NAV per share at the time of issuance. In addition, our Advisor agreed to take 50% of the monthly advisory fee payment from August 2020 through June 30, 2021 in I Shares based on the then current NAV per share of such shares at the time of issuance. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we borrowed $52.0 million in revolving loans in order to increase liquidity during this period of economic uncertainty. See - Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d for a more complete discussion of our financial resources.\nWe further engaged our independent valuation expert, pursuant to an agreement dated May 14, 2020, to provide valuation services on a monthly, instead of a rolling annual, basis, until such time that we had greater visibility into the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our properties' valuations. Given the relative stability of the month-over-month valuation of our real estate assets, our liabilities and our rent collections our Board determined that it is in the best interests of us and our stockholders to cease incurring the additional costs associated with the monthly valuations and to return to valuing our real estate portfolio on a rolling annual basis in accordance with our valuation policies effective September 30, 2020. For further information regarding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company, see Part I, Item 1A titled Risk Factors.\u201d\nOperating Highlights and Key Performance Indicators\n2020 Activity\n\u2022Disposed of five properties, consisting of three retail properties and two anchored shopping centers, for an aggregate gross sales price of $16.8 million.\n\u2022Increased total debt by $99.7 million to $450.7 million, with cash proceeds utilized primarily for investment and redemptions.\n\u2022Invested $50 million of limited partnership interests in CIM UII Onshore.\nPortfolio Information\nReal Estate Portfolio\nAs of December 31, 2020, we owned 123 commercial properties located in 34 states, comprising 5.3 million rentable square feet, which includes the rentable square feet of buildings on land subject to ground leases. As of December 31, 2020, these properties were 98.1% leased (including any month-to-month agreements) with a weighted average remaining lease term of 9.8 years.\nThe following table shows the property statistics of our real estate assets as of December 31, 2020 and 2019: \n____________________________________\n(1)Includes square feet of buildings on land that are subject to ground leases.\n(2)Investment-grade tenants are those with a credit rating of BBB- or higher by Standard & Poor's or a credit rating of Baa3 or higher by Moody's. The ratings may reflect those assigned by Standard & Poor's or Moody's to the lease guarantor or the parent company, as applicable. The weighted average credit rating is weighted based on annualized rental income, and is for only those tenants rated by Standard & Poor's.\nThe following table summarizes our real estate acquisition activity during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019:  __________________________________\n(1)Includes square feet of buildings on land that are subject to ground leases.\nThe following table shows the tenant diversification of our real estate portfolio, based on annualized rental income, as of December 31, 2020: \n____________________________________\n(1)Includes leases which are master lease agreements.\n(2)Includes square feet of buildings on land that is subject to ground leases.\nThe following table shows the tenant industry diversification of our real estate portfolio, based on annualized rental income as of December 31, 2020:\n\n____________________________________\n(1)Includes leases which are master lease agreements.\n(2)Includes square feet of buildings on land that is subject to ground leases.\nThe following table shows the geographic diversification of our real estate portfolio, based on annualized rental income, as of December 31, 2020: \n____________________________________\n(1)Includes square feet of buildings on land that is subject to ground leases.\nThe following table shows the property type diversification of our real estate portfolio, based on annualized rental income, as of December 31, 2020:\n\n____________________________________\n(1)Includes square feet of buildings on land parcels subject to ground leases.\nLeases\nAlthough there are variations in the specific terms of the leases of our properties, the following is a summary of the general structure of our current leases. Generally, the leases of the properties acquired provide for initial terms of ten or more years, and provide the tenant with one or more multi-year renewal options, subject to generally the same terms and conditions as the initial lease term. Certain leases also provide that in the event we wish to sell the property subject to that lease, we first must offer the lessee the right to purchase the property on the same terms and conditions as any offer which we intend to accept for the sale of the property. The properties are generally leased under net leases pursuant to which the tenant bears responsibility for substantially all property costs and expenses associated with ongoing maintenance and operation, including utilities, property taxes and insurance, while certain of the leases require us to maintain the roof, structure and parking areas of the building. Additionally, certain leases provide for increases in rent as a result of fixed increases, increases in the consumer price index, and/or increases in the tenant's sales volume.\nOur leases, as of December 31, 2020, provided for annual base rental payments (payable in monthly installments) ranging from $12,000 to $3.3 million, and had an average annual base rental payment of $437,000, with a weighted average remaining lease term of 9.8 years.\nThe following table shows lease expirations of our real estate portfolio as of December 31, 2020, during each of the next ten years and thereafter, assuming no exercise of renewal options: \n____________________________________\n* Represents less than 1% of the total annual base rent.\n(1)Includes leases which are master lease agreements.\n(2)Includes square feet of buildings on land that is subject to ground leases.\nThe following table shows the economic metrics of our real estate assets as of and for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019:\n\n____________________________________\n(1)Based on annualized rental income of our real estate portfolio as of the respective reporting date.\n(2)Through the end of the next five years as of the respective reporting date.\nResults of Operations\nOverview\nWe are not aware of any material trends or uncertainties, other than the effects of the recent outbreak of COVID-19, and national economic conditions affecting real estate in general, that may reasonably be expected to have a material impact on our results from the acquisition, management and operations of properties other than those listed in Part I, Item 1A - Risk Factors. Currently, we are unable to predict the impact that the COVID-19 pandemic will have on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows in future periods due to numerous uncertainties.\nFor a comparison of the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, see Item 7 - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nSame Store Analysis\nOur results of operations are influenced by the timing of acquisitions and the operating performance of our real estate assets. We review our stabilized operating results, measured by net operating income ( NOI\u201d), from properties that we owned for the entirety of both the current and prior year reporting periods, referred to as same store\u201d properties, and we believe that the presentation of operating results for same store properties provides useful information to stockholders. NOI is a supplemental non-GAAP financial measure of a real estate company's operating performance. NOI is considered by\nmanagement to be a helpful supplemental performance measure, as it enables management to evaluate the impact of occupancy, rents, leasing activity, and other controllable property operating results at our real estate properties, and it provides a consistent method for the comparison of our properties. We define NOI as operating revenues less operating expenses, which exclude (i) depreciation and amortization, (ii) interest expense and other non-property related revenue and expense items such as (a) general and administrative expenses, (b) advisory fees and expenses, (c) transaction-related expenses (d) real estate impairment (e) gain on disposition or real estate, net and (f) income from marketable securities. Our NOI may not be comparable to that of other REITs and should not be considered to be more relevant or accurate in evaluating our operating performance than the current GAAP methodology used in calculating net income. In determining the same store property pool, we include all properties that were owned for the entirety of both the current and prior reporting periods, except for properties during the current or prior year that were under development or redevelopment.\nComparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2020 and 2019\nThe following table reconciles net income, calculated in accordance with GAAP, to net operating income (dollar amounts in thousands): \nA total of 119 properties were acquired before January 1, 2019 and represent our same store\u201d properties during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. Non-same store\u201d properties, for purposes of the table below, includes properties acquired and disposed on or after January 1, 2019. The following table details the components of net operating income broken out between same store and non-same store properties (dollar amounts in thousands): \nInterest Expense and Other, Net\nThe increase in interest expense and other, net, of $2.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to the same period in 2019, was primarily due to an increase of $90.6 million in our average outstanding debt balance for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, partially offset by a decrease in the weighted average interest rate from 3.90% as of December 31, 2019 to 3.66% as of December 31, 2020.\nLoss on Investment in CIM UII Onshore\nThe increase in loss on investment in CIM UII Onshore of $2.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to the same period in 2019, was due to our investment in limited partnership interests in CIM UII Onshore, for which we recognized our share of CIM UII Onshore's loss of $2.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2020. No such investments were made during the year ended December 31, 2019.\nGain on Disposition of Real Estate, Net\nThe decrease in gain on disposition of real estate, net of $9.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to the same period in 2019 was primarily due to the disposition of five properties during the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to the disposition of 28 properties during the year ended December 31, 2019.\nImpairment\nThe increase in impairment of $10.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to the same period in 2019, was primarily due to management identifying the carrying value of one anchored shopping center and one retail property to be greater than the estimated fair value of the properties, as well as bankruptcies at one anchored shopping center and three retail properties resulting in an impairment charge of $13.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to an impairment charge of $3.1 million relating to one anchored shopping center and five retail properties due to the carrying value being greater than the estimated fair value of the properties during the year ended December 31, 2019.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nThe decrease in depreciation and amortization expenses of $1.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to the same period in 2019, was primarily due to the disposition of five properties during the year ended December 31, 2020 and 28 properties during the year ended December 31, 2019, partially offset by recognizing a full year of depreciation and amortization expenses on four properties acquired during the year ended December 31, 2019.\nTransaction-Related Expenses\nWe reimburse CIM Income NAV Management or its affiliates for transaction-related expenses incurred in the process of acquiring a property, disposing of a property, or the origination or acquisition of a loan, so long as the total expenses relating to the transaction do not exceed 6.0% of the contract purchase price, unless otherwise approved by a majority of our Board, including a majority of our independent directors, as commercially competitive, fair and reasonable to us. Our acquisitions qualify as asset acquisitions, and, as such, certain acquisition costs related to these asset acquisitions are capitalized.\nThe decrease in transaction-related expenses of $507,000 during the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to the same period in 2019, was primarily due to a decrease in advisor reimbursement expenses related to lower acquisition and disposition activity during the year ended December 31, 2020.\nAdvisory Fees and Expenses\nThe advisory fees and expenses that we pay to our advisor are based upon our NAV. Advisory fees and expenses decreased $1.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to the same period in 2019, primarily due to a decrease in our average total NAV for all share classes of $69.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2020.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nThe primary general and administrative expense items are certain expense reimbursements to our advisor, escrow and trustee fees and professional service fees.\nThe decrease in general and administrative expenses of $1.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to the same period in 2019, was primarily due to a decrease in advisor reimbursements due to reduced reimbursable costs.\nNet Operating Income\nSame store property net operating income decreased $3.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to the same period in 2019. The decrease was primarily due to a reduction in rental and other property income for amounts deemed not probable of collection due to three same store tenants declaring bankruptcy.\nNon-same store property net operating income decreased $1.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to the same period in 2019. The decrease is primarily due to the disposition of 28 properties during the year ended\nDecember 31, 2019, partially offset by recognizing a full period of net operating income for the four properties acquired during the year ended December 31, 2019.\nDistributions\nPrior to April 1, 2020, on a quarterly basis, our Board authorized a daily distribution for the succeeding quarter. Our Board authorized the following daily distribution amounts per share for the periods indicated below:\n\n______________________\n(1)The daily distribution amount for each class of outstanding common stock is adjusted based on the relative NAV of the various classes each day so that, from day to day, distributions constitute a uniform percentage of the NAV per share of all classes. As a result, from day to day, the per share daily distribution for each outstanding class of common stock may be higher or lower than the daily distribution amount authorized by our Board based on the relative NAV of each class of common stock on that day.\nOn April 20, 2020, our Board decided to make a determination as to the amount and timing of distributions on a monthly, instead of a quarterly, basis until such time that we have greater visibility into the impact that the COVID-19 pandemic will have on our tenants' ability to continue to pay rent on their leases on a timely basis or at all, the degree to which federal, state or local governmental authorities grant rent relief or other relief or amnesty programs applicable to our tenants, our ability to access the capital markets, and on the United States and worldwide financial markets and economy. On March 25, 2021, given the relative stability of our rent collections and cash flow projections, our Board determined to declare monthly distributions for the months of March, April, May and June of 2021.\nSince April of 2020, our Board has authorized the following monthly distribution amounts per share for the periods indicated below:\n ________________\n(1)The distribution amount for each class of outstanding common stock is adjusted based on the relative NAV of the various classes so that distributions constitute a uniform percentage of the NAV per share of all classes for stockholders of record as of the last business day of the month for which the distribution rate applies.\nOn July 23, 2020, our Board authorized a year-end distribution (the Year-End Distribution\u201d) of $0.0839 per share of our D Shares, T Shares, S Shares and I Shares, which amount would be adjusted based on the relative NAV of our D Shares, T Shares, S Shares and I Shares so that distributions constitute a uniform percentage of the NAV per share of all classes. The Year-End Distribution is payable to stockholders of record as of the close of business on December 30, 2020 and was paid in January 2021 upon a determination by our chief financial officer that as of the payment date of the Year-End Distribution, we were able to pay our debts as they become due in the usual course of business and our assets were not less than the sum of our total liabilities. The Year-End Distribution was paid in cash or reinvested in shares of our common stock for stockholders participating in our distribution reinvestment plan. The Year-End Distribution was paid in addition to the distribution authorized by our Board for the month of December 2020.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had distributions payable of $4.9 million, which is included in distributions and redemptions payable on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.\nThe following table presents distributions and the source of distributions for the periods indicated below (dollars amounts in thousands):  ______________________\n(1)Net cash provided by operating activities for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 was $32.0 million and $32.5 million, respectively.\n(2)Our Distributions for the year ended December 31, 2019 were fully covered by cash flows from operating activities, including cash flows from prior periods of $471,000.\nShare Redemptions\nEffective April 1, 2020, we have adopted the Amended Share Redemption Program to provide limited liquidity whereby, on a monthly basis, stockholders may request that we redeem all or any portion of their shares. Our Amended Share Redemption Program provides that, no later than on the second to last business day of a given month, stockholders may request that we redeem all or any portion of their shares, subject to a minimum redemption amount and certain short-term trading fees. The redemption price per share for each class will be our NAV per share for such class for that month, calculated by the independent fund accountant in accordance with our valuation policies. Prior to April 1, 2020, our share redemption plan provided limited liquidity whereby, on a daily basis, stockholders could request that we redeem all or any portion of their shares.\nOur Amended Share Redemption Program includes certain redemption limits, including a quarterly limit and, in some cases, an individual stockholder limit. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we received redemption requests of approximately 11.3 million shares of our common stock for $188.4 million in excess of our redemption limit. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we received valid redemption requests under our Amended Share Redemption Program totaling approximately 16.8 million shares, of which we redeemed approximately 5.4 million shares as of December 31, 2020 for $93.6 million at an average redemption price of $17.31 per share and 126,000 shares subsequent to December 31, 2020 for $2.1 million at an average redemption price of $16.67. The remaining redemption requests relating to approximately 11.3 million shares went unfulfilled. A valid redemption request is one that complies with the applicable requirements and guidelines of our current share redemption program then in effect. See Note 14 -Stockholders' Equity to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional terms of the share redemption program, including the share redemption plan limits.\nAs of July 2020, the Board determined that monthly redemptions temporarily will be limited to shares whose aggregate value is no more than 0.8% of our aggregate NAV as of the last calendar day of the previous calendar month, and in any calendar quarter, redemptions will be limited to shares whose aggregate value is no more than 2.0% of our aggregate NAV as of the last calendar day of the previous calendar quarter. While no assurances can be made regarding the timing of a return to the\nredemption plan limits stated in our existing share redemption plan, if at all, we are targeting the return to our limits under the Amended Share Redemption Program to occur in the third quarter of 2021. We intend to fund share redemptions with available cash, proceeds from our liquid investments and proceeds from the sale of additional shares. We may, after taking the interests of our Company as a whole and the interests of our remaining stockholders into consideration, use proceeds from any available sources at our disposal to satisfy redemption requests, including, but not limited to, proceeds from sales of additional shares, excess cash flow from operations, sales of our liquid investments, incurrence of indebtedness and, if necessary, proceeds from the disposition of real estate properties or real estate related assets. In an effort to have adequate cash available to support our share redemption plan, CIM Income NAV Management may determine to reserve borrowing capacity under our line of credit. CIM Income NAV Management could then elect to borrow against our line of credit in part to redeem shares presented for redemption during periods when we do not have sufficient proceeds from the sale of shares in the Offering to fund all redemption requests. See the discussion of our share redemption program in Part II, Item 5.

See also the Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements section preceding Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. For a comparison of the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, see Item 7 - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nOverview\nWe were formed on July 27, 2010, to acquire and operate a diversified portfolio of commercial properties in the retail, office and industrial sectors that are leased to creditworthy tenants under long-term net leases, and are strategically located throughout the United States, and U.S. government securities, agency securities, corporate debt and other investments for which there is reasonable liquidity. We expect to complement our portfolio of net-lease properties by investing in substantially leased core metropolitan commercial and multi-family properties with growth potential that we believe will help us meet our investment objectives, either directly or through other funds with a proven track record of performance in these investment types, including funds managed by affiliates of our advisor. We commenced our principal operations on December 7, 2011, when we issued the initial $10.0 million in shares of our common stock in the Offering and acquired our first real estate property. When we refer to our share classes in this Annual Report on Form 10-K with respect to dates prior to the Restructure Date, we are referring to our shares under our prior share structure, and when we refer to our share classes in this Annual Report on Form 10-K with respect to dates on or after the Restructure Date, we are referring to our shares under our new share structure. We have no paid employees and are externally advised and managed by CIM Income NAV Management.\nAs we acquire additional commercial real estate, we will be subject to changes in real estate prices and changes in interest rates on any current variable rate debt, refinancings or new indebtedness used to acquire the properties. We may manage our risk of changes in real estate prices on future property acquisitions, when applicable, by entering into purchase agreements and loan commitments simultaneously, or through loan assumptions, so that our operating yield is determinable at the time we enter into a purchase agreement, by contracting with developers for future delivery of properties, or by entering into sale-leaseback transactions. We manage our interest rate risk by monitoring the interest rate environment in connection with our future property acquisitions, when applicable, or upcoming debt maturities to determine the appropriate financing or refinancing terms, which may include fixed rate loans, variable rate loans or interest rate hedges. If we are unable to acquire suitable properties or obtain suitable financing terms for future acquisitions or refinancing, our results of operations may be adversely affected.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we owned 123 properties located in 34 states, comprising 5.3 million rentable square feet of commercial space, which includes the rentable square feet of buildings on land subject to ground leases. Our operating results and cash flows are primarily influenced by rental income from our commercial properties and interest expense on our property indebtedness and acquisition and operating expenses. As 98.1% of our rentable square feet was under lease as of December 31, 2020, with a weighted average remaining lease term of 9.8 years, we believe our exposure to changes in commercial rental rates on our portfolio is substantially mitigated, except for vacancies caused by tenant bankruptcies or other factors, including due to circumstances related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Our advisor regularly monitors the creditworthiness of our tenants by reviewing each tenant's financial results, any available credit rating agency reports on the tenant or guarantor, the operating history of the property with such tenant, the tenant's market share and track record within its industry segment, the general health and outlook of the tenant's industry segment, and other information for changes and possible trends. If our advisor identifies significant changes or trends that may adversely affect the creditworthiness of a tenant, it will gather a more in-depth knowledge of the tenant's financial condition and, if necessary, attempt to mitigate the tenant credit risk by evaluating the possible sale of the property, or identifying a possible replacement tenant should the current tenant fail to perform on the lease.\nEffective April 1, 2020, we modified our Offering and certain other features of our Company from a daily to a monthly NAV REIT. We believe this change will result in greater access to capital to execute on our investment strategy, which will help us to better achieve our investment objectives by driving growth and diversification within the portfolio, creating a stronger balance sheet and enhancing liquidity for the benefit of all stockholders.\nAs part of the change from a daily to a monthly NAV REIT, our Board approved, among other things: (1) a change in the frequency of our NAV calculations from daily to monthly and certain other related changes to our valuation policies; and (2) adopted an amended share redemption program that provides for redemptions on a monthly basis. As a monthly NAV REIT, we\nexpect that investors' subscriptions will be accepted on the first day of each month and the purchase price of each class of shares would generally equal the prior month's NAV for that class divided by the number of shares of such class outstanding, as determined monthly, plus applicable selling commissions and dealer manager fees.\nCOVID-19\nThe COVID-19 outbreak and the associated shelter-in-place\u201d or stay-at-home\u201d orders or other quarantine mandates or public health guidance issued by local, state or federal authorities has adversely affected a number of our tenants' businesses. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic continues to impact our operations and those of our tenants will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence, including the scope, severity and duration of the pandemic, the actions taken to contain the pandemic or mitigate its impact, and the direct and indirect economic effects of the pandemic and containment measures, among others.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, we provided lease concessions, either in the form of rent deferrals or abatements, to certain tenants in response to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on those tenants. As of December 31, 2020, we granted rent deferrals with an aggregate deferral amount of $539,000. Additionally, as of December 31, 2020, we granted rent abatements to tenants with an aggregate abatement amount of $618,000, which reduced revenues during the year ended December 31, 2020.\nAs of March 24, 2021, we have collected approximately 99% of rental payments billed to tenants during the three months ended December 31, 2020. There have been no significant changes in rent collections subsequent to December 31, 2020.\nWe are actively managing our response to the COVID-19 pandemic in collaboration with our tenants and business partners and are assessing potential impacts to our financial position and operating results, as well as potential adverse developments in our business. In order to manage the financial health of the Company, our Board is making its determinations with respect to the declaration of distributions on a monthly, instead of quarterly basis and has approved and adopted an amended and restated share redemption program (the Amended Share Redemption Program\u201d) that, among other changes, provides that the Amended Share Redemption Program may be suspended at any time by majority vote of the Board without prior notice if the Board believes such action is in the best interest of the Company and its stockholders. Given the recent levels of investor subscriptions and increased redemption requests, which we believe has been exacerbated by the challenging economic environment caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, our stated objectives of maintaining target liquidity of 10% of the NAV up to $1 billion, and 5% of the NAV in excess of $1 billion ( Target Liquidity\u201d) and satisfying the redemption plan limits are in conflict. As such, the Company is temporarily redeeming less than the Amended Share Redemption Program limits to maintain this Target Liquidity while the Company seeks to generate additional liquidity through investor subscriptions and execution of an in-process asset disposition program. On August 30, 2020, our Board determined that, effective immediately, monthly redemptions temporarily will be limited to shares whose aggregate value is no more than 0.8% of the aggregate NAV as of the last calendar day of the previous calendar month, and in any calendar quarter, redemptions will be limited to shares whose aggregate value is no more than 2.0% of the aggregate NAV as of the last calendar day of the previous calendar quarter. While no assurances can be made regarding the timing of a return to the redemption plan limits stated in the Company's Amended Share Redemption Program, if at all, the Company is currently targeting the return to the limits under the Amended Share Redemption Program to occur in the third quarter of 2021. Further, in support of our efforts to achieve sustainable liquidity, our Board determined that 50% of the independent directors' quarterly compensation payments for the third quarter of 2020 through the second quarter of 2021 will be paid in the form of D Shares based on the then current NAV per share at the time of issuance. In addition, our Advisor agreed to take 50% of the monthly advisory fee payment from August 2020 through June 30, 2021 in I Shares based on the then current NAV per share of such shares at the time of issuance. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we borrowed $52.0 million in revolving loans in order to increase liquidity during this period of economic uncertainty. See - Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d for a more complete discussion of our financial resources.\nWe further engaged our independent valuation expert, pursuant to an agreement dated May 14, 2020, to provide valuation services on a monthly, instead of a rolling annual, basis, until such time that we had greater visibility into the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our properties' valuations. Given the relative stability of the month-over-month valuation of our real estate assets, our liabilities and our rent collections our Board determined that it is in the best interests of us and our stockholders to cease incurring the additional costs associated with the monthly valuations and to return to valuing our real estate portfolio on a rolling annual basis in accordance with our valuation policies effective September 30, 2020. For further information regarding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company, see Part I, Item 1A titled Risk Factors.\u201d\nOperating Highlights and Key Performance Indicators\n2020 Activity\n\u2022Disposed of five properties, consisting of three retail properties and two anchored shopping centers, for an aggregate gross sales price of $16.8 million.\n\u2022Increased total debt by $99.7 million to $450.7 million, with cash proceeds utilized primarily for investment and redemptions.\n\u2022Invested $50 million of limited partnership interests in CIM UII Onshore.\nPortfolio Information\nReal Estate Portfolio\nAs of December 31, 2020, we owned 123 commercial properties located in 34 states, comprising 5.3 million rentable square feet, which includes the rentable square feet of buildings on land subject to ground leases. As of December 31, 2020, these properties were 98.1% leased (including any month-to-month agreements) with a weighted average remaining lease term of 9.8 years.\nThe following table shows the property statistics of our real estate assets as of December 31, 2020 and 2019: Table 13: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Number of commercial properties </td> <td>123 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>128 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Rentable square feet (in thousands) (1)\n</td> <td>5,288 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,406 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Percentage of rentable square feet leased </td> <td>98.1 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>98.6 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Percentage of investment-grade tenants (2)\n</td> <td>29.5 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>32.1 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n____________________________________\n(1)Includes square feet of buildings on land that are subject to ground leases.\n(2)Investment-grade tenants are those with a credit rating of BBB- or higher by Standard & Poor's or a credit rating of Baa3 or higher by Moody's.

buildings on land parcels subject to ground leases.\nLeases\nAlthough there are variations in the specific terms of the leases of our properties, the following is a summary of the general structure of our current leases. Generally, the leases of the properties acquired provide for initial terms of ten or more years, and provide the tenant with one or more multi-year renewal options, subject to generally the same terms and conditions as the initial lease term. Certain leases also provide that in the event we wish to sell the property subject to that lease, we first must offer the lessee the right to purchase the property on the same terms and conditions as any offer which we intend to accept for the sale of the property. The properties are generally leased under net leases pursuant to which the tenant bears responsibility for substantially all property costs and expenses associated with ongoing maintenance and operation, including utilities, property taxes and insurance, while certain of the leases require us to maintain the roof, structure and parking areas of the building. Additionally, certain leases provide for increases in rent as a result of fixed increases, increases in the consumer price index, and/or increases in the tenant's sales volume.\nOur leases, as of December 31, 2020, provided for annual base rental payments (payable in monthly installments) ranging from $12,000 to $3.3 million, and had an average annual base rental payment of $437,000, with a weighted average remaining lease term of 9.8 years.\nThe following table shows lease expirations of our real estate portfolio as of December 31, 2020, during each of the next ten years and thereafter,

or uncertainties, other than the effects of the recent outbreak of COVID-19, and national economic conditions affecting real estate in general, that may reasonably be expected to have a material impact on our results from the acquisition, management and operations of properties other than those listed in Part I, Item 1A - Risk Factors. Currently, we are unable to predict the impact that the COVID-19 pandemic will have on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows in future periods due to numerous uncertainties.\nFor a comparison of the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, see Item 7 - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nSame Store Analysis\nOur results of operations are influenced by the timing of acquisitions and the operating performance of our real estate assets. We review our stabilized operating results, measured by net operating income ( NOI\u201d), from properties that we owned for the entirety of both the current and prior year reporting periods, referred to as same store\u201d properties, and we believe that the presentation of operating results for same store properties provides useful information to stockholders. NOI is a supplemental non-GAAP financial measure of a real estate company's operating performance. NOI is considered by\nmanagement to be a helpful supplemental performance measure, as it enables management to evaluate the impact of occupancy, rents, leasing activity, and other controllable property operating results at our real estate properties, and it provides a consistent method for the comparison of our properties. We define NOI as operating revenues less operating expenses, which exclude (i) depreciation and amortization, (ii) interest expense and other non-property related revenue and expense items such as (a) general and administrative expenses, (b) advisory fees and expenses, (c) transaction-related expenses (d) real estate impairment (e) gain on disposition or real estate, net and (f) income from marketable securities. Our NOI may not be comparable to that of other REITs and should not be considered to be more relevant or accurate in evaluating our operating performance than the current GAAP methodology used in calculating net income. In determining the same store property pool, we include all properties that were owned for the entirety of both the current and prior reporting periods, except for properties during the current or prior year that were under development or redevelopment.\nComparison of the Years Ended December 31, 2020 and 2019\nThe following table reconciles net income, calculated in accordance with GAAP, to net operating income (dollar amounts in thousands): Table 21: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Total </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>For the Year Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net (loss) income </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(11,011) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>14,791 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(25,802) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense and other, net </td> <td>17,127 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14,337 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,790 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss on investment in CIM UII Onshore </td> <td>2,660 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,660 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income </td> <td>8,776 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>29,128 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(20,352) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain on disposition of real estate, net </td> <td>(627) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(10,213) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9,586 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Real estate impairment </td> <td>13,851 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,090 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10,761 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization </td> <td>27,647 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>29,182 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,535) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Transaction-related expenses </td> <td>726 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,233 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(507) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Advisory fees and expenses </td> <td>6,382 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,902 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,520) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General and administrative expenses </td> <td>5,512 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,021 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,509) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest income on marketable securities </td> <td>(345) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(206) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(139) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net operating income </td> <td>$ </td> <td>61,922 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>67,137 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(5,215) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nA total of 119 properties were acquired before January 1, 2019 and represent our same store\u201d properties during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.

recognized our share of CIM UII Onshore's loss of $2.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2020. No such investments were made during the year ended December 31, 2019.\nGain on Disposition of Real Estate, Net\nThe decrease in gain on disposition of real estate, net of $9.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to the same period in 2019 was primarily due to the disposition of five properties during the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to the disposition of 28 properties during the year ended December 31, 2019.\nImpairment\nThe increase in impairment of $10.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to the same period in 2019, was primarily due to management identifying the carrying value of one anchored shopping center and one retail property to be greater than the estimated fair value of the properties, as well as bankruptcies at one anchored shopping center and three retail properties resulting in an impairment charge of $13.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to an impairment charge of $3.1 million relating to one anchored shopping center and five retail properties due to the carrying value being greater than the estimated fair value of the properties during the year ended December 31, 2019.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nThe decrease in depreciation and amortization expenses of $1.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to the same period in 2019, was primarily due to the disposition of five properties during the year ended December 31, 2020 and 28 properties during the year ended December 31, 2019, partially offset by recognizing a full year of depreciation and amortization expenses on four properties acquired during the year ended December 31, 2019.\nTransaction-Related Expenses\nWe reimburse CIM Income NAV Management or its affiliates for transaction-related expenses incurred in the process of acquiring a property, disposing of a property, or the origination or acquisition of a loan, so long as the total expenses relating to the transaction do not exceed 6.0% of the contract purchase price, unless otherwise approved by a majority of our Board, including a majority of our independent directors, as commercially competitive, fair and reasonable to us. Our acquisitions qualify as asset acquisitions, and, as such, certain acquisition costs related to these asset acquisitions are capitalized.\nThe decrease in transaction-related expenses of $507,000 during the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to the same period in 2019, was primarily due to a decrease in advisor reimbursement expenses related to lower acquisition and disposition activity during the year ended December 31, 2020.\nAdvisory Fees and Expenses\nThe advisory fees and expenses that we pay to our advisor are based upon our NAV. Advisory fees and expenses decreased $1.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to the same period in 2019, primarily due to a decrease in our average total NAV for all share classes of $69.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2020.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nThe primary general and administrative expense items are certain expense reimbursements to our advisor, escrow and trustee fees and professional service fees.\nThe decrease in general and administrative expenses of $1.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to the same period in 2019, was primarily due to a decrease in advisor reimbursements due to reduced reimbursable costs.\nNet Operating Income\nSame store property net operating income decreased $3.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to the same period in 2019. The decrease was primarily due to a reduction in rental and other property income for amounts deemed not probable of collection due to three same store tenants declaring bankruptcy.\nNon-same store property net operating income decreased $1.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to the same period in 2019. The decrease is primarily due to the disposition of 28 properties during the year ended\nDecember 31, 2019, partially offset by recognizing a full period of net operating income for the four properties acquired during the year ended December 31, 2019.\nDistributions\nPrior to April 1, 2020, on a quarterly basis, our Board authorized a daily distribution for the succeeding quarter. Our Board authorized the following daily distribution amounts per share for the periods indicated below:\nTable 23: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Period Commencing </td> <td> </td> <td>Period Ending </td> <td> </td> <td>Daily Distribution Amount (1)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>December 8, 2011 </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, 2011 </td> <td> </td> <td>$0.002260274 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>January 1, 2012 </td> <td> </td> <td>September 30, 2012 </td> <td> </td> <td>$0.002254099 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>October 1, 2012 </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, 2012 </td> <td> </td> <td>$0.002383836 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>January 1, 2013 </td> <td> </td> <td>September 30, 2013 </td> <td> </td> <td>$0.002429042 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>October 1, 2013 </td> <td> </td> <td>March 31, 2014 </td> <td> </td> <td>$0.002563727 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>April 1, 2014 </td> <td> </td> <td>March 31, 2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>$0.002678083 </td> </tr>\n</table>\n______________________\n(1)The daily distribution amount for each class of outstanding common stock is adjusted based on the relative NAV of the various classes each day so that, from day to day, distributions constitute a uniform percentage of the NAV per share of all classes. As a result, from day to day, the per share daily distribution for each outstanding class of common stock may be higher or lower than the daily distribution amount authorized by our Board based on the relative NAV of each class of common stock on that day.\nOn April 20, 2020, our Board decided to make a determination as to the amount and timing of distributions on a monthly, instead of a quarterly, basis until such time that we have greater visibility into the impact that the COVID-19 pandemic will have on our tenants' ability to continue to pay rent on their leases on a timely basis or at all, the degree to which federal, state or local governmental authorities grant rent relief or other relief or amnesty programs applicable to our tenants, our ability to access the capital markets, and on the United States and worldwide financial markets and economy. On March 25, 2021, given the relative stability of our rent collections and cash flow projections, our Board determined to declare monthly distributions for the months of March, April, May and June of 2021.\nSince April of 2020, our Board has authorized the following monthly distribution amounts per share for the periods indicated below:\nTable 24: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Record Date </td> <td> </td> <td>Distribution Amount (1)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>April 30, 2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>$0.0400 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>May 31, 2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>$0.0400 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>June 30, 2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>$0.0777 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>July 30, 2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>$0.0777 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>August 28, 2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>$0.0777 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>September 29, 2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>$0.0777 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>October 29, 2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>$0.0777 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>November 27, 2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>$0.0777 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>December 30, 2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>$0.0777 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>January 28, 2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>$0.0777 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>February 25, 2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>$0.0777 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>March 29, 2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>$0.0777 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>April 29 2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>$0.0777 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>May 28, 2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>$0.0777 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>June 29, 2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>$0.0777 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table> ________________\n(1)The distribution amount for each class of outstanding common stock is adjusted based on the relative NAV of the various classes so that distributions constitute a uniform percentage of the NAV per share of all classes for stockholders of record as of the last business day of the month for which the distribution rate applies.\nOn July 23, 2020, our Board authorized a year-end distribution (the Year-End Distribution\u201d) of $0.0839 per share of our D Shares, T Shares, S Shares and I Shares, which amount would be adjusted based on the relative NAV of our D Shares, T Shares, S Shares and I Shares so that distributions constitute a uniform percentage of the NAV per share of all classes. The Year-End Distribution is payable to stockholders of record as of the close of business on December 30, 2020 and was paid in January 2021 upon a determination by our chief financial officer that as of the payment date of the Year-End Distribution, we were able to pay our debts as they become due in the usual course of business and our assets were not less than the sum of our total liabilities. The Year-End Distribution was paid in cash or reinvested in shares of our common stock for stockholders participating in our distribution reinvestment plan. The Year-End Distribution was paid in addition to the distribution authorized by our Board for the month of December 2020.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had distributions payable of $4.9 million, which is included in distributions and redemptions payable on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.\nThe following table presents distributions and the source of distributions for the periods indicated below (dollars amounts in thousands): Table 25: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Amount </td> <td> </td> <td>Percent </td> <td> </td> <td>Amount </td> <td> </td> <td>Percent </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Distributions paid in cash\n</td> <td>$ </td> <td>14,646 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>53 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>16,816 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>51 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Distributions reinvested </td> <td>13,108 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>47 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>16,201 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>49 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total distributions </td> <td>$ </td> <td>27,754 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>33,017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Source of distributions: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by operating activities (1)\n</td> <td>$ </td> <td>27,754 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>33,017 </td> <td> </td> <td>(2) </td> <td>100 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total sources </td> <td>$ </td> <td>27,754 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>33,017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table> ______________________\n(1)Net cash provided by operating activities for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 was $32.0 million and $32.5 million, respectively.\n(2)Our Distributions for the year ended December 31, 2019 were fully covered by cash flows from operating activities, including cash flows from prior periods of $471,000.\nShare Redemptions\nEffective April 1, 2020, we have adopted the Amended Share Redemption Program to provide limited liquidity whereby, on a monthly basis, stockholders may request that we redeem all or any portion of their shares. Our Amended Share Redemption Program provides that, no later than on the second to last business day of a given month, stockholders may request that we redeem all or any portion of their shares, subject to a minimum redemption amount and certain short-term trading fees. The redemption price per share for each class will be our NAV per share for such class for that month, calculated by the independent fund accountant in accordance with our valuation policies. Prior to April 1, 2020, our share redemption plan provided limited liquidity whereby, on a daily basis, stockholders could request that we redeem all or any portion of their shares.\nOur Amended Share Redemption Program includes certain redemption limits, including a quarterly limit and, in some cases, an individual stockholder limit. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we received redemption requests of approximately 11.3 million shares of our common stock for $188.4 million in excess of our redemption limit. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we received valid redemption requests under our Amended Share Redemption Program totaling approximately 16.8 million shares, of which we redeemed approximately 5.4 million shares as of December 31, 2020 for $93.6 million at an average redemption price of $17.31 per share and 126,000 shares subsequent to December 31, 2020 for $2.1 million at an average redemption price of $16.67. The remaining redemption requests relating to approximately 11.3 million shares went unfulfilled. A valid redemption request is one that complies with the applicable requirements and guidelines of our current share redemption program then in effect. See Note 14 -Stockholders' Equity to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional terms of the share redemption program, including the share redemption plan limits.\nAs of July 2020, the Board determined that monthly redemptions temporarily will be limited to shares whose aggregate value is no more than 0.8% of our aggregate NAV as of the last calendar day of the previous calendar month, and in any calendar quarter, redemptions will be limited to shares whose aggregate value is no more than 2.0% of our aggregate NAV as of the last calendar day of the previous calendar quarter. While no assurances can be made regarding the timing of a return to the\nredemption plan limits stated in our existing share redemption plan, if at all, we are targeting the return to our limits under the Amended Share Redemption Program to occur in the third quarter of 2021. We intend to fund share redemptions with available cash, proceeds from our liquid investments and proceeds from the sale of additional shares. We may, after taking the interests of our Company as a whole and the interests of our remaining stockholders into consideration, use proceeds from any available sources at our disposal to satisfy redemption requests, including, but not limited to, proceeds from sales of additional shares, excess cash flow from operations, sales of our liquid investments, incurrence of indebtedness and, if necessary, proceeds from the disposition of real estate properties or real estate related assets. In an effort to have adequate cash available to support our share redemption plan, CIM Income NAV Management may determine to reserve borrowing capacity under our line of credit. CIM Income NAV Management could then elect to borrow against our line of credit in part to redeem shares presented for redemption during periods when we do not have sufficient proceeds from the sale of shares in the Offering to fund all redemption requests.
