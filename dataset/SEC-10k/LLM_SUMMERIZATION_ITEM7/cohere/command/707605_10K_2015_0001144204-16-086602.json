MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (MD&A)\nThe following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of the Company should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of the Company including the related notes thereto, included elsewhere herein.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2015, 2014, AND 2013\n2015 SUMMARY OVERVIEW: Net income was $1,374,000, or $0.07 per share, for the fourth quarter of 2015. This was $625,000, or $0.03 per share, higher than the fourth quarter of 2014. Net income for the full year was $5,997,000, or $0.31 per share, which represents an increase by $2,974,000, or $0.16 per share, from 2014. The Company's 2015 results illustrate the effectiveness from very specific profitability improvement actions executed to permit the Company to continue growing the business but to avoid expense increases so as to improve per share profitability.\nWe have previously emphasized the Company's determination to become a significant competitor in every market where the company has a presence. The reports from the marketplace continue to be encouraging. Net loan growth year over year totaled almost $52 million while deposits increased by $33 million as both of these activities set new year ending records for AmeriServ. These marketplace successes also found support from a more efficient company. Operating non-interest expense was $1.7 million, or 3.9%, lower than 2014. The now proven effectiveness of the 2014 profitability efforts has resulted in a new enthusiasm among staff members for ways to trim expenses.\nThis is not to say that 2015 was without its challenges. The worldwide energy turmoil resulted in the bankruptcy of a Western Pennsylvania energy related company. However, the Company's total loan portfolio still contains a lower level of troubled loans than the average level at the Company's peer banks across the nation. The lending standards of the Company remain consistent with the goal of supporting qualified borrowers over the ups and downs of the business cycle.\nThe Federal Reserve's interest rate policies that were adopted in 2008 have severely punished the thrifty, those living on pensions and community banks throughout the country. The squeeze on the banker's net interest margin hurts the availability of credit. It is understandable that the Federal Reserve would respond to events like the freezing of credit markets in 2008, but this seemed to encourage the Federal Reserve to seek to manage the entire economy permanently. Let us hope they can unwind their involvement without further disturbances in this very large and complex economy.\nThe Board and the management team of the Company remain committed to a continuation of time tested banking management practices. These include strong capital, deep liquidity and a conservative balance sheet. To further these goals, in January 2016, the Company paid off the $21 million of US Treasury preferred shares related to the SBLF program using cash on hand and net proceeds from the private placement of $7.65 million in aggregate principal amount of 6.5% fixed rate subordinated notes. These SBLF funds were a way for the Treasury to encourage banks to lend to small businesses. It worked very well! The Company increased its roster of small business borrowers throughout its regions. However, the Treasury would have increased its dividend rate on the preferred shares from 1% per year to 9% per year in February 2016. The Company will continue to lend to small businesses and will continue to be a well-capitalized community bank, but the Company will not experience this dividend rate increase for those shares are retired. This action was spelled out in detail in the Company's press release from January 28, 2016.\nFinally, a comment about the turmoil in financial markets. The domestic economy of the U.S. has been dynamic and ever-changing throughout history. The question we are all forced to answer is how much risk to accept in our economic affairs. The events of 2015 would suggest that it is best to limit risk when contemplating a dynamic economy. This has been and will be our guiding principle as we pursue our climb to financial respectability in 2016 and beyond.\nPERFORMANCE OVERVIEW... The following table summarizes some of the Company's key profitability performance indicators for each of the past three years.\nTable 20: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td>2014 </td> <td> </td> <td>2013 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT\nPER SHARE DATA AND RATIOS) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net income </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,997 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,023 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,193 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net income available to common shareholders </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,787 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,813 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,984 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Diluted earnings per share </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.31 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.15 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.26 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Return on average assets </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.54 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.29 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.51 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Return on average equity </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.10 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.61 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.69 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Company reported net income available to common shareholders of $5.8 million, or $0.31 per diluted common share, for 2015. This represented a 107% increase in earnings per share from 2014 where net income available to common shareholders totaled $2.8 million, or $0.15 per diluted share. Factors causing this increase in earnings were solid loan and deposit growth in our community banking business which contributed to an increase of $1.3 million, or 3.9%, in net interest income while increasing revenue from our trust and wealth management business contributed to 7.5% growth in non-interest income in 2015. Additionally, operating expenses declined by $2.3 million, or 5.4%, as we improved the ongoing efficiency of the Company by successfully executing several profitability improvement initiatives.\nThe Company reported net income available to common shareholders of $2.8 million, or $0.15 per diluted common share, for 2014. This represented a 42.3% decrease in earnings per share from 2013 where net income available to common shareholders totalled $5.0 million, or $0.26 per diluted share. Factors contributing to this reduction in earnings were a $1.5 million unfavorable swing in the provision for loan losses, a $1.4 million reduction in non-interest revenue, and a $1.1 million increase in non-interest expense. The non-interest expense increase included a $669,000 goodwill impairment charge and a $376,000 fourth quarter pension charge related to 25 employees who elected to participate in an early retirement incentive program. These negative items were partially offset by a $1.2 million increase in net interest income due to continued growth of our loan portfolio while maintaining excellent asset quality.\nThe Company reported net income available to common shareholders of $5.0 million, or $0.26 per diluted common share, for 2013. This represented a 23.8% increase in earnings per share from 2012 where net income available to common shareholders totalled $4.2 million, or $0.21 per diluted share. Growth in total revenue, improved asset quality, and effective capital management caused the increase in earnings per share in 2013. Specifically, a $658,000 increase in net interest income resulted from continued strong growth of our loan portfolio, as total loans grew by $55 million, or 7.5%. Material loan growth occurred in loan categories that qualified for the SBLF through the Company's loan production offices. As a result of this growth in SBLF qualified loans, the Company locked in the lowest preferred dividend rate available under the program of 1% until its redemption in the first quarter of 2016. This lower rate saved the Company $619,000 in preferred stock dividend payments in 2013 and was a key factor contributing to the earnings per share growth. Additionally, the calculation of earnings per share benefitted from a 713,000, or 3.6%, reduction in average shares outstanding due to the success of the Company's common stock repurchase program that was completed in the second quarter of 2013. There was also $325,000 more earnings benefit from negative loan loss provisions in 2013 due to the Company's improved asset quality. These positive items were partially offset by a $1.6 million or 3.9% increase in non-interest expense and slightly higher income tax expense.\nNET INTEREST INCOME AND MARGIN... The Company's net interest income represents the amount by which interest income on earning assets exceeds interest paid on interest bearing liabilities. Net interest income is a primary source of the Company's earnings; it is affected by interest rate fluctuations as well as changes in the amount and mix of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities. The following table summarizes the Company's net interest income performance for each of the past three years:\nTable 21: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td>2014 </td> <td> </td> <td>2013 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT RATIOS) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Interest income </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>41,881 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>40,441 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>39,343 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Interest expense </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,520 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,397 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,482 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net interest income </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>35,361 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>34,044 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>32,861 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net interest margin </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.49 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.52 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.56 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\n2015 NET INTEREST PERFORMANCE OVERVIEW... The Company's net interest income increased by $1.3 million, or 3.9%, for the full year of 2015 when compared to the full year 2014 as net interest margin compression was more than fully mitigated by earning asset growth, a greater level of prepayment fees on early loan payoffs and an increased dividend from the FHLB of Pittsburgh. The Company's net interest margin of 3.49% for the full year 2015 was three basis points lower than the net interest margin of 3.52% for the full year 2014. The earning asset growth occurred in the loan portfolio as total loans averaged $857 million for the full year of 2015 which is $52 million, or 6.5%, higher than the $805 million average for the full year of 2014. This loan growth reflects the successful results of the Company's sales calling efforts, with an emphasis on generating commercial loans and owner occupied commercial real estate loans particularly through its loan production offices in the stronger growth markets of Pittsburgh and Altoona in Pennsylvania, Hagerstown, Maryland and Harrisonburg, Virginia. Overall, total interest income increased by $1.4 million, or 3.6%, for the full year 2015.\nTotal interest expense has been well controlled in 2015 as it increased by $123,000, or 1.9%, for the full year of 2015 due to tight control of our cost of funds through disciplined deposit pricing. Total deposit interest expense decreased by $137,000, or 2.8%, in 2015 when compared to last year. Even with this reduction in deposit costs, the Company continues to have a strong loyal core deposit base and success in cross-selling new loan customers into deposit products. Specifically, total deposits averaged $893 million for full year of 2015 which is $21 million, or 2.4%, higher than the $872 million average in 2014. The Company is pleased that a meaningful portion of this deposit growth occurred in non-interest bearing demand deposit accounts. This decreased interest expense for deposits has been more than offset by a $260,000 increase in the interest cost for borrowings as the Company has utilized more FHLB term advances to extend borrowings and provide protection against rising interest rates.\nOverall, the Company expects that it will need to continue to grow earning assets to achieve net interest income growth in 2016 as net interest margin compression is expected to continue given the ongoing challenges of the exceptionally low interest rate environment. Solid commercial loan pipelines suggest that the Company should be able to again grow the loan portfolio in 2016 although we expect pricing pressures on new commercial loans to continue to be intense.\nCOMPONENT CHANGES IN NET INTEREST INCOME: 2015 VERSUS 2014... Regarding the separate components of net interest income, the Company's total interest income in 2015 increased by $1.4 million, or 3.6%, when compared to 2014. This increase was due to a $44.4 million increase in average earning assets due to an increase in average loans, partially offset by a four basis point decline in the earning asset yield from 4.18% to 4.14%. Within the earning asset base, the yield on the total loan portfolio decreased by eight basis points from 4.52% to 4.44% as a greater level of prepayment fees on early loan payoffs was more than offset by the impact from new loans having yields that are below the rate on the maturing instruments that they are replacing. However, the yield on total investment securities increased by seven basis points from 2.60% to 2.67% due to an increased dividend from the FHLB of Pittsburgh and a reduction in premium amortization on mortgage backed securities which resulted from a slowdown in mortgage prepayment speeds in 2015. Investment securities interest revenue declined by $223,000 in 2015 due to a $12 million decrease in the average investment securities portfolio as the Company has utilized cash flow from securities to help fund the previously mentioned loan growth.\nThe Company's total interest expense for 2015 increased by $123,000, or 1.9%, when compared to 2014. This increase in interest expense was due to an increased level of average FHLB borrowed funds which more than offset a lower cost of funds as the cost of interest bearing liabilities declined by one basis point to 0.81%. Management's strategy to carefully price interest rates paid on all deposit categories has not had a negative impact on deposit growth and reflects the loyalty of the bank's core deposit base. The overall cost of interest bearing deposits decreased by two basis points to 0.66% in spite of a $5.4 million increase in the total average volume. The Company has utilized term advances from the FHLB, with maturities ranging between three and five years, to help fund its earning asset growth and manage interest rate risk. The average balance of FHLB term advances has increased by $13 million while the average cost of these advances has increased by 20 basis points to 1.21%. Overall, total FHLB borrowings averaged $71 million or 6.4% of total assets during 2015.\n2014 NET INTEREST INCOME PERFORMANCE OVERVIEW... The Company's net interest income for the full year 2014 increased by $1.2 million, or 3.6%, when compared to the full year 2013. The Company's net interest margin of 3.52% for the full year 2014 was four basis points lower than the net interest margin of 3.56% for the full year 2013. The Company has been able to mitigate this net interest margin pressure and to increase net interest income by both growing its earning assets and reducing its cost of funds. Specifically, the earning asset growth has occurred in the loan portfolio as total loans averaged a record $805 million for the full year 2014 which is $58 million, or 7.8%, higher than the $746 million average for the 2013 year. This loan growth reflects the successful results of the Company's more intensive sales calling efforts, with an emphasis on generating commercial loans and owner occupied CRE loans, which qualify as SBLF loans. Interest income in 2014 has also benefitted from reduced premium amortization on mortgage backed securities due to slower mortgage prepayment speeds. Overall, total interest income increased by $1.1 million in 2014. Additionally, the increase in loans caused the Company's loan to deposit ratio to average 92.3% in 2014 compared to 88.2% in 2013.\nTotal interest expense for the 2014 year declined by $85,000 from the full year 2013 due to the Company's proactive efforts to reduce deposit costs. Even with this reduction in deposit costs, the Company still experienced growth in deposits which reflects the loyalty of our core deposit base and ongoing efforts to cross sell new loan customers into deposit products. Specifically, total deposits averaged a record level of $872 million for the full year 2014 which is $25 million, or 3.0%, higher than the $847 million average for the full year 2013. This decreased interest expense for deposits has been partially offset by a $190,000 increase in the interest cost for borrowings as the Company has utilized more Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) term advances to extend borrowings and provide protection against rising interest rates.\nCOMPONENT CHANGES IN NET INTEREST INCOME: 2014 VERSUS 2013... Regarding the separate components of net interest income, the Company's total interest income in 2014 increased by $1.1 million when compared to 2013. This increase was due to a $44.1 million increase in average earning assets due to an increase in average loans partially offset by a nine basis point decline in the earning asset yield from 4.27% to 4.18%. Within the earning asset base, the yield on the total loan portfolio decreased by 19 basis points from 4.71% to 4.52% as new loans typically have yields that are below the rate on the maturing instruments that they are replacing. However, the yield on total investment securities increased by 10 basis points from 2.50% to 2.60% due primarily to a reduction in premium amortization on mortgage backed securities due to a slowdown in mortgage prepayment speeds in 2014. Investment securities interest revenue declined by $122,000 in 2014 due to an $11 million decrease in the average investment securities portfolio as the Company has utilized cash flow from securities to help fund the previously mentioned loan growth.\nThe Company's total interest expense for 2014 decreased by $85,000, or 1.3%, when compared to 2013. This decrease in interest expense was due to a lower cost of funds as the cost of interest bearing liabilities declined by six basis points to 0.82%. Management's decision to further reduce interest rates paid on all deposit categories has not had a negative impact on deposit growth and reflects the loyalty of the bank's core deposit base. This decrease in funding costs occurred in spite of a $43.4 million increase in the volume of average interest bearing liabilities. The Company has utilized term advances from the FHLB, with maturities ranging between three and five years, to help fund its earning asset growth and manage interest rate risk. The average balance of FHLB term advances has increased by $15 million while the average cost of these advances has increased by only 17 basis points to 1.01%. Overall, total FHLB borrowings averaged $52 million or 4.9% of total assets during 2014.\nThe table that follows provides an analysis of net interest income on a tax-equivalent basis setting forth (i) average assets, liabilities, and stockholders' equity, (ii) interest income earned on interest earning assets and interest expense paid on interest bearing liabilities, (iii) average yields earned on interest earning assets and average rates paid on interest bearing liabilities, (iv) interest rate spread (the difference between the average yield earned on interest earning assets and the average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities), and (v) net interest margin (net interest income as a percentage of average total interest earning assets). For purposes of these tables loan balances include non-accrual loans, and interest income on loans includes loan fees or amortization of such fees which have been deferred, as well as interest recorded on certain non-accrual loans as cash is received. Regulatory stock is included within available for sale investment securities for this analysis. Additionally, a tax rate of approximately 34% is used to compute tax-equivalent yields.\nTable 22: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>

The table below sets forth an analysis of volume and rate changes in net interest income on a tax-equivalent basis. For purposes of this table, changes in interest income and interest expense are allocated to volume and rate categories based upon the respective percentage changes in average balances and average rates. Changes in net interest income that could not be specifically identified as either a rate or volume change were allocated proportionately to changes in volume and changes in rate.\nTable 23: <table>

The Company's written lending policies require underwriting, loan documentation, and credit analysis standards to be met prior to funding any loan. After the loan has been approved and funded, continued periodic credit review is required. The Company's policy is to individually review, as circumstances warrant, each of its commercial and commercial mortgage loans to determine if a loan is impaired. At a minimum, credit reviews are mandatory for all commercial and commercial mortgage loan relationships with aggregate balances in excess of $250,000 within a 12-month period. The Company has also identified three pools of small dollar value homogeneous loans which are evaluated collectively for impairment. These separate pools are for small business relationships with aggregate balances of $250,000 or less, residential mortgage loans and consumer loans. Individual loans within these pools are reviewed and removed from the pool if factors such as significant delinquency in payments of 90 days or more, bankruptcy, or other negative economic concerns indicate impairment. The following table sets forth information concerning the Company's loan delinquency and other non-performing assets.\nTable 24: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>AT DECEMBER 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td>2014 </td> <td> </td> <td>2013 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT PERCENTAGES) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total accruing loans past due 30 to 89 days </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,396 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,643 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,264 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total non-accrual loans </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,066 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,195 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,871 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total non-performing assets including TDRs(1) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,297 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,917 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,109 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Loan delinquency as a percentage of total loans, net of unearned income </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.50 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.32 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.42 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Non-accrual loans as a percentage of total loans, net of unearned income </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.69 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.27 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.37 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Non-performing assets as a percentage of total loans, net of unearned income, and other real estate owned </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.71 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.35 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.52 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Non-performing assets as a percentage of total assets </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.55 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.27 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.39 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total classified loans (loans rated substandard or doubtful) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>8,566 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>11,229 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>11,779 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 25: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>(1) </td> <td>Non-performing assets are comprised of (i) loans that are on a non-accrual basis, (ii) loans that are contractually past due 90 days or more as to interest and principal payments, (iii) performing loans classified as troubled debt restructuring and (iv) other real estate owned. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Company continues to maintain strong asset quality even though non-performing loans increased late in 2015. The increase was largely due to the transfer into non-accrual status of a $4.1 million loan to a customer in the fracking industry that filed for bankruptcy protection in the fourth quarter. Of this total $4.1 million loan, $2.5 million relates to an equipment loan that was used to finance certain components of a new frack water treatment plant and $1.6 million relates to a loan that was used to finance the purchase of 10 truck tractors and 5 truck trailers. At year-end 2015, the Company had established specific reserves within its allowance for loan losses of $865,000 on the water treatment plant loan and $469,000 on the tractor and trailer loan. Recent developments from the bankruptcy process indicate that the truck tractors and trailers should be returned from the borrower to the Company for disposition in the near future. In regards to the frack water treatment plant, the Company has not yet been able to determine if the plant is fully operational despite the borrower's intent to get the plant in that condition in order to maximize potential value. The Company's ultimate loss on this loan would increase significantly should the plant not be able to be sold as a turn-key operation ready plant. This is the Company's only meaningful direct loan exposure to the energy industry. The continued successful ongoing problem credit resolution efforts of the Company is demonstrated in the table above as levels of non-accrual loans, non-performing assets, classified loans and low loan delinquency levels are well below 1% of total loans. We continue to closely monitor the loan portfolio given the uneven recovery in the economy and the number of relatively large-sized commercial and CRE loans within the portfolio. As of December 31, 2015, the 25 largest credits represented 24.0% of total loans outstanding.\nALLOWANCE AND PROVISION FOR LOAN LOSSES... As described in more detail in the Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates section of this MD&A, the Company uses a comprehensive methodology and procedural discipline to maintain an ALL to absorb inherent losses in the loan portfolio. The Company believes this is a critical accounting policy since it involves significant estimates and judgments. The following table sets forth changes in the ALL and certain ratios for the periods ended.\nTable 26: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

$1,250,000 provision for loan losses which represented an increase of $875,000 when compared to the 2014 full year provision of $375,000. The higher provision that was needed this year was largely due to the transfer into non-accrual status of a $4.1 million loan to a customer in the fracking industry that filed for bankruptcy protection in the fourth quarter. The higher provision recorded in 2015 was also needed to support the continuing growth of the loan portfolio and cover net loan charge-offs. For the full year, there were net loan charge-offs of $952,000, or 0.11% of total loans, in 2015 compared to net loan charge-offs of $856,000, or 0.11% of total loans, in 2014. Overall, even with the fourth quarter\nincrease in non-performing assets, the Company continued to maintain strong asset quality in 2015. At December 31, 2015, non-performing assets totaled $6.3 million, or 0.71% of total loans. When determining the provision for loan losses, the Company considers a number of factors, some of which include periodic credit reviews, non-performing assets, loan delinquency and charge-off trends, concentrations of credit, loan volume trends and broader local and national economic trends. In summary, the allowance for loan losses provided 158% coverage of non-performing loans, and 1.13% of total loans, at December 31, 2015, compared to 400% coverage of non-performing loans, and 1.16% of total loans, at December 31, 2014. The Company presently expects that it will have greater positive loan loss provisions in 2016 to support the expected growth of the loan portfolio.\nFor 2014, the Company recorded a $375,000 provision for loan losses compared to a $1.1 million negative provision for the 2013 year. This represents an unfavorable swing of $1.5 million between years and is a significant factor contributing to the lower earnings in 2014. The positive provision in 2014 was needed to partially cover net loan charge-offs and support the continuing growth of the loan portfolio. In 2014, actual credit losses realized through net charge-offs totaled $856,000, or 0.11% of average total loans, which represents a decrease from the 2013 year when net charge-offs totaled $1.4 million, or 0.18% of average total loans. Overall, for the 2014 year, the Company continued to maintain outstanding asset quality. At December 31, 2014, non-performing assets totaled $2.9 million, or only 0.35% of total loans, which represents the first time that our non-performing assets have been under $3 million since 2007. In summary, the ALL provided a strong 400% coverage of non-performing loans, and 1.16% of total loans, at December 31, 2014, compared to 327% coverage of non-performing loans, and 1.29% of total loans, at December 31, 2013.\nThe following schedule sets forth the allocation of the ALL among various loan categories. This allocation is determined by using the consistent quarterly procedural discipline that was previously discussed. The entire ALL is available to absorb future loan losses in any loan category.\nTable 27: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>AT DECEMBER 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td>2014 </td> <td> </td> <td>2013 </td> <td> </td> <td>2012 </td> <td> </td> <td>2011 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>AMOUNT </td> <td> </td> <td>PERCENT\nOF LOANS\nIN EACH\nCATEGORY\nTO TOTAL\nLOANS </td> <td> </td> <td>AMOUNT </td> <td> </td> <td>PERCENT\nOF LOANS\nIN EACH\nCATEGORY\nTO TOTAL\nLOANS </td> <td> </td> <td>AMOUNT </td> <td> </td> <td>PERCENT\nOF LOANS\nIN EACH\nCATEGORY\nTO TOTAL\nLOANS </td> <td> </td> <td>AMOUNT </td> <td> </td> <td>PERCENT\nOF LOANS\nIN EACH\nCATEGORY\nTO TOTAL\nLOANS </td> <td> </td> <td>AMOUNT </td> <td> </td> <td>PERCENT\nOF LOANS\nIN EACH\nCATEGORY\nTO TOTAL\nLOANS </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT PERCENTAGES) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Commercial </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,244 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>20.6 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,262 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16.8 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,844 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15.3 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,596 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14.3 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,365 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12.5 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Commercial loans secured by real estate </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,449 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>47.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,902 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>49.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,885 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>52.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,796 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>53.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9,400 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>52.8 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Real estate-mortgage </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,173 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>29.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,310 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>31.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,260 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>30.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,269 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>30.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,270 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>32.0 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Consumer </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>151 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>190 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>136 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>150 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>174 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.7 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Allocation to general risk </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>904 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>959 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>979 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>760 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,414 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>9,921 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>9,623 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>10,104 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>12,571 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>14,623 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nEven though residential real estate-mortgage loans comprise 29.3% of the Company's total loan portfolio, only $1.2 million or 11.8% of the total ALL is allocated against this loan category. The residential real estate-mortgage loan allocation is based upon the Company's three-year historical average of actual loan charge-offs experienced in that category and other qualitative factors. The disproportionately higher allocations for commercial loans and commercial loans secured by real estate reflect the increased credit risk associated with this type of lending, the Company's historical loss experience in these categories, and other qualitative factors. The large decline in the part of the allowance allocated to commercial loans secured by real estate reflects the continued asset quality improvements in this sector.\nBased on the Company's ALL methodology and the related assessment of the inherent risk factors contained within the Company's loan portfolio, we believe that the ALL is adequate at December 31, 2015 to cover losses within the Company's loan portfolio.\nNON-INTEREST INCOME... Non-interest income for 2015 totalled $15.3 million, an increase of $944,000, or 6.6%, from 2014.

The Company recorded income tax expense of $2.3 million, or an effective tax rate of 28.1%, in 2015 compared to the income tax expense of $1.6 million, or an effective tax rate of 34.6%, for 2014. The higher income tax expense is due to the Company's increased earnings in 2015 as the Company's effective tax rate is lower than 2014 due to an increase in tax free revenue from bank owned life insurance. BOLI is the Company's largest source of tax-free earnings. Contributing to the higher effective tax rate in 2014 was the non-deductibility of the goodwill impairment charge for tax purposes. The Company's deferred tax asset was $9.0 million at December 31, 2015 and relates primarily to AMT carryforwards and the ALL.\nSEGMENT RESULTS... Retail banking's net income contribution was $3.0 million in 2015 compared to $2.2 million in 2014 and $2.8 million in 2013. The increased net income contribution in 2015 reflects increased net interest income and reduced non-interest expense. Net interest income was positively impacted by an increased funding benefit from deposits provided by this segment, which more than fully mitigated the ongoing net interest margin pressure from the continued low interest rate environment. Lower personnel costs and increased efficiencies related to the profitability improvement program were the primary contributor to the reduced level of non-interest expense as a result of fewer FTEs after certain employees elected to participate in the early retirement program late in 2014. These positive items more than offset a lower level of non-interest income as increased revenue from BOLI was more than offset by reduced deposit service charges and lower residential mortgage banking revenues.\nThe commercial banking segment reported net income of $5.4 million in 2015 compared to net income of $4.2 million in 2014 and $5.0 million in 2013. The net income contribution for 2015 increased as a result of strong growth in the commercial and commercial real estate loan portfolios which resulted in a higher level of net interest income. Also positively impacting net income was a greater level of prepayment fees on early loan payoffs. Additionally, similar to the retail segment, total non-interest expenses were lower due to the early retirement program and other increased efficiencies from the profitability program. Partially offsetting these favorable items was an increase of $740,000 in the provision for loan losses.\nThe trust segment's net income contribution was $1.3 million in 2015 compared to $564,000 in 2014 and $1.2 million in 2013. The net income contribution for 2015 reflects increased trust and investment advisory fees as a result of increased assets under management which reflects successful new business development activities as well as effective management of existing customer accounts in this volatile market environment. Also, WCCA returned to profitability as the client base stabilized and began to exhibit growth. The 2014 year was negatively impacted by the previously discussed $669,000 goodwill impairment charge at WCCA.\nSlightly offsetting these favorable items was lower financial services revenue due to fewer production personnel in 2015. Additionally, expenses for the trust segment were negatively impacted by approximately $300,000 of professional fees related to addressing a trust operations trading error. We expect to incur an additional $300,000 to $400,000 of costs in the first quarter of 2016 to complete and resolve this matter. Overall, the fair market value of trust assets under administration totaled $1.975 billion at December 31, 2015, an increase of $90.9 million, or 4.8%, from the December 31, 2014 total of $1.884 billion.\nThe investment/parent segment reported a net loss of $3.8 million in 2015 which was comparable with the net loss of $3.9 million in 2014 and $3.8 million in 2013. Overall this segment has felt the most earnings pressure from the continued low interest rate environment and declining investment security balances which have been utilized to help fund loan growth. Additionally, all of the interest expense of the trust preferred securities is allocated to this segment. The Company did generate investment security gains of $71,000 in 2015 and $177,000 in 2014 from the sale of certain low balance, rapidly prepaying mortgage backed securities which had a favorable impact on earnings in this segment.\nFor greater discussion on the future strategic direction of the Company's key business segments, see \u201cManagement's Discussion and Analysis - Forward Looking Statements.\u201d\nBALANCE SHEET... The Company's total consolidated assets of $1.149 billion at December 31, 2015 grew by $60 million or 5.5% from the $1.089 billion level at December 31, 2014. This asset growth was due primarily to a $51.9 million or 6.2% increase in total loans in 2015. This loan growth reflects the successful results of the Company's more intensive sales calling efforts with an emphasis on generating commercial loans and owner occupied CRE loans particularly through its loan production offices. This loan increase was partially offset by a $6.1 million decrease in investment securities as the Company utilized this item to help fund the loan growth.\nThe Company also funded the previously mentioned asset growth with a combination of both increased deposits ($33 million) and FHLB borrowings ($16 million). The FHLB term advances, with maturities between 3 and 5 years, now total $48 million as the Company has utilized these advances to help manage interest rate risk in a rising rate environment. Late in December, the Company successfully completed a $7.65 million subordinated debt issuance. Other liabilities decreased by $1.8 million due to a decrease in the Company's pension liability. Total stockholders' equity increased by $4.6 million since year-end 2014 mainly due to increased retained earnings as the Company's net income available to common shareholders more than exceeded funds used for common stock cash dividend payments. The Company continues to be considered well capitalized for regulatory purposes with a risk based capital ratio of 15.55% and an asset leverage ratio of 11.41% at December 31, 2015. The Company's book value per common share was $5.19, its tangible book value per common share was $4.56 and its tangible common equity to tangible assets ratio was 7.57% at December 31, 2015.\nLIQUIDITY... The Company's liquidity position has been strong during the last several years. Our core retail deposit base has grown over the past four years and has been adequate to fund the Company's operations. Cash flow from maturities, prepayments and amortization of securities was also used to help fund loan growth. We strive to operate our loan to deposit ratio in a range of 85% to 100%. At December 31, 2015, the Company's loan to deposit ratio was 97.9%. Given current commercial loan pipelines and the continued development of our four existing loan production offices, we are optimistic that we can maintain our loan to deposit ratio at its current level and within our guideline parameters.\nLiquidity can also be analyzed by utilizing the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. Cash and cash equivalents increased by $15.6 million from December 31, 2014, to December 31, 2015, due to $55.7 million of cash provided by financing activities and $9.8 of cash provided by operating activities. This was partially offset by $49.9 million of cash used in investing activities. Within investing activities, cash advanced for new loan fundings and purchases totalled $261.3 million and was $54.2 million higher than the $207.2 million of cash received from loan principal payments and sales. Within financing activities, deposits increased by $33.3 million, which was used to help fund the overall loan growth experienced in 2015. Total FHLB borrowings increased as advances, both short-term and long term, exceeded pay downs by $6 million and was also utilized to fund earning asset growth. Late in December, the Company successfully completed a $7.65 million subordinated debt issuance.\nThe holding company had a total of $30.4 million of cash, short-term investments, and investment securities at December 31, 2015. Additionally, dividend payments from our subsidiaries can also provide ongoing cash to the holding company. At December 31, 2015, our subsidiary Bank had $3.5 million of cash available for immediate dividends to the holding company under applicable regulatory formulas. As such, the holding company has strong liquidity to meet its trust preferred debt service requirements, its subordinated debt interest payments, and its common stock dividends, which in total should approximate $2.1 million over the next twelve months.\nFinancial institutions must maintain liquidity to meet day-to-day requirements of depositors and borrowers, take advantage of market opportunities, and provide a cushion against unforeseen needs. Liquidity needs can be met by either reducing assets or increasing liabilities. Sources of asset liquidity are provided by short-term investment securities, time deposits with banks, federal funds sold, and short-term investments in money market funds. These assets totaled $45 million and $33 million at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Maturing and repaying loans, as well as the monthly cash flow associated with mortgage-backed securities and security maturities are other significant sources of asset liquidity for the Company.\nLiability liquidity can be met by attracting deposits with competitive rates, using repurchase agreements, buying federal funds, or utilizing the facilities of the Federal Reserve or the FHLB systems. The Company utilizes a variety of these methods of liability liquidity. Additionally, the Company's subsidiary bank is a member of the FHLB, which provides the opportunity to obtain short- to longer-term advances based upon the Company's investment in assets secured by one- to four-family residential real estate. At December 31, 2015, the Company had $350 million of overnight borrowing availability at the FHLB, $33 million of short-term borrowing availability at the Federal Reserve Bank and $39 million of unsecured federal funds lines with correspondent banks. The Company believes it has ample liquidity available to fund outstanding loan commitments if they were fully drawn upon.\nCAPITAL RESOURCES... The Company meaningfully exceeds all regulatory capital ratios for each of the periods presented and is considered well capitalized. The asset leverage ratio was 11.41% and the risk based capital ratio was 15.55% at December 31, 2015. We anticipate that we will maintain our strong capital ratios throughout 2016. Capital generated from earnings will be utilized to pay the common stock cash dividend and will also support anticipated balance sheet growth. Our common dividend payout ratio for the full year 2015 was 13.0%. Late in 2015, the Company issued $7.65 million of subordinated debt which qualifies as Tier 2 capital for regulatory capital calculation purposes. This resulted in the holding company cash position being $30.3 million at year end 2015. In the first quarter of 2016, we have used the net proceeds from the subordinated debt issuance along with a meaningful portion of holding company cash to redeem the SBLF preferred stock prior to the interest rate on the SBLF increasing from 1% to 9%. As a result of the SBLF redemption, we expect that holding company cash will be approximately $10.0 million by the end of the first quarter of 2016 and then build as the year progresses.\nOn July 2, 2013, the Federal Reserve approved final rules that substantially amend the regulatory risk-based capital rules applicable to the Company and the Bank. The final rules implement the \u201cBasel III\u201d regulatory capital reforms, as well as certain changes required by the Dodd-Frank Act. The July 2013 final rules generally implement higher minimum capital requirements, add a new common equity tier 1 capital requirement, and establish criteria that instruments must meet to be considered common equity tier 1 capital, additional tier 1 capital or tier 2 capital. The new minimum capital to risk-adjusted assets requirements are a common equity tier 1 capital ratio of 4.5% (6.5% to be considered \u201cwell capitalized\u201d) and a tier 1 capital ratio of 6.0%, increased from 4.0% (and increased from 6.0% to 8.0% to be considered \u201cwell capitalized\u201d); the total capital ratio remains at 8.0% under the new rules (10.0% to be considered \u201cwell capitalized\u201d). Under the new rules, in order to avoid limitations on capital distributions (including dividend payments and certain discretionary bonus payments to executive officers), a banking organization must hold a capital conservation buffer comprised of common equity tier 1 capital above its minimum risk-based capital requirements in an amount greater than 2.5% of total risk-weighted assets. The new minimum capital requirements are effective on January 1, 2015. The capital conservation buffer requirements phase in over a three-year period beginning January 1, 2016 at the 0.625% level. Implementation of the deductions and other adjustments to common equity tier 1 capital began on January 1, 2015 and will be phased-in over a three-year period (beginning at 40% on January 1, 2015, 60% on January 1, 2016 and an additional 20% per year thereafter).\nThe Company's capital position will be more than adequate to meet the revised regulatory capital requirements.\nINTEREST RATE SENSITIVITY... Asset/liability management involves managing the risks associated with changing interest rates and the resulting impact on the Company's net interest income, net income and capital. The management and measurement of interest rate risk at the Company is performed by using the following tools: 1) simulation modeling, which analyzes the impact of interest rate changes on net interest income, net income and capital levels over specific future time periods. The simulation modeling forecasts earnings under a variety of scenarios that incorporate changes in the absolute level of interest rates, the shape of the yield curve, prepayments and changes in the volumes and rates of various loan and deposit categories. The simulation modeling incorporates assumptions about reinvestment and the repricing characteristics of certain assets and liabilities without stated contractual maturities; 2) market value of portfolio equity sensitivity analysis, and 3) static GAP analysis, which analyzes the extent to which interest rate sensitive assets and interest rate sensitive liabilities are matched at specific points in time. The overall interest rate risk position and strategies are reviewed by senior management and the Company's Board on an ongoing basis.\nThe following table presents a summary of the Company's static GAP positions at December 31, 2015:\nTable 44: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr>

Company's balance sheet is still asset sensitive with some improvement noted between years. We continue to see loan customer preference for fixed rate loans given the overall low level of interest rates. Also, we have extended some term advances with the FHLB to help manage our\ninterest rate risk position. Overall, the absolute low level of short interest rates makes this table more difficult to analyze since there is little room for certain deposit liabilities to reprice downward further.\nManagement places primary emphasis on simulation modeling to manage and measure interest rate risk. The Company's asset/liability management policy seeks to limit net interest income variability over the first twelve months of the forecast period to +/-7.5%, which include interest rate movements of 200 basis points. Additionally, the Company also uses market value sensitivity measures to further evaluate the balance sheet exposure to changes in interest rates. The Company monitors the trends in market value of portfolio equity sensitivity analysis on a quarterly basis.\nThe following table presents an analysis of the sensitivity inherent in the Company's net interest income and market value of portfolio equity. The interest rate scenarios in the table compare the Company's base forecast, which was prepared using a flat interest rate scenario, to scenarios that reflect immediate interest rate changes of 100 and 200 basis points. Note that we suspended the 200 basis point downward rate shock since it has little value due to the absolute low level of interest rates. Each rate scenario contains unique prepayment and repricing assumptions that are applied to the Company's existing balance sheet that was developed under the flat interest rate scenario.\nTable 45: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>INTEREST RATE SCENARIO </td> <td> </td> <td>VARIABILITY\nOF NET\nINTEREST\nINCOME </td> <td> </td> <td>CHANGE IN\nMARKET\nVALUE OF\nPORTFOLIO\nEQUITY </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>200 bp increase </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.7 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>19.5 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>100 bp increase </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11.4 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>100 bp decrease </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2.6 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(14.3 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Company believes that its overall interest rate risk position is well controlled. The variability of net interest income is modestly positive in the upward rate shocks due to the Company's short duration investment securities portfolio and scheduled repricing of loans tied to LIBOR or prime. Also, the Company expects that it will not have to reprice its core deposit accounts up as quickly when interest rates rise. The variability of net interest income is negative in the 100 basis point downward rate scenario as the Company has more exposure to assets repricing downward to a greater extent than liabilities due to the absolute low level of interest rates with the fed funds rate currently at 0.25%. The market value of portfolio equity increases in the upward rate shocks due to the improved value of the Company's core deposit base. Negative variability of market value of portfolio equity occurs in the downward rate shock due to a reduced value for core deposits.\nWithin the investment portfolio at December 31, 2015, 85% of the portfolio is classified as available for sale and 15% as held to maturity. The available for sale classification provides management with greater flexibility to manage the securities portfolio to better achieve overall balance sheet rate sensitivity goals and provide liquidity if needed. The mark to market of the available for sale securities does inject more volatility in the book value of equity, but has no impact on regulatory capital. There are 64 securities that are temporarily impaired at December 31, 2015. The Company reviews its securities quarterly and has asserted that at December 31, 2015, the impaired value of securities represents temporary declines due to movements in interest rates and the Company does have the ability and intent to hold those securities to maturity or to allow a market recovery. Furthermore, it is the Company's intent to manage its long-term interest rate risk by continuing to sell newly originated fixed-rate 30-year mortgage loans into the secondary market (excluding construction and any jumbo loans). The Company also sells 15-year fixed-rate mortgage loans into the secondary market as well, depending on market conditions. For the year 2015, 82% of all residential mortgage loan production was sold into the secondary market.\nThe amount of loans outstanding by category as of December 31, 2015, which are due in (i) one year or less, (ii) more than one year through five years, and (iii) over five years, are shown in the following table. Loan balances are also categorized according to their sensitivity to changes in interest rates.\nTable 46: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>ONE YEAR\nOR LESS </td> <td> </td> <td>MORE THAN\nONE YEAR\nTHROUGH\nFIVE YEARS </td> <td> </td> <td>OVER FIVE\nYEARS </td> <td> </td> <td>TOTAL\nLOANS </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT RATIOS) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Commercial </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>46,371 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>68,921 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>65,773 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>181,066 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Commercial loans secured by real estate </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>43,502 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>128,271 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>249,865 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>421,637 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Real estate-mortgage </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>22,384 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>59,343 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>179,213 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>260,940 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Consumer </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,356 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,731 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,257 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>20,344 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>120,613 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>263,266 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>500,108 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>883,987 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Loans with fixed-rate </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> 49,386 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>121,504 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> 281,889 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>452,779 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Loans with floating-rate </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>71,227 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>141,762 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>218,219 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>431,208 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>120,613 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>263,266 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>500,108 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>883,987 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Percent composition of maturity </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13.6 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>29.8 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>56.6 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Fixed-rate loans as a percentage of total loans </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>51.2 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Floating-rate loans as a percentage of total loans </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>48.8 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe loan maturity information is based upon original loan terms and is not adjusted for principal paydowns and rollovers.

The Company incurs off-balance sheet risks in the normal course of business in order to meet the financing needs of its customers. These risks derive from commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit. Such commitments and standby letters of credit involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit risk in excess of the amount recognized in the consolidated financial statements. The Company's exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to these commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit is represented by their contractual amounts. The Company uses the same credit and collateral policies in making commitments and conditional\nobligations as for all other lending. The Company had various outstanding commitments to extend credit approximating $170.5 million and standby letters of credit of $7.5 million as of December 31, 2015. The Company can also use various interest rate contracts, such as interest rate swaps, caps, floors and swaptions to help manage interest rate and market valuation risk exposure, which is incurred in normal recurrent banking activities. The Company had no interest rate contracts outstanding as of December 31, 2015.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES... The accounting and reporting policies of the Company are in accordance with GAAP and conform to general practices within the banking industry. Accounting and reporting policies for the ALL, goodwill, income taxes, and investment securities are deemed critical because they involve the use of estimates and require significant management judgments. Application of assumptions different than those used by the Company could result in material changes in the Company's financial position or results of operation.\nACCOUNT - Allowance for loan losses\nBALANCE SHEET REFERENCE - Allowance for loan losses\nINCOME STATEMENT REFERENCE - Provision (credit) for loan losses\nDESCRIPTION\nThe allowance for loan losses is calculated with the objective of maintaining reserve levels believed by management to be sufficient to absorb estimated probable credit losses. Management's determination of the adequacy of the allowance is based on periodic evaluations of the credit portfolio and other relevant factors. However, this quarterly evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires material estimates, including, among others, likelihood of customer default, loss given default, exposure at default, the amounts and timing of expected future cash flows on impaired loans, value of collateral, estimated losses on consumer loans and residential mortgages, and general amounts for historical loss experience. This process also considers economic conditions, uncertainties in estimating losses and inherent risks in the various credit portfolios. All of these factors may be susceptible to significant change. Also, the allocation of the allowance for credit losses to specific loan pools is based on historical loss trends and management's judgment concerning those trends.\nCommercial and CRE loans are the largest category of credits and the most sensitive to changes in assumptions and judgments underlying the determination of the ALL. Approximately $7.7 million, or 78%, of the total ALL at December 31, 2015 has been allocated to these two loan categories. This allocation also considers other relevant factors such as actual versus estimated losses, economic trends, delinquencies, levels of non-performing and Troubled Debt Restructured (TDR) loans, concentrations of credit, trends in loan volume, experience and depth of management, examination and audit results, effects of any changes in lending policies and trends in policy, financial information and documentation exceptions. To the extent actual outcomes differ from management estimates, additional provision for loan losses may be required that would adversely impact earnings in future periods.\nACCOUNT - Goodwill\nBALANCE SHEET REFERENCE - Goodwill\nINCOME STATEMENT REFERENCE - Goodwill impairment\nDESCRIPTION\nThe Company considers our accounting policies related to goodwill to be critical because the assumptions or judgment used in determining the fair value of assets and liabilities acquired in past acquisitions are subjective and complex. As a result, changes in these assumptions or judgment could have a significant impact on our financial condition or results of operations.\nThe fair value of acquired assets and liabilities, including the resulting goodwill, was based either on quoted market prices or provided by other third party sources, when available. When third party information was not available, estimates were made in good faith by management primarily through the use of internal cash flow modeling techniques. The assumptions that were used in the cash flow modeling were subjective and are susceptible to significant changes. The Company routinely utilizes the services of an independent third\nparty that is regarded within the banking industry as an expert in valuing core deposits to monitor the ongoing value and changes in the Company's core deposit base. These core deposit valuation updates are based upon specific data provided from statistical analysis of the Company's own deposit behavior to estimate the duration of these non-maturity deposits combined with market interest rates and other economic factors.\nGoodwill arising from business combinations represents the value attributable to unidentifiable intangible elements in the business acquired. The Company's goodwill relates to value inherent in the banking and wealth management businesses, and the value is dependent upon the Company's ability to provide quality, cost-effective services in the face of free competition from other market participants on a regional basis. This ability relies upon continuing investments in processing systems, the development of value-added service features and the ease of use of the Company's services. As such, goodwill value is supported ultimately by revenue that is driven by the volume of business transacted and the loyalty of the Company's deposit and customer base over a longer time frame. The quality and value of a Company's assets is also an important factor to consider when performing goodwill impairment testing. A decline in earnings as a result of a lack of growth or the inability to deliver cost-effective value added services over sustained periods can lead to impairment of goodwill.\nGoodwill which has an indefinite useful life is tested for impairment at least annually and written down and charged to results of operations only in periods in which the recorded value is more than the estimated fair value.\nThe Company recorded a $669,000 impairment charge as a result of a goodwill impairment analysis performed in the third quarter of 2014. A qualitative assessment of WCCA indicated that it was more likely than not that the carrying value of WCCA exceeded it fair value. As such, the Company then performed the necessary two-step impairment test. In Step 1, we determined the carrying value of WCCA, including the goodwill, and compared it to the estimated fair value of WCCA. The results of Step 1 indicated that the carrying value of the goodwill exceeded the fair value so it was necessary to move to Step 2 where we measured the amount of the impairment loss. After performing Step 2, we determined that the implied value of the goodwill was less than its carrying costs which caused us to record an impairment charge of $669,000 in the third quarter of 2014. Overall, the voluntary departure of WCCA's former CEO and the related litigation against him for violations of his employment agreement, caused disruption within the WCCA customer base during 2014. This disruption ultimately led to the loss of certain clients and a reduction in the projected earnings capacity of WCCA. These were the key facts and circumstances that led to the goodwill impairment charge in the third quarter of 2014. The Company utilized a discounted cash flow model along with a valuation technique based upon a multiple of revenues to estimate the fair value of WCCA. In 2015, WCCA returned to profitability and stabilized earnings, which reflected that no impairment charge was necessary.\nACCOUNT - Income Taxes\nBALANCE SHEET REFERENCE - Net deferred tax asset\nINCOME STATEMENT REFERENCE - Provision for income taxes\nDESCRIPTION\nThe provision for income taxes is the sum of income taxes both currently payable and deferred. The changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based upon the changes in differences between the basis of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the basis of assets and liabilities as measured by the enacted tax rates that management estimates will be in effect when the differences reverse. This income tax review is completed on a quarterly basis.\nIn relation to recording the provision for income taxes, management must estimate the future tax rates applicable to the reversal of tax differences, make certain assumptions regarding whether tax differences are permanent or temporary and the related timing of the expected reversal. Also, estimates are made as to whether taxable operating income in future periods will be sufficient to fully recognize any gross deferred tax assets. If recovery is not likely, we must increase our provision for taxes by recording a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets that we estimate will not ultimately be recoverable. Alternatively, we may make\nestimates about the potential usage of deferred tax assets that decrease our valuation allowances. As of December 31, 2015, we believe that all of the deferred tax assets recorded on our balance sheet will ultimately be recovered and that no valuation allowances were needed.\nIn addition, the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations. We recognize liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. If we ultimately determine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary, we reverse the liability and recognize a tax benefit during the period in which we determine that the liability is no longer necessary. We record an additional charge in our provision for taxes in the period in which we determine that the recorded tax liability is less than we expect the ultimate assessment to be.\nACCOUNT - Investment Securities\nBALANCE SHEET REFERENCE - Investment securities\nINCOME STATEMENT REFERENCE - Net realized gains (losses) on investment securities\nDESCRIPTION\nAvailable-for-sale and held-to-maturity securities are reviewed quarterly for possible other-than-temporary impairment. The review includes an analysis of the facts and circumstances of each individual investment such as the severity of loss, the length of time the fair value has been below cost, the expectation for that security's performance, the creditworthiness of the issuer and the Company's intent and ability to hold the security to recovery. A decline in value that is considered to be other-than-temporary is recorded as a loss within non-interest income in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. At December 31, 2015, the unrealized losses in the available-for-sale security portfolio were comprised of securities issued by government agencies or government sponsored agencies and certain high quality corporate securities. The Company believes the unrealized losses are primarily a result of increases in market yields from the time of purchase. In general, as market yields rise, the value of securities will decrease; as market yields fall, the fair value of securities will increase. Management generally views changes in fair value caused by changes in interest rates as temporary; therefore, these securities have not been classified as other-than-temporarily impaired. Management has also concluded that based on current information we expect to continue to receive scheduled interest payments as well as the entire principal balance. Furthermore, management does not intend to sell these securities and does not believe it will be required to sell these securities before they recover in value.\nFORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS...

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (MD&A)\nThe following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of the Company should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of the Company including the related notes thereto, included elsewhere herein.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2015, 2014, AND 2013\n2015 SUMMARY OVERVIEW: Net income was $1,374,000, or $0.07 per share, for the fourth quarter of 2015. This was $625,000, or $0.03 per share, higher than the fourth quarter of 2014. Net income for the full year was $5,997,000, or $0.31 per share, which represents an increase by $2,974,000, or $0.16 per share, from 2014. The Company's 2015 results illustrate the effectiveness from very specific profitability improvement actions executed to permit the Company to continue growing the business but to avoid expense increases so as to improve per share profitability.\nWe have previously emphasized the Company's determination to become a significant competitor in every market where the company has a presence. The reports from the marketplace continue to be encouraging. Net loan growth year over year totaled almost $52 million while deposits increased by $33 million as both of these activities set new year ending records for AmeriServ. These marketplace successes also found support from a more efficient company. Operating non-interest expense was $1.7 million, or 3.9%, lower than 2014. The now proven effectiveness of the 2014 profitability efforts has resulted in a new enthusiasm among staff members for ways to trim expenses.\nThis is not to say that 2015 was without its challenges. The worldwide energy turmoil resulted in the bankruptcy of a Western Pennsylvania energy related company. However, the Company's total loan portfolio still contains a lower level of troubled loans than the average level at the Company's peer banks across the nation. The lending standards of the Company remain consistent with the goal of supporting qualified borrowers over the ups and downs of the business cycle.\nThe Federal Reserve's interest rate policies that were adopted in 2008 have severely punished the thrifty, those living on pensions and community banks throughout the country. The squeeze on the banker's net interest margin hurts the availability of credit. It is understandable that the Federal Reserve would respond to events like the freezing of credit markets in 2008, but this seemed to encourage the Federal Reserve to seek to manage the entire economy permanently. Let us hope they can unwind their involvement without further disturbances in this very large and complex economy.\nThe Board and the management team of the Company remain committed to a continuation of time tested banking management practices. These include strong capital, deep liquidity and a conservative balance sheet. To further these goals, in January 2016, the Company paid off the $21 million of US Treasury preferred shares related to the SBLF program using cash on hand and net proceeds from the private placement of $7.65 million in aggregate principal amount of 6.5% fixed rate subordinated notes. These SBLF funds were a way for the Treasury to encourage banks to lend to small businesses. It worked very well! The Company increased its roster of small business borrowers throughout its regions. However, the Treasury would have increased its dividend rate on the preferred shares from 1% per year to 9% per year in February 2016. The Company will continue to lend to small businesses and will continue to be a well-capitalized community bank, but the Company will not experience this dividend rate increase for those shares are retired. This action was spelled out in detail in the Company's press release from January 28, 2016.\nFinally, a comment about the turmoil in financial markets. The domestic economy of the U.S. has been dynamic and ever-changing throughout history. The question we are all forced to answer is how much risk to accept in our economic affairs. The events of 2015 would suggest that it is best to limit risk when contemplating a dynamic economy. This has been and will be our guiding principle as we pursue our climb to financial respectability in 2016 and beyond.\nPERFORMANCE OVERVIEW... The following table summarizes some of the Company's key profitability performance indicators for each of the past three years.\n\nThe Company reported net income available to common shareholders of $5.8 million, or $0.31 per diluted common share, for 2015. This represented a 107% increase in earnings per share from 2014 where net income available to common shareholders totaled $2.8 million, or $0.15 per diluted share. Factors causing this increase in earnings were solid loan and deposit growth in our community banking business which contributed to an increase of $1.3 million, or 3.9%, in net interest income while increasing revenue from our trust and wealth management business contributed to 7.5% growth in non-interest income in 2015. Additionally, operating expenses declined by $2.3 million, or 5.4%, as we improved the ongoing efficiency of the Company by successfully executing several profitability improvement initiatives.\nThe Company reported net income available to common shareholders of $2.8 million, or $0.15 per diluted common share, for 2014. This represented a 42.3% decrease in earnings per share from 2013 where net income available to common shareholders totalled $5.0 million, or $0.26 per diluted share. Factors contributing to this reduction in earnings were a $1.5 million unfavorable swing in the provision for loan losses, a $1.4 million reduction in non-interest revenue, and a $1.1 million increase in non-interest expense. The non-interest expense increase included a $669,000 goodwill impairment charge and a $376,000 fourth quarter pension charge related to 25 employees who elected to participate in an early retirement incentive program. These negative items were partially offset by a $1.2 million increase in net interest income due to continued growth of our loan portfolio while maintaining excellent asset quality.\nThe Company reported net income available to common shareholders of $5.0 million, or $0.26 per diluted common share, for 2013. This represented a 23.8% increase in earnings per share from 2012 where net income available to common shareholders totalled $4.2 million, or $0.21 per diluted share. Growth in total revenue, improved asset quality, and effective capital management caused the increase in earnings per share in 2013. Specifically, a $658,000 increase in net interest income resulted from continued strong growth of our loan portfolio, as total loans grew by $55 million, or 7.5%. Material loan growth occurred in loan categories that qualified for the SBLF through the Company's loan production offices. As a result of this growth in SBLF qualified loans, the Company locked in the lowest preferred dividend rate available under the program of 1% until its redemption in the first quarter of 2016. This lower rate saved the Company $619,000 in preferred stock dividend payments in 2013 and was a key factor contributing to the earnings per share growth. Additionally, the calculation of earnings per share benefitted from a 713,000, or 3.6%, reduction in average shares outstanding due to the success of the Company's common stock repurchase program that was completed in the second quarter of 2013. There was also $325,000 more earnings benefit from negative loan loss provisions in 2013 due to the Company's improved asset quality. These positive items were partially offset by a $1.6 million or 3.9% increase in non-interest expense and slightly higher income tax expense.\nNET INTEREST INCOME AND MARGIN... The Company's net interest income represents the amount by which interest income on earning assets exceeds interest paid on interest bearing liabilities. Net interest income is a primary source of the Company's earnings; it is affected by interest rate fluctuations as well as changes in the amount and mix of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities. The following table summarizes the Company's net interest income performance for each of the past three years:\n\n2015 NET INTEREST PERFORMANCE OVERVIEW... The Company's net interest income increased by $1.3 million, or 3.9%, for the full year of 2015 when compared to the full year 2014 as net interest margin compression was more than fully mitigated by earning asset growth, a greater level of prepayment fees on early loan payoffs and an increased dividend from the FHLB of Pittsburgh. The Company's net interest margin of 3.49% for the full year 2015 was three basis points lower than the net interest margin of 3.52% for the full year 2014. The earning asset growth occurred in the loan portfolio as total loans averaged $857 million for the full year of 2015 which is $52 million, or 6.5%, higher than the $805 million average for the full year of 2014. This loan growth reflects the successful results of the Company's sales calling efforts, with an emphasis on generating commercial loans and owner occupied commercial real estate loans particularly through its loan production offices in the stronger growth markets of Pittsburgh and Altoona in Pennsylvania, Hagerstown, Maryland and Harrisonburg, Virginia. Overall, total interest income increased by $1.4 million, or 3.6%, for the full year 2015.\nTotal interest expense has been well controlled in 2015 as it increased by $123,000, or 1.9%, for the full year of 2015 due to tight control of our cost of funds through disciplined deposit pricing. Total deposit interest expense decreased by $137,000, or 2.8%, in 2015 when compared to last year. Even with this reduction in deposit costs, the Company continues to have a strong loyal core deposit base and success in cross-selling new loan customers into deposit products. Specifically, total deposits averaged $893 million for full year of 2015 which is $21 million, or 2.4%, higher than the $872 million average in 2014. The Company is pleased that a meaningful portion of this deposit growth occurred in non-interest bearing demand deposit accounts. This decreased interest expense for deposits has been more than offset by a $260,000 increase in the interest cost for borrowings as the Company has utilized more FHLB term advances to extend borrowings and provide protection against rising interest rates.\nOverall, the Company expects that it will need to continue to grow earning assets to achieve net interest income growth in 2016 as net interest margin compression is expected to continue given the ongoing challenges of the exceptionally low interest rate environment. Solid commercial loan pipelines suggest that the Company should be able to again grow the loan portfolio in 2016 although we expect pricing pressures on new commercial loans to continue to be intense.\nCOMPONENT CHANGES IN NET INTEREST INCOME: 2015 VERSUS 2014... Regarding the separate components of net interest income, the Company's total interest income in 2015 increased by $1.4 million, or 3.6%, when compared to 2014. This increase was due to a $44.4 million increase in average earning assets due to an increase in average loans, partially offset by a four basis point decline in the earning asset yield from 4.18% to 4.14%. Within the earning asset base, the yield on the total loan portfolio decreased by eight basis points from 4.52% to 4.44% as a greater level of prepayment fees on early loan payoffs was more than offset by the impact from new loans having yields that are below the rate on the maturing instruments that they are replacing. However, the yield on total investment securities increased by seven basis points from 2.60% to 2.67% due to an increased dividend from the FHLB of Pittsburgh and a reduction in premium amortization on mortgage backed securities which resulted from a slowdown in mortgage prepayment speeds in 2015. Investment securities interest revenue declined by $223,000 in 2015 due to a $12 million decrease in the average investment securities portfolio as the Company has utilized cash flow from securities to help fund the previously mentioned loan growth.\nThe Company's total interest expense for 2015 increased by $123,000, or 1.9%, when compared to 2014. This increase in interest expense was due to an increased level of average FHLB borrowed funds which more than offset a lower cost of funds as the cost of interest bearing liabilities declined by one basis point to 0.81%. Management's strategy to carefully price interest rates paid on all deposit categories has not had a negative impact on deposit growth and reflects the loyalty of the bank's core deposit base. The overall cost of interest bearing deposits decreased by two basis points to 0.66% in spite of a $5.4 million increase in the total average volume. The Company has utilized term advances from the FHLB, with maturities ranging between three and five years, to help fund its earning asset growth and manage interest rate risk. The average balance of FHLB term advances has increased by $13 million while the average cost of these advances has increased by 20 basis points to 1.21%. Overall, total FHLB borrowings averaged $71 million or 6.4% of total assets during 2015.\n2014 NET INTEREST INCOME PERFORMANCE OVERVIEW... The Company's net interest income for the full year 2014 increased by $1.2 million, or 3.6%, when compared to the full year 2013. The Company's net interest margin of 3.52% for the full year 2014 was four basis points lower than the net interest margin of 3.56% for the full year 2013. The Company has been able to mitigate this net interest margin pressure and to increase net interest income by both growing its earning assets and reducing its cost of funds. Specifically, the earning asset growth has occurred in the loan portfolio as total loans averaged a record $805 million for the full year 2014 which is $58 million, or 7.8%, higher than the $746 million average for the 2013 year. This loan growth reflects the successful results of the Company's more intensive sales calling efforts, with an emphasis on generating commercial loans and owner occupied CRE loans, which qualify as SBLF loans. Interest income in 2014 has also benefitted from reduced premium amortization on mortgage backed securities due to slower mortgage prepayment speeds. Overall, total interest income increased by $1.1 million in 2014. Additionally, the increase in loans caused the Company's loan to deposit ratio to average 92.3% in 2014 compared to 88.2% in 2013.\nTotal interest expense for the 2014 year declined by $85,000 from the full year 2013 due to the Company's proactive efforts to reduce deposit costs. Even with this reduction in deposit costs, the Company still experienced growth in deposits which reflects the loyalty of our core deposit base and ongoing efforts to cross sell new loan customers into deposit products. Specifically, total deposits averaged a record level of $872 million for the full year 2014 which is $25 million, or 3.0%, higher than the $847 million average for the full year 2013. This decreased interest expense for deposits has been partially offset by a $190,000 increase in the interest cost for borrowings as the Company has utilized more Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) term advances to extend borrowings and provide protection against rising interest rates.\nCOMPONENT CHANGES IN NET INTEREST INCOME: 2014 VERSUS 2013... Regarding the separate components of net interest income, the Company's total interest income in 2014 increased by $1.1 million when compared to 2013. This increase was due to a $44.1 million increase in average earning assets due to an increase in average loans partially offset by a nine basis point decline in the earning asset yield from 4.27% to 4.18%. Within the earning asset base, the yield on the total loan portfolio decreased by 19 basis points from 4.71% to 4.52% as new loans typically have yields that are below the rate on the maturing instruments that they are replacing. However, the yield on total investment securities increased by 10 basis points from 2.50% to 2.60% due primarily to a reduction in premium amortization on mortgage backed securities due to a slowdown in mortgage prepayment speeds in 2014. Investment securities interest revenue declined by $122,000 in 2014 due to an $11 million decrease in the average investment securities portfolio as the Company has utilized cash flow from securities to help fund the previously mentioned loan growth.\nThe Company's total interest expense for 2014 decreased by $85,000, or 1.3%, when compared to 2013. This decrease in interest expense was due to a lower cost of funds as the cost of interest bearing liabilities declined by six basis points to 0.82%. Management's decision to further reduce interest rates paid on all deposit categories has not had a negative impact on deposit growth and reflects the loyalty of the bank's core deposit base. This decrease in funding costs occurred in spite of a $43.4 million increase in the volume of average interest bearing liabilities. The Company has utilized term advances from the FHLB, with maturities ranging between three and five years, to help fund its earning asset growth and manage interest rate risk. The average balance of FHLB term advances has increased by $15 million while the average cost of these advances has increased by only 17 basis points to 1.01%. Overall, total FHLB borrowings averaged $52 million or 4.9% of total assets during 2014.\nThe table that follows provides an analysis of net interest income on a tax-equivalent basis setting forth (i) average assets, liabilities, and stockholders' equity, (ii) interest income earned on interest earning assets and interest expense paid on interest bearing liabilities, (iii) average yields earned on interest earning assets and average rates paid on interest bearing liabilities, (iv) interest rate spread (the difference between the average yield earned on interest earning assets and the average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities), and (v) net interest margin (net interest income as a percentage of average total interest earning assets). For purposes of these tables loan balances include non-accrual loans, and interest income on loans includes loan fees or amortization of such fees which have been deferred, as well as interest recorded on certain non-accrual loans as cash is received. Regulatory stock is included within available for sale investment securities for this analysis. Additionally, a tax rate of approximately 34% is used to compute tax-equivalent yields.\n\nNet interest income may also be analyzed by segregating the volume and rate components of interest income and interest expense. The table below sets forth an analysis of volume and rate changes in net interest income on a tax-equivalent basis. For purposes of this table, changes in interest income and interest expense are allocated to volume and rate categories based upon the respective percentage changes in average balances and average rates. Changes in net interest income that could not be specifically identified as either a rate or volume change were allocated proportionately to changes in volume and changes in rate.\n\nLOAN QUALITY... The Company's written lending policies require underwriting, loan documentation, and credit analysis standards to be met prior to funding any loan. After the loan has been approved and funded, continued periodic credit review is required. The Company's policy is to individually review, as circumstances warrant, each of its commercial and commercial mortgage loans to determine if a loan is impaired. At a minimum, credit reviews are mandatory for all commercial and commercial mortgage loan relationships with aggregate balances in excess of $250,000 within a 12-month period. The Company has also identified three pools of small dollar value homogeneous loans which are evaluated collectively for impairment. These separate pools are for small business relationships with aggregate balances of $250,000 or less, residential mortgage loans and consumer loans. Individual loans within these pools are reviewed and removed from the pool if factors such as significant delinquency in payments of 90 days or more, bankruptcy, or other negative economic concerns indicate impairment. The following table sets forth information concerning the Company's loan delinquency and other non-performing assets.\n\n (1) Non-performing assets are comprised of (i) loans that are on a non-accrual basis, (ii) loans that are contractually past due 90 days or more as to interest and principal payments, (iii) performing loans classified as troubled debt restructuring and (iv) other real estate owned. \nThe Company continues to maintain strong asset quality even though non-performing loans increased late in 2015. The increase was largely due to the transfer into non-accrual status of a $4.1 million loan to a customer in the fracking industry that filed for bankruptcy protection in the fourth quarter. Of this total $4.1 million loan, $2.5 million relates to an equipment loan that was used to finance certain components of a new frack water treatment plant and $1.6 million relates to a loan that was used to finance the purchase of 10 truck tractors and 5 truck trailers. At year-end 2015, the Company had established specific reserves within its allowance for loan losses of $865,000 on the water treatment plant loan and $469,000 on the tractor and trailer loan. Recent developments from the bankruptcy process indicate that the truck tractors and trailers should be returned from the borrower to the Company for disposition in the near future. In regards to the frack water treatment plant, the Company has not yet been able to determine if the plant is fully operational despite the borrower's intent to get the plant in that condition in order to maximize potential value. The Company's ultimate loss on this loan would increase significantly should the plant not be able to be sold as a turn-key operation ready plant. This is the Company's only meaningful direct loan exposure to the energy industry. The continued successful ongoing problem credit resolution efforts of the Company is demonstrated in the table above as levels of non-accrual loans, non-performing assets, classified loans and low loan delinquency levels are well below 1% of total loans. We continue to closely monitor the loan portfolio given the uneven recovery in the economy and the number of relatively large-sized commercial and CRE loans within the portfolio. As of December 31, 2015, the 25 largest credits represented 24.0% of total loans outstanding.\nALLOWANCE AND PROVISION FOR LOAN LOSSES... As described in more detail in the Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates section of this MD&A, the Company uses a comprehensive methodology and procedural discipline to maintain an ALL to absorb inherent losses in the loan portfolio. The Company believes this is a critical accounting policy since it involves significant estimates and judgments. The following table sets forth changes in the ALL and certain ratios for the periods ended.\n\nFor 2015, the Company recorded a $1,250,000 provision for loan losses which represented an increase of $875,000 when compared to the 2014 full year provision of $375,000. The higher provision that was needed this year was largely due to the transfer into non-accrual status of a $4.1 million loan to a customer in the fracking industry that filed for bankruptcy protection in the fourth quarter. The higher provision recorded in 2015 was also needed to support the continuing growth of the loan portfolio and cover net loan charge-offs. For the full year, there were net loan charge-offs of $952,000, or 0.11% of total loans, in 2015 compared to net loan charge-offs of $856,000, or 0.11% of total loans, in 2014. Overall, even with the fourth quarter\nincrease in non-performing assets, the Company continued to maintain", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (MD&A)\nThe following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of the Company should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of the Company including the related notes thereto, included elsewhere herein.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2015, 2014, AND 2013\n2015 SUMMARY OVERVIEW: Net income was $1,374,000, or $0.07 per share, for the fourth quarter of 2015.

Net interest income is a primary source of the Company's earnings; it is affected by interest rate fluctuations as well as changes in the amount and mix of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities. The following table summarizes the Company's net interest income performance for each of the past three years:\nTable 21: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td>2014 </td> <td> </td> <td>2013 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT RATIOS) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Interest income </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>41,881 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>40,441 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>39,343 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Interest expense </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,520 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,397 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,482 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net interest income </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>35,361 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>34,044 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>32,861 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net interest margin </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.49 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.52 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.56 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\n2015 NET INTEREST PERFORMANCE OVERVIEW... The Company's net interest income increased by $1.3 million, or 3.9%, for the full year of 2015 when compared to the full year 2014 as net interest margin compression was more than fully mitigated by earning asset growth, a greater level of prepayment fees on early loan payoffs and an increased dividend from the FHLB of Pittsburgh. The Company's net interest margin of 3.49% for the full year 2015 was three basis points lower than the net interest margin of 3.52% for the full year 2014. The earning asset growth occurred in the loan portfolio as total loans averaged $857 million for the full year of 2015 which is $52 million, or 6.5%, higher than the $805 million average for the full year of 2014. This loan growth reflects the successful results of the Company's sales calling efforts, with an emphasis on generating commercial loans and owner occupied commercial real estate loans particularly through its loan production offices in the stronger growth markets of Pittsburgh and Altoona in Pennsylvania, Hagerstown, Maryland and Harrisonburg, Virginia. Overall, total interest income increased by $1.4 million, or 3.6%, for the full year 2015.\nTotal interest expense has been well controlled in 2015 as it increased by $123,000, or 1.9%, for the full year of 2015 due to tight control of our cost of funds through disciplined deposit pricing. Total deposit interest expense decreased by $137,000, or 2.8%, in 2015 when compared to last year. Even with this reduction in deposit costs, the Company continues to have a strong loyal core deposit base and success in cross-selling new loan customers into deposit products. Specifically, total deposits averaged $893 million for full year of 2015 which is $21 million, or 2.4%, higher than the $872 million average in 2014. The Company is pleased that a meaningful portion of this deposit growth occurred in non-interest bearing demand deposit accounts. This decreased interest expense for deposits has been more than offset by a $260,000 increase in the interest cost for borrowings as the Company has utilized more FHLB term advances to extend borrowings and provide protection against rising interest rates.\nOverall, the Company expects that it will need to continue to grow earning assets to achieve net interest income growth in 2016 as net interest margin compression is expected to continue given the ongoing challenges of the exceptionally low interest rate environment. Solid commercial loan pipelines suggest that the Company should be able to again grow the loan portfolio in 2016 although we expect pricing pressures on new commercial loans to continue to be intense.\nCOMPONENT CHANGES IN NET INTEREST INCOME: 2015 VERSUS 2014... Regarding the separate components of net interest income, the Company's total interest income in 2015 increased by $1.4 million, or 3.6%, when compared to 2014. This increase was due to a $44.4 million increase in average earning assets due to an increase in average loans, partially offset by a four basis point decline in the earning asset yield from 4.18% to 4.14%. Within the earning asset base, the yield on the total loan portfolio decreased by eight basis points from 4.52% to 4.44% as a greater level of prepayment fees on early loan payoffs was more than offset by the impact from new loans having yields that are below the rate on the maturing instruments that they are replacing. However, the yield on total investment securities increased by seven basis points from 2.60% to 2.67% due to an increased dividend from the FHLB of Pittsburgh and a reduction in premium amortization on mortgage backed securities which resulted from a slowdown in mortgage prepayment speeds in 2015. Investment securities interest revenue declined by $223,000 in 2015 due to a $12 million decrease in the average investment securities portfolio as the Company has utilized cash flow from securities to help fund the previously mentioned loan growth.\nThe Company's total interest expense for 2015 increased by $123,000, or 1.9%, when compared to 2014. This increase in interest expense was due to an increased level of average FHLB borrowed funds which more than offset a lower cost of funds as the cost of interest bearing liabilities declined by one basis point to 0.81%. Management's strategy to carefully price interest rates paid on all deposit categories has not had a negative impact on deposit growth and reflects the loyalty of the bank's core deposit base. The overall cost of interest bearing deposits decreased by two basis points to 0.66% in spite of a $5.4 million increase in the total average volume. The Company has utilized term advances from the FHLB, with maturities ranging between three and five years, to help fund its earning asset growth and manage interest rate risk. The average balance of FHLB term advances has increased by $13 million while the average cost of these advances has increased by 20 basis points to 1.21%. Overall, total FHLB borrowings averaged $71 million or 6.4% of total assets during 2015.\n2014 NET INTEREST INCOME PERFORMANCE OVERVIEW... The Company's net interest income for the full year 2014 increased by $1.2 million, or 3.6%, when compared to the full year 2013. The Company's net interest margin of 3.52% for the full year 2014 was four basis points lower than the net interest margin of 3.56% for the full year 2013. The Company has been able to mitigate this net interest margin pressure and to increase net interest income by both growing its earning assets and reducing its cost of funds. Specifically, the earning asset growth has occurred in the loan portfolio as total loans averaged a record $805 million for the full year 2014 which is $58 million, or 7.8%, higher than the $746 million average for the 2013 year. This loan growth reflects the successful results of the Company's more intensive sales calling efforts, with an emphasis on generating commercial loans and owner occupied CRE loans, which qualify as SBLF loans. Interest income in 2014 has also benefitted from reduced premium amortization on mortgage backed securities due to slower mortgage prepayment speeds. Overall, total interest income increased by $1.1 million in 2014. Additionally, the increase in loans caused the Company's loan to deposit ratio to average 92.3% in 2014 compared to 88.2% in 2013.\nTotal interest expense for the 2014 year declined by $85,000 from the full year 2013 due to the Company's proactive efforts to reduce deposit costs. Even with this reduction in deposit costs, the Company still experienced growth in deposits which reflects the loyalty of our core deposit base and ongoing efforts to cross sell new loan customers into deposit products. Specifically, total deposits averaged a record level of $872 million for the full year 2014 which is $25 million, or 3.0%, higher than the $847 million average for the full year 2013. This decreased interest expense for deposits has been partially offset by a $190,000 increase in the interest cost for borrowings as the Company has utilized more Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) term advances to extend borrowings and provide protection against rising interest rates.\nCOMPONENT CHANGES IN NET INTEREST INCOME: 2014 VERSUS 2013... Regarding the separate components of net interest income, the Company's total interest income in 2014 increased by $1.1 million when compared to 2013. This increase was due to a $44.1 million increase in average earning assets due to an increase in average loans partially offset by a nine basis point decline in the earning asset yield from 4.27% to 4.18%. Within the earning asset base, the yield on the total loan portfolio decreased by 19 basis points from 4.71% to 4.52% as new loans typically have yields that are below the rate on the maturing instruments that they are replacing. However, the yield on total investment securities increased by 10 basis points from 2.50% to 2.60% due primarily to a reduction in premium amortization on mortgage backed securities due to a slowdown in mortgage prepayment speeds in 2014. Investment securities interest revenue declined by $122,000 in 2014 due to an $11 million decrease in the average investment securities portfolio as the Company has utilized cash flow from securities to help fund the previously mentioned loan growth.\nThe Company's total interest expense for 2014 decreased by $85,000, or 1.3%, when compared to 2013. This decrease in interest expense was due to a lower cost of funds as the cost of interest bearing liabilities declined by six basis points to 0.82%. Management's decision to further reduce interest rates paid on all deposit categories has not had a negative impact on deposit growth and reflects the loyalty of the bank's core deposit base. This decrease in funding costs occurred in spite of a $43.4 million increase in the volume of average interest bearing liabilities. The Company has utilized term advances from the FHLB, with maturities ranging between three and five years, to help fund its earning asset growth and manage interest rate risk. The average balance of FHLB term advances has increased by $15 million while the average cost of these advances has increased by only 17 basis points to 1.01%. Overall, total FHLB borrowings averaged $52 million or 4.9% of total assets during 2014.\nThe table that follows provides an analysis of net interest income on a tax-equivalent basis setting forth (i) average assets, liabilities, and stockholders' equity, (ii) interest income earned on interest earning assets and interest expense paid on interest bearing liabilities, (iii) average yields earned on interest earning assets and average rates paid on interest bearing liabilities, (iv) interest rate spread (the difference between the average yield earned on interest earning assets and the average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities), and (v) net interest margin (net interest income as a percentage of average total interest earning assets). For purposes of these tables loan balances include non-accrual loans, and interest income on loans includes loan fees or amortization of such fees which have been deferred, as well as interest recorded on certain non-accrual loans as cash is received. Regulatory stock is included within available for sale investment securities for this analysis. Additionally, a tax rate of approximately 34% is used to compute tax-equivalent yields.\nTable 22: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>

The Company's written lending policies require underwriting, loan documentation, and credit analysis standards to be met prior to funding any loan. After the loan has been approved and funded, continued periodic credit review is required. The Company's policy is to individually review, as circumstances warrant, each of its commercial and commercial mortgage loans to determine if a loan is impaired. At a minimum, credit reviews are mandatory for all commercial and commercial mortgage loan relationships with aggregate balances in excess of $250,000 within a 12-month period. The Company has also identified three pools of small dollar value homogeneous loans which are evaluated collectively for impairment. These separate pools are for small business relationships with aggregate balances of $250,000 or less, residential mortgage loans and consumer loans. Individual loans within these pools are reviewed and removed from the pool if factors such as significant delinquency in payments of 90 days or more, bankruptcy, or other negative economic concerns indicate impairment. The following table sets forth information concerning the Company's loan delinquency and other non-performing assets.\nTable 24: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>AT DECEMBER 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td>2014 </td> <td> </td> <td>2013 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT PERCENTAGES) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total accruing loans past due 30 to 89 days </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,396 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,643 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,264 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total non-accrual loans </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,066 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,195 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,871 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total non-performing assets including TDRs(1) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,297 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,917 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,109 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Loan delinquency as a percentage of total loans, net of unearned income </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.50 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.32 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.42 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Non-accrual loans as a percentage of total loans, net of unearned income </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.69 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.27 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.37 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Non-performing assets as a percentage of total loans, net of unearned income, and other real estate owned </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.71 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.35 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.52 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Non-performing assets as a percentage of total assets </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.55 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.27 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.39 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total classified loans (loans rated substandard or doubtful) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>8,566 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>11,229 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>11,779 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) Non-performing assets are comprised of (i) loans that are on a non-accrual basis, (ii) loans that are contractually past due 90 days or more as to interest and principal payments, (iii) performing loans classified as troubled debt restructuring and (iv) other real estate owned. \nThe Company continues to maintain strong asset quality even though non-performing loans increased late in 2015. The increase was largely due to the transfer into non-accrual status of a $4.1 million loan to a customer in the fracking industry that filed for bankruptcy protection in the fourth quarter. Of this total $4.1 million loan, $2.5 million relates to an equipment loan that was used to finance certain components of a new frack water treatment plant and $1.6 million relates to a loan that was used to finance the purchase of 10 truck tractors and 5 truck trailers. At year-end 2015, the Company had established specific reserves within its allowance for loan losses of $865,000 on the water treatment plant loan and $469,000 on the tractor and trailer loan. Recent developments from the bankruptcy process indicate that the truck tractors and trailers should be returned from the borrower to the Company for disposition in the near future. In regards to the frack water treatment plant, the Company has not yet been able to determine if the plant is fully operational despite the borrower's intent to get the plant in that condition in order to maximize potential value. The Company's ultimate loss on this loan would increase significantly should the plant not be able to be sold as a turn-key operation ready plant. This is the Company's only meaningful direct loan exposure to the energy industry. The continued successful ongoing problem credit resolution efforts of the Company is demonstrated in the table above as levels of non-accrual loans, non-performing assets, classified loans and low loan delinquency levels are well below 1% of total loans. We continue to closely monitor the loan portfolio given the uneven recovery in the economy and the number of relatively large-sized commercial and CRE loans within the portfolio. As of December 31, 2015, the 25 largest credits represented 24.0% of total loans outstanding.\nALLOWANCE AND PROVISION FOR LOAN LOSSES... As described in more detail in the Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates section of this MD&A, the Company uses a comprehensive methodology and procedural discipline to maintain an ALL to absorb inherent losses in the loan portfolio. The Company believes this is a critical accounting policy since it involves significant estimates and judgments. The following table sets forth changes in the ALL and certain ratios for the periods ended.\nTable 26: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

$1,250,000 provision for loan losses which represented an increase of $875,000 when compared to the 2014 full year provision of $375,000. The higher provision that was needed this year was largely due to the transfer into non-accrual status of a $4.1 million loan to a customer in the fracking industry that filed for bankruptcy protection in the fourth quarter. The higher provision recorded in 2015 was also needed to support the continuing growth of the loan portfolio and cover net loan charge-offs. For the full year, there were net loan charge-offs of $952,000, or 0.11% of total loans, in 2015 compared to net loan charge-offs of $856,000, or 0.11% of total loans, in 2014. Overall, even with the fourth quarter\nincrease in non-performing assets, the Company continued to maintain"}
