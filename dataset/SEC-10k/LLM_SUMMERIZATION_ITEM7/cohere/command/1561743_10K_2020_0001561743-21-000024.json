MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes and other financial information included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. You should review the Risk Factors\u201d section of this Annual Report for a discussion of important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis or elsewhere in this Annual Report.\nOverview\nWe are a commercial-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on saving and improving the lives of pets. Our mission is to bring to our pets the same kinds of safe and effective medicines that our human family members enjoy. Our core strategy is to identify targets that have already demonstrated safety and efficacy in humans and to develop therapeutics based on these validated targets for pets, primarily dogs and cats. We believe this approach will lead to shorter development times and higher approval rates than pursuing new, non-validated targets. Our current portfolio includes over 20 product candidates in development, predominantly biologics. We also have state-of-the-art biologics manufacturing capabilities and a broad intellectual property portfolio.\nOur first product, Mirataz\u00ae was approved in May 2018 and became commercially available to veterinarians in the United States in July 2018. In November 2019, our second product, Zimeta\u2122 (dipyrone injection) for the control of fever in horses was approved by the FDA and became commercially available in December 2019. In addition, we have multiple other product candidates, predominantly biologics, in various stages of development. We believe there are significant unmet medical needs for pets, and that the pet therapeutics segment of the animal health industry is likely to grow substantially as new therapeutics are identified, developed and marketed specifically for pets.\nMirataz is the first and only transdermal medication specifically developed and FDA-approved for the management of weight loss in cats. Weight loss is a serious and potentially fatal condition that represents the leading cause of visits to the veterinarian for cats. Mirataz, which is formulated with the proprietary Accusorb\u2122 technology, is applied topically to the cat's inner ear (pinna) once a day, providing a more attractive application route compared to oral administration. The product is classified as a weight gain drug and can be used in cats with various underlying diseases associated with unintended weight loss.\nZimeta is the first injectable dipyrone product to receive FDA approval for use in horses. Dipyrone, the active ingredient in Zimeta, is a member of the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) class and has a centrally acting mechanism of action on the hypothalamus where fever originates and is regulated.\nOn March 16, 2020, we entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement whereby we agreed to sell Mirataz, our\ntransdermal drug for the management of weight loss in cats, to Dechra for a cash purchase price of $43 million, of which $38.7 million will be paid on the closing date and $4.3 million will be paid out of escrow beginning in 12 months assuming no escrow claims, alongside an ongoing royalty on global net sales. The acquisition comprises worldwide marketing rights, intellectual property rights, marketing authorizations and associated regulatory documentation, third party supply contracts related to raw material and manufacture of the finished product, and certain product inventory. On April 15, 2020, we completed the sale of Mirataz to Dechra.\nThe European Commission granted marketing authorization of Mirataz in December 2019. Dechra, which is based in the United Kingdom, plans to launch Mirataz in the UK and the European Union in 2021, and intends to conduct the necessary regulatory activities to achieve approvals in other key international markets.\nConcurrent with the sale of Mirataz, we announced a strategic realignment of our business model whereby we plan to rely more on a partnership-based model for commercialization strategy similar to the traditional human biotech commercialization strategy whereby pipeline assets are partnered with larger commercial partners that can maximize product opportunity in return for upfront payments, contingent milestones, and royalties on future sales. Our focus will be on accelerating our deep pipeline of late-stage biologics candidates in canine and feline markets, while stopping most small molecule development for these species. We believe monoclonal antibodies are the future of veterinary medicine, and represent the greatest opportunity for value creation, given large potential markets for our programs and our competitive advantage in biologics. Accordingly, the companion animal commercial infrastructure was substantially reduced. In connection with this restructuring, we eliminated 53 positions, representing about one-third of our workforce. The eliminated positions primarily relate to the companion animal sales force and research and development for small molecule programs. On June 8, 2020, we announced a second restructuring to eliminate an additional 24 positions to streamline our operations and reduce operating expenditures by prioritizing investment in our highest value, late stage programs, especially the interleukin-31 (IL-31) antibody, interleukin-4 receptor (IL-4R) antibody, and parvovirus antibody programs. We completed our restructuring by eliminating the last 5 remaining positions in the third quarter of 2020 and do not anticipate any further reductions in the foreseeable future.\nIn December 2020, we entered into a Distribution and Licensing Agreement granting Dechra Veterinary Products, LLC, an exclusive license under our Patents and Marketing Authorizations to promote, market, sell and distribute Zimeta in the U.S. and Canadian territories, through channels of distribution permitted by applicable laws and regulations in the relevant countries forming part of the territory. We are responsible for the performance of the third party manufacturer for Zimeta, including the performance of all of the duties and including but not limited to, timely delivery of product meeting the applicable specifications. In consideration for the exclusive license and manufacturing services to be performed by us, Dechra will pay KindredBio a milestone payment upon achievement of certain sales milestone, a royalty fee and a price per unit of Zimeta.\nOn May 19, 2020, we entered into an agreement with Vaxart, Inc. for the manufacture of Vaxart's oral vaccine candidate for COVID-19. We recorded contract manufacturing revenue based on the percentage completion of specific milestones for the quarter. In October 2020, we announced the expansion of our manufacturing agreement with Vaxart for COVID-19 and other vaccine candidates.\nBiologic Product Development Updates\nOn March 16, 2020, we announced further prioritization our biologics programs for dogs and cats, which we view as our highest potential assets.\nKIND-016, Tirnovetmab (Interleukin-31)\nIn October 2018, we announced positive topline results from our pilot laboratory effectiveness study of tirnovetmab, KIND-016, a fully caninized, high-affinity monoclonal antibody targeting interleukin-31 (IL-31), for the treatment of atopic dermatitis in dogs. In addition, we announced that the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office has issued a patent (Patent No. 10,093,731) for KindredBio's anti-IL31 antibody.\nIn July 2019, we reported positive topline results from a pilot field effectiveness study for our IL-31 antibody that confirmed the results from our pilot laboratory study. The manufacturing scale up process proceeded and the pivotal efficacy study of KIND-016 was initiated in December 2020.\nCanine atopic dermatitis is an immune-mediated inflammatory skin condition in dogs and is the leading reason owners take their dog to the veterinarian. Atopic dermatitis is a large market, with the leading two products on the market selling over $900 million per year. We are pursuing a multi-pronged approach toward atopic dermatitis, with a portfolio of promising biologics. Our market research tells us there is strong demand for new biological treatments for pruritic dogs, with 70% of veterinarians, and a higher percentage of dermatologists, expressing a need for alternatives to current therapies.\nKIND-032\nIn December 2019 we announced the outcome of a positive pilot laboratory study of KIND-032, a fully caninized monoclonal antibody targeting interleukin-4 (IL-4) receptor, for the treatment of atopic dermatitis in dogs. In the study, 14 laboratory dogs with clinical signs consistent with atopic dermatitis were dosed with placebo or with KIND-032 at two different doses. The Canine Atopic Dermatitis Extent and Severity Index (CADESI) scores were assessed by board-certified veterinary dermatologists who were blinded to treatment assignments. The study demonstrated that KindredBio's antibody was well-tolerated. Although the study was a single-dose study designed primarily to assess safety and pharmacokinetics, evidence of positive efficacy and dose response was observed at Week 1, as measured by CADESI-04. A second pilot study to further assess dosing commenced in the third quarter of 2020.\nThe IL-4 pathway is a key driver of the inflammation that underlies atopic dermatitis and several other allergic diseases. Unlike KIND-025, which binds to IL-4 and IL-13 circulating in blood, KIND-032 binds to the IL-4 receptor on the surface of immune cells.\nKIND-025\nOn March 24, 2020, we announced positive results from our pilot field efficacy study of KIND-025, a canine fusion protein targeting IL-4 and IL-13, for the treatment of atopic dermatitis in dogs. A higher treatment success rate was observed in the KIND-025 group over the placebo group from week 1 through week 4. Positive efficacy signals were also detected with other endpoints including 20mm or higher reduction from baseline in PVAS score. Cell line development is being continued as we further evaluate this program. The IL-4 and IL-13 pathways are key drivers of the inflammation that underlies atopic dermatitis and other allergic diseases. The IL-4/13 SINK molecule binds to both IL-4 and IL-13 circulating in the blood and inhibits their interactions with their respective receptors, thereby modifying the clinical signs associated with atopic dermatitis. We currently do not have plans to prioritize KIND-025 ahead of our other programs.\nKIND-030\nIn August 2019, we announced positive results from our pilot efficacy study of KIND-030, a chimeric, high-affinity monoclonal antibody targeting canine parvovirus (CPV). This was a 12-dog study, of which 4 dogs were treated prophylactically and 2 dogs were treated after establishment of the infection. All treated dogs survived, compared to none in the applicable placebo group. The effect was seen in both prophylaxis setting, as well as in a treatment setting after establishment of infection. On September 16, 2020, we reported positive results from our pivotal efficacy study of KIND-030 in prevention of parvovirus infection in prophylactic treatment. In the randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled study, KIND-030 was administered to dogs as prophylactic therapy to prevent clinical signs of CPV infection. The primary objectives of the study were met. All of the placebo-control dogs developed parvovirus infection as predefined in the study protocol, while none of the KIND-030 treated dogs developed the disease. Furthermore, the parvovirus challenge resulted in 60% mortality rate in the control dogs compared to 0% mortality rate in the KIND-030 treated dogs.\nKIND-030 is being pursued for two indications in dogs: prophylactic therapy to prevent clinical signs of canine parvovirus infection and treatment of established parvovirus infection. The pivotal efficacy study for the treatment indication is expected to complete in the second quarter of 2021. There is no set review timeline at the United States Department of Agriculture Center for Veterinary Biologics. Regulatory approval and review timeline are subject to the typical risks inherent in such a process.\nCPV is the most significant cause of viral enteritis in dogs, especially puppies, with mortality rates reportedly as high as 91% if untreated. Banfield Medical records report that at least 250,000 dogs are infected with parvoviruses each year, excluding emergency hospitals, shelters, specialty hospitals or undiagnosed cases. While there are vaccines available for CPV, they have to be administered multiple times and many puppies don't receive the vaccine at all, or don't get the complete series. This will not replace the need for vaccination; it may just change the timing of the vaccination post administration. There are currently no approved or unapproved treatments for CPV. Currently, owners spend up to thousands of dollars for supportive care for dogs infected with CPV.\nIn December 2020, we announced an agreement granting Elanco Animal Health, Inc. (\"Elanco\") exclusive global rights to KIND-030. Under the terms of the agreement, KindredBio will receive an upfront payment of $500,000, development milestone payments of up to $16 million upon achievement of certain development, regulatory and manufacturing targets, and sales milestones in an aggregate amount of up to $94 million payable throughout the term of the agreement. Furthermore, royalty payments are to range from the low to high teens. The agreement specifies that KindredBio will supply the licensed product to Elanco, and that Elanco will conduct the necessary regulatory activities to achieve approvals in Europe and other key international markets.\nKIND-509\nOn December 21, 2020, we announced positive results from the pilot field efficacy study of our monoclonal antibody against tumor necrosis factor alpha (anti-TNF antibody) for canine inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The study was a randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled pilot effectiveness study that enrolled 10 dogs diagnosed with IBD to assess the efficacy and safety of KindredBio's anti-TNF\u03b1 antibody over a 4-week treatment period. The primary effectiveness variable for this exploratory study was reduction in Canine Inflammatory Bowel Disease Activity Index (CIBDAI) score, which was assessed at Screening and Days 0, 7, 14, 21 and 28. Complete remission, defined as \u2265 75% reduction in average post-dose CIBDAI score from baseline, was achieved in 75% of the anti-TNF\u03b1 group compared to 17% in the placebo group. The treatment effect was early-onset and durable. At Day 7, the first post-dose visit, 75% of the anti-TNF\u03b1 treated dogs showed \u2265 75% reduction of CIBDAI score from baseline, compared to 17% in the placebo group. Furthermore, 50% of the anti-TNF\u03b1 treated dogs achieved and maintained 100% reduction of CIBDAI score from baseline throughout all post-dose visits, whereas none in the placebo group achieved the same result.\nIBD is a chronic disease of the gastrointestinal tract and can affect dogs at any age, but is more common in middle-aged and older dogs. The majority of canine IBD cases involve chronic states of diarrhea, vomiting, gastroenteritis, inappetence, and other symptoms, certain of which are cited as among the most frequent disorders impacting dogs. For certain dog breeds, the prevalence of diarrhea exceeds 5%. Existing treatments can have significant drawbacks, including limited diets and excessive antibiotic use, which can lead to owner frustration, lapses in treatment adherence, or poor quality of life for the affected animal.\nKIND-510a\nIn January 2019, we announced positive topline results from our pilot field effectiveness study of KIND-510a, a long-acting feline recombinant erythropoietin being developed for the management of non-regenerative anemia in cats. It has been engineered by KindredBio to have a prolonged half-life compared to endogenous erythropoietin, a protein that regulates and stimulates production of red blood cells. The pivotal efficacy study for KIND-510a was initiated in the fourth quarter of 2019.\nOn November 25, 2020, KindredBio made the decision to suspend the feline recombinant erythropoietin program following an adverse event. Patient safety is paramount to KindredBio. Given the impact of safety profile on the program's commercial value, and amid the continued rapid growth of the canine dermatitis market, the decision was made to redirect resources toward accelerating the Company's programs for canine atopic dermatitis. KindredBio maintains backup programs for its feline recombinant erythropoietin and may seek to develop these at a later date.\nAnemia is a common condition that is estimated to affect millions of older cats. It is often associated with chronic kidney disease, because kidneys produce erythropoietin and chronic kidney disease leads to decreased levels of endogenous erythropoietin. Chronic kidney disease affects approximately half of older cats, making it a leading cause of feline mortality. Human erythropoietins, which are multi-billion-dollar products in the human market, are immunogenic in cats.\nKIND-511\nKIND-511 is an anti-Tumor Necrosis Factor ( anti-TNF\u201d) treatment for newborn foals. Sick newborn foals, defined as sepsis score \u2265 11 or positive blood culture, are challenging, and difficult to treat and result in\napproximately 50% mortality. We have completed a pilot field study in sick or septic foals to assess safety and efficacy of anti-TNF monoclonal antibody, with positive results. By Kaplan-Meier analysis, the difference in survival between the control and placebo groups was statistically significant (p=0.0293). There is currently no FDA-approved therapy. We have placed this program on indefinite hold to focus on accelerating our late-stage biologic candidates in the canine and feline markets.\nIn addition to the product candidates discussed above, we are in the early stages of development for multiple additional indications, including interleukin antibodies and canine checkpoint inhibitors, with the potential to attain approval for one or more products annually for several years. In all, we have over 20 programs for various indications for dogs and cats.\nEquine Product Development Updates\nWe completed a strategic review of our equine candidates. In December 2020, we entered into a Distribution and Licensing Agreement granting Dechra an exclusive license under our Patents and Marketing Authorizations to promote, market, sell and distribute Zimeta in the US and Canadian territories in return for a royalty on sales and milestone payment upon achievement of a certain sales milestone. We made the decision to discontinue the development of KIND-012 (dipyrone oral gel) and pause the development of KIND-014 to focus on accelerating our late-stage biologic candidates.\nManufacturing\nWe have constructed a Good Manufacturing Practice, or GMP, biologics manufacturing plant in Burlingame, CA which is fully commissioned. We have proceeded to GMP manufacturing of our feline erythropoietin product candidate in January 2018. In addition, we have completed construction and commissioning of our biologics manufacturing lines in our manufacturing plant in Elwood, Kansas in 2019. The Elwood facility includes approximately 180,000 square feet with clean rooms, utility, equipment, and related quality documentation suitable for biologics and small molecule manufacturing.\nFunding\nWe are a commercial-stage company with two products approved for marketing and sale. We have incurred significant net losses since our inception. We incurred cumulative net losses of $244.9 million through December 31, 2020. These losses have resulted principally from costs incurred in connection with investigating and developing our product candidates, research and development activities and general and administrative costs associated with our operations.\nHistorically, our funding has been a combination of private and public offerings. From our initial public offering in December 2013 through December 2019, we raised approximately $257.4 million in net proceeds, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses. On April 8, 2020, we entered into an At Market Offering (\"ATM\") whereby we may offer and sell shares of our common stock from time to time up to $25 million. Through December 31, 2020, 59,211 shares were sold through the ATM, for total gross proceeds of approximately $298,000. Net proceeds, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expense, were approximately $201,000. As of December 31, 2020, we had cash, cash equivalents and investments in available-for-sale securities of $59.9 million.\nFor the foreseeable future, we expect to continue to incur losses, which will increase significantly from historical levels as we expand our product development activities, seek regulatory approvals for our product candidates and begin to commercialize them if they are approved by the Center for Veterinary Medicine branch, or CVM, of the FDA, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, or USDA, or the European Medicines Agency, or EMA. If we are required to further fund our operations, we expect to do so through public or private equity offerings, debt financings, corporate collaborations and licensing arrangements. We cannot assure you that such funds will be available on terms favorable to us, if at all. Arrangements with collaborators or others may require us to relinquish rights to certain of our technologies or product candidates. In addition, we may never successfully complete development of, obtain adequate patent protection for, obtain necessary regulatory approval, or achieve commercial viability for any of our biologic product candidates. If we are not able to raise additional capital on terms acceptable\nto us, or at all, as and when needed, we may be required to curtail our operations, and we may be unable to continue as a going concern.\nFinancial Overview\nRevenues\nOur revenues consist of product revenue resulting from the sale of Mirataz for the management of weight loss in cats and Zimeta for the treatment of fever in horses. In addition, our revenues in 2020 also included the sale of our Mirataz asset, partner royalties, contract manufacturing and partner licensing revenue.\nCost of Revenues\nCost of product revenues consists primarily of the cost of direct materials, direct labor and overhead costs associated with manufacturing, inbound shipping and other third-party logistics costs.\nContract manufacturing costs consist primarily of the cost of direct materials, direct labor and overhead costs associated with manufacturing, rent, facility costs and related machinery depreciation.\nResearch and Development Expense\nAll costs of research and development are expensed in the period incurred. Research and development costs primarily consist of contracted development costs, manufacturing costs, salaries and related expenses for personnel, stock-based compensation expense, regulatory, outside service providers, professional and consulting services, travel costs and materials used in clinical trials and research and development.\nWe are currently pursuing over 10 indications. We typically use our employee and infrastructure resources across multiple development programs. We track outsourced development costs by development compound but do not allocate personnel or other internal costs related to development to specific programs or development compounds as these expenses are included in personnel costs and other internal costs.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expense\nSelling, general and administrative expense consists primarily of personnel costs, including salaries, related benefits and stock-based compensation for employees, consultants and directors. Selling, general and administrative expenses also include rent and other facilities costs, conference and sponsorship activities, travel costs, professional fees for legal, accounting and tax, information technology services, business development activities, costs associated with being a public company and other general and commercial business services.\nAs announced in the strategic realignment of our business model on March 16, 2020, KindredBio transitioned to a partnership-based model for commercialization strategy similar to the traditional human biotech commercialization strategy whereby pipeline assets are partnered with larger commercial partners that can maximize product opportunity in return for upfront payments, contingent milestones, and royalties on future sales. As a result of the sale of our Mirataz asset, our companion animal commercial infrastructure was substantially reduced. Furthermore, the Distribution and Licensing Agreement of Zimeta to Dechra resulted in the dismantling our commercial infrastructure.\nInterest and Other Income (Expenses), Net\nConsist of interest earned on our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, interest expenses on our long-term loan and asset disposals.\nIncome Taxes\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had net operating loss carryforwards for federal and state income tax purposes of $211,817,000 and $117,203,000, respectively, which will begin to expire in fiscal year 2032. The\nFederal NOL generated after 2017 of $118,704,000 will carryforward indefinitely and be available to offset up to 80% of future taxable income each year. Our management has evaluated the factors bearing upon the realizability of our deferred tax assets, which are comprised principally of net operating loss carryforwards. Our management concluded that, due to the uncertainty of realizing any tax benefits as of December 31, 2020, a valuation allowance was necessary to fully offset our deferred tax assets.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates\nOur management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or U.S. GAAP. The preparation of our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, and revenue, costs and expenses and related disclosures during the reporting periods. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and judgments, including those described below. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nWhile our significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 2 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this document, we believe that the estimates and assumptions involved in the following accounting policies may have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nRevenue Recognition\nOur revenues consist of product revenues resulting from the sale of Mirataz and Zimeta, revenue from the sale of our Mirataz asset, the associated partner royalties, revenue from our contract manufacturing service and partner licensing revenue.\nIn accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (\"ASC\") 606, we applied the following steps to recognize revenue that reflects the consideration to which we expect to be entitled to receive in exchange for the promised goods or services (See Note 2):\n1. Identify the contract with a customer\n2. Identify the performance obligations in the contract\n3. Determine the transaction price\n4. Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations\n5. Determine the satisfaction of performance obligation\nProduct Revenue\nOur product revenues consist of sales of Mirataz and Zimeta. We account for a contract with a customer when there is a legally enforceable contract between us and our customer, the rights of the parties are identified, the contract has commercial substance, and collectability of the contract consideration is probable. Our customers could either be distributors who subsequently resell our products to third parties such as veterinarians, clinics or animal hospitals, licensing partners or other third parties.\nRevenue from the sale of our Mirataz asset\nOn March 16, 2020, we entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement to sell Mirataz to Dechra for a cash purchase price of $43 million. On April 15, 2020, we completed the sale of Mirataz to Dechra and received payment of $38.7 million on the closing date. The remaining $4.3 million will be paid out of escrow beginning in 12 months assuming no escrow claims. We concluded our accounting treatment of the asset sale to Dechra meets the scope of ASC Topic 610-20-15-2, \"Gains and Losses from the Derecognition of Nonfinancial Assets\". We considered our strategic realignment of our business model whereby we become a biologics-only company focused on accelerating our deep pipeline of late-stage biologics candidates in canine and feline markets. Accordingly, we plan to rely more on a partnership-based model for commercialization strategy whereby pipeline assets are partnered with larger\ncommercial partners that can maximize product opportunity in return for upfront payment, contingent milestones, and royalties on future sales. Based on the above evaluation in the aggregate, we concluded the proper presentation of the sale of Mirataz to be within operating income as part of revenue. This is presented as a separate line item and described as revenue from asset sale.\nPartner Royalties\nWe recognize royalty revenue in connection with licenses granted under license and development arrangements with partners. Royalties are based upon a percentage of commercial sales of partnered products based on levels of net sales. These sales-based royalties, for which the license was deemed the predominant element to which the royalties relate, are estimated and recognized in the period in which the partners' commercial sales occur. The royalties are generally reported and payable to us within 45 to 60 days of the end of each calendar quarter in which the commercial sales are made. We base our estimates of royalties earned on actual sales information from our partners when available. If actual royalties received are different than amounts estimated, we would adjust the royalty revenue in the period in which the adjustment becomes known.\nContract Manufacturing Revenue\nThe manufacturing revenue stream generally represents revenue from the manufacturing of customer product(s). Under a manufacturing contract, a quantity of manufacturing runs is ordered and the product is manufactured according to the customer's specifications and typically only one performance obligation is included. Each manufacturing run represents a distinct service that is sold separately and has stand-alone value to the customer. The product(s) are manufactured exclusively for a specific customer and have no alternative use. The customer retains control of their product during the entire manufacturing process and can make changes to the process or specifications at their request.\nThe customer and our project team typically have a timeline on each milestone and duration time. They also have an estimated start and finish date. When the project is moving forward, they constantly change to the actual date to track the project progress. The timing has been shared by both parties. This becomes the most important basis for our revenue recognition.\nBecause of the timing effect of revenue recognition, billings and cash collections can be recorded into three different ways: billed trade receivables, contract assets (unbilled receivables), and contract liabilities (customer deposits and deferred revenue). Contract assets are recorded when our right to consideration is conditioned on something other than the passage of time. Contract assets are reclassified to trade receivables on the balance sheet when our rights become unconditional. Contract liabilities represent customer deposits and deferred revenue billed and/or received in advance of our fulfillment of performance obligations. Contract liabilities convert to revenue as we perform our obligations under the contract.\nPartner Licensing Revenue\nPartner licensing revenue consists of revenue that compensates us for services performed, such as formulation, process development, and preparation of pre-clinical and clinical drug product materials under research and development arrangements with partners. Revenues related to research and development are generally recognized as the related services or activities are performed using the output method and in accordance with the contract terms. To the extent that the agreements specify services are to be performed on a fixed basis, revenues are\nrecognized consistent with the pattern of the work performed. In agreements that specify milestones, we evaluate whether the milestones are considered probable of being achieved and estimate the amount to be included in the transaction price using the most likely amount method. If it is probable that a significant revenue reversal would not occur, the value of the associated milestone is recognized at a point in time. Non-refundable milestone payments related to arrangements under which we have continuing performance obligations would be deferred and recognized over the period of performance. Milestone payments that are not within our control, such as submission for approval to regulators by a partner or approvals from regulators, are not considered probable of being achieved until those submissions are submitted by the customer or approvals are received.\nProduct Returns\nConsistent with the industry practice, we generally offer customers a limited right of return of damaged or expired product that has been purchased directly from us. Our return policy generally allows customers to receive credit for expired products within 90 days after the product's expiration date. We estimate the amount of our product revenues that may be returned by our customers and record these estimates as a reduction of product revenues in the period the related product revenues are recognized, as well as within accrued liabilities, in the consolidated balance sheets.\nOur contract manufacturing customer retains control of their product during the entire manufacturing process and can make changes to the process or specifications at their request. There were no product returns.\nFair Value Measurements\nWe invest our cash in money market funds, cash deposits and debt instruments of the U.S. government agency securities. In the current market environment, the assessment of the fair value of the debt securities can be difficult and subjective. Accounting Standards Codification, or ASC, 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosure\" standard describes a fair value hierarchy based on three levels of inputs, of which the first two are considered observable and the last unobservable, that may be used to measure fair value which are the following:\nTable 10: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Level 1 </td> <td> </td> <td>Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities; </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Level 2 </td> <td> </td> <td>Inputs other than Level 1 that are observable, either directly or indirectly, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities; and </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Level 3 </td> <td> </td> <td>Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities. The determination of fair value for Level 3 instruments requires the most management judgment and subjectivity. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nInventories\nWe value inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value. We determine the cost of inventory using the standard-cost method, which approximates actual cost based on a first-in, first-out method. We analyze our inventory levels quarterly and write down inventory subject to expire in excess of expected requirements, or that has a cost basis in excess of its expected net realizable value. These inventory related costs are recognized as cost of product revenues on the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. Currently our inventory consists of finished goods only.\nResearch and Development\nAs part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, we are required to estimate accrued research and development expenses. Examples of estimated accrued expenses include fees paid to vendors and clinical sites in connection with our pivotal studies, to CROs in connection with our toxicology studies, and to contract manufacturers in connection with the production of API and formulated drug.\nWe review new and open contracts and communicate with applicable internal and vendor personnel to identify services that have been performed on our behalf and estimate the level of service performed and the associated costs incurred for the service when we have not yet been invoiced or otherwise notified of the actual cost for accrued expenses. The majority of our service providers invoice us monthly in arrears for services performed or as milestones are achieved in relation to our contract manufacturers. We make estimates of our accrued expenses as of each balance sheet date.\nWe base our accrued expenses related to pivotal studies on our estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to contracts with vendors, our internal resources, and payments to clinical sites based on enrollment projections. The financial terms of the vendor agreements are subject to negotiation, vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows. Payments under some of these contracts depend on factors such\nas the successful enrollment of animals and the completion of development milestones. We estimate the time period over which services will be performed and the level of effort to be expended in each period. If the actual timing of the performance of services or the level of effort varies from our estimate, we adjust the related expense accrual accordingly on a prospective basis. If we do not identify costs that have been incurred or if we underestimate or overestimate the level of services performed or the costs of these services, our actual expenses could differ from our estimates. To date, we have not made any material adjustments to our estimates of accrued research and development expenses or the level of services performed in any reporting period presented.\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe measure stock-based awards at fair value on the date of grant and recognize the corresponding compensation expense of the awards, net of estimated forfeitures, over the requisite service periods, which correspond to the vesting periods of the awards. Generally, we issue stock-based awards with only service-based vesting conditions, and record compensation expense for these awards using the straight-line method. Our intention is to grant stock-based awards with exercise prices equivalent to the fair value of our common stock as of the date of grant.\nThe fair value of each stock-based award is estimated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The expected volatility is based on the historic volatility of our own stock. The expected terms of our awards have been determined utilizing the simplified\u201d method, since our historical experience for option grants is not relevant to our expectations for recent grants. The risk-free interest rate is determined by reference to the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant of the award for time periods approximately equal to the expected term of the award. Expected dividend yield is zero, based on the fact that we have never paid cash dividends and do not expect to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. See Note 10 in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table summarizes the results of our operations for the periods indicated:\nTable 11: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In thousands, except per share amounts) </td> <td>Years Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenues: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net product revenues\n</td> <td>$ </td> <td>878 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,256 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,966 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenue from asset sale\n</td> <td>38,700 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Partner royalty revenue\n</td> <td>535 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Contract manufacturing revenue\n</td> <td>1,551 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Partner licensing revenue </td> <td>500 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total revenues </td> <td>42,164 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,256 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,966 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating costs and expenses </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of product revenues (1)\n</td> <td>3,945 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>587 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>324 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Contract manufacturing costs\n</td> <td>681 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Research and development\n</td> <td>31,281 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>28,310 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>26,399 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling, general and administrative\n</td> <td>21,979 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>37,926 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>26,499 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Restructuring costs\n</td> <td>4,246 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total operating costs and expenses </td> <td>62,132 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>66,823 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>53,222 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss from operations </td> <td>(19,968) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(62,567) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(51,256) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest and other income (expenses), net </td> <td>(1,828) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,178 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,566 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net loss </td> <td>(21,796) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(61,389) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(49,690) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Change in unrealized gains or losses on available-for-sale securities </td> <td>(1) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>24 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>20 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Comprehensive loss </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(21,797) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(61,365) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(49,670) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net loss per share attributable to common stockholders, basic and diluted\n</td> <td>$ </td> <td>(0.55) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(1.59) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(1.60) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Weighted-average number of common shares outstanding, basic and diluted\n</td> <td>39,289 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>38,657 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>31,001 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1) Includes $3,826 finished goods write-off related to the Dechra agreements signed in 2020. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenues\nOur product revenues consist of sale of Mirataz and Zimeta, revenue from the sale of our Mirataz asset, the associated partner royalties, revenue from our contract manufacturing service and partner licensing revenue.\nProduct revenue\nOur product revenues consist of sales of Mirataz and Zimeta. Also included in product sale is revenue derived from co-marketing products for our partners in conjunction with sales of Mirataz and Zimeta.\nOur net product revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020 decreased by 79.4% to $878,000 compared with $4,256,000 for the same period in 2019. The decrease is mainly due our sale of the Mirataz asset to Dechra in April 2020 compared with twelve months of Mirataz product sales in 2019. Net product revenue for Zimeta in 2020 was $27,000 compared with $127,000 in 2019, reflecting a downturn in equine events and transportation as a result of COVID-19. In conjunction with Mirataz and Zimeta, we also recorded $29,000 in revenue derived from co-marketing products for our partners, Butterfly Networks and Astaria Global in 2020.\nOur product sale revenue for the year ended December 31, 2019 increased by 116.5% to $4,256,000 compared with $1,966,000 for the same period in 2018. The increase is mainly due to a full year of Mirataz product\nsales while Mirataz only became commercial available to veterinarians in the United States in July 2018. In addition, our second product, Zimeta\u2122 (dipyrone injection) for the control of fever in horses was approved by the FDA and became commercially available in December 2019.\nAs a result of our licensing agreements with Dechra, we will be recording partner royalty revenues related to these products instead of product revenues going forward.\nRevenue from asset sale\nOur revenue from the Mirataz asset sale to Dechra for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $38.7 million. The remaining $4.3 million will be paid out of escrow beginning in 12 months assuming no escrow claims. There were no asset sales in 2019 or 2018.\nPartner royalties\nOur partner royalty revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $535,000, resulting from Dechra's net sales of Mirataz. There were no partner royalty revenues in 2019 or 2018.\nContract manufacturing revenue\nOn May 19, 2020, we entered into an agreement with Vaxart, Inc. for the manufacture of Vaxart's oral vaccine candidate for COVID-19. We recorded contract manufacturing revenue of $1.6 million based on the percentage completion of specific milestones. We did not have any contract manufacturing revenue in prior years.\nPartner licensing revenue\nOur partner licensing revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $0.5 million due to a non-refundable upfront payment from Elanco for the exclusive global rights to KIND-030. There were no partner licensing revenues in prior years.\nCost of Revenues\nOur cost of product sales for the year ended December 31, 2020 increased by 572.1% to $3,945,000 compared with $587,000 for the same period in 2019. Cost of product revenues consists primarily of the cost of direct materials, direct labor and overhead costs associated with manufacturing, inbound shipping and other third-party logistics costs. The increase is mainly due to the $3.8 million finished goods write-off related to the Dechra agreements signed in 2020, the majority of which is related to Mirataz. All remaining Mirataz products not included in the transferred assets to Dechra due to the transition to proprietary Dechra brand labelling was written off.\nOur cost of product sales for the year ended December 31, 2019 increased by 81.2% to $587,000 compared with $324,000 for the same period in 2018. Cost of product revenues consists primarily of the cost of direct materials, direct labor and overhead costs associated with manufacturing, inbound shipping and other third-party logistics costs. The increase reflected a full year of Mirataz product sales in 2019.\nOur cost of contract manufacturing for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $681,000. Contract manufacturing costs consist primarily of the cost of direct materials, direct labor and overhead costs associated with manufacturing, rent, facility costs and related machinery depreciation. We did not have any contract manufacturing costs in prior years.\nConcentrations of credit risk\nOur revenue was generated entirely from sales within the United States. Our product sales to three large distributors, namely MWI Animal Health, Henry Schein (now Covetrus North America) and Midwest Veterinary Supply, each accounted for more than 10% of gross product revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020. On a combined basis, in 2020, these distributors accounted for approximately 78% of our product sales.\nOur accounts receivable from amounts billed for contract manufacturing services in 2020 is derived from one customer. The contract requires up-front payment and installment payments during the service period. We perform periodic evaluations of the financial condition of our customers and generally do not require collateral, but we can terminate any contract if a material default occurs.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, our product sales to three large distributors, namely Henry Schein (now Covetrus North America), MWI Animal Health and Patterson Veterinary Supply each accounted for more than 10% of total revenues. On a combined basis, in 2019, these distributors accounted for approximately 85% of our product sales. We did not provide any contract manufacturing services in 2019 or 2018.\nProduct returns\nOur return policy generally allows customers to receive credit for expired products within 90 days after the product's expiration date. We estimated product return liabilities of 3% for Zimeta of gross revenue using probability-weighted available industry data and data provided by our distributors such as the inventories remaining in the distribution channel. Adjustments will be made in the future if actual results vary from our estimates.\nAccounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts\nAccounts receivable are stated at their carrying values, net of any allowances for doubtful accounts. Accounts receivable consist primarily of amounts due from distributors, our contract manufacturing customer, and licensing partner for which collection is probable based on the customer's intent and ability to pay. Receivables are evaluated for collection probability on a regular basis and an allowance for doubtful accounts is recorded, if necessary. We have no allowance for doubtful accounts as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, as our analysis did not uncover any collection risks.\nResearch and Development Expense\nAll costs of research and development are expensed in the period incurred. Research and development costs consist primarily of salaries and related expenses for personnel, stock-based compensation expense, fees paid to consultants, outside service providers, professional services, travel costs and materials used in clinical trials and research and development. We typically use our employee and infrastructure resources across multiple development programs.\nResearch and development expense was as follows for the periods indicated:\nTable 12: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In thousands except percentages) </td> <td>Years Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td>Annual percent change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020/2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019/2018 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Payroll and related\n</td> <td>$ </td> <td>10,868 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>12,646 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>10,204 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(14) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>24 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consulting\n</td> <td>800 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,406 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,360 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(67) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Field trial costs, including materials\n</td> <td>3,097 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,915 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(23) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Biologics development and supplies\n</td> <td>7,269 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,526 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,890 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>188 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(35) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Stock-based compensation\n</td> <td>1,883 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,848 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,746 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other\n</td> <td>7,364 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,869 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,284 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>51 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>31,281 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>28,310 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>26,399 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>7 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, research and development expense related primarily to advancing the development of KIND-030, KIND-016, KIND-032, KIND-510a and other early stage biologic programs.\nResearch and development expenses for the year ended December 31, 2020 increased by 10% to $31.3 million compared with $28.3 million for the same period in 2019. The increase was primarily due to the inclusion of expenses from the Kansas facility as it began to manufacture clinical trial material offset by lower costs as we stopped most small molecule development and prioritize our focus on late stage biologic candidates. Prior to 2020, construction and commissioning expenditures associated with the Kansas facility had been categorized as general\nand administrative expenses. Outsourced research and development expense related to KIND-030, KIND-510a, KIND-014 and other product development programs for the year ended December 31, 2020 were $1.3 million, $0.8 million, $0.4 million and $0.9 million, respectively.\nResearch and development expenses for the year ended December 31, 2019 increased by 7% to $28.3 million compared with $26.4 million for the same period in 2018. Payroll and related expenses increased by $2.4 million due to increase in headcount as we advance our biologics development and manufacturing programs. Higher regulatory and research fees, consulting, depreciation, rent as a result of expanded lab spaces and other facility costs also contributed to the increase in expenses, offset by lower non-GMP production and testing expenses. Outsourced research and development expense related to KIND-014, KIND-012, CAD programs, KIND-510a and other product development programs for the year ended December 31, 2019 were $1.7 million, $0.6 million, $0.5 million, $0.4 million and $1.3 million, respectively.\nWe expect research and development expense to decrease for the foreseeable future. While we expect biologics manufacturing expenses to increase due to the manufacture of KIND-016 and KIND-030 antibodies for our pivotal field studies, our excess manpower and capacity allow us to take on some contract manufacturing services thereby subsidizing the cost of our manufacturing facilities. Labor and associated benefits, supplies and facility expenses related to contract manufacturing services are recorded as cost of goods sold and would offset increases in our biologics manufacturing expenses, resulting in a net decrease in research and development expenses. Due to the inherently unpredictable nature of our development, we cannot reasonably estimate or predict the nature, specific timing or estimated costs of the efforts that will be necessary to complete the development of our product candidates.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expense\nThe composition of general and administrative expense was as follows for the periods indicated:\nTable 13: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In thousands except percentages) </td> <td>Years Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td>Annual percent change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020/2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019/2018 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Payroll and related\n</td> <td>$ </td> <td>6,294 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>15,385 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>9,498 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(59) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>62 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consulting, professional and legal fees\n</td> <td>4,115 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,523 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,561 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Stock-based compensation\n</td> <td>5,704 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,509 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,531 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>22 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Corporate and marketing expenses\n</td> <td>2,705 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,022 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,420 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(46) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other\n</td> <td>3,161 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,487 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,489 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(63) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>89 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>21,979 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>37,926 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>26,499 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(42) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>43 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nSelling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2020 decreased by 42% to $22.0 million compared with $37.9 million for the same period in 2019. The $15.9 million year-over-year decrease was mainly due to the re-categorization of Kansas plant expenditures as research and development expenses, and lower payroll and related expenses including marketing expenses as a result of the elimination of our companion animal sales force. The decrease was offset by higher legal fees.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2019 increased by 43% to $37.9 million compared with $26.5 million for the same period in 2018. Headcount increase was due to the expansion of our commercial organization and administrative personnel to support the company's growth. Sales and marketing expenses account for a big component of the increase. Higher stock-based compensation expense also contributed to the increase.\nWe expect selling, general and administrative expense to decrease going forward as a result of our transition to a partnership-focused commercialization strategy whereby pipeline assets are out-licensed to larger commercial partners that can maximize product opportunity in return for upfront payment, contingent milestones, and royalties on future sales.\nRestructuring Costs\nWe recorded restructuring charges of approximately $4.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The restructuring charge of approximately $1.7 million in the first quarter of 2020 was the result of the elimination of 53 positions due to the strategic realignment of our business model whereby we became a biologics-only company while stopping most small molecule development. All charges pertaining to this restructuring have been paid. The restructuring charge of approximately $2.3 million in the second quarter was the result of prioritizing our most attractive late stage programs and substantially reducing our expenses to best position the company for success with the new business model. Another 24 employees were impacted by the restructuring and all restructuring charges have been paid by the third quarter of 2020. We further eliminated another 5 positions in the third quarter and incurred a restructuring charge of approximately $0.3 million related to severance payments and health care benefits, exclusive of stock compensation. We do not anticipate any further reductions in the foreseeable future.\nInterest and Other (Expenses) Income, Net\nTable 14: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In thousands) </td> <td>Years Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest and other (expenses) income, net\n</td> <td>$ </td> <td>(1,828) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,178 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,566 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe decrease of approximately $3.0 million in 2020 compared to 2019 was the result of $1.4 million lower interest income due to lower interest rate and cash balance. In addition, the change of further impacted by interest expense and amortization of loan issuance costs of $1.7 million.\nThe decrease of approximately $388,000 in 2019 compared to 2018 was mainly caused by the borrowing on a loan, which incurred approximately $461,000 of interest expenses. In addition, the change was further impacted by disposals of fixed assets of approximately $212,000, offset by an increase in interest income of $339,000 from our investments.\nQuarterly Result of

since our inception in September 2012. We incurred net losses of $21.8 million, $61.4 million and $49.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. These losses have resulted primarily from costs incurred in research and development activities and selling, general and administrative costs associated with our operations. As of December 31, 2020, we had an accumulated deficit of $244.9 million.\nFrom our initial public offering in December 2013 through December 2019, we raised approximately $257.4 million in net proceeds, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses. In April 2020, we entered into an At Market Offering (\"ATM\") whereby we may offer and sell shares of our common stock from time to time up to $25 million. Through December 31, 2020, 59,211 shares were sold through the ATM, for total gross proceeds of approximately $298,000. Net proceeds, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expense, were approximately $201,000. As of December 31, 2020, we had cash, cash equivalents and investments in available-for-sale securities of approximately $59.9 million. We believe our cash, cash equivalents and investments along with the net reduction in our workforce, remaining proceeds from the\nMirataz sale, and revenues from royalties, partner licensing and contract manufacturing will be sufficient to fund our planned operations for at least another 24 months. In addition, our ATM facility will provide us with access to additional cash and extend our runway, if required.\nThe following table shows a summary of our cash flows for the periods set forth below:\nTable 16: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In thousands) </td> <td>Years Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash flows used in operating activities\n</td> <td>$ </td> <td>(9,857) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(56,342) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(45,035) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash flows provided by (used in) investing activities\n</td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,773 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(47,816) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>16,604 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash flows (used in) provided by financing activities\n</td> <td>$ </td> <td>(282) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>63,842 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>49,920 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet cash used in operating activities\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, net cash used in operating activities was $9.9 million. Our net loss of $21.8 million included non-cash charges primarily in the form of share-based compensation of $7.6 million, depreciation expense of $4.7 million, amortization of the debt discount of long-term loan of $348,000, Mirataz and Zimeta finished goods write-off of $3.8 million, loss on disposal of property and equipment of $56,000, partially offset by discounts and amortization of premiums on investments of $28,000. The non-cash charges were further impacted by changes in operating assets and liabilities that resulted in approximately $4.5 million of cash used in operating activities.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, net cash used in operating activities was $56.3 million. Our net loss of $61.4 million included non-cash charges primarily in the form of share-based compensation of $7.4 million, depreciation expense of $2.5 million, amortization of the debt discount of long-term loan of $84,000, shares issued for consulting services of $61,000, and loss on disposal of property and equipment of $212,000, partially offset by discounts and amortization of premiums on investments of $513,000. The non-cash charges were partly impacted by changes in operating assets and liabilities that resulted in approximately $4.7 million of cash provided by operating activities.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, net cash used in operating activities was $45.0 million. Our net loss of $49.7 million included non-cash charges primarily in the form of share-based compensation of $6.3 million, depreciation expense of $805,000, loss on disposal of property and equipment of $34,000, partially offset by discount of premiums on investments of $179,000. The non-cash charges were partly offset by changes in operating assets and liabilities that resulted in $2.3 million of cash used in operating activities.\nNet cash provided by (used in) investing activities\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, net cash provided by investing activities was $5.8 million, which resulted from $9.3 million related to proceeds of sales and maturities of investments, net of purchases of investments, further impacted by $3.7 million in purchases of property and equipment, of which $58,000 is included in accounts payable and accrued liabilities at December 31, 2020, also positively affected by sale of equipment of $82,000.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, net cash used in investing activities was $47.8 million, which resulted from $39.4 million related to purchase of investments, net of the proceeds of sales and maturities of investments, further impacted by $9.7 million in purchases of property and equipment, of which $1.3 million is included in accounts payable and accrued liabilities at December 31, 2019, also positively affected by sale of equipment of $5,000.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, net cash provided by investing activities was $16.6 million, which resulted from $30.3 million related to the proceeds of sales and maturities of investments, net of purchases of investments, offset by $20.1 million in purchases of property and equipment, of which $6.2 million is included in accounts payable and accrued liabilities at December 31, 2018, also positively affected by sale of equipment of $248,000.\nNet cash (used in) provided by financing activities\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, net cash used in financing activities consisted of approximately $201,000 in net proceeds from the sale of common stock through an ATM and follow-on public offering, and approximately $383,000 from the exercise of stock options and purchase of ESPP shares, offset by payment of $866,000 related to restricted stock awards tax liability on net settlement.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, net cash provided by financing activities consisted of approximately $43.1 million in net proceeds from the sale of common stock through an ATM and follow-on public offering, net proceeds of $19.2 million from a loan agreement and approximately $2.0 million from the exercise of stock options and purchase of ESPP shares, offset by payment of $493,000 related to restricted stock awards tax liability on net settlement.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, net cash provided by net cash provided by financing activities consisted of approximately $49.2 million in net proceeds from the sale of common stock through an ATM and follow-on public offering, and approximately $1.0 million from stock option exercises and purchase of ESPP shares, offset by payment of $247,000 related to restricted stock awards tax liability on net settlement.\nFuture Funding Requirements\nWe anticipate that we will continue to incur losses for the next several years due to expenses relating to:\n\u2022pivotal trials of our product candidates;\n\u2022toxicology studies for our product candidates; and\n\u2022biologics manufacturing.\nWe believe that our cash, cash equivalents and investments along with the net reduction in our workforce,\nremaining proceeds from the Mirataz sale, and revenues from royalties, partner licensing and contract manufacturing will be sufficient to fund our planned operations for at least another 24 months. In addition, our April 8, 2020 ATM facility will provide us with access to additional cash and extend our runway, if required. However, our operating plan may change as a result of many factors currently unknown to us, and we may need to seek additional funds sooner than planned, through public or private equity or debt financings or other sources, such as strategic collaborations. Such financing may result in dilution to stockholders, imposition of debt covenants and repayment obligations or other restrictions that may affect our business. In addition, we may seek additional capital due to favorable market conditions or strategic considerations even if we believe we have sufficient funds for our current or future operating plans.\nOur future capital requirements depend on many factors, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022the scope, progress, results and costs of researching and developing our current or future product candidates;\n\u2022the timing of, and the costs involved in, obtaining regulatory approvals for any of our current or future product candidates;\n\u2022the number and characteristics of the product candidates we pursue;\n\u2022the cost of manufacturing our current and future product candidates and any products we successfully out-license, including cost of building internal biologics manufacturing capacity;\n\u2022the expenses needed to attract and retain skilled personnel;\n\u2022the costs associated with being a public company;\n\u2022our ability to establish and maintain strategic collaborations, licensing or other arrangements and the financial terms of such agreements; and\n\u2022the costs involved in preparing, filing, prosecuting, maintaining, defending and enforcing current and future patents, including litigation costs and the outcome of any such litigation.\nContractual Obligations\nWe have non-cancelable operating leases for two office spaces and expanded laboratory space under which we are obligated to make minimum lease payments totaling $4.1 million through May 2025, the timing of which is described in more detail in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. In addition, we have five operating leases for equipment under which we are obligated to make minimum lease payments totaling $81,000 through 2027.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nSince inception, we have not engaged in the use of any off-balance sheet arrangements, such as structured finance entities, special purpose entities or variable interest entities.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nIn March 2020, the FASB issued ASU No. 2020-04, \"Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848)\", changes to the interbank offered rates (IBORs), and, particularly, the risk of cessation of the London Interbank Offered Rate (\"LIBOR\"). The amendments provide optional expedients and exceptions for applying U.S. GAAP to contracts that reference LIBOR expected to be discontinued because of reference rate reform. The expedients and exceptions do not apply to contract modifications made after December 31, 2022. The following optional expedients are permitted for contracts that are modified because of reference rate reform and that meet certain scope guidance: Modifications of contracts within the scope of ASC Topic 470, Debt, should be accounted for by prospectively adjusting the effective interest rate. The amendment also permits an entity to consider contract modifications due to reference rate reform to be an event that does not require contract remeasurement at the modification date or reassessment of a previous accounting determination. When elected, the optional expedients for contract modifications must be applied consistently for all contracts. It applies to all entities within the scope of the affected accounting guidance and will take effect as of March 12, 2020 through December 31, 2022. We have one loan contract which references LIBOR rate. We have not modified the contract with our lenders yet. We are currently evaluating the new guidance and have not determined the impact this standard may have on our financial statements.\nWe do not believe there are any other recently issued standards not yet effective that will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements when the standards become effective.", "summary": "- Cytocom Inc.

7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes and other financial information included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. You should review the Risk Factors\u201d section of this Annual Report for a discussion of important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis or elsewhere in this Annual Report.\nOverview\nWe are a commercial-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on saving and improving the lives of pets. Our mission is to bring to our pets the same kinds of safe and effective medicines that our human family members enjoy. Our core strategy is to identify targets that have already demonstrated safety and efficacy in humans and to develop therapeutics based on these validated targets for pets, primarily dogs and cats. We believe this approach will lead to shorter development times and higher approval rates than pursuing new, non-validated targets. Our current portfolio includes over 20 product candidates in development, predominantly biologics. We also have state-of-the-art biologics manufacturing capabilities and a broad intellectual property portfolio.\nOur first product, Mirataz\u00ae was approved in May 2018 and became commercially available to veterinarians in the United States in July 2018. In November 2019, our second product, Zimeta\u2122 (dipyrone injection) for the control of fever in horses was approved by the FDA and became commercially available in December 2019. In addition, we have multiple other product candidates, predominantly biologics, in various stages of development. We believe there are significant unmet medical needs for pets, and that the pet therapeutics segment of the animal health industry is likely to grow substantially as new therapeutics are identified, developed and marketed specifically for pets.\nMirataz is the first and only transdermal medication specifically developed and FDA-approved for the management of weight loss in cats. Weight loss is a serious and potentially fatal condition that represents the leading cause of visits to the veterinarian for cats. Mirataz, which is formulated with the proprietary Accusorb\u2122 technology, is applied topically to the cat's inner ear (pinna) once a day, providing a more attractive application route compared to oral administration. The product is classified as a weight gain drug and can be used in cats with various underlying diseases associated with unintended weight loss.\nZimeta is the first injectable dipyrone product to receive FDA approval for use in horses. Dipyrone, the active ingredient in Zimeta, is a member of the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) class and has a centrally acting mechanism of action on the hypothalamus where fever originates and is regulated.\nOn March 16, 2020, we entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement whereby we agreed to sell Mirataz, our\ntransdermal drug for the management of weight loss in cats, to Dechra for a cash purchase price of $43 million, of which $38.7 million will be paid on the closing date and $4.3 million will be paid out of escrow beginning in 12 months assuming no escrow claims, alongside an ongoing royalty on global net sales. The acquisition comprises worldwide marketing rights, intellectual property rights, marketing authorizations and associated regulatory documentation, third party supply contracts related to raw material and manufacture of the finished product, and certain product inventory. On April 15, 2020, we completed the sale of Mirataz to Dechra.\nThe European Commission granted marketing authorization of Mirataz in December 2019. Dechra, which is based in the United Kingdom, plans to launch Mirataz in the UK and the European Union in 2021, and intends to conduct the necessary regulatory activities to achieve approvals in other key international markets.\nConcurrent with the sale of Mirataz, we announced a strategic realignment of our business model whereby we plan to rely more on a partnership-based model for commercialization strategy similar to the traditional human biotech commercialization strategy whereby pipeline assets are partnered with larger commercial partners that can maximize product opportunity in return for upfront payments, contingent milestones, and royalties on future sales. Our focus will be on accelerating our deep pipeline of late-stage biologics candidates in canine and feline markets, while stopping most small molecule development for these species. We believe monoclonal antibodies are the future of veterinary medicine, and represent the greatest opportunity for value creation, given large potential markets for our programs and our competitive advantage in biologics. Accordingly, the companion animal commercial infrastructure was substantially reduced. In connection with this restructuring, we eliminated 53 positions, representing about one-third of our workforce. The eliminated positions primarily relate to the companion animal sales force and research and development for small molecule programs. On June 8, 2020, we announced a second restructuring to eliminate an additional 24 positions to streamline our operations and reduce operating expenditures by prioritizing investment in our highest value, late stage programs, especially the interleukin-31 (IL-31) antibody, interleukin-4 receptor (IL-4R) antibody, and parvovirus antibody programs. We completed our restructuring by eliminating the last 5 remaining positions in the third quarter of 2020 and do not anticipate any further reductions in the foreseeable future.\nIn December 2020, we entered into a Distribution and Licensing Agreement granting Dechra Veterinary Products, LLC, an exclusive license under our Patents and Marketing Authorizations to promote, market, sell and distribute Zimeta in the U.S. and Canadian territories, through channels of distribution permitted by applicable laws and regulations in the relevant countries forming part of the territory. We are responsible for the performance of the third party manufacturer for Zimeta, including the performance of all of the duties and including but not limited to, timely delivery of product meeting the applicable specifications. In consideration for the exclusive license and manufacturing services to be performed by us, Dechra will pay KindredBio a milestone payment upon achievement of certain sales milestone, a royalty fee and a price per unit of Zimeta.\nOn May 19, 2020, we entered into an agreement with Vaxart, Inc. for the manufacture of Vaxart's oral vaccine candidate for COVID-19. We recorded contract manufacturing revenue based on the percentage completion of specific milestones for the quarter. In October 2020, we announced the expansion of our manufacturing agreement with Vaxart for COVID-19 and other vaccine candidates.\nBiologic Product Development Updates\nOn March 16, 2020, we announced further prioritization our biologics programs for dogs and cats, which we view as our highest potential assets.\nKIND-016, Tirnovetmab (Interleukin-31)\nIn October 2018, we announced positive topline results from our pilot laboratory effectiveness study of tirnovetmab, KIND-016, a fully caninized, high-affinity monoclonal antibody targeting interleukin-31 (IL-31), for the treatment of atopic dermatitis in dogs. In addition, we announced that the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office has issued a patent (Patent No. 10,093,731) for KindredBio's anti-IL31 antibody.\nIn July 2019, we reported positive topline results from a pilot field effectiveness study for our IL-31 antibody that confirmed the results from our pilot laboratory study. The manufacturing scale up process proceeded and the pivotal efficacy study of KIND-016 was initiated in December 2020.\nCanine atopic dermatitis is an immune-mediated inflammatory skin condition in dogs and is the leading reason owners take their dog to the veterinarian. Atopic dermatitis is a large market, with the leading two products on the market selling over $900 million per year. We are pursuing a multi-pronged approach toward atopic dermatitis, with a portfolio of promising biologics. Our market research tells us there is strong demand for new biological treatments for pruritic dogs, with 70% of veterinarians, and a higher percentage of dermatologists, expressing a need for alternatives to current therapies.\nKIND-032\nIn December 2019 we announced the outcome of a positive pilot laboratory study of KIND-032, a fully caninized monoclonal antibody targeting interleukin-4 (IL-4) receptor, for the treatment of atopic dermatitis in dogs. In the study, 14 laboratory dogs with clinical signs consistent with atopic dermatitis were dosed with placebo or with KIND-032 at two different doses. The Canine Atopic Dermatitis Extent and Severity Index (CADESI) scores were assessed by board-certified veterinary dermatologists who were blinded to treatment assignments. The study demonstrated that KindredBio's antibody was well-tolerated. Although the study was a single-dose study designed primarily to assess safety and pharmacokinetics, evidence of positive efficacy and dose response was observed at Week 1, as measured by CADESI-04. A second pilot study to further assess dosing commenced in the third quarter of 2020.\nThe IL-4 pathway is a key driver of the inflammation that underlies atopic dermatitis and several other allergic diseases. Unlike KIND-025, which binds to IL-4 and IL-13 circulating in blood, KIND-032 binds to the IL-4 receptor on the surface of immune cells.\nKIND-025\nOn March 24, 2020, we announced positive results from our pilot field efficacy study of KIND-025, a canine fusion protein targeting IL-4 and IL-13, for the treatment of atopic dermatitis in dogs. A higher treatment success rate was observed in the KIND-025 group over the placebo group from week 1 through week 4. Positive efficacy signals were also detected with other endpoints including 20mm or higher reduction from baseline in PVAS score. Cell line development is being continued as we further evaluate this program. The IL-4 and IL-13 pathways are key drivers of the inflammation that underlies atopic dermatitis and other allergic diseases. The IL-4/13 SINK molecule binds to both IL-4 and IL-13 circulating in the blood and inhibits their interactions with their respective receptors, thereby modifying the clinical signs associated with atopic dermatitis. We currently do not have plans to prioritize KIND-025 ahead of our other programs.\nKIND-030\nIn August 2019, we announced positive results from our pilot efficacy study of KIND-030, a chimeric, high-affinity monoclonal antibody targeting canine parvovirus (CPV). This was a 12-dog study, of which 4 dogs were treated prophylactically and 2 dogs were treated after establishment of the infection. All treated dogs survived, compared to none in the applicable placebo group. The effect was seen in both prophylaxis setting, as well as in a treatment setting after establishment of infection. On September 16, 2020, we reported positive results from our pivotal efficacy study of KIND-030 in prevention of parvovirus infection in prophylactic treatment. In the randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled study, KIND-030 was administered to dogs as prophylactic therapy to prevent clinical signs of CPV infection. The primary objectives of the study were met. All of the placebo-control dogs developed parvovirus infection as predefined in the study protocol, while none of the KIND-030 treated dogs developed the disease. Furthermore, the parvovirus challenge resulted in 60% mortality rate in the control dogs compared to 0% mortality rate in the KIND-030 treated dogs.\nKIND-030 is being pursued for two indications in dogs: prophylactic therapy to prevent clinical signs of canine parvovirus infection and treatment of established parvovirus infection. The pivotal efficacy study for the treatment indication is expected to complete in the second quarter of 2021. There is no set review timeline at the United States Department of Agriculture Center for Veterinary Biologics. Regulatory approval and review timeline are subject to the typical risks inherent in such a process.\nCPV is the most significant cause of viral enteritis in dogs, especially puppies, with mortality rates reportedly as high as 91% if untreated. Banfield Medical records report that at least 250,000 dogs are infected with parvoviruses each year, excluding emergency hospitals, shelters, specialty hospitals or undiagnosed cases. While there are vaccines available for CPV, they have to be administered multiple times and many puppies don't receive the vaccine at all, or don't get the complete series. This will not replace the need for vaccination; it may just change the timing of the vaccination post administration. There are currently no approved or unapproved treatments for CPV. Currently, owners spend up to thousands of dollars for supportive care for dogs infected with CPV.\nIn December 2020, we announced an agreement granting Elanco Animal Health, Inc. (\"Elanco\") exclusive global rights to KIND-030. Under the terms of the agreement, KindredBio will receive an upfront payment of $500,000, development milestone payments of up to $16 million upon achievement of certain development, regulatory and manufacturing targets, and sales milestones in an aggregate amount of up to $94 million payable throughout the term of the agreement. Furthermore, royalty payments are to range from the low to high teens. The agreement specifies that KindredBio will supply the licensed product to Elanco, and that Elanco will conduct the necessary regulatory activities to achieve approvals in Europe and other key international markets.\nKIND-509\nOn December 21, 2020, we announced positive results from the pilot field efficacy study of our monoclonal antibody against tumor necrosis factor alpha (anti-TNF antibody) for canine inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The study was a randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled pilot effectiveness study that enrolled 10 dogs diagnosed with IBD to assess the efficacy and safety of KindredBio's anti-TNF\u03b1 antibody over a 4-week treatment period. The primary effectiveness variable for this exploratory study was reduction in Canine Inflammatory Bowel Disease Activity Index (CIBDAI) score, which was assessed at Screening and Days 0, 7, 14, 21 and 28. Complete remission, defined as \u2265 75% reduction in average post-dose CIBDAI score from baseline, was achieved in 75% of the anti-TNF\u03b1 group compared to 17% in the placebo group. The treatment effect was early-onset and durable. At Day 7, the first post-dose visit, 75% of the anti-TNF\u03b1 treated dogs showed \u2265 75% reduction of CIBDAI score from baseline, compared to 17% in the placebo group. Furthermore, 50% of the anti-TNF\u03b1 treated dogs achieved and maintained 100% reduction of CIBDAI score from baseline throughout all post-dose visits, whereas none in the placebo group achieved the same result.\nIBD is a chronic disease of the gastrointestinal tract and can affect dogs at any age, but is more common in middle-aged and older dogs. The majority of canine IBD cases involve chronic states of diarrhea, vomiting, gastroenteritis, inappetence, and other symptoms, certain of which are cited as among the most frequent disorders impacting dogs. For certain dog breeds, the prevalence of diarrhea exceeds 5%. Existing treatments can have significant drawbacks, including limited diets and excessive antibiotic use, which can lead to owner frustration, lapses in treatment adherence, or poor quality of life for the affected animal.\nKIND-510a\nIn January 2019, we announced positive topline results from our pilot field effectiveness study of KIND-510a, a long-acting feline recombinant erythropoietin being developed for the management of non-regenerative anemia in cats. It has been engineered by KindredBio to have a prolonged half-life compared to endogenous erythropoietin, a protein that regulates and stimulates production of red blood cells. The pivotal efficacy study for KIND-510a was initiated in the fourth quarter of 2019.\nOn November 25, 2020, KindredBio made the decision to suspend the feline recombinant erythropoietin program following an adverse event. Patient safety is paramount to KindredBio. Given the impact of safety profile on the program's commercial value, and amid the continued rapid growth of the canine dermatitis market, the decision was made to redirect resources toward accelerating the Company's programs for canine atopic dermatitis. KindredBio maintains backup programs for its feline recombinant erythropoietin and may seek to develop these at a later date.\nAnemia is a common condition that is estimated to affect millions of older cats. It is often associated with chronic kidney disease, because kidneys produce erythropoietin and chronic kidney disease leads to decreased levels of endogenous erythropoietin. Chronic kidney disease affects approximately half of older cats, making it a leading cause of feline mortality. Human erythropoietins, which are multi-billion-dollar products in the human market, are immunogenic in cats.\nKIND-511\nKIND-511 is an anti-Tumor Necrosis Factor ( anti-TNF\u201d) treatment for newborn foals. Sick newborn foals, defined as sepsis score \u2265 11 or positive blood culture, are challenging, and difficult to treat and result in\napproximately 50% mortality. We have completed a pilot field study in sick or septic foals to assess safety and efficacy of anti-TNF monoclonal antibody, with positive results. By Kaplan-Meier analysis, the difference in survival between the control and placebo groups was statistically significant (p=0.0293). There is currently no FDA-approved therapy. We have placed this program on indefinite hold to focus on accelerating our late-stage biologic candidates in the canine and feline markets.\nIn addition to the product candidates discussed above, we are in the early stages of development for multiple additional indications, including interleukin antibodies and canine checkpoint inhibitors, with the potential to attain approval for one or more products annually for several years. In all, we have over 20 programs for various indications for dogs and cats.\nEquine Product Development Updates\nWe completed a strategic review of our equine candidates. In December 2020, we entered into a Distribution and Licensing Agreement granting Dechra an exclusive license under our Patents and Marketing Authorizations to promote, market, sell and distribute Zimeta in the US and Canadian territories in return for a royalty on sales and milestone payment upon achievement of a certain sales milestone. We made the decision to discontinue the development of KIND-012 (dipyrone oral gel) and pause the development of KIND-014 to focus on accelerating our late-stage biologic candidates.\nManufacturing\nWe have constructed a Good Manufacturing Practice, or GMP, biologics manufacturing plant in Burlingame, CA which is fully commissioned. We have proceeded to GMP manufacturing of our feline erythropoietin product candidate in January 2018. In addition, we have completed construction and commissioning of our biologics manufacturing lines in our manufacturing plant in Elwood, Kansas in 2019. The Elwood facility includes approximately 180,000 square feet with clean rooms, utility, equipment, and related quality documentation suitable for biologics and small molecule manufacturing.\nFunding\nWe are a commercial-stage company with two products approved for marketing and sale. We have incurred significant net losses since our inception. We incurred cumulative net losses of $244.9 million through December 31, 2020. These losses have resulted principally from costs incurred in connection with investigating and developing our product candidates, research and development activities and general and administrative costs associated with our operations.\nHistorically, our funding has been a combination of private and public offerings. From our initial public offering in December 2013 through December 2019, we raised approximately $257.4 million in net proceeds, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses. On April 8, 2020, we entered into an At Market Offering (\"ATM\") whereby we may offer and sell shares of our common stock from time to time up to $25 million. Through December 31, 2020, 59,211 shares were sold through the ATM, for total gross proceeds of approximately $298,000. Net proceeds, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expense, were approximately $201,000. As of December 31, 2020, we had cash, cash equivalents and investments in available-for-sale securities of $59.9 million.\nFor the foreseeable future, we expect to continue to incur losses, which will increase significantly from historical levels as we expand our product development activities, seek regulatory approvals for our product candidates and begin to commercialize them if they are approved by the Center for Veterinary Medicine branch, or CVM, of the FDA, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, or USDA, or the European Medicines Agency, or EMA. If we are required to further fund our operations, we expect to do so through public or private equity offerings, debt financings, corporate collaborations and licensing arrangements. We cannot assure you that such funds will be available on terms favorable to us, if at all. Arrangements with collaborators or others may require us to relinquish rights to certain of our technologies or product candidates. In addition, we may never successfully complete development of, obtain adequate patent protection for, obtain necessary regulatory approval, or achieve commercial viability for any of our biologic product candidates. If we are not able to raise additional capital on terms acceptable\nto us, or at all, as and when needed, we may be required to curtail our operations, and we may be unable to continue as a going concern.\nFinancial Overview\nRevenues\nOur revenues consist of product revenue resulting from the sale of Mirataz for the management of weight loss in cats and Zimeta for the treatment of fever in horses. In addition, our revenues in 2020 also included the sale of our Mirataz asset, partner royalties, contract manufacturing and partner licensing revenue.\nCost of Revenues\nCost of product revenues consists primarily of the cost of direct materials, direct labor and overhead costs associated with manufacturing, inbound shipping and other third-party logistics costs.\nContract manufacturing costs consist primarily of the cost of direct materials, direct labor and overhead costs associated with manufacturing, rent, facility costs and related machinery depreciation.\nResearch and Development Expense\nAll costs of research and development are expensed in the period incurred. Research and development costs primarily consist of contracted development costs, manufacturing costs, salaries and related expenses for personnel, stock-based compensation expense, regulatory, outside service providers, professional and consulting services, travel costs and materials used in clinical trials and research and development.\nWe are currently pursuing over 10 indications. We typically use our employee and infrastructure resources across multiple development programs. We track outsourced development costs by development compound but do not allocate personnel or other internal costs related to development to specific programs or development compounds as these expenses are included in personnel costs and other internal costs.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expense\nSelling, general and administrative expense consists primarily of personnel costs, including salaries, related benefits and stock-based compensation for employees, consultants and directors. Selling, general and administrative expenses also include rent and other facilities costs, conference and sponsorship activities, travel costs, professional fees for legal, accounting and tax, information technology services, business development activities, costs associated with being a public company and other general and commercial business services.\nAs announced in the strategic realignment of our business model on March 16, 2020, KindredBio transitioned to a partnership-based model for commercialization strategy similar to the traditional human biotech commercialization strategy whereby pipeline assets are partnered with larger commercial partners that can maximize product opportunity in return for upfront payments, contingent milestones, and royalties on future sales. As a result of the sale of our Mirataz asset, our companion animal commercial infrastructure was substantially reduced. Furthermore, the Distribution and Licensing Agreement of Zimeta to Dechra resulted in the dismantling our commercial infrastructure.\nInterest and Other Income (Expenses), Net\nConsist of interest earned on our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, interest expenses on our long-term loan and asset disposals.\nIncome Taxes\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had net operating loss carryforwards for federal and state income tax purposes of $211,817,000 and $117,203,000, respectively, which will begin to expire in fiscal year 2032. The\nFederal NOL generated after 2017 of $118,704,000 will carryforward indefinitely and be available to offset up to 80% of future taxable income each year. Our management has evaluated the factors bearing upon the realizability of our deferred tax assets, which are comprised principally of net operating loss carryforwards. Our management concluded that, due to the uncertainty of realizing any tax benefits as of December 31, 2020, a valuation allowance was necessary to fully offset our deferred tax assets.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates\nOur management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or U.S. GAAP. The preparation of our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, and revenue, costs and expenses and related disclosures during the reporting periods. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and judgments, including those described below. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nWhile our significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 2 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this document, we believe that the estimates and assumptions involved in the following accounting policies may have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nRevenue Recognition\nOur revenues consist of product revenues resulting from the sale of Mirataz and Zimeta, revenue from the sale of our Mirataz asset, the associated partner royalties, revenue from our contract manufacturing service and partner licensing revenue.\nIn accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (\"ASC\") 606, we applied the following steps to recognize revenue that reflects the consideration to which we expect to be entitled to receive in exchange for the promised goods or services (See Note 2):\n1. Identify the contract with a customer\n2. Identify the performance obligations in the contract\n3. Determine the transaction price\n4. Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations\n5. Determine the satisfaction of performance obligation\nProduct Revenue\nOur product revenues consist of sales of Mirataz and Zimeta. We account for a contract with a customer when there is a legally enforceable contract between us and our customer, the rights of the parties are identified, the contract has commercial substance, and collectability of the contract consideration is probable. Our customers could either be distributors who subsequently resell our products to third parties such as veterinarians, clinics or animal hospitals, licensing partners or other third parties.\nRevenue from the sale of our Mirataz asset\nOn March 16, 2020, we entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement to sell Mirataz to Dechra for a cash purchase price of $43 million. On April 15, 2020, we completed the sale of Mirataz to Dechra and received payment of $38.7 million on the closing date. The remaining $4.3 million will be paid out of escrow beginning in 12 months assuming no escrow claims. We concluded our accounting treatment of the asset sale to Dechra meets the scope of ASC Topic 610-20-15-2, \"Gains and Losses from the Derecognition of Nonfinancial Assets\". We considered our strategic realignment of our business model whereby we become a biologics-only company focused on accelerating our deep pipeline of late-stage biologics candidates in canine and feline markets. Accordingly, we plan to rely more on a partnership-based model for commercialization strategy whereby pipeline assets are partnered with larger\ncommercial partners that can maximize product opportunity in return for upfront payment, contingent milestones, and royalties on future sales. Based on the above evaluation in the aggregate, we concluded the proper presentation of the sale of Mirataz to be within operating income as part of revenue. This is presented as a separate line item and described as revenue from asset sale.\nPartner Royalties\nWe recognize royalty revenue in connection with licenses granted under license and development arrangements with partners. Royalties are based upon a percentage of commercial sales of partnered products based on levels of net sales. These sales-based royalties, for which the license was deemed the predominant element to which the royalties relate, are estimated and recognized in the period in which the partners' commercial sales occur. The royalties are generally reported and payable to us within 45 to 60 days of the end of each calendar quarter in which the commercial sales are made. We base our estimates of royalties earned on actual sales information from our partners when available. If actual royalties received are different than amounts estimated, we would adjust the royalty revenue in the period in which the adjustment becomes known.\nContract Manufacturing Revenue\nThe manufacturing revenue stream generally represents revenue from the manufacturing of customer product(s). Under a manufacturing contract, a quantity of manufacturing runs is ordered and the product is manufactured according to the customer's specifications and typically only one performance obligation is included. Each manufacturing run represents a distinct service that is sold separately and has stand-alone value to the customer. The product(s) are manufactured exclusively for a specific customer and have no alternative use. The customer retains control of their product during the entire manufacturing process and can make changes to the process or specifications at their request.\nThe customer and our project team typically have a timeline on each milestone and duration time. They also have an estimated start and finish date. When the project is moving forward, they constantly change to the actual date to track the project progress. The timing has been shared by both parties. This becomes the most important basis for our revenue recognition.\nBecause of the timing effect of revenue recognition, billings and cash collections can be recorded into three different ways: billed trade receivables, contract assets (unbilled receivables), and contract liabilities (customer deposits and deferred revenue). Contract assets are recorded when our right to consideration is conditioned on something other than the passage of time. Contract assets are reclassified to trade receivables on the balance sheet when our rights become unconditional. Contract liabilities represent customer deposits and deferred revenue billed and/or received in advance of our fulfillment of performance obligations. Contract liabilities convert to revenue as we perform our obligations under the contract.\nPartner Licensing Revenue\nPartner licensing revenue consists of revenue that compensates us for services performed, such as formulation, process development, and preparation of pre-clinical and clinical drug product materials under research and development arrangements with partners. Revenues related to research and development are generally recognized as the related services or activities are performed using the output method and in accordance with the contract terms. To the extent that the agreements specify services are to be performed on a fixed basis, revenues are\nrecognized consistent with the pattern of the work performed. In agreements that specify milestones, we evaluate whether the milestones are considered probable of being achieved and estimate the amount to be included in the transaction price using the most likely amount method. If it is probable that a significant revenue reversal would not occur, the value of the associated milestone is recognized at a point in time. Non-refundable milestone payments related to arrangements under which we have continuing performance obligations would be deferred and recognized over the period of performance. Milestone payments that are not within our control, such as submission for approval to regulators by a partner or approvals from regulators, are not considered probable of being achieved until those submissions are submitted by the customer or approvals are received.\nProduct Returns\nConsistent with the industry practice, we generally offer customers a limited right of return of damaged or expired product that has been purchased directly from us. Our return policy generally allows customers to receive credit for expired products within 90 days after the product's expiration date. We estimate the amount of our product revenues that may be returned by our customers and record these estimates as a reduction of product revenues in the period the related product revenues are recognized, as well as within accrued liabilities, in the consolidated balance sheets.\nOur contract manufacturing customer retains control of their product during the entire manufacturing process and can make changes to the process or specifications at their request. There were no product returns.\nFair Value Measurements\nWe invest our cash in money market funds, cash deposits and debt instruments of the U.S. government agency securities. In the current market environment, the assessment of the fair value of the debt securities can be difficult and subjective. Accounting Standards Codification, or ASC, 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosure\" standard describes a fair value hierarchy based on three levels of inputs, of which the first two are considered observable and the last unobservable, that may be used to measure fair value which are the following:\n Level 1 Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities; Level 2 Inputs other than Level 1 that are observable, either directly or indirectly, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities; and Level 3 Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities. The determination of fair value for Level 3 instruments requires the most management judgment and subjectivity. \nInventories\nWe value inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value. We determine the cost of inventory using the standard-cost method, which approximates actual cost based on a first-in, first-out method. We analyze our inventory levels quarterly and write down inventory subject to expire in excess of expected requirements, or that has a cost basis in excess of its expected net realizable value. These inventory related costs are recognized as cost of product revenues on the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. Currently our inventory consists of finished goods only.\nResearch and Development\nAs part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, we are required to estimate accrued research and development expenses. Examples of estimated accrued expenses include fees paid to vendors and clinical sites in connection with our pivotal studies, to CROs in connection with our toxicology studies, and to contract manufacturers in connection with the production of API and formulated drug.\nWe review new and open contracts and communicate with applicable internal and vendor personnel to identify services that have been performed on our behalf and estimate the level of service performed and the associated costs incurred for the service when we have not yet been invoiced or otherwise notified of the actual cost for accrued expenses. The majority of our service providers invoice us monthly in arrears for services performed or as milestones are achieved in relation to our contract manufacturers. We make estimates of our accrued expenses as of each balance sheet date.\nWe base our accrued expenses related to pivotal studies on our estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to contracts with vendors, our internal resources, and payments to clinical sites based on enrollment projections. The financial terms of the vendor agreements are subject to negotiation, vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows. Payments under some of these contracts depend on factors such\nas the successful enrollment of animals and the completion of development milestones. We estimate the time period over which services will be performed and the level of effort to be expended in each period. If the actual timing of the performance of services or the level of effort varies from our estimate, we adjust the related expense accrual accordingly on a prospective basis. If we do not identify costs that have been incurred or if we underestimate or overestimate the level of services performed or the costs of these services, our actual expenses could differ from our estimates. To date, we have not made any material adjustments to our estimates of accrued research and development expenses or the level of services performed in any reporting period presented.\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe measure stock-based awards at fair value on the date of grant and recognize the corresponding compensation expense of the awards, net of estimated forfeitures, over the requisite service periods, which correspond to the vesting periods of the awards. Generally, we issue stock-based awards with only service-based vesting conditions, and record compensation expense for these awards using the straight-line method. Our intention is to grant stock-based awards with exercise prices equivalent to the fair value of our common stock as of the date of grant.\nThe fair value of each stock-based award is estimated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The expected volatility is based on the historic volatility of our own stock. The expected terms of our awards have been determined utilizing the simplified\u201d method, since our historical experience for option grants is not relevant to our expectations for recent grants. The risk-free interest rate is determined by reference to the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant of the award for time periods approximately equal to the expected term of the award. Expected dividend yield is zero, based on the fact that we have never paid cash dividends and do not expect to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. See Note 10 in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table summarizes the results of our operations for the periods indicated:\n\nRevenues\nOur product revenues consist of sale of Mirataz and Zimeta, revenue from the sale of our Mirataz asset, the associated partner royalties, revenue from our contract manufacturing service and partner licensing revenue.\nProduct revenue\nOur product revenues consist of sales of Mirataz and Zimeta. Also included in product sale is revenue derived from co-marketing products for our partners in conjunction with sales of Mirataz and Zimeta.\nOur net product revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020 decreased by 79.4% to $878,000 compared with $4,256,000 for the same period in 2019. The decrease is mainly due our sale of the Mirataz asset to Dechra in April 2020 compared with twelve months of Mirataz product sales in 2019. Net product revenue for Zimeta in 2020 was $27,000 compared with $127,000 in 2019, reflecting a downturn in equine events and transportation as a result of COVID-19. In conjunction with Mirataz and Zimeta, we also recorded $29,000 in revenue derived from co-marketing products for our partners, Butterfly Networks and Astaria Global in 2020.\nOur product sale revenue for the year ended December 31, 2019 increased by 116.5% to $4,256,000 compared with $1,966,000 for the same period in 2018. The increase is mainly due to a full year of Mirataz product\nsales while Mirataz only became commercial available to veterinarians in the United States in July 2018. In addition, our second product, Zimeta\u2122 (dipyrone injection) for the control of fever in horses was approved by the FDA and became commercially available in December 2019.\nAs a result of our licensing agreements with Dechra, we will be recording partner royalty revenues related to these products instead of product revenues going forward.\nRevenue from asset sale\nOur revenue from the Mirataz asset sale to Dechra for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $38.7 million. The remaining $4.3 million will be paid out of escrow beginning in 12 months assuming no escrow claims. There were no asset sales in 2019 or 2018.\nPartner royalties\nOur partner royalty revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $535,000, resulting from Dechra's net sales of Mirataz. There were no partner royalty revenues in 2019 or 2018.\nContract manufacturing revenue\nOn May 19, 2020, we entered into an agreement with Vaxart, Inc. for the manufacture of Vaxart's oral vaccine candidate for COVID-19. We recorded contract manufacturing revenue of $1.6 million based on the percentage completion of specific milestones. We did not have any contract manufacturing revenue in prior years.\nPartner licensing revenue\nOur partner licensing revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $0.5 million due to a non-refundable upfront payment from Elanco for the exclusive global rights to KIND-030. There were no partner licensing revenues in prior years.\nCost of Revenues\nOur cost of product sales for the year ended December 31, 2020 increased by 572.1% to $3,945,000 compared with $587,000 for the same period in 2019. Cost of product revenues consists primarily of the cost of direct materials, direct labor and overhead costs associated with manufacturing, inbound shipping and other third-party logistics costs. The increase is mainly due to the $3.8 million finished goods write-off related to the Dechra agreements signed in 2020, the majority of which is related to Mirataz. All remaining Mirataz products not included in the transferred assets to Dechra due to the transition to proprietary Dechra brand labelling was written off.\nOur cost of product sales for the year ended December 31, 2019 increased by 81.2% to $587,000 compared with $324,000 for the same period in 2018. Cost of product revenues consists primarily of the cost of direct materials, direct labor and overhead costs associated with manufacturing, inbound shipping and other third-party logistics costs. The increase reflected a full year of Mirataz product sales in 2019.\nOur cost of contract manufacturing for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $681,000. Contract manufacturing costs consist primarily of the cost of direct materials, direct labor and overhead costs associated with manufacturing, rent, facility costs and related machinery depreciation. We did not have any contract manufacturing costs in prior years.\nConcentrations of credit risk\nOur revenue was generated entirely from sales within the United States. Our product sales to three large distributors, namely MWI Animal Health, Henry Schein (now Covetrus North America) and Midwest Veterinary Supply, each accounted for more than 10% of gross product revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020. On a combined basis, in 2020, these distributors accounted for approximately 78% of our product sales.\nOur accounts receivable from amounts billed for contract manufacturing services in 2020 is derived from one customer. The contract requires up-front payment and installment payments during the service period. We perform periodic evaluations of the financial condition of our customers and generally do not require collateral, but we can terminate any contract if a material default occurs.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, our product sales to three large distributors, namely Henry Schein (now Covetrus North America), MWI Animal Health and Patterson Veterinary Supply each accounted for more than 10% of total revenues. On a combined basis, in 2019, these distributors accounted for approximately 85% of our product sales. We did not provide any contract manufacturing services in 2019 or 2018.\nProduct returns\nOur return policy generally allows customers to receive credit for expired products within 90 days after the product's expiration date. We estimated product return liabilities of 3% for Zimeta of gross revenue using probability-weighted available industry data and data provided by our distributors such as the inventories remaining in the distribution channel. Adjustments will be made in the future if actual results vary from our estimates.\nAccounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts\nAccounts receivable are stated at their carrying values, net of any allowances for doubtful accounts. Accounts receivable consist primarily of amounts due from distributors, our contract manufacturing customer, and licensing partner for which collection is probable based on the customer's intent and ability to pay. Receivables are evaluated for collection probability on a regular basis and an allowance for doubtful accounts is recorded, if necessary. We have no allowance for doubtful accounts as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, as our analysis did not uncover any collection risks.\nResearch and Development Expense\nAll costs of research and development are expensed in the period incurred. Research and development costs consist primarily of salaries and related expenses for personnel, stock-based compensation expense, fees paid to consultants, outside service providers, professional services, travel costs and materials used in clinical trials and research and development. We typically use our employee and infrastructure resources across multiple development programs.\nResearch and development expense was as follows for the periods indicated:\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, research and development expense related primarily to advancing the development of KIND-030, KIND-016, KIND-032, KIND-510a and other early stage biologic programs.\nResearch and development expenses for the year ended December 31, 2020 increased by 10% to $31.3 million compared with $28.3 million for the same period in 2019. The increase was primarily due to the inclusion of expenses from the Kansas facility as it began to manufacture clinical trial material offset by lower costs as we stopped most small molecule development and prioritize our focus on late stage biologic candidates. Prior to 2020, construction and commissioning expenditures associated with the Kansas facility had been categorized as general\nand administrative expenses. Outsourced research and development expense related to KIND-030, KIND-510a, KIND-014 and other product development programs for the year ended December 31, 2020 were $1.3 million, $0.8 million, $0.4 million and $0.9 million, respectively.\nResearch and development expenses for the year ended December 31, 2019 increased by 7% to $28.3 million compared with $26.4 million for the same period in 2018. Payroll and related expenses increased by $2.4 million due to increase in headcount as we advance our biologics development and manufacturing programs. Higher regulatory and research fees, consulting, depreciation, rent as a result of expanded lab spaces and other facility costs also contributed to the increase in expenses, offset by lower non-GMP production and testing expenses. Outsourced research and development expense related to KIND-014, KIND-012, CAD programs, KIND-510a and other product development programs for the year ended December 31, 2019 were $1.7 million, $0.6 million, $0.5 million, $0.4 million and $1.3 million, respectively.\nWe expect research and development expense to decrease for the foreseeable future. While we expect biologics manufacturing expenses to increase due to the manufacture of KIND-016 and KIND-030 antibodies for our pivotal field studies, our excess manpower and capacity allow us to take on some contract manufacturing services thereby subsidizing the cost of our manufacturing facilities. Labor and associated benefits, supplies and facility expenses related to contract manufacturing services are recorded as cost of goods sold and would offset increases in our biologics manufacturing expenses, resulting in a net decrease in research and development expenses. Due to the inherently unpredictable nature of our development, we cannot reasonably estimate or predict the nature, specific timing or estimated costs of the efforts that will be necessary to complete the development of our product candidates.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expense\nThe composition of general and administrative expense was as follows for the periods indicated:\n\nSelling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2020 decreased by 42% to $22.0 million compared with $37.9 million for the same period in 2019. The $15.9 million year-over-year decrease was mainly due to the re-categorization of Kansas plant expenditures as research and development expenses, and lower payroll and related expenses including marketing expenses as a result of the elimination of our companion animal sales force. The decrease was offset by higher legal fees.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2019 increased by 43% to $37.9 million compared with $26.5 million for the same period in 2018. Headcount increase was due to the expansion of our commercial organization and administrative personnel to support the company's growth. Sales and marketing expenses account for a big component of the increase. Higher stock-based compensation expense also contributed to the increase.\nWe expect selling, general and administrative expense to decrease going forward as a result of our transition to a partnership-focused commercialization strategy whereby pipeline assets are out-licensed to larger commercial partners that can maximize product opportunity in return for upfront payment, contingent milestones, and royalties on future sales.\nRestructuring Costs\nWe recorded restructuring charges of approximately $4.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The restructuring charge of approximately $1.7 million in the first quarter of 2020 was the result of the elimination of 53 positions due to the strategic realignment of our business model whereby we became a biologics-only company while stopping most small molecule development. All charges pertaining to this restructuring have been paid. The restructuring charge of approximately $2.3 million in the second quarter was the result of prioritizing our most attractive late stage programs and substantially reducing our expenses to best position the company for success with the new business model. Another 24 employees were impacted by the restructuring and all restructuring charges have been paid by the third quarter of 2020. We further eliminated another 5 positions in the third quarter and incurred a restructuring charge of approximately $0.3 million related to severance payments and health care benefits, exclusive of stock compensation. We do not anticipate any further reductions in the foreseeable future.\nInterest and Other (Expenses) Income, Net\n\nThe decrease of approximately $3.0 million in 2020 compared to 2019 was the result of $1.4 million lower interest income due to lower interest rate and cash balance. In addition, the change of further impacted by interest expense and amortization of loan issuance costs of $1.7 million.\nThe decrease of approximately $388,000 in 2019 compared to 2018 was mainly caused by the borrowing on a loan, which incurred approximately $461,000 of interest expenses. In addition, the change was further impacted by disposals of fixed assets of approximately $212,000, offset by an increase in interest income of $339,000 from our investments.\nQuarterly Result of Operations\nThe following table presents selected unaudited quarterly financial data for each of the quarters in the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.\n", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes and other financial information included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. You should review the Risk Factors\u201d section of this Annual Report for a discussion of important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis or elsewhere in this Annual Report.\nOverview\nWe are a commercial-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on saving and improving the lives of pets. Our mission is to bring to our pets the same kinds of safe and effective medicines that our human family members enjoy. Our core strategy is to identify targets that have already demonstrated safety and efficacy in humans and to develop therapeutics based on these validated targets for pets, primarily dogs and cats. We believe this approach will lead to shorter development times and higher approval rates than pursuing new, non-validated targets. Our current portfolio includes over 20 product candidates in development, predominantly biologics. We also have state-of-the-art biologics manufacturing capabilities and a broad intellectual property portfolio.\nOur first product, Mirataz\u00ae was approved in May 2018 and became commercially available to veterinarians in the United States in July 2018. In November 2019, our second product, Zimeta\u2122 (dipyrone injection) for the control of fever in horses was approved by the FDA and became commercially available in December 2019. In addition, we have multiple other product candidates, predominantly biologics, in various stages of development. We believe there are significant unmet medical needs for pets, and that the pet therapeutics segment of the animal health industry is likely to grow substantially as new therapeutics are identified, developed and marketed specifically for pets.\nMirataz is the first and only transdermal medication specifically developed and FDA-approved for the management of weight loss in cats. Weight loss is a serious and potentially fatal condition that represents the leading cause of visits to the veterinarian for cats. Mirataz, which is formulated with the proprietary Accusorb\u2122 technology, is applied topically to the cat's inner ear (pinna) once a day, providing a more attractive application route compared to oral administration. The product is classified as a weight gain drug and can be used in cats with various underlying diseases associated with unintended weight loss.\nZimeta is the first injectable dipyrone product to receive FDA approval for use in horses. Dipyrone, the active ingredient in Zimeta, is a member of the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) class and has a centrally acting mechanism of action on the hypothalamus where fever originates and is regulated.\nOn March 16, 2020, we entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement whereby we agreed to sell Mirataz, our\ntransdermal drug for the management of weight loss in cats, to Dechra for a cash purchase price of $43 million, of which $38.7 million will be paid on the closing date and $4.3 million will be paid out of escrow beginning in 12 months assuming no escrow claims, alongside an ongoing royalty on global net sales. The acquisition comprises worldwide marketing rights, intellectual property rights, marketing authorizations and associated regulatory documentation, third party supply contracts related to raw material and manufacture of the finished product, and certain product inventory. On April 15, 2020, we completed the sale of Mirataz to Dechra.\nThe European Commission granted marketing authorization of Mirataz in December 2019. Dechra, which is based in the United Kingdom, plans to launch Mirataz in the UK and the European Union in 2021, and intends to conduct the necessary regulatory activities to achieve approvals in other key international markets.\nConcurrent with the sale of Mirataz, we announced a strategic realignment of our business model whereby we plan to rely more on a partnership-based model for commercialization strategy similar to the traditional human biotech commercialization strategy whereby pipeline assets are partnered with larger commercial partners that can maximize product opportunity in return for upfront payments, contingent milestones, and royalties on future sales. Our focus will be on accelerating our deep pipeline of late-stage biologics candidates in canine and feline markets, while stopping most small molecule development for these species. We believe monoclonal antibodies are the future of veterinary medicine, and represent the greatest opportunity for value creation, given large potential markets for our programs and our competitive advantage in biologics. Accordingly, the companion animal commercial infrastructure was substantially reduced. In connection with this restructuring, we eliminated 53 positions, representing about one-third of our workforce. The eliminated positions primarily relate to the companion animal sales force and research and development for small molecule programs. On June 8, 2020, we announced a second restructuring to eliminate an additional 24 positions to streamline our operations and reduce operating expenditures by prioritizing investment in our highest value, late stage programs, especially the interleukin-31 (IL-31) antibody, interleukin-4 receptor (IL-4R) antibody, and parvovirus antibody programs. We completed our restructuring by eliminating the last 5 remaining positions in the third quarter of 2020 and do not anticipate any further reductions in the foreseeable future.\nIn December 2020, we entered into a Distribution and Licensing Agreement granting Dechra Veterinary Products, LLC, an exclusive license under our Patents and Marketing Authorizations to promote, market, sell and distribute Zimeta in the U.S. and Canadian territories, through channels of distribution permitted by applicable laws and regulations in the relevant countries forming part of the territory. We are responsible for the performance of the third party manufacturer for Zimeta, including the performance of all of the duties and including but not limited to, timely delivery of product meeting the applicable specifications. In consideration for the exclusive license and manufacturing services to be performed by us, Dechra will pay KindredBio a milestone payment upon achievement of certain sales milestone, a royalty fee and a price per unit of Zimeta.\nOn May 19, 2020, we entered into an agreement with Vaxart, Inc. for the manufacture of Vaxart's oral vaccine candidate for COVID-19. We recorded contract manufacturing revenue based on the percentage completion of specific milestones for the quarter. In October 2020, we announced the expansion of our manufacturing agreement with Vaxart for COVID-19 and other vaccine candidates.\nBiologic Product Development Updates\nOn March 16, 2020, we announced further prioritization our biologics programs for dogs and cats, which we view as our highest potential assets.\nKIND-016, Tirnovetmab (Interleukin-31)\nIn October 2018, we announced positive topline results from our pilot laboratory effectiveness study of tirnovetmab, KIND-016, a fully caninized, high-affinity monoclonal antibody targeting interleukin-31 (IL-31), for the treatment of atopic dermatitis in dogs. In addition, we announced that the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office has issued a patent (Patent No. 10,093,731) for KindredBio's anti-IL31 antibody.\nIn July 2019, we reported positive topline results from a pilot field effectiveness study for our IL-31 antibody that confirmed the results from our pilot laboratory study. The manufacturing scale up process proceeded and the pivotal efficacy study of KIND-016 was initiated in December 2020.\nCanine atopic dermatitis is an immune-mediated inflammatory skin condition in dogs and is the leading reason owners take their dog to the veterinarian. Atopic dermatitis is a large market, with the leading two products on the market selling over $900 million per year. We are pursuing a multi-pronged approach toward atopic dermatitis, with a portfolio of promising biologics. Our market research tells us there is strong demand for new biological treatments for pruritic dogs, with 70% of veterinarians, and a higher percentage of dermatologists, expressing a need for alternatives to current therapies.\nKIND-032\nIn December 2019 we announced the outcome of a positive pilot laboratory study of KIND-032, a fully caninized monoclonal antibody targeting interleukin-4 (IL-4) receptor, for the treatment of atopic dermatitis in dogs. In the study, 14 laboratory dogs with clinical signs consistent with atopic dermatitis were dosed with placebo or with KIND-032 at two different doses. The Canine Atopic Dermatitis Extent and Severity Index (CADESI) scores were assessed by board-certified veterinary dermatologists who were blinded to treatment assignments. The study demonstrated that KindredBio's antibody was well-tolerated. Although the study was a single-dose study designed primarily to assess safety and pharmacokinetics, evidence of positive efficacy and dose response was observed at Week 1, as measured by CADESI-04. A second pilot study to further assess dosing commenced in the third quarter of 2020.\nThe IL-4 pathway is a key driver of the inflammation that underlies atopic dermatitis and several other allergic diseases. Unlike KIND-025, which binds to IL-4 and IL-13 circulating in blood, KIND-032 binds to the IL-4 receptor on the surface of immune cells.\nKIND-025\nOn March 24, 2020, we announced positive results from our pilot field efficacy study of KIND-025, a canine fusion protein targeting IL-4 and IL-13, for the treatment of atopic dermatitis in dogs. A higher treatment success rate was observed in the KIND-025 group over the placebo group from week 1 through week 4. Positive efficacy signals were also detected with other endpoints including 20mm or higher reduction from baseline in PVAS score. Cell line development is being continued as we further evaluate this program. The IL-4 and IL-13 pathways are key drivers of the inflammation that underlies atopic dermatitis and other allergic diseases. The IL-4/13 SINK molecule binds to both IL-4 and IL-13 circulating in the blood and inhibits their interactions with their respective receptors, thereby modifying the clinical signs associated with atopic dermatitis. We currently do not have plans to prioritize KIND-025 ahead of our other programs.\nKIND-030\nIn August 2019, we announced positive results from our pilot efficacy study of KIND-030, a chimeric, high-affinity monoclonal antibody targeting canine parvovirus (CPV). This was a 12-dog study, of which 4 dogs were treated prophylactically and 2 dogs were treated after establishment of the infection. All treated dogs survived, compared to none in the applicable placebo group. The effect was seen in both prophylaxis setting, as well as in a treatment setting after establishment of infection. On September 16, 2020, we reported positive results from our pivotal efficacy study of KIND-030 in prevention of parvovirus infection in prophylactic treatment. In the randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled study, KIND-030 was administered to dogs as prophylactic therapy to prevent clinical signs of CPV infection. The primary objectives of the study were met. All of the placebo-control dogs developed parvovirus infection as predefined in the study protocol, while none of the KIND-030 treated dogs developed the disease. Furthermore, the parvovirus challenge resulted in 60% mortality rate in the control dogs compared to 0% mortality rate in the KIND-030 treated dogs.\nKIND-030 is being pursued for two indications in dogs: prophylactic therapy to prevent clinical signs of canine parvovirus infection and treatment of established parvovirus infection. The pivotal efficacy study for the treatment indication is expected to complete in the second quarter of 2021. There is no set review timeline at the United States Department of Agriculture Center for Veterinary Biologics. Regulatory approval and review timeline are subject to the typical risks inherent in such a process.\nCPV is the most significant cause of viral enteritis in dogs, especially puppies, with mortality rates reportedly as high as 91% if untreated. Banfield Medical records report that at least 250,000 dogs are infected with parvoviruses each year, excluding emergency hospitals, shelters, specialty hospitals or undiagnosed cases. While there are vaccines available for CPV, they have to be administered multiple times and many puppies don't receive the vaccine at all, or don't get the complete series. This will not replace the need for vaccination; it may just change the timing of the vaccination post administration. There are currently no approved or unapproved treatments for CPV. Currently, owners spend up to thousands of dollars for supportive care for dogs infected with CPV.\nIn December 2020, we announced an agreement granting Elanco Animal Health, Inc. (\"Elanco\") exclusive global rights to KIND-030. Under the terms of the agreement, KindredBio will receive an upfront payment of $500,000, development milestone payments of up to $16 million upon achievement of certain development, regulatory and manufacturing targets, and sales milestones in an aggregate amount of up to $94 million payable throughout the term of the agreement. Furthermore, royalty payments are to range from the low to high teens. The agreement specifies that KindredBio will supply the licensed product to Elanco, and that Elanco will conduct the necessary regulatory activities to achieve approvals in Europe and other key international markets.\nKIND-509\nOn December 21, 2020, we announced positive results from the pilot field efficacy study of our monoclonal antibody against tumor necrosis factor alpha (anti-TNF antibody) for canine inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The study was a randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled pilot effectiveness study that enrolled 10 dogs diagnosed with IBD to assess the efficacy and safety of KindredBio's anti-TNF\u03b1 antibody over a 4-week treatment period. The primary effectiveness variable for this exploratory study was reduction in Canine Inflammatory Bowel Disease Activity Index (CIBDAI) score, which was assessed at Screening and Days 0, 7, 14, 21 and 28. Complete remission, defined as \u2265 75% reduction in average post-dose CIBDAI score from baseline, was achieved in 75% of the anti-TNF\u03b1 group compared to 17% in the placebo group. The treatment effect was early-onset and durable. At Day 7, the first post-dose visit, 75% of the anti-TNF\u03b1 treated dogs showed \u2265 75% reduction of CIBDAI score from baseline, compared to 17% in the placebo group. Furthermore, 50% of the anti-TNF\u03b1 treated dogs achieved and maintained 100% reduction of CIBDAI score from baseline throughout all post-dose visits, whereas none in the placebo group achieved the same result.\nIBD is a chronic disease of the gastrointestinal tract and can affect dogs at any age, but is more common in middle-aged and older dogs. The majority of canine IBD cases involve chronic states of diarrhea, vomiting, gastroenteritis, inappetence, and other symptoms, certain of which are cited as among the most frequent disorders impacting dogs. For certain dog breeds, the prevalence of diarrhea exceeds 5%. Existing treatments can have significant drawbacks, including limited diets and excessive antibiotic use, which can lead to owner frustration, lapses in treatment adherence, or poor quality of life for the affected animal.\nKIND-510a\nIn January 2019, we announced positive topline results from our pilot field effectiveness study of KIND-510a, a long-acting feline recombinant erythropoietin being developed for the management of non-regenerative anemia in cats. It has been engineered by KindredBio to have a prolonged half-life compared to endogenous erythropoietin, a protein that regulates and stimulates production of red blood cells. The pivotal efficacy study for KIND-510a was initiated in the fourth quarter of 2019.\nOn November 25, 2020, KindredBio made the decision to suspend the feline recombinant erythropoietin program following an adverse event. Patient safety is paramount to KindredBio. Given the impact of safety profile on the program's commercial value, and amid the continued rapid growth of the canine dermatitis market, the decision was made to redirect resources toward accelerating the Company's programs for canine atopic dermatitis. KindredBio maintains backup programs for its feline recombinant erythropoietin and may seek to develop these at a later date.\nAnemia is a common condition that is estimated to affect millions of older cats. It is often associated with chronic kidney disease, because kidneys produce erythropoietin and chronic kidney disease leads to decreased levels of endogenous erythropoietin. Chronic kidney disease affects approximately half of older cats, making it a leading cause of feline mortality. Human erythropoietins, which are multi-billion-dollar products in the human market, are immunogenic in cats.\nKIND-511\nKIND-511 is an anti-Tumor Necrosis Factor ( anti-TNF\u201d) treatment for newborn foals. Sick newborn foals, defined as sepsis score \u2265 11 or positive blood culture, are challenging, and difficult to treat and result in\napproximately 50% mortality. We have completed a pilot field study in sick or septic foals to assess safety and efficacy of anti-TNF monoclonal antibody, with positive results. By Kaplan-Meier analysis, the difference in survival between the control and placebo groups was statistically significant (p=0.0293). There is currently no FDA-approved therapy. We have placed this program on indefinite hold to focus on accelerating our late-stage biologic candidates in the canine and feline markets.\nIn addition to the product candidates discussed above, we are in the early stages of development for multiple additional indications, including interleukin antibodies and canine checkpoint inhibitors, with the potential to attain approval for one or more products annually for several years. In all, we have over 20 programs for various indications for dogs and cats.\nEquine Product Development Updates\nWe completed a strategic review of our equine candidates. In December 2020, we entered into a Distribution and Licensing Agreement granting Dechra an exclusive license under our Patents and Marketing Authorizations to promote, market, sell and distribute Zimeta in the US and Canadian territories in return for a royalty on sales and milestone payment upon achievement of a certain sales milestone. We made the decision to discontinue the development of KIND-012 (dipyrone oral gel) and pause the development of KIND-014 to focus on accelerating our late-stage biologic candidates.\nManufacturing\nWe have constructed a Good Manufacturing Practice, or GMP, biologics manufacturing plant in Burlingame, CA which is fully commissioned. We have proceeded to GMP manufacturing of our feline erythropoietin product candidate in January 2018. In addition, we have completed construction and commissioning of our biologics manufacturing lines in our manufacturing plant in Elwood, Kansas in 2019. The Elwood facility includes approximately 180,000 square feet with clean rooms, utility, equipment, and related quality documentation suitable for biologics and small molecule manufacturing.\nFunding\nWe are a commercial-stage company with two products approved for marketing and sale. We have incurred significant net losses since our inception. We incurred cumulative net losses of $244.9 million through December 31, 2020. These losses have resulted principally from costs incurred in connection with investigating and developing our product candidates, research and development activities and general and administrative costs associated with our operations.\nHistorically, our funding has been a combination of private and public offerings. From our initial public offering in December 2013 through December 2019, we raised approximately $257.4 million in net proceeds, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses. On April 8, 2020, we entered into an At Market Offering (\"ATM\") whereby we may offer and sell shares of our common stock from time to time up to $25 million. Through December 31, 2020, 59,211 shares were sold through the ATM, for total gross proceeds of approximately $298,000. Net proceeds, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expense, were approximately $201,000. As of December 31, 2020, we had cash, cash equivalents and investments in available-for-sale securities of $59.9 million.\nFor the foreseeable future, we expect to continue to incur losses, which will increase significantly from historical levels as we expand our product development activities, seek regulatory approvals for our product candidates and begin to commercialize them if they are approved by the Center for Veterinary Medicine branch, or CVM, of the FDA, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, or USDA, or the European Medicines Agency, or EMA. If we are required to further fund our operations, we expect to do so through public or private equity offerings, debt financings, corporate collaborations and licensing arrangements. We cannot assure you that such funds will be available on terms favorable to us, if at all. Arrangements with collaborators or others may require us to relinquish rights to certain of our technologies or product candidates. In addition, we may never successfully complete development of, obtain adequate patent protection for, obtain necessary regulatory approval, or achieve commercial viability for any of our biologic product candidates. If we are not able to raise additional capital on terms acceptable\nto us, or at all, as and when needed, we may be required to curtail our operations, and we may be unable to continue as a going concern.\nFinancial Overview\nRevenues\nOur revenues consist of product revenue resulting from the sale of Mirataz for the management of weight loss in cats and Zimeta for the treatment of fever in horses. In addition, our revenues in 2020 also included the sale of our Mirataz asset, partner royalties, contract manufacturing and partner licensing revenue.\nCost of Revenues\nCost of product revenues consists primarily of the cost of direct materials, direct labor and overhead costs associated with manufacturing, inbound shipping and other third-party logistics costs.\nContract manufacturing costs consist primarily of the cost of direct materials, direct labor and overhead costs associated with manufacturing, rent, facility costs and related machinery depreciation.\nResearch and Development Expense\nAll costs of research and development are expensed in the period incurred. Research and development costs primarily consist of contracted development costs, manufacturing costs, salaries and related expenses for personnel, stock-based compensation expense, regulatory, outside service providers, professional and consulting services, travel costs and materials used in clinical trials and research and development.\nWe are currently pursuing over 10 indications. We typically use our employee and infrastructure resources across multiple development programs. We track outsourced development costs by development compound but do not allocate personnel or other internal costs related to development to specific programs or development compounds as these expenses are included in personnel costs and other internal costs.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expense\nSelling, general and administrative expense consists primarily of personnel costs, including salaries, related benefits and stock-based compensation for employees, consultants and directors. Selling, general and administrative expenses also include rent and other facilities costs, conference and sponsorship activities, travel costs, professional fees for legal, accounting and tax, information technology services, business development activities, costs associated with being a public company and other general and commercial business services.\nAs announced in the strategic realignment of our business model on March 16, 2020, KindredBio transitioned to a partnership-based model for commercialization strategy similar to the traditional human biotech commercialization strategy whereby pipeline assets are partnered with larger commercial partners that can maximize product opportunity in return for upfront payments, contingent milestones, and royalties on future sales. As a result of the sale of our Mirataz asset, our companion animal commercial infrastructure was substantially reduced. Furthermore, the Distribution and Licensing Agreement of Zimeta to Dechra resulted in the dismantling our commercial infrastructure.\nInterest and Other Income (Expenses), Net\nConsist of interest earned on our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, interest expenses on our long-term loan and asset disposals.\nIncome Taxes\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had net operating loss carryforwards for federal and state income tax purposes of $211,817,000 and $117,203,000, respectively, which will begin to expire in fiscal year 2032. The\nFederal NOL generated after 2017 of $118,704,000 will carryforward indefinitely and be available to offset up to 80% of future taxable income each year. Our management has evaluated the factors bearing upon the realizability of our deferred tax assets, which are comprised principally of net operating loss carryforwards. Our management concluded that, due to the uncertainty of realizing any tax benefits as of December 31, 2020, a valuation allowance was necessary to fully offset our deferred tax assets.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates\nOur management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or U.S. GAAP. The preparation of our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, and revenue, costs and expenses and related disclosures during the reporting periods. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and judgments, including those described below. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nWhile our significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 2 of the notes to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this document, we believe that the estimates and assumptions involved in the following accounting policies may have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nRevenue Recognition\nOur revenues consist of product revenues resulting from the sale of Mirataz and Zimeta, revenue from the sale of our Mirataz asset, the associated partner royalties, revenue from our contract manufacturing service and partner licensing revenue.\nIn accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (\"ASC\") 606, we applied the following steps to recognize revenue that reflects the consideration to which we expect to be entitled to receive in exchange for the promised goods or services (See Note 2):\n1. Identify the contract with a customer\n2. Identify the performance obligations in the contract\n3. Determine the transaction price\n4. Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations\n5. Determine the satisfaction of performance obligation\nProduct Revenue\nOur product revenues consist of sales of Mirataz and Zimeta. We account for a contract with a customer when there is a legally enforceable contract between us and our customer, the rights of the parties are identified, the contract has commercial substance, and collectability of the contract consideration is probable. Our customers could either be distributors who subsequently resell our products to third parties such as veterinarians, clinics or animal hospitals, licensing partners or other third parties.\nRevenue from the sale of our Mirataz asset\nOn March 16, 2020, we entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement to sell Mirataz to Dechra for a cash purchase price of $43 million. On April 15, 2020, we completed the sale of Mirataz to Dechra and received payment of $38.7 million on the closing date. The remaining $4.3 million will be paid out of escrow beginning in 12 months assuming no escrow claims. We concluded our accounting treatment of the asset sale to Dechra meets the scope of ASC Topic 610-20-15-2, \"Gains and Losses from the Derecognition of Nonfinancial Assets\". We considered our strategic realignment of our business model whereby we become a biologics-only company focused on accelerating our deep pipeline of late-stage biologics candidates in canine and feline markets. Accordingly, we plan to rely more on a partnership-based model for commercialization strategy whereby pipeline assets are partnered with larger\ncommercial partners that can maximize product opportunity in return for upfront payment, contingent milestones, and royalties on future sales. Based on the above evaluation in the aggregate, we concluded the proper presentation of the sale of Mirataz to be within operating income as part of revenue. This is presented as a separate line item and described as revenue from asset sale.\nPartner Royalties\nWe recognize royalty revenue in connection with licenses granted under license and development arrangements with partners. Royalties are based upon a percentage of commercial sales of partnered products based on levels of net sales. These sales-based royalties, for which the license was deemed the predominant element to which the royalties relate, are estimated and recognized in the period in which the partners' commercial sales occur. The royalties are generally reported and payable to us within 45 to 60 days of the end of each calendar quarter in which the commercial sales are made. We base our estimates of royalties earned on actual sales information from our partners when available. If actual royalties received are different than amounts estimated, we would adjust the royalty revenue in the period in which the adjustment becomes known.\nContract Manufacturing Revenue\nThe manufacturing revenue stream generally represents revenue from the manufacturing of customer product(s). Under a manufacturing contract, a quantity of manufacturing runs is ordered and the product is manufactured according to the customer's specifications and typically only one performance obligation is included. Each manufacturing run represents a distinct service that is sold separately and has stand-alone value to the customer. The product(s) are manufactured exclusively for a specific customer and have no alternative use. The customer retains control of their product during the entire manufacturing process and can make changes to the process or specifications at their request.\nThe customer and our project team typically have a timeline on each milestone and duration time. They also have an estimated start and finish date. When the project is moving forward, they constantly change to the actual date to track the project progress. The timing has been shared by both parties. This becomes the most important basis for our revenue recognition.\nBecause of the timing effect of revenue recognition, billings and cash collections can be recorded into three different ways: billed trade receivables, contract assets (unbilled receivables), and contract liabilities (customer deposits and deferred revenue). Contract assets are recorded when our right to consideration is conditioned on something other than the passage of time. Contract assets are reclassified to trade receivables on the balance sheet when our rights become unconditional. Contract liabilities represent customer deposits and deferred revenue billed and/or received in advance of our fulfillment of performance obligations. Contract liabilities convert to revenue as we perform our obligations under the contract.\nPartner Licensing Revenue\nPartner licensing revenue consists of revenue that compensates us for services performed, such as formulation, process development, and preparation of pre-clinical and clinical drug product materials under research and development arrangements with partners. Revenues related to research and development are generally recognized as the related services or activities are performed using the output method and in accordance with the contract terms. To the extent that the agreements specify services are to be performed on a fixed basis, revenues are\nrecognized consistent with the pattern of the work performed. In agreements that specify milestones, we evaluate whether the milestones are considered probable of being achieved and estimate the amount to be included in the transaction price using the most likely amount method. If it is probable that a significant revenue reversal would not occur, the value of the associated milestone is recognized at a point in time. Non-refundable milestone payments related to arrangements under which we have continuing performance obligations would be deferred and recognized over the period of performance. Milestone payments that are not within our control, such as submission for approval to regulators by a partner or approvals from regulators, are not considered probable of being achieved until those submissions are submitted by the customer or approvals are received.\nProduct Returns\nConsistent with the industry practice, we generally offer customers a limited right of return of damaged or expired product that has been purchased directly from us. Our return policy generally allows customers to receive credit for expired products within 90 days after the product's expiration date. We estimate the amount of our product revenues that may be returned by our customers and record these estimates as a reduction of product revenues in the period the related product revenues are recognized, as well as within accrued liabilities, in the consolidated balance sheets.\nOur contract manufacturing customer retains control of their product during the entire manufacturing process and can make changes to the process or specifications at their request. There were no product returns.\nFair Value Measurements\nWe invest our cash in money market funds, cash deposits and debt instruments of the U.S. government agency securities. In the current market environment, the assessment of the fair value of the debt securities can be difficult and subjective. Accounting Standards Codification, or ASC, 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosure\" standard describes a fair value hierarchy based on three levels of inputs, of which the first two are considered observable and the last unobservable, that may be used to measure fair value which are the following:\n Level 1 Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities; Level 2 Inputs other than Level 1 that are observable, either directly or indirectly, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities; and Level 3 Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities. The determination of fair value for Level 3 instruments requires the most management judgment and subjectivity. \nInventories\nWe value inventory at the lower of cost or net realizable value. We determine the cost of inventory using the standard-cost method, which approximates actual cost based on a first-in, first-out method. We analyze our inventory levels quarterly and write down inventory subject to expire in excess of expected requirements, or that has a cost basis in excess of its expected net realizable value. These inventory related costs are recognized as cost of product revenues on the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. Currently our inventory consists of finished goods only.\nResearch and Development\nAs part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements, we are required to estimate accrued research and development expenses. Examples of estimated accrued expenses include fees paid to vendors and clinical sites in connection with our pivotal studies, to CROs in connection with our toxicology studies, and to contract manufacturers in connection with the production of API and formulated drug.\nWe review new and open contracts and communicate with applicable internal and vendor personnel to identify services that have been performed on our behalf and estimate the level of service performed and the associated costs incurred for the service when we have not yet been invoiced or otherwise notified of the actual cost for accrued expenses. The majority of our service providers invoice us monthly in arrears for services performed or as milestones are achieved in relation to our contract manufacturers. We make estimates of our accrued expenses as of each balance sheet date.\nWe base our accrued expenses related to pivotal studies on our estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to contracts with vendors, our internal resources, and payments to clinical sites based on enrollment projections. The financial terms of the vendor agreements are subject to negotiation, vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows. Payments under some of these contracts depend on factors such\nas the successful enrollment of animals and the completion of development milestones. We estimate the time period over which services will be performed and the level of effort to be expended in each period. If the actual timing of the performance of services or the level of effort varies from our estimate, we adjust the related expense accrual accordingly on a prospective basis. If we do not identify costs that have been incurred or if we underestimate or overestimate the level of services performed or the costs of these services, our actual expenses could differ from our estimates. To date, we have not made any material adjustments to our estimates of accrued research and development expenses or the level of services performed in any reporting period presented.\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe measure stock-based awards at fair value on the date of grant and recognize the corresponding compensation expense of the awards, net of estimated forfeitures, over the requisite service periods, which correspond to the vesting periods of the awards. Generally, we issue stock-based awards with only service-based vesting conditions, and record compensation expense for these awards using the straight-line method. Our intention is to grant stock-based awards with exercise prices equivalent to the fair value of our common stock as of the date of grant.\nThe fair value of each stock-based award is estimated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The expected volatility is based on the historic volatility of our own stock. The expected terms of our awards have been determined utilizing the simplified\u201d method, since our historical experience for option grants is not relevant to our expectations for recent grants. The risk-free interest rate is determined by reference to the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant of the award for time periods approximately equal to the expected term of the award. Expected dividend yield is zero, based on the fact that we have never paid cash dividends and do not expect to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future.

Also included in product sale is revenue derived from co-marketing products for our partners in conjunction with sales of Mirataz and Zimeta.\nOur net product revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020 decreased by 79.4% to $878,000 compared with $4,256,000 for the same period in 2019. The decrease is mainly due our sale of the Mirataz asset to Dechra in April 2020 compared with twelve months of Mirataz product sales in 2019. Net product revenue for Zimeta in 2020 was $27,000 compared with $127,000 in 2019, reflecting a downturn in equine events and transportation as a result of COVID-19. In conjunction with Mirataz and Zimeta, we also recorded $29,000 in revenue derived from co-marketing products for our partners, Butterfly Networks and Astaria Global in 2020.\nOur product sale revenue for the year ended December 31, 2019 increased by 116.5% to $4,256,000 compared with $1,966,000 for the same period in 2018. The increase is mainly due to a full year of Mirataz product\nsales while Mirataz only became commercial available to veterinarians in the United States in July 2018. In addition, our second product, Zimeta\u2122 (dipyrone injection) for the control of fever in horses was approved by the FDA and became commercially available in December 2019.\nAs a result of our licensing agreements with Dechra, we will be recording partner royalty revenues related to these products instead of product revenues going forward.\nRevenue from asset sale\nOur revenue from the Mirataz asset sale to Dechra for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $38.7 million. The remaining $4.3 million will be paid out of escrow beginning in 12 months assuming no escrow claims. There were no asset sales in 2019 or 2018.\nPartner royalties\nOur partner royalty revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $535,000, resulting from Dechra's net sales of Mirataz. There were no partner royalty revenues in 2019 or 2018.\nContract manufacturing revenue\nOn May 19, 2020, we entered into an agreement with Vaxart, Inc. for the manufacture of Vaxart's oral vaccine candidate for COVID-19. We recorded contract manufacturing revenue of $1.6 million based on the percentage completion of specific milestones. We did not have any contract manufacturing revenue in prior years.\nPartner licensing revenue\nOur partner licensing revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $0.5 million due to a non-refundable upfront payment from Elanco for the exclusive global rights to KIND-030. There were no partner licensing revenues in prior years.\nCost of Revenues\nOur cost of product sales for the year ended December 31, 2020 increased by 572.1% to $3,945,000 compared with $587,000 for the same period in 2019. Cost of product revenues consists primarily of the cost of direct materials, direct labor and overhead costs associated with manufacturing, inbound shipping and other third-party logistics costs. The increase is mainly due to the $3.8 million finished goods write-off related to the Dechra agreements signed in 2020, the majority of which is related to Mirataz. All remaining Mirataz products not included in the transferred assets to Dechra due to the transition to proprietary Dechra brand labelling was written off.\nOur cost of product sales for the year ended December 31, 2019 increased by 81.2% to $587,000 compared with $324,000 for the same period in 2018. Cost of product revenues consists primarily of the cost of direct materials, direct labor and overhead costs associated with manufacturing, inbound shipping and other third-party logistics costs. The increase reflected a full year of Mirataz product sales in 2019.\nOur cost of contract manufacturing for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $681,000. Contract manufacturing costs consist primarily of the cost of direct materials, direct labor and overhead costs associated with manufacturing, rent, facility costs and related machinery depreciation. We did not have any contract manufacturing costs in prior years.\nConcentrations of credit risk\nOur revenue was generated entirely from sales within the United States. Our product sales to three large distributors, namely MWI Animal Health, Henry Schein (now Covetrus North America) and Midwest Veterinary Supply, each accounted for more than 10% of gross product revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020. On a combined basis, in 2020, these distributors accounted for approximately 78% of our product sales.\nOur accounts receivable from amounts billed for contract manufacturing services in 2020 is derived from one customer. The contract requires up-front payment and installment payments during the service period. We perform periodic evaluations of the financial condition of our customers and generally do not require collateral, but we can terminate any contract if a material default occurs.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, our product sales to three large distributors, namely Henry Schein (now Covetrus North America), MWI Animal Health and Patterson Veterinary Supply each accounted for more than 10% of total revenues. On a combined basis, in 2019, these distributors accounted for approximately 85% of our product sales. We did not provide any contract manufacturing services in 2019 or 2018.\nProduct returns\nOur return policy generally allows customers to receive credit for expired products within 90 days after the product's expiration date. We estimated product return liabilities of 3% for Zimeta of gross revenue using probability-weighted available industry data and data provided by our distributors such as the inventories remaining in the distribution channel. Adjustments will be made in the future if actual results vary from our estimates.\nAccounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts\nAccounts receivable are stated at their carrying values, net of any allowances for doubtful accounts. Accounts receivable consist primarily of amounts due from distributors, our contract manufacturing customer, and licensing partner for which collection is probable based on the customer's intent and ability to pay. Receivables are evaluated for collection probability on a regular basis and an allowance for doubtful accounts is recorded, if necessary. We have no allowance for doubtful accounts as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, as our analysis did not uncover any collection risks.\nResearch and Development Expense\nAll costs of research and development are expensed in the period incurred. Research and development costs consist primarily of salaries and related expenses for personnel, stock-based compensation expense, fees paid to consultants, outside service providers, professional services, travel costs and materials used in clinical trials and research and development. We typically use our employee and infrastructure resources across multiple development programs.\nResearch and development expense was as follows for the periods indicated:\nTable 12: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In thousands except percentages) </td> <td>Years Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td>Annual percent change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020/2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019/2018 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Payroll and related\n</td> <td>$ </td> <td>10,868 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>12,646 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>10,204 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(14) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>24 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consulting\n</td> <td>800 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,406 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,360 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(67) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Field trial costs, including materials\n</td> <td>3,097 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,915 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(23) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Biologics development and supplies\n</td> <td>7,269 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,526 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,890 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>188 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(35) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Stock-based compensation\n</td> <td>1,883 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,848 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,746 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other\n</td> <td>7,364 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,869 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,284 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>51 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>31,281 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>28,310 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>26,399 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>7 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, research and development expense related primarily to advancing the development of KIND-030, KIND-016, KIND-032, KIND-510a and other early stage biologic programs.\nResearch and development expenses for the year ended December 31, 2020 increased by 10% to $31.3 million compared with $28.3 million for the same period in 2019. The increase was primarily due to the inclusion of expenses from the Kansas facility as it began to manufacture clinical trial material offset by lower costs as we stopped most small molecule development and prioritize our focus on late stage biologic candidates. Prior to 2020, construction and commissioning expenditures associated with the Kansas facility had been categorized as general\nand administrative expenses. Outsourced research and development expense related to KIND-030, KIND-510a, KIND-014 and other product development programs for the year ended December 31, 2020 were $1.3 million, $0.8 million, $0.4 million and $0.9 million, respectively.\nResearch and development expenses for the year ended December 31, 2019 increased by 7% to $28.3 million compared with $26.4 million for the same period in 2018. Payroll and related expenses increased by $2.4 million due to increase in headcount as we advance our biologics development and manufacturing programs. Higher regulatory and research fees, consulting, depreciation, rent as a result of expanded lab spaces and other facility costs also contributed to the increase in expenses, offset by lower non-GMP production and testing expenses. Outsourced research and development expense related to KIND-014, KIND-012, CAD programs, KIND-510a and other product development programs for the year ended December 31, 2019 were $1.7 million, $0.6 million, $0.5 million, $0.4 million and $1.3 million, respectively.\nWe expect research and development expense to decrease for the foreseeable future. While we expect biologics manufacturing expenses to increase due to the manufacture of KIND-016 and KIND-030 antibodies for our pivotal field studies, our excess manpower and capacity allow us to take on some contract manufacturing services thereby subsidizing the cost of our manufacturing facilities. Labor and associated benefits, supplies and facility expenses related to contract manufacturing services are recorded as cost of goods sold and would offset increases in our biologics manufacturing expenses, resulting in a net decrease in research and development expenses. Due to the inherently unpredictable nature of our development, we cannot reasonably estimate or predict the nature, specific timing or estimated costs of the efforts that will be necessary to complete the development of our product candidates.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expense\nThe composition of general and administrative expense was as follows for the periods indicated:\nTable 13: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In thousands except percentages) </td> <td>Years Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td>Annual percent change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020/2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019/2018 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Payroll and related\n</td> <td>$ </td> <td>6,294 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>15,385 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>9,498 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(59) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>62 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consulting, professional and legal fees\n</td> <td>4,115 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,523 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,561 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Stock-based compensation\n</td> <td>5,704 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,509 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,531 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>22 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Corporate and marketing expenses\n</td> <td>2,705 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,022 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,420 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(46) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other\n</td> <td>3,161 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,487 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,489 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(63) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>89 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>21,979 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>37,926 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>26,499 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(42) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>43 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nSelling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2020 decreased by 42% to $22.0 million compared with $37.9 million for the same period in 2019. The $15.9 million year-over-year decrease was mainly due to the re-categorization of Kansas plant expenditures as research and development expenses, and lower payroll and related expenses including marketing expenses as a result of the elimination of our companion animal sales force. The decrease was offset by higher legal fees.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2019 increased by 43% to $37.9 million compared with $26.5 million for the same period in 2018. Headcount increase was due to the expansion of our commercial organization and administrative personnel to support the company's growth. Sales and marketing expenses account for a big component of the increase. Higher stock-based compensation expense also contributed to the increase.\nWe expect selling, general and administrative expense to decrease going forward as a result of our transition to a partnership-focused commercialization strategy whereby pipeline assets are out-licensed to larger commercial partners that can maximize product opportunity in return for upfront payment, contingent milestones, and royalties on future sales.\nRestructuring Costs\nWe recorded restructuring charges of approximately $4.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The restructuring charge of approximately $1.7 million in the first quarter of 2020 was the result of the elimination of 53 positions due to the strategic realignment of our business model whereby we became a biologics-only company while stopping most small molecule development. All charges pertaining to this restructuring have been paid. The restructuring charge of approximately $2.3 million in the second quarter was the result of prioritizing our most attractive late stage programs and substantially reducing our expenses to best position the company for success with the new business model. Another 24 employees were impacted by the restructuring and all restructuring charges have been paid by the third quarter of 2020. We further eliminated another 5 positions in the third quarter and incurred a restructuring charge of approximately $0.3 million related to severance payments and health care benefits, exclusive of stock compensation.
