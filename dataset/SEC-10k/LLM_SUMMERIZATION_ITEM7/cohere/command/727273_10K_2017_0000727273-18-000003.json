Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nIn connection with the \"safe harbor\" provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, the following discussion contains trend analysis and other forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of words such as \"intends\", \"anticipates\", \"believes\", \"estimates\", \"projects\", \"forecasts\", \"expects\", \"plans\" and \"proposes\". Although we believe that the expectations reflected in these forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, there are a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements. These include, among others, our ability to maximize value from our land and water resources and our ability to obtain new financings as needed to meet our ongoing working capital needs. See additional discussion under the heading \"Risk Factors\" above.\nOverview\nWe are a land and water resource development company with 45,000 acres of land in three areas of eastern San Bernardino County, California. Virtually all of this land is underlain by high-quality, naturally recharging groundwater resources, and is situated in proximity to the Colorado River and the Colorado River Aqueduct (\"CRA\"), California's primary mode of water transportation for imports from the Colorado River into the State. Our properties are suitable for various uses, including large-scale agricultural development, groundwater storage and water supply projects. Our main objective is to realize the highest and best use of these land and water resources in an environmentally responsible way.\nWe believe that the long-term highest and best use of our land and water assets will be realized through the development of a combination of water supply and storage projects at our properties. Therefore, we have primarily focused on the development of the Cadiz Valley Water Conservation, Recovery and Storage Project (\"Water Project\" or \"Project\"), which will capture and conserve millions of acre-feet2 of native groundwater currently being lost to evaporation from the aquifer system beneath our 34,500-acre property in the Cadiz and Fenner valleys of eastern San Bernardino County (the \"Cadiz/Fenner Property\"), and deliver it to water providers throughout Southern California (see \"Water Resource Development\"). A second phase of the Water Project would offer storage of up to one million acre-feet of imported water in the aquifer system. We believe that the ultimate implementation of this Water Project will provide a significant source of future cash flow.\n2 One acre-foot is equal to approximately 326,000 gallons or the volume of water that will cover an area of one acre to a depth of one-foot. An acre-foot is generally considered to be enough water to meet the annual water needs of one average California household.\nThe primary factor driving the value of such projects is ongoing pressure on California's traditional water supplies and the resulting demand for new, reliable supply solutions that can meet both immediate and long-term water needs. Available supply is constrained by regulatory restrictions on each of the State's three main water sources: the CRA, the State Water Project, which provides water supplies from Northern California to the central and southern parts of the state, and the Los Angeles Aqueduct, which delivers water from the eastern Sierra Nevada mountains to Los Angeles. Southern California's water providers rely on imports from these systems for a majority of their water supplies, but deliveries from all three into the region have been below capacity over the last several years, even in wet years.\nFurther, the availability of supplies in California differs greatly from year to year due to natural hydrological variability. Over the last decade, California struggled through an historic drought featuring record-low winter precipitation. Then, following a series of strong storms that delivered record amounts of rain and snow during the 2016-2017 winter, state officials declared an end to the drought. Yet, the 2017-2018 winter has delivered few precipitation events and, through February 2018, 82% of the State is again abnormally dry according to the US Drought Monitor. The rapid swings between wet and dry years challenges California's traditional supply system and supports the need for reliable storage and local supply.\nSouthern California water providers are presently pursuing investments in storage, supply and infrastructure to meet long-term demand given the variety of challenges and limitations faced by the State's traditional infrastructure. The Cadiz Water Project is a local supply option in Southern California that could help address the region's water supply challenges by providing new reliable supply and local groundwater storage opportunities (see \"Water Resource Development\" below) in both dry and wet years. Following a multi-year California Environmental Quality Act (\"CEQA\") review and permitting process, the Water Project received permits that allow the capture and conservation of 2.5 million acre-feet of groundwater over 50 years in accordance with the terms of a groundwater management plan approved by San Bernardino County, the public agency responsible for groundwater use at the project area.\nOur current working capital requirements relate largely to the final development activities associated with the Water Project and those activities consistent with the Water Project related to further development of our land and agricultural assets. While we continue to believe that the ultimate implementation of the Water Project will provide the primary source of our future cash flow, we also believe there is significant additional value in our underlying agricultural assets.\nDemand for agricultural land with water rights is at an all-time high; therefore, in addition to our Water Project proposal, we are engaged in agricultural joint ventures at the Cadiz/Fenner Property that put some of the groundwater currently being lost to evaporation from the underlying aquifer system to immediate beneficial use. We have farmed portions of the Cadiz/Fenner Property since the late 1980s relying on groundwater from the aquifer system for irrigation and the site is well suited for various permanent and seasonal crops. Presently, the property has 2,100 acres leased for cultivation of a variety of crops, including citrus, dried-on-the-vine raisins and seasonal vegetables.\nWe also continue to explore additional uses of our land and water resource assets, including the marketing of our approved desert tortoise land conservation bank, which is located on our properties outside the Water Project area, and other long-term legacy uses of our properties, such as habitat conservation and cultural development.\nWater Resource Development\nThe Water Project is designed to capture and conserve billions of gallons of renewable native groundwater currently being lost to evaporation from the aquifer system underlying our Cadiz/Fenner Property, and provide a new reliable water supply for approximately 400,000 people in Southern California. In this first phase, Phase 1, the total quantity of groundwater to be recovered and conveyed to Water Project participants will not exceed a long-term annual average of 50,000 acre-feet per year for 50 years. The Water Project also offers participants in Phase 1 the ability to carry-over their annual supply and store it in the groundwater basin from year to year. A second phase of the Water Project, Phase II, will offer up to one million acre-feet of storage capacity that can be used to hold water supplies imported to the project area.\nWater Project facilities required for Phase I primarily include, among other things:\nTable 19: <table> <tr> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> High-yield wells designed to efficiently recover available native groundwater from beneath the Water Project area;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 20: <table> <tr> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> A water conveyance pipeline to deliver water from the well-field to the Colorado River Aqueduct (\"CRA\") for further delivery to Project participants; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 21: <table> <tr> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> An energy source to provide power to the well-field, pipeline and pumping facilities.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIf an imported water storage component of the Project is ultimately implemented in Phase II, the following additional facilities would be required, among other things:\nTable 22: <table> <tr> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> Facilities to pump water through the conveyance pipeline from the CRA to the Water Project well-field and/or through the Company's pipeline from Cadiz to Barstow, CA; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 23: <table> <tr> <td> \u00b7\n</td> <td> Spreading basins, which are shallow settling ponds that will be configured to efficiently percolate water from the ground surface down to the water table using subsurface storage capacity for the storage of water.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nPhase I\nPhase I has been fully reviewed and permitted in accordance with the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA). In May 2016, all permits and approvals were sustained in the California Court of Appeal and are no longer subject to further litigation. As a result, the Project presently is permitted to provide an average of 50,000 acre-feet of water for 50 years to meet municipal and industrial (M&I) water needs in Southern California.\nIn October 2017, the US Bureau of Land Management (\"BLM\") provided a letter finding that the Project's proposed use of a portion of the Arizona & California Railroad Company (\"ARZC\") right-of-way from Cadiz to Freda, California to construct and operate the Water Project's water conveyance pipeline and related railroad improvements from Cadiz to the CRA is within the scope of the original right of way grant and not subject to additional permitting or review. The buried pipeline would be constructed parallel to the railroad tracks and be used to convey water between our Cadiz Valley property and the CRA.\nConstruction of Phase I Water Project facilities is expected to cost approximately $250 million and will require capital financing that we expect will be secured by definitive Purchase and Sale Agreements with Project participants and the new facility assets. On May 25, 2017, the Company closed a strategic transaction with funds affiliated with Apollo Global Management, LLC (\"Apollo\"), a leading global alternative investment manager with approximately $197 billion of assets under management, to initiate financial arrangements for the construction of Phase I. In furtherance of the strategic transaction, funds managed by affiliates of Apollo and the Company executed a conditional commitment of up to $240 million for Phase I construction finance expenditures. The conditional commitment is intended to provide the additional resources necessary to complete the construction of Phase I of the Water Project. However, Cadiz is not obligated to accept such financing from Apollo, and Apollo's commitment is conditional (see \"Liquidity and Capital Resources\", below). We expect to finalize construction financing after the final terms of contracts and conveyance are negotiated, as described below.\nIn addition to finalizing construction financing terms as described above, prior to construction, the Water Project must (1) finalize contracts with Project participating agencies, (2) secure transportation arrangements to deliver water into each participant's service area, and (3) complete final design, engineering and construction permitting. Below is a discussion of present activities to advance these objectives.\n(1) Contracts with Public Water Agencies or Private Water Utilities\nThe Company has executed Letters of Intent (\"LOIs\"), option agreements and purchase agreements, or contracts (collectively, \"Agreements\") with public water agencies and private water utilities in California during the Project's development. These participating agencies serve more than one million customers in cities throughout California's San Bernardino, Riverside, Los Angeles, Orange, Imperial and Ventura Counties. Twenty percent of Water Project supplies have been reserved for San Bernardino County-based agencies.\nSanta Margarita Water District (\"SMWD\"), Orange County's second largest water provider, was the first participant to convert its option agreement and adopt resolutions approving a Water Purchase and Sale Agreement for 5,000 acre-feet of water. The structure of the SMWD purchase agreement calls for an annually adjusted water supply payment, plus a pro rata portion of the capital recovery charge and operating and maintenance costs. The capital recovery charge is calculated by amortizing the total capital investment by the Company over a 30-year term.\nAgreements entered into prior to the beginning of the CEQA review process provide the right to acquire an annual supply of 5,000 acre-feet of water at $775 per acre-foot (2010 dollars, subject to adjustment), which is competitive with the incremental cost of new water. In addition, these agencies received options to acquire storage rights in the Water Project to allow for the management of their Water Project supplies in complement with their own water resources. Up to 150,000 acre-feet of carry-over storage is available for reservation by the agencies prior to construction commencement. Participants that elect to achieve year-to-year flexibility in their use of Project water by utilizing carry-over storage will reserve storage capacity for $1,500 per acre-foot prior to construction.\nLOIs that have been entered into since completion of the CEQA review process reserve supplies from the Water Project at $960 per acre-foot (2014 dollars, subject to adjustment). These LOIs also include the option to reserve carry-over storage capacity for $1,500 per acre-foot prior to construction.\nPresently, total reservations of supplies from the Water Project via these Agreements are in excess of Water Project capacity. Prior to construction of the Water Project, we expect to convert existing option agreements and LOIs to purchase agreements. We are working collaboratively with the participating water agencies to account for any oversubscription in the final definitive Purchase and Sale Agreements we enter into with these agencies and allow for inclusive participation across Southern California.\n(2) Conveyance Arrangements\nPrior to construction of the Water Project, and in coordination with final participation contracts described in (1) above, an agreement and terms for moving water supplies in the CRA must be negotiated with Metropolitan Water District of Southern California (\"Metropolitan\"), which owns and controls the CRA.\nWater supplies conserved by the Project would enter the CRA at the termination of the project's conveyance pipeline near Rice, CA. The CEQA process considered a variety of options to enter the CRA and assumed final entry into the CRA would be determined by MWD in consultation with the Project's participating agencies. Once arrangements are reached, the Metropolitan Board would take action as a responsible agency under CEQA regarding the terms and conditions of the Water Project's use of the CRA to transport water to its participating agencies.\nThere is no application yet before Metropolitan related to entry and transportation of Project supplies, but we expect such a formal application will be filed in 2018 as the Project's contractual arrangements with participants are finalized. Any agreement as to the terms and conditions of the Water Project's use of the CRA will be negotiated between and entered into by Metropolitan and the Project participating agencies, not the Company. Discussions with Metropolitan regarding conveyance of Project water in the CRA have been led by SMWD, the Water Project's CEQA lead agency.\nWater Project supplies entering the CRA will comply with Metropolitan's published engineering, design and water quality standards and will be subject to all applicable fees and charges routinely established by Metropolitan for the conveyance of water within its service territory. We believe there are multiple benefits that can be secured by MWD upon making space reasonably available for the Water Project supplies and having the flexibility of relying on the Water Project in both wet and dry years.\n(3) Final Design and Permitting\nAs a component of completing contract terms with participating agencies and related wheeling arrangements with Metropolitan, we must also finalize design of Project facilities and acquire relevant construction permits with state and local agencies. Together with SMWD we have engaged engineering and environmental consultants to complete design plans for the 43-mile pipeline, Project wellfield, any necessary water treatment facilities, and facilities required to connect to the Metropolitan system at and near the CRA. This work is ongoing and expected to proceed in coordination with the negotiation of contracts and wheeling arrangements.\nOnce facility design and layout near completion, we will need to obtain additional permits and approvals from state or local entities prior to construction. This may include but is not limited to confirmation of existing access rights, easements and rights-of-way, for areas that may be crossed by Project facilities in the Project area subject to final pipeline configuration.\nPhase II\nIn a second phase of the Water Project, we expect to make available up to one million acre-feet of capacity in the aquifer system for storage of surplus water conveyed to the Project area. Under the Imported Water Storage Component, or Phase II, water from the Colorado River or the State Water Project could be conveyed to spreading basins that would be constructed on our private property to percolate into the aquifer system and held in storage. When needed, previously stored water would be returned to Phase II participating agencies via the Project's 43-mile conveyance pipeline to the CRA, described above, or via an existing 96-mile pipeline that extends from our Cadiz property northwest to Barstow and Bakersfield, California (see \"Northern Pipeline\" below).\nPhase II has already been the subject of programmatic environmental review in accordance with CEQA, but still requires project-level environmental review and permitting once participating agencies are identified. Phase II may also require federal permits subject to the National Environmental Policy Act, or NEPA.\nNorthern Pipeline\nWe currently own a 96-mile existing idle natural gas pipeline that extends from the Cadiz/Fenner Property to Barstow, California and we intend to convert this pipeline to allow for the transportation of water. The Barstow area serves as a hub for water delivered from northern and central California to communities in Southern California's High Desert. In addition, we hold an option to purchase a further 124-mile segment of this pipeline from Barstow to Wheeler Ridge, California for $20 million. This option expires in December 2018. We do not currently have the cash resources on hand to exercise this option and have engaged an investment banker to pursue alternatives that will provide the resources to allow us to exercise this option. If we are unable to exercise this option, then our Northern Pipeline opportunities will be limited to the 96- mile segment we currently own.\nInitial feasibility studies indicated that, upon conversion, the 30-inch pipeline could transport between 18,000 and 30,000 acre-feet of water per year between the Water Project area and various points along the Central and Northern California water transportation network. As a result, this pipeline could create significant opportunities for our water resource development efforts.\nIf this pipeline were to become operational, then the Water Project would link two major water delivery systems in California, providing flexible opportunities for both supply and storage. The Northern Pipeline could deliver Phase I supplies, either directly or via exchange, to existing and potential customers of Phase I of the Project. Any use of the pipeline would be conducted in conformity with the Water Project's groundwater management plan and is subject to further CEQA evaluation and potentially federal environmental permitting.\nThe Northern Pipeline also represents new opportunities for the Company, independent of the Water Project, to offer water transportation to locations along the pipeline route that are not presently interconnected by existing water infrastructure. The entire 220-mile pipeline crosses California's major water infrastructure as well as urban and agricultural centers and can be utilized to transport water, independent of the Water Project, between users who presently lack direct interconnections along the pipeline route. We are presently engaged in discussions with parties that may be interested in such transportation.\nAgricultural Development\nWithin the Cadiz/Fenner Property, all of the existing 34,500 acres are currently zoned for agriculture. In 1993, we secured conditional use permits to develop agriculture on up to 9,600 acres of the property and withdraw groundwater from the underlying aquifer system for irrigation. We have since maintained various levels of crops on the Property as we developed the Water Project. In 2013, we entered into a lease agreement with a third party to develop up to 1,480 acres of lemons at the site, 640 acres of which have been planted to date.\nIn February 2016, we entered into a lease agreement with Fenner Valley Farms LLC (\"FVF\"), a subsidiary of Water Asset Management LLC, a related party, pursuant to which FVF leased, for a 99-year term, 2,100 acres at the Cadiz/Fenner property to be used to plant, grow and harvest agricultural crops (\"FVF Lease\"). As consideration for the lease, FVF paid the Company a one-time payment of $12,000,000 in February 2016. The acreage that was historically farmed by the Company and the acreage that is leased to a third party to develop lemons was included within the leased acreage. Following entry into this lease, we are no longer directly involved in the current agricultural operations at the site and all agricultural revenue is derived pursuant to the FVF Lease.\nAs part of the agricultural development to be conducted under the lease arrangements, the groundwater production capacity of the property's existing well-field is expected to be enhanced through infrastructure improvements that are complementary to the Water Project. While any additional well-field development for agricultural use would be financed by our agricultural partners as provided under our agricultural lease arrangements, we retained a call feature that allows us, at any time in the initial 20 years, to acquire the well-field and integrate any new agricultural well-field infrastructure developed into the Water Project's facilities.\nAdditional Eastern Mojave Properties\nWe also own approximately 11,000 acres outside of the Cadiz/Fenner Valley area in two locations within the Mojave Desert in eastern San Bernardino County.\nOur primary landholding outside of the Cadiz area is approximately 9,000 acres in the Piute Valley. This landholding is located approximately 15 miles from the resort community of Laughlin, Nevada, and about 12 miles from the Colorado River town of Needles, California. Extensive hydrological studies, including the drilling and testing of a full-scale production well, have demonstrated that this landholding is underlain by high-quality groundwater. The aquifer system underlying this property is naturally recharged by precipitation (both rain and snow) within a watershed of approximately 975 square miles and could be suitable for a water supply project, agricultural development or solar energy production. These properties are located in or adjacent to areas designated by the federal government as National Monument, Critical Desert Tortoise Habitat and/or Desert Wilderness Areas and are suitable candidates for preservation and conservation (see \"Land Conservation Bank\" below).\nAdditionally, we own acreage located near Danby Dry Lake in Ward Valley, approximately 30 miles southeast of our Cadiz/Fenner Valley properties. The Danby Dry Lake property is located approximately 10 miles north of the CRA. Initial hydrological studies indicate that the area has excellent potential for a water supply project. Certain of the properties in this area may also be suitable for agricultural development and/or preservation and conservation.\nLand Conservation Bank\nApproximately 7,500 acres of our properties outside of the Cadiz/Fenner Valley area in the Piute Valley are located within terrain designated by the federal government as Critical Desert Tortoise Habitat and/or Desert Wilderness Areas and offer limited development opportunities. In February 2015, the California Department of Fish and Wildlife approved our establishment of the Fenner Valley Desert Tortoise Conservation Bank (\"Fenner Bank\"), a land conservation bank that makes available these properties for mitigation of impacts to tortoise and other sensitive species that would be caused by development across the Southern California desert. Under its enabling documents, the Fenner Bank offers credits that can be acquired by entities that must mitigate or offset impacts linked to planned development. For example, this bank can service the mitigation requirements of renewable energy, military, residential and commercial development projects being considered throughout the desert. Credits sold by the Fenner Bank will fund our permanent preservation of the land as well as research by outside entities, including San Diego Zoo Global, into desert tortoise health and species protection.\nOther Opportunities\nOther opportunities in the water and agricultural or related infrastructure business complementary to our current objectives could provide new opportunities for our Company.\nOver the longer-term, we believe the population of Southern California, Nevada and Arizona will continue to grow, and that, in time, the economics of commercial and residential development at our properties may become attractive.\nWe remain committed to the sustainable use of our land and water assets, and will continue to explore all opportunities for environmentally responsible development of these assets. We cannot estimate which of these opportunities will ultimately be utilized.\nResults of Operations\nTable 24: <table> <tr> <td> (a)\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2016\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe have not received significant revenues from our water resource and real estate development activities to date. Our revenues have been limited to rental income from the FVF Lease (see \"Agricultural Development\", above). As a result, we have historically incurred a net loss from operations. We had revenues of $437 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2017, and $412 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2016. The net loss totaled $33.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared with a net loss of $26.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The higher loss in 2017 was primarily related to a $3.5 million loss on extinguishment of debt and $2.6 million in unrealized losses recorded for warrant liabilities. The higher 2017 loss was also related to an increase in stock compensation resulting from the vesting of milestone shares earned by employees, an increase in cash bonus awards to employees, and an increase in general and administrative expense due to pre-construction engineering activities in connection with the Water Project.\nOur primary expenses are our ongoing overhead costs associated with the development of the Water Project (i.e., general and administrative expense) and our interest expense. We will continue to incur non-cash expense in connection with our management and director equity incentive compensation plans.\nRevenues. Revenue totaled $437 thousand during the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $412 thousand during the year ended December 31, 2016. The 2017 revenue is primarily related to rental income from the FVF Lease (see \"Agricultural Development\", above).\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses. General and administrative expenses during the year ended December 31, 2017, totaled $12.8 million compared with $9.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Non-cash compensation costs related to stock and option awards are included in general and administrative expenses.\nGeneral and administrative expenses, exclusive of stock-based compensation costs, totaled $10.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared with $8.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in general and administrative expense in 2017 was primarily due to pre-construction engineering activities in connection with the Water Project and an increase in cash bonus awards to employees.\nCompensation costs from stock and option awards for the year ended December 31, 2017, totaled $2.3 million compared with $1.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The higher 2017 expense primarily reflects the vesting of milestone shares earned by employees and consultants of the Company.\nDepreciation. Depreciation expense totaled $274 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2017, and $292 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nInterest Expense, net. Net interest expense totaled $17.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $14.9 million during 2016. The following table summarizes the components of net interest expense for the two periods (in thousands):\nTable 25: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest on outstanding debt\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 11,279\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 9,664\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Unrealized losses on warrants\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2,608\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Amortization of debt discount\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 3,690\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 4,973\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Amortization of deferred loan costs\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest income\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (51\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 17,719\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 14,875\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe interest on outstanding debt increased from $9.7 million to $11.3 million due to compounded interest on a larger credit facility associated with our May 2017 debt refinancing. Additionally, during the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company recorded net unrealized losses on warrants of $2.6 million, which included $3.1 million in unrealized losses related to the issuance of shares to former lenders (see Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Common Stock\") and $508 thousand in unrealized gains related to our May 2017 debt refinancing. (See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Long-Term Debt\").\nDebt Refinancings. In May 2017, we entered into a new $60 million credit agreement (\"Credit Agreement\") with funds affiliated with Apollo Global Management, LLC (\"Apollo\") that replaced and refinanced our then existing $45 million senior secured mortgage debt (\"Prior Senior Secured Debt\") and provided $15 million of new senior debt to fund immediate construction related expenditures (\"New Senior Secured Debt\"). The New Senior Secured Debt will mature on the earliest of (a) the four year anniversary of the Closing Date, and (b) the \"Springing Maturity Date\", which is defined as the date which is 91 days prior to the maturity date of the 7.00% Convertible Senior Notes of Cadiz due 2020 (the \"New Convertible Notes\") that were issued in December 2015 and April 2016 pursuant to the New Convertible Notes Indenture as defined in the Credit Agreement, if on the 91st day preceding the maturity date of the New Convertible Notes, the 5-Day VWAP, as defined in the Credit Agreement, is less than 120% of the then applicable Conversion Rate, as defined in the New Convertible Notes Indenture, and at least $10,000,000 in original principal amount of the New Convertible Notes is outstanding ((a) or (b), as applicable, the \"Maturity Date\"). Interest on the New Senior Secured Debt is due quarterly on each March 31, June 30, September 30 and December 31 (each an \"Interest Date\") beginning on June 30, 2017. Interest on the New Senior Secured Debt will (i) accrete to the outstanding principal amount at a rate per annum equal to 6% (the \"PIK Rate\") compounded quarterly on each Interest Date and (ii) accrue on the outstanding principal amount at a rate per annum equal to 2% (the \"Cash Rate\"). We, in our discretion, may make any quarterly interest payment in cash on the applicable Interest Date at the PIK Rate, in lieu of accretion of such interest to the principal amount at the PIK Rate. The proceeds from the Credit Agreement were used to repay the Prior Senior Secured Debt resulting in a loss on extinguishment of $3.5 million which consisted of the write-off of unamortized debt discount, unamortized debt issuance costs and fees paid to the former lenders. In addition, we incurred $1.5 million in legal and finders' fees which was recorded as additional debt discount and is being amortized through December 2019, which is the Springing Maturity Date as discussed above.\nIn conjunction with the closing of the New Senior Secured Debt, we issued to Apollo a warrant to purchase an aggregate of 362,500 shares of our common stock (\"2017 Warrant\"). The Company recorded a debt discount at the time of the closing of the New Senior Secured Debt in the amount of $2.9 million which was the fair value of the 2017 Warrant issued. The debt discount is being amortized through December 2019, which is the Springing Maturity Date as discussed above. The fair value of the 2017 Warrant will be remeasured each reporting period, and the change in warrant value will be recorded as interest expense and an adjustment to the derivative liability. The warrant has a five-year term and an exercise price of $14.94 per share, subject to adjustment.\nTable 26: <table> <tr> <td> (b)\n</td> <td> Year Ended December 31, 2016 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2015\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe had revenues of $412 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2016, and $304 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2015. The net loss totaled $26.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared with a net loss of $24.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The higher loss in 2016 was primarily related to a $2.25 million loss on extinguishment of debt. The higher 2016 loss was also related to higher interest expense on additional convertible debt issued and higher amortization expense, offset by a decrease in litigation costs related to the Water Project due to the timing of the appellate litigation.\nRevenues. Revenue totaled $412 thousand during the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to $304 thousand during the year ended December 31, 2015. The 2016 revenue is primarily related to rental income from the FVF Lease (see \"Agricultural Development\", above).\nCost of Sales. Cost of sales were zero for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared with $334 thousand during the year ended December 31, 2015.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses. General and administrative expenses during the year ended December 31, 2016, totaled $9.3 million compared with $13.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. Non-cash compensation costs related to stock and option awards are included in general and administrative expenses.\nGeneral and administrative expenses, exclusive of stock-based compensation costs, totaled $8.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2016, compared with $12.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease in general and administrative expense in 2016 was primarily due to lower litigation costs related to the Water Project due to the timing of the appellate litigation (see Item 1. - \"Business, (a) General Development of Business\", above.)\nCompensation costs from stock and option awards for the year ended December 31, 2016, totaled $1.3 million compared with $1.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The higher 2016 expense was primarily due to higher stock-based non-cash compensation costs related to shares awarded to the Brownstein law firm for certain legal and advisory services to the Company.\nDepreciation. Depreciation expense totaled $292 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2016, and $270 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nInterest Expense, net. Net interest expense totaled $14.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to $10.1 million during 2015. The following table summarizes the components of net interest expense for the two periods (in thousands):\nTable 27: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest on outstanding debt\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 9,664\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 8,237\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Amortization of debt discount\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 4,973\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1,635\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Amortization of deferred loan costs\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 14,875\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 10,070\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe interest on outstanding debt increased from $8.2 million to $9.7 million due to compounded interest on the debt facilities resulting in a higher principal balance. Amortization of debt discount increased from $1.6 million to $5.0 million primarily due to the acceleration of unamortized debt discount related to the conversion of approximately $2.8 million in original principal amount of the 2020 Notes that were issued in April 2016.\nPrior Debt Refinancings. In April 2016, we entered into a note purchase agreement with new and existing investors (the \"Investors\"). Pursuant to the agreement, we issued approximately $10.0 million of our 7.00% Convertible Senior Notes due 2020 (\"2020 Notes) in aggregate principal and accrued interest. The proceeds from the issuance of the 2020 Notes (such 2020 Notes, the \"New Notes\"), are used for general working capital purposes. The 2020 Notes accrue interest at 7.00% per year, with no principal or interest payments due prior to maturity on March 5, 2020. The 2020 Notes, including original principal and accrued interest, are convertible at any time into the Company's common stock at a price of $6.75 per share, pursuant to the terms of the Indenture dated as of December 10, 2015, by and between the Company and US Bank National Association (the \"Indenture\"), under which the New Notes were issued. As a result of this transaction, we recorded a debt discount in the amount of $2.0 million which is the difference between the proceeds from this transaction and the principal and accrued interest of New Notes on the day of the issuance. In addition, based on the conversion rate of $6.75 per share, the fair value of the shares receivable on conversion exceed the $8.0 million in net proceeds; therefore, a beneficial conversion feature was recorded in the amount of $1.48 million. This amount was recorded as additional debt discount with a corresponding amount recorded as additional paid-in capital. Such debt discount is accreted to the redemption value of the instrument over the remaining term of the loan. Furthermore, we incurred $400 thousand in placement agent fees which was recorded as additional debt discount and is being amortized over the remaining term of the loan.\nIn November 2016, we entered into an agreement with our then senior lenders which (i) extended the maturity date of our secured senior debt from September 2017 to September 2019 and (ii) permits us to satisfy the cash interest payment obligations through the issuance of shares of the Company's common stock. In connection with the agreement, we issued to our then senior lenders an aggregate of 357,500 shares of the Company's common stock and warrants to purchase an aggregate of 357,500 shares of its common stock (\"2016 Warrants\"). The Company recorded a debt discount in the amount of $3.4 million which was the fair value of the 357,500 shares issued. Such debt discount was accreted over the remaining term of the loan. The 2016 Warrants had a five- year term and an exercise price of $0.01 per share. In October 2017, the Company agreed to issue an aggregate of 264,096 shares of the Company's common stock with an aggregate value of $3.3 million in connection with a Payoff Agreement the Company entered into with prior lenders on May 24, 2017. Effective upon the delivery of the 264,096 shares, the 2016 Warrants were deemed cancelled. The Company recorded a $3.1 million expense in 2017 for the issuance of these shares and cancellation of the warrants. The expense is included in interest expense. Additionally, we filed a prospectus supplement to our S-3 registration statement, number 333-214318, indicating that we were offering 800,000 shares of our common stock to satisfy the cash interest payment obligations under the Credit Agreement in an aggregate amount equal to $5,639,916. Only 78,942 shares of the 800,000 shares offered were issued as payment of our interest obligations with an aggregate value of $866,345, prior to May 26, 2017, when we repaid in full, in cash, all amounts due under the Credit Agreement. Therefore, because the additional 721,058 (\"Unissued Shares\") included in the prospectus supplement will not be issued to pay the interest due under the Credit Agreement, the offering of the Unissued Shares with an aggregate value of $4,773,571 has been terminated.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n(a) Current Financing Arrangements\nAs we have not received significant revenues from our development activities to date, we have been required to obtain financing to bridge the gap between the time water resource and other development expenses are incurred and the time that revenue will commence. Historically, we have addressed these needs primarily through secured debt financing arrangements, private equity placements and the exercise of outstanding stock options and warrants. We have also worked with our secured lenders to structure our debt in a way which allows us to continue development of the Water Project and minimize the dilution of the ownership interests of common stockholders.\nOn May 25, 2017, we entered into a new $60 million credit agreement with funds affiliated with Apollo Global Management, LLC (\"Apollo\") that replaced and refinanced our then existing $45 million senior secured mortgage debt (\"Prior Senior Secured Debt\") and provided $15 million of new senior debt to fund immediate construction related expenditures (\"New Senior Secured Debt\"). Additionally, funds affiliated with Apollo also executed a conditional commitment letter to fund up to $240 million in construction finance expenditures for the Cadiz Water Project, subject to the satisfaction of conditions precedent. It is intended to provide the additional resources necessary to complete the construction of Phase I of the Water Project. Apollo's commitment for up to $240 million is conditional and Cadiz is not obligated to accept such financing from Apollo.\nThe New Senior Secured Debt and the convertible notes contain representations, warranties and covenants that are typical for agreements of this type, including restrictions that would limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness, incur liens, pay dividends or make restricted payments, dispose of assets, make investments and merge or consolidate with another person. However, while there are affirmative covenants, there are no financial maintenance covenants and no restrictions on our ability to issue additional common stock to fund future working capital needs. The debt covenants associated with the New Senior Secured Debt were negotiated by the parties with a view towards our operating and financial condition as it existed at the time the agreements were executed. At December 31, 2017, we were in compliance with our debt covenants.\nLimitations on our liquidity and ability to raise capital may adversely affect us. Sufficient liquidity is critical to meet our resource development activities. We currently expect our cash on hand to be sufficient to meet our working capital needs for a period beyond one year from this annual report issuance date. To the extent additional capital is required, we may increase liquidity through a variety of means, including equity or debt placements, through the lease, sale or other disposition of assets or reductions in operating costs. Equity placements, if made, would be undertaken only to the extent necessary, so as to minimize the dilutive effect of any such placements upon our existing stockholders.\nAs we continue to actively pursue our business strategy, additional financing will continue to be required. See \"Outlook\" below. The covenants in the term debt do not prohibit our use of additional equity financing and allow us to retain 100% of the proceeds of any equity financing. We do not expect the loan covenants to materially limit our ability to finance our water development activities.\nAt December 31, 2017, we had no outstanding credit facilities other than the New Senior Secured Debt and the convertible notes.\nCash Used for Operating Activities. Cash used for operating activities totaled $10.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, $9.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, and $12.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The cash was primarily used to fund general and administrative expenses related to our water development efforts and litigation costs.\nCash Used For Investing Activities. Cash used for investing activities in the year ended December 31, 2017, was $1.0 million, compared with zero for the year ended December 31, 2016, and $906 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2015. The 2017 costs consisted of engineering and design related to the development of the Water Project, and the 2015 period primarily included additional investments in well-field and environmental work related to progressing the Water Project.\nCash Provided by (Used for) Financing Activities. Cash provided by financing activities totaled $12.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared with cash provided by financing activities of $19.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, and cash used for financing activities of $42 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2015. The 2017 results include $12.3 million of net proceeds from the issuance of long term debt. The 2016 results include proceeds of approximately $12.0 million related to the FVF Lease (see \"Agricultural Development\", above), $8.0 million in net proceeds related to convertible note financing and approximately $10.5 million in proceeds from the issuance of shares under a shelf takedown offering, offset by $960 thousand in recorded debt issuance costs and a principal payment of approximately $10.6 million on the Prior Senior Secured Debt.\n(b) Outlook\nShort-Term Outlook. Our cash resources of $13.0 million as of December 31, 2017 provide us with sufficient funds to meet our working capital needs through April 2019. As of March 5, 2018, $1.35 million of short-term debt was removed when certain of our lenders elected to convert all principal and accrued interest under the 2018 Convertible Notes. As we require additional working capital to fund operations, we expect to continue our historical practice of structuring our financing arrangements to match the anticipated needs of our development activities. See \"Long-Term Outlook\" below. No assurances can be given, however, as to the availability or terms of any new financing. Additionally, our option to acquire an additional 124-mile extension of our Northern Pipeline will require a $20 million payment by December 2018. We do not currently have the cash resources on hand to exercise this option and have engaged an investment banker to pursue alternatives that will provide the resources to allow us to exercise this option. If we are unable to exercise this option, then our Northern Pipeline opportunities will be limited to the 96-mile segment we currently own.\nLong-Term Outlook. In the longer term, we will need to raise additional capital to finance working capital needs, capital expenditures and any payments due under our Senior Secured Debt or our convertible notes at maturity (see \"Current Financing Arrangements\" above). Our future working capital needs will depend upon the specific measures we pursue in the entitlement and development of our water resources and other developments. Future capital expenditures will depend primarily on the progress of the Water Project.\nWe are evaluating the amount of cash needed, and the manner in which such cash will be raised, on an ongoing basis. We may meet any future cash requirements through a variety of means, including construction financing to be provided by the Apollo conditional commitment letter described above (see \"Debt Refinancings\" above), equity and debt placements, or through the sale or other disposition of assets. Equity placements would be undertaken only to the extent necessary, so as to minimize the dilution effect of any such placements upon our existing stockholders. Limitations on our liquidity and ability to raise capital may adversely affect us. Sufficient liquidity is critical to meet our resource development activities.\n(c) Critical Accounting Policies\nAs discussed in Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements, the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and related footnotes. In preparing these financial statements, management has made its best estimates and judgments of certain amounts included in the financial statements based on all relevant information available at the time and giving due consideration to materiality. We do not believe there is a great likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported related to the accounting policies described below. However, application of these policies involves the exercise of judgment and use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and, as a result, actual results could differ from these estimates. Management has concluded that the following critical accounting policies described below affect the most significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements.\n(1) Intangible and Other Long-Lived Assets. Property, plant and equipment, intangible and certain other long-lived assets are depreciated or amortized over their useful lives. Useful lives are based on management's estimates of the period over which the assets will generate revenue.\n(2) Goodwill. As a result of a merger in May 1988 between two companies, which eventually became known as Cadiz Inc., goodwill in the amount of $7,006,000 was recorded. Approximately $3,193,000 of this amount was amortized until the adoption of Accounting Standards Codification 350, \"Intangibles - Goodwill and Other\" on January 1, 2002.\n(3) Valuation of Goodwill and Long-Lived Assets. The Company assesses long-lived assets, excluding goodwill, for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable through the estimated undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the assets. If it is determined that the carrying value of long-lived assets may not be recoverable, the impairment is measured by using the projected discounted cash-flow method.\nThe Company uses a one-step impairment test to identify potential goodwill impairment and measure the amount of a goodwill impairment loss to be recognized (if any) for the Company. This quantitative assessment is performed at least annually and compares a reporting unit's fair value to its carrying amount to determine if there is a potential impairment. An impairment loss will be recognized for the amount by which the reporting unit's carrying amount exceeds its fair value, not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill in that reporting unit.\n(4) Deferred Tax Assets and Valuation Allowances. To date, the Company has not generated significant revenue from its water development programs, and it has a history of net operating losses. As such, the Company has generated significant deferred tax assets, including large net operating loss carryforwards for federal and state income taxes for which it has recorded a full valuation allowance. Management is currently working on water storage, water supply, and agricultural projects, including the Water Project, that are designed to generate future taxable income, although there can be no guarantee that this will occur. If taxable income is generated in future years, some portion or all of the valuation allowance will be reversed, and an increase in net income would consequently be reported.\n(5) Stock-Based Compensation. The Company applies the Black-Scholes valuation model in determining the fair value of options granted to employees and consultants. For employees, the fair value is then charged to expense on the straight-line basis over the requisite service period. For consultants, the fair value is remeasured at each reporting period and recorded as a liability until the award is settled.\nAccounting Standards Codification Topic 718, \"Compensation - Stock Compensation\" also requires the Company to estimate forfeitures in calculating the expense related to stock-based compensation as opposed to only recognizing forfeitures and the corresponding reduction in expense as they occur. As of December 31, 2017, all options outstanding are fully vested; therefore, there is no potential impact of forfeitures.\n(6) Valuation of Warrants. In November 2016, the Company issued to its then senior lenders warrants to purchase an aggregate of 357,500 shares of the Company's common stock (\"2016 Warrants\"). The 2016 Warrants had a five-year term and an exercise price of $.01 per share. The fair value of these warrants was determined using the Black-Scholes pricing model. The fair value of the 2016 Warrants was remeasured each reporting period, and the change in warrant value was recorded as an adjustment to the derivative liability with unrealized gains or losses reflected in interest expense. In October 2017, the Company agreed to issue an aggregate of 264,096 shares of the Company's common stock with an aggregate value of $3.3 million in connection with a Payoff Agreement the Company entered into with prior lenders on May 24, 2017. Effective upon the delivery of the 264,096 shares, the 2016 Warrants were deemed cancelled. The Company recorded a $3.1 million expense in 2017 for the issuance of these shares and cancellation of the warrants. The expense is included in interest expense.\nIn May 2017, the Company issued to its senior lenders warrants to purchase an aggregate 362,500 shares of the Company's common stock (\"2017 Warrants\"). The 2017 Warrants have a five-year term and an exercise price of $14.94 per share, subject to adjustment. The 2017 Warrants are valued using a lattice model that uses unobservable inputs such as volatility and future probability of issuing new shares. The fair value of the 2017 Warrants are remeasured each reporting period, and the change in warrant value is recorded as an adjustment to the derivative liability with unrealized gains or losses reflect in interest expense.\n(d) New Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\".\n(e) Off Balance Sheet Arrangements\nThe Company does not have any off balance sheet arrangements at this time.\n(f) Certain Known Contractual Obligations\nTable 28: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Payments Due by Period\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Contractual Obligations\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Less than 1 year\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1-3 years\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 4-5 years\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> After 5 years\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Long-term debt and lease obligations\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 147,440\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,427\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 69,578\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 62,715\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 13,720\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest payable\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 105,871\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1,315\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 14,360\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 14,786\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 75,410\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating leases\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1,467\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 254,778\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,242\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 84,605\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 77,801\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 89,130\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n* The above table does not reflect unrecognized tax benefits of $2.8 million, the timing of which is uncertain.

Forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of words such as \"intends\", \"anticipates\", \"believes\", \"estimates\", \"projects\", \"forecasts\", \"expects\", \"plans\" and \"proposes\". Although we believe that the expectations reflected in these forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, there are a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements. These include, among others, our ability to maximize value from our land and water resources and our ability to obtain new financings as needed to meet our ongoing working capital needs. See additional discussion under the heading \"Risk Factors\" above.\nOverview\nWe are a land and water resource development company with 45,000 acres of land in three areas of eastern San Bernardino County, California. Virtually all of this land is underlain by high-quality, naturally recharging groundwater resources, and is situated in proximity to the Colorado River and the Colorado River Aqueduct (\"CRA\"), California's primary mode of water transportation for imports from the Colorado River into the State. Our properties are suitable for various uses, including large-scale agricultural development, groundwater storage and water supply projects. Our main objective is to realize the highest and best use of these land and water resources in an environmentally responsible way.\nWe believe that the long-term highest and best use of our land and water assets will be realized through the development of a combination of water supply and storage projects at our properties. Therefore, we have primarily focused on the development of the Cadiz Valley Water Conservation, Recovery and Storage Project (\"Water Project\" or \"Project\"), which will capture and conserve millions of acre-feet2 of native groundwater currently being lost to evaporation from the aquifer system beneath our 34,500-acre property in the Cadiz and Fenner valleys of eastern San Bernardino County (the \"Cadiz/Fenner Property\"), and deliver it to water providers throughout Southern California (see \"Water Resource Development\"). A second phase of the Water Project would offer storage of up to one million acre-feet of imported water in the aquifer system. We believe that the ultimate implementation of this Water Project will provide a significant source of future cash flow.\n2 One acre-foot is equal to approximately 326,000 gallons or the volume of water that will cover an area of one acre to a depth of one-foot. An acre-foot is generally considered to be enough water to meet the annual water needs of one average California household.\nThe primary factor driving the value of such projects is ongoing pressure on California's traditional water supplies and the resulting demand for new, reliable supply solutions that can meet both immediate and long-term water needs. Available supply is constrained by regulatory restrictions on each of the State's three main water sources: the CRA, the State Water Project, which provides water supplies from Northern California to the central and southern parts of the state, and the Los Angeles Aqueduct, which delivers water from the eastern Sierra Nevada mountains to Los Angeles. Southern California's water providers rely on imports from these systems for a majority of their water supplies, but deliveries from all three into the region have been below capacity over the last several years, even in wet years.\nFurther, the availability of supplies in California differs greatly from year to year due to natural hydrological variability. Over the last decade, California struggled through an historic drought featuring record-low winter precipitation. Then, following a series of strong storms that delivered record amounts of rain and snow during the 2016-2017 winter, state officials declared an end to the drought. Yet, the 2017-2018 winter has delivered few precipitation events and, through February 2018, 82% of the State is again abnormally dry according to the US Drought Monitor. The rapid swings between wet and dry years challenges California's traditional supply system and supports the need for reliable storage and local supply.\nSouthern California water providers are presently pursuing investments in storage, supply and infrastructure to meet long-term demand given the variety of challenges and limitations faced by the State's traditional infrastructure. The Cadiz Water Project is a local supply option in Southern California that could help address the region's water supply challenges by providing new reliable supply and local groundwater storage opportunities (see \"Water Resource Development\" below) in both dry and wet years. Following a multi-year California Environmental Quality Act (\"CEQA\") review and permitting process, the Water Project received permits that allow the capture and conservation of 2.5 million acre-feet of groundwater over 50 years in accordance with the terms of a groundwater management plan approved by San Bernardino County, the public agency responsible for groundwater use at the project area.\nOur current working capital requirements relate largely to the final development activities associated with the Water Project and those activities consistent with the Water Project related to further development of our land and agricultural assets. While we continue to believe that the ultimate implementation of the Water Project will provide the primary source of our future cash flow, we also believe there is significant additional value in our underlying agricultural assets.\nDemand for agricultural land with water rights is at an all-time high; therefore, in addition to our Water Project proposal, we are engaged in agricultural joint ventures at the Cadiz/Fenner Property that put some of the groundwater currently being lost to evaporation from the underlying aquifer system to immediate beneficial use. We have farmed portions of the Cadiz/Fenner Property since the late 1980s relying on groundwater from the aquifer system for irrigation and the site is well suited for various permanent and seasonal crops. Presently, the property has 2,100 acres leased for cultivation of a variety of crops, including citrus, dried-on-the-vine raisins and seasonal vegetables.\nWe also continue to explore additional uses of our land and water resource assets, including the marketing of our approved desert tortoise land conservation bank, which is located on our properties outside the Water Project area, and other long-term legacy uses of our properties, such as habitat conservation and cultural development.\nWater Resource Development\nThe Water Project is designed to capture and conserve billions of gallons of renewable native groundwater currently being lost to evaporation from the aquifer system underlying our Cadiz/Fenner Property, and provide a new reliable water supply for approximately 400,000 people in Southern California. In this first phase, Phase 1, the total quantity of groundwater to be recovered and conveyed to Water Project participants will not exceed a long-term annual average of 50,000 acre-feet per year for 50 years. The Water Project also offers participants in Phase 1 the ability to carry-over their annual supply and store it in the groundwater basin from year to year. A second phase of the Water Project, Phase II, will offer up to one million acre-feet of storage capacity that can be used to hold water supplies imported to the project area.\nWater Project facilities required for Phase I primarily include, among other things:\n \u00b7 High-yield wells designed to efficiently recover available native groundwater from beneath the Water Project area; \n \u00b7 A water conveyance pipeline to deliver water from the well-field to the Colorado River Aqueduct (\"CRA\") for further delivery to Project participants; and \n \u00b7 An energy source to provide power to the well-field, pipeline and pumping facilities. \nIf an imported water storage component of the Project is ultimately implemented in Phase II, the following additional facilities would be required, among other things:\n \u00b7 Facilities to pump water through the conveyance pipeline from the CRA to the Water Project well-field and/or through the Company's pipeline from Cadiz to Barstow, CA; and \n \u00b7 Spreading basins, which are shallow settling ponds that will be configured to efficiently percolate water from the ground surface down to the water table using subsurface storage capacity for the storage of water. \nPhase I\nPhase I has been fully reviewed and permitted in accordance with the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA). In May 2016, all permits and approvals were sustained in the California Court of Appeal and are no longer subject to further litigation. As a result, the Project presently is permitted to provide an average of 50,000 acre-feet of water for 50 years to meet municipal and industrial (M&I) water needs in Southern California.\nIn October 2017, the US Bureau of Land Management (\"BLM\") provided a letter finding that the Project's proposed use of a portion of the Arizona & California Railroad Company (\"ARZC\") right-of-way from Cadiz to Freda, California to construct and operate the Water Project's water conveyance pipeline and related railroad improvements from Cadiz to the CRA is within the scope of the original right of way grant and not subject to additional permitting or review. The buried pipeline would be constructed parallel to the railroad tracks and be used to convey water between our Cadiz Valley property and the CRA.\nConstruction of Phase I Water Project facilities is expected to cost approximately $250 million and will require capital financing that we expect will be secured by definitive Purchase and Sale Agreements with Project participants and the new facility assets. On May 25, 2017, the Company closed a strategic transaction with funds affiliated with Apollo Global Management, LLC (\"Apollo\"), a leading global alternative investment manager with approximately $197 billion of assets under management, to initiate financial arrangements for the construction of Phase I. In furtherance of the strategic transaction, funds managed by affiliates of Apollo and the Company executed a conditional commitment of up to $240 million for Phase I construction finance expenditures. The conditional commitment is intended to provide the additional resources necessary to complete the construction of Phase I of the Water Project. However, Cadiz is not obligated to accept such financing from Apollo, and Apollo's commitment is conditional (see \"Liquidity and Capital Resources\", below). We expect to finalize construction financing after the final terms of contracts and conveyance are negotiated, as described below.\nIn addition to finalizing construction financing terms as described above, prior to construction, the Water Project must (1) finalize contracts with Project participating agencies, (2) secure transportation arrangements to deliver water into each participant's service area, and (3) complete final design, engineering and construction permitting. Below is a discussion of present activities to advance these objectives.\n(1) Contracts with Public Water Agencies or Private Water Utilities\nThe Company has executed Letters of Intent (\"LOIs\"), option agreements and purchase agreements, or contracts (collectively, \"Agreements\") with public water agencies and private water utilities in California during the Project's development. These participating agencies serve more than one million customers in cities throughout California's San Bernardino, Riverside, Los Angeles, Orange, Imperial and Ventura Counties. Twenty percent of Water Project supplies have been reserved for San Bernardino County-based agencies.\nSanta Margarita Water District (\"SMWD\"), Orange County's second largest water provider, was the first participant to convert its option agreement and adopt resolutions approving a Water Purchase and Sale Agreement for 5,000 acre-feet of water. The structure of the SMWD purchase agreement calls for an annually adjusted water supply payment, plus a pro rata portion of the capital recovery charge and operating and maintenance costs. The capital recovery charge is calculated by amortizing the total capital investment by the Company over a 30-year term.\nAgreements entered into prior to the beginning of the CEQA review process provide the right to acquire an annual supply of 5,000 acre-feet of water at $775 per acre-foot (2010 dollars, subject to adjustment), which is competitive with the incremental cost of new water. In addition, these agencies received options to acquire storage rights in the Water Project to allow for the management of their Water Project supplies in complement with their own water resources. Up to 150,000 acre-feet of carry-over storage is available for reservation by the agencies prior to construction commencement. Participants that elect to achieve year-to-year flexibility in their use of Project water by utilizing carry-over storage will reserve storage capacity for $1,500 per acre-foot prior to construction.\nLOIs that have been entered into since completion of the CEQA review process reserve supplies from the Water Project at $960 per acre-foot (2014 dollars, subject to adjustment). These LOIs also include the option to reserve carry-over storage capacity for $1,500 per acre-foot prior to construction.\nPresently, total reservations of supplies from the Water Project via these Agreements are in excess of Water Project capacity. Prior to construction of the Water Project, we expect to convert existing option agreements and LOIs to purchase agreements. We are working collaboratively with the participating water agencies to account for any oversubscription in the final definitive Purchase and Sale Agreements we enter into with these agencies and allow for inclusive participation across Southern California.\n(2) Conveyance Arrangements\nPrior to construction of the Water Project, and in coordination with final participation contracts described in (1) above, an agreement and terms for moving water supplies in the CRA must be negotiated with Metropolitan Water District of Southern California (\"Metropolitan\"), which owns and controls the CRA.\nWater supplies conserved by the Project would enter the CRA at the termination of the project's conveyance pipeline near Rice, CA. The CEQA process considered a variety of options to enter the CRA and assumed final entry into the CRA would be determined by MWD in consultation with the Project's participating agencies. Once arrangements are reached, the Metropolitan Board would take action as a responsible agency under CEQA regarding the terms and conditions of the Water Project's use of the CRA to transport water to its participating agencies.\nThere is no application yet before Metropolitan related to entry and transportation of Project supplies, but we expect such a formal application will be filed in 2018 as the Project's contractual arrangements with participants are finalized. Any agreement as to the terms and conditions of the Water Project's use of the CRA will be negotiated between and entered into by Metropolitan and the Project participating agencies, not the Company. Discussions with Metropolitan regarding conveyance of Project water in the CRA have been led by SMWD, the Water Project's CEQA lead agency.\nWater Project supplies entering the CRA will comply with Metropolitan's published engineering, design and water quality standards and will be subject to all applicable fees and charges routinely established by Metropolitan for the conveyance of water within its service territory. We believe there are multiple benefits that can be secured by MWD upon making space reasonably available for the Water Project supplies and having the flexibility of relying on the Water Project in both wet and dry years.\n(3) Final Design and Permitting\nAs a component of completing contract terms with participating agencies and related wheeling arrangements with Metropolitan, we must also finalize design of Project facilities and acquire relevant construction permits with state and local agencies. Together with SMWD we have engaged engineering and environmental consultants to complete design plans for the 43-mile pipeline, Project wellfield, any necessary water treatment facilities, and facilities required to connect to the Metropolitan system at and near the CRA. This work is ongoing and expected to proceed in coordination with the negotiation of contracts and wheeling arrangements.\nOnce facility design and layout near completion, we will need to obtain additional permits and approvals from state or local entities prior to construction. This may include but is not limited to confirmation of existing access rights, easements and rights-of-way, for areas that may be crossed by Project facilities in the Project area subject to final pipeline configuration.\nPhase II\nIn a second phase of the Water Project, we expect to make available up to one million acre-feet of capacity in the aquifer system for storage of surplus water conveyed to the Project area. Under the Imported Water Storage Component, or Phase II, water from the Colorado River or the State Water Project could be conveyed to spreading basins that would be constructed on our private property to percolate into the aquifer system and held in storage. When needed, previously stored water would be returned to Phase II participating agencies via the Project's 43-mile conveyance pipeline to the CRA, described above, or via an existing 96-mile pipeline that extends from our Cadiz property northwest to Barstow and Bakersfield, California (see \"Northern Pipeline\" below).\nPhase II has already been the subject of programmatic environmental review in accordance with CEQA, but still requires project-level environmental review and permitting once participating agencies are identified. Phase II may also require federal permits subject to the National Environmental Policy Act, or NEPA.\nNorthern Pipeline\nWe currently own a 96-mile existing idle natural gas pipeline that extends from the Cadiz/Fenner Property to Barstow, California and we intend to convert this pipeline to allow for the transportation of water. The Barstow area serves as a hub for water delivered from northern and central California to communities in Southern California's High Desert. In addition, we hold an option to purchase a further 124-mile segment of this pipeline from Barstow to Wheeler Ridge, California for $20 million. This option expires in December 2018. We do not currently have the cash resources on hand to exercise this option and have engaged an investment banker to pursue alternatives that will provide the resources to allow us to exercise this option. If we are unable to exercise this option, then our Northern Pipeline opportunities will be limited to the 96- mile segment we currently own.\nInitial feasibility studies indicated that, upon conversion, the 30-inch pipeline could transport between 18,000 and 30,000 acre-feet of water per year between the Water Project area and various points along the Central and Northern California water transportation network. As a result, this pipeline could create significant opportunities for our water resource development efforts.\nIf this pipeline were to become operational, then the Water Project would link two major water delivery systems in California, providing flexible opportunities for both supply and storage. The Northern Pipeline could deliver Phase I supplies, either directly or via exchange, to existing and potential customers of Phase I of the Project. Any use of the pipeline would be conducted in conformity with the Water Project's groundwater management plan and is subject to further CEQA evaluation and potentially federal environmental permitting.\nThe Northern Pipeline also represents new opportunities for the Company, independent of the Water Project, to offer water transportation to locations along the pipeline route that are not presently interconnected by existing water infrastructure. The entire 220-mile pipeline crosses California's major water infrastructure as well as urban and agricultural centers and can be utilized to transport water, independent of the Water Project, between users who presently lack direct interconnections along the pipeline route. We are presently engaged in discussions with parties that may be interested in such transportation.\nAgricultural Development\nWithin the Cadiz/Fenner Property, all of the existing 34,500 acres are currently zoned for agriculture. In 1993, we secured conditional use permits to develop agriculture on up to 9,600 acres of the property and withdraw groundwater from the underlying aquifer system for irrigation. We have since maintained various levels of crops on the Property as we developed the Water Project. In 2013, we entered into a lease agreement with a third party to develop up to 1,480 acres of lemons at the site, 640 acres of which have been planted to date.\nIn February 2016, we entered into a lease agreement with Fenner Valley Farms LLC (\"FVF\"), a subsidiary of Water Asset Management LLC, a related party, pursuant to which FVF leased, for a 99-year term, 2,100 acres at the Cadiz/Fenner property to be used to plant, grow and harvest agricultural crops (\"FVF Lease\"). As consideration for the lease, FVF paid the Company a one-time payment of $12,000,000 in February 2016. The acreage that was historically farmed by the Company and the acreage that is leased to a third party to develop lemons was included within the leased acreage. Following entry into this lease, we are no longer directly involved in the current agricultural operations at the site and all agricultural revenue is derived pursuant to the FVF Lease.\nAs part of the agricultural development to be conducted under the lease arrangements, the groundwater production capacity of the property's existing well-field is expected to be enhanced through infrastructure improvements that are complementary to the Water Project. While any additional well-field development for agricultural use would be financed by our agricultural partners as provided under our agricultural lease arrangements, we retained a call feature that allows us, at any time in the initial 20 years, to acquire the well-field and integrate any new agricultural well-field infrastructure developed into the Water Project's facilities.\nAdditional Eastern Mojave Properties\nWe also own approximately 11,000 acres outside of the Cadiz/Fenner Valley area in two locations within the Mojave Desert in eastern San Bernardino County.\nOur primary landholding outside of the Cadiz area is approximately 9,000 acres in the Piute Valley. This landholding is located approximately 15 miles from the resort community of Laughlin, Nevada, and about 12 miles from the Colorado River town of Needles, California. Extensive hydrological studies, including the drilling and testing of a full-scale production well, have demonstrated that this landholding is underlain by high-quality groundwater. The aquifer system underlying this property is naturally recharged by precipitation (both rain and snow) within a watershed of approximately 975 square miles and could be suitable for a water supply project, agricultural development or solar energy production. These properties are located in or adjacent to areas designated by the federal government as National Monument, Critical Desert Tortoise Habitat and/or Desert Wilderness Areas and are suitable candidates for preservation and conservation (see \"Land Conservation Bank\" below).\nAdditionally, we own acreage located near Danby Dry Lake in Ward Valley, approximately 30 miles southeast of our Cadiz/Fenner Valley properties. The Danby Dry Lake property is located approximately 10 miles north of the CRA. Initial hydrological studies indicate that the area has excellent potential for a water supply project. Certain of the properties in this area may also be suitable for agricultural development and/or preservation and conservation.\nLand Conservation Bank\nApproximately 7,500 acres of our properties outside of the Cadiz/Fenner Valley area in the Piute Valley are located within terrain designated by the federal government as Critical Desert Tortoise Habitat and/or Desert Wilderness Areas and offer limited development opportunities. In February 2015, the California Department of Fish and Wildlife approved our establishment of the Fenner Valley Desert Tortoise Conservation Bank (\"Fenner Bank\"), a land conservation bank that makes available these properties for mitigation of impacts to tortoise and other sensitive species that would be caused by development across the Southern California desert. Under its enabling documents, the Fenner Bank offers credits that can be acquired by entities that must mitigate or offset impacts linked to planned development. For example, this bank can service the mitigation requirements of renewable energy, military, residential and commercial development projects being considered throughout the desert. Credits sold by the Fenner Bank will fund our permanent preservation of the land as well as research by outside entities, including San Diego Zoo Global, into desert tortoise health and species protection.\nOther Opportunities\nOther opportunities in the water and agricultural or related infrastructure business complementary to our current objectives could provide new opportunities for our Company.\nOver the longer-term, we believe the population of Southern California, Nevada and Arizona will continue to grow, and that, in time, the economics of commercial and residential development at our properties may become attractive.\nWe remain committed to the sustainable use of our land and water assets, and will continue to explore all opportunities for environmentally responsible development of these assets. We cannot estimate which of these opportunities will ultimately be utilized.\nResults of Operations\n (a) Year Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2016 \nWe have not received significant revenues from our water resource and real estate development activities to date. Our revenues have been limited to rental income from the FVF Lease (see \"Agricultural Development\", above). As a result, we have historically incurred a net loss from operations. We had revenues of $437 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2017, and $412 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2016. The net loss totaled $33.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared with a net loss of $26.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The higher loss in 2017 was primarily related to a $3.5 million loss on extinguishment of debt and $2.6 million in unrealized losses recorded for warrant liabilities. The higher 2017 loss was also related to an increase in stock compensation resulting from the vesting of milestone shares earned by employees, an increase in cash bonus awards to employees, and an increase in general and administrative expense due to pre-construction engineering activities in connection with the Water Project.\nOur primary expenses are our ongoing overhead costs associated with the development of the Water Project (i.e., general and administrative expense) and our interest expense. We will continue to incur non-cash expense in connection with our management and director equity incentive compensation plans.\nRevenues. Revenue totaled $437 thousand during the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $412 thousand during the year ended December 31, 2016. The 2017 revenue is primarily related to rental income from the FVF Lease (see \"Agricultural Development\", above).\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses. General and administrative expenses during the year ended December 31, 2017, totaled $12.8 million compared with $9.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Non-cash compensation costs related to stock and option awards are included in general and administrative expenses.\nGeneral and administrative expenses, exclusive of stock-based compensation costs, totaled $10.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared with $8.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in general and administrative expense in 2017 was primarily due to pre-construction engineering activities in connection with the Water Project and an increase in cash bonus awards to employees.\nCompensation costs from stock and option awards for the year ended December 31, 2017, totaled $2.3 million compared with $1.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The higher 2017 expense primarily reflects the vesting of milestone shares earned by employees and consultants of the Company.\nDepreciation. Depreciation expense totaled $274 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2017, and $292 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nInterest Expense, net. Net interest expense totaled $17.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $14.9 million during 2016. The following table summarizes the components of net interest expense for the two periods (in thousands):\n\nThe interest on outstanding debt increased from $9.7 million to $11.3 million due to compounded interest on a larger credit facility associated with our May 2017 debt refinancing. Additionally, during the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company recorded net unrealized losses on warrants of $2.6 million, which included $3.1 million in unrealized losses related to the issuance of shares to former lenders (see Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Common Stock\") and $508 thousand in unrealized gains related to our May 2017 debt refinancing. (See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Long-Term Debt\").\nDebt Refinancings. In May 2017, we entered into a new $60 million credit agreement (\"Credit Agreement\") with funds affiliated with Apollo Global Management, LLC (\"Apollo\") that replaced and refinanced our then existing $45 million senior secured mortgage debt (\"Prior Senior Secured Debt\") and provided $15 million of new senior debt to fund immediate construction related expenditures (\"New Senior Secured Debt\"). The New Senior Secured Debt will mature on the earliest of (a) the four year anniversary of the Closing Date, and (b) the \"Springing Maturity Date\", which is defined as the date which is 91 days prior to the maturity date of the 7.00% Convertible Senior Notes of Cadiz due 2020 (the \"New Convertible Notes\") that were issued in December 2015 and April 2016 pursuant to the New Convertible Notes Indenture as defined in the Credit Agreement, if on the 91st day preceding the maturity date of the New Convertible Notes, the 5-Day VWAP, as defined in the Credit Agreement, is less than 120% of the then applicable Conversion Rate, as defined in the New Convertible Notes Indenture, and at least $10,000,000 in original principal amount of the New Convertible Notes is outstanding ((a) or (b), as applicable, the \"Maturity Date\"). Interest on the New Senior Secured Debt is due quarterly on each March 31, June 30, September 30 and December 31 (each an \"Interest Date\") beginning on June 30, 2017. Interest on the New Senior Secured Debt will (i) accrete to the outstanding principal amount at a rate per annum equal to 6% (the \"PIK Rate\") compounded quarterly on each Interest Date and (ii) accrue on the outstanding principal amount at a rate per annum equal to 2% (the \"Cash Rate\"). We, in our discretion, may make any quarterly interest payment in cash on the applicable Interest Date at the PIK Rate, in lieu of accretion of such interest to the principal amount at the PIK Rate. The proceeds from the Credit Agreement were used to repay the Prior Senior Secured Debt resulting in a loss on extinguishment of $3.5 million which consisted of the write-off of unamortized debt discount, unamortized debt issuance costs and fees paid to the former lenders. In addition, we incurred $1.5 million in legal and finders' fees which was recorded as additional debt discount and is being amortized through December 2019, which is the Springing Maturity Date as discussed above.\nIn conjunction with the closing of the New Senior Secured Debt, we issued to Apollo a warrant to purchase an aggregate of 362,500 shares of our common stock (\"2017 Warrant\"). The Company recorded a debt discount at the time of the closing of the New Senior Secured Debt in the amount of $2.9 million which was the fair value of the 2017 Warrant issued. The debt discount is being amortized through December 2019, which is the Springing Maturity Date as discussed above. The fair value of the 2017 Warrant will be remeasured each reporting period, and the change in warrant value will be recorded as interest expense and an adjustment to the derivative liability. The warrant has a five-year term and an exercise price of $14.94 per share, subject to adjustment.\n (b) Year Ended December 31, 2016 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2015 \nWe had revenues of $412 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2016, and $304 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2015. The net loss totaled $26.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared with a net loss of $24.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The higher loss in 2016 was primarily related to a $2.25 million loss on extinguishment of debt. The higher 2016 loss was also related to higher interest expense on additional convertible debt issued and higher amortization expense, offset by a decrease in litigation costs related to the Water Project due to the timing of the appellate litigation.\nRevenues. Revenue totaled $412 thousand during the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to $304 thousand during the year ended December 31, 2015. The 2016 revenue is primarily related to rental income from the FVF Lease (see \"Agricultural Development\", above).\nCost of Sales. Cost of sales were zero for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared with $334 thousand during the year ended December 31, 2015.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses. General and administrative expenses during the year ended December 31, 2016, totaled $9.3 million compared with $13.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. Non-cash compensation costs related to stock and option awards are included in general and administrative expenses.\nGeneral and administrative expenses, exclusive of stock-based compensation costs, totaled $8.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2016, compared with $12.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease in general and administrative expense in 2016 was primarily due to lower litigation costs related to the Water Project due to the timing of the appellate litigation (see Item 1. - \"Business, (a) General Development of Business\", above.)\nCompensation costs from stock and option awards for the year ended December 31, 2016, totaled $1.3 million compared with $1.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The higher 2016 expense was primarily due to higher stock-based non-cash compensation costs related to shares awarded to the Brownstein law firm for certain legal and advisory services to the Company.\nDepreciation. Depreciation expense totaled $292 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2016, and $270 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nInterest Expense, net. Net interest expense totaled $14.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to $10.1 million during 2015. The following table summarizes the components of net interest expense for the two periods (in thousands):\n\nThe interest on outstanding debt increased from $8.2 million to $9.7 million due to compounded interest on the debt facilities resulting in a higher principal balance. Amortization of debt discount increased from $1.6 million to $5.0 million primarily due to the acceleration of unamortized debt discount related to the conversion of approximately $2.8 million in original principal amount of the 2020 Notes that were issued in April 2016.\nPrior Debt Refinancings. In April 2016, we entered into a note purchase agreement with new and existing investors (the \"Investors\"). Pursuant to the agreement, we issued approximately $10.0 million of our 7.00% Convertible Senior Notes due 2020 (\"2020 Notes) in aggregate principal and accrued interest. The proceeds from the issuance of the 2020 Notes (such 2020 Notes, the \"New Notes\"), are used for general working capital purposes. The 2020 Notes accrue interest at 7.00% per year, with no principal or interest payments due prior to maturity on March 5, 2020. The 2020 Notes, including original principal and accrued interest, are convertible at any time into the Company's common stock at a price of $6.75 per share, pursuant to the terms of the Indenture dated as of December 10, 2015, by and between the Company and US Bank National Association (the \"Indenture\"), under which the New Notes were issued. As a result of this transaction, we recorded a debt discount in the amount of $2.0 million which is the difference between the proceeds from this transaction and the principal and accrued interest of New Notes on the day of the issuance. In addition, based on the conversion rate of $6.75 per share, the fair value of the shares receivable on conversion exceed the $8.0 million in net proceeds; therefore, a beneficial conversion feature was recorded in the amount of $1.48 million. This amount was recorded as additional debt discount with a corresponding amount recorded as additional paid-in capital. Such debt discount is accreted to the redemption value of the instrument over the remaining term of the loan. Furthermore, we incurred $400 thousand in placement agent fees which was recorded as additional debt discount and is being amortized over the remaining term of the loan.\nIn November 2016, we entered into an agreement with our then senior lenders which (i) extended the maturity date of our secured senior debt from September 2017 to September 2019 and (ii) permits us to satisfy the cash interest payment obligations through the issuance of shares of the Company's common stock. In connection with the agreement, we issued to our then senior lenders an aggregate of 357,500 shares of the Company's common stock and warrants to purchase an aggregate of 357,500 shares of its common stock (\"2016 Warrants\"). The Company recorded a debt discount in the amount of $3.4 million which was the fair value of the 357,500 shares issued. Such debt discount was accreted over the remaining term of the loan. The 2016 Warrants had a five- year term and an exercise price of $0.01 per share. In October 2017, the Company agreed to issue an aggregate of 264,096 shares of the Company's common stock with an aggregate value of $3.3 million in connection with a Payoff Agreement the Company entered into with prior lenders on May 24, 2017. Effective upon the delivery of the 264,096 shares, the 2016 Warrants were deemed cancelled. The Company recorded a $3.1 million expense in 2017 for the issuance of these shares and cancellation of the warrants. The expense is included in interest expense. Additionally, we filed a prospectus supplement to our S-3 registration statement, number 333-214318, indicating that we were offering 800,000 shares of our common stock to satisfy the cash interest payment obligations under the Credit Agreement in an aggregate amount equal to $5,639,916. Only 78,942 shares of the 800,000 shares offered were issued as payment of our interest obligations with an aggregate value of $866,345, prior to May 26, 2017, when we repaid in full, in cash, all amounts due under the Credit Agreement. Therefore, because the additional 721,058 (\"Unissued Shares\") included in the prospectus supplement will not be issued to pay the interest due under the Credit Agreement, the offering of the Unissued Shares with an aggregate value of $4,773,571 has been terminated.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n(a) Current Financing Arrangements\nAs we have not received significant revenues from our development activities to date, we have been required to obtain financing to bridge the gap between the time water resource and other development expenses are incurred and the time that revenue will commence. Historically, we have addressed these needs primarily through secured debt financing arrangements, private equity placements and the exercise of outstanding stock options and warrants. We have also worked with our secured lenders to structure our debt in a way which allows us to continue development of the Water Project and minimize the dilution of the ownership interests of common stockholders.\nOn May 25, 2017, we entered into a new $60 million credit agreement with funds affiliated with Apollo Global Management, LLC (\"Apollo\") that replaced and refinanced our then existing $45 million senior secured mortgage debt (\"Prior Senior Secured Debt\") and provided $15 million of new senior debt to fund immediate construction related expenditures (\"New Senior Secured Debt\"). Additionally, funds affiliated with Apollo also executed a conditional commitment letter to fund up to $240 million in construction finance expenditures for the Cadiz Water Project, subject to the satisfaction of conditions precedent. It is intended to provide the additional resources necessary to complete the construction of Phase I of the Water Project. Apollo's commitment for up to $240 million is conditional and Cadiz is not obligated to accept such financing from Apollo.\nThe New Senior Secured Debt and the convertible notes contain representations, warranties and covenants that are typical for agreements of this type, including restrictions that would limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness, incur liens, pay dividends or make restricted payments, dispose of assets, make investments and merge or consolidate with another person. However, while there are affirmative covenants, there are no financial maintenance covenants and no restrictions on our ability to issue additional common stock to fund future working capital needs. The debt covenants associated with the New Senior Secured Debt were negotiated by the parties with a view towards our operating and financial condition as it existed at the time the agreements were executed. At December 31, 2017, we were in compliance with our debt covenants.\nLimitations on our liquidity and ability to raise capital may adversely affect us. Sufficient liquidity is critical to meet our resource development activities. We currently expect our cash on hand to be sufficient to meet our working capital needs for a period beyond one year from this annual report issuance date. To the extent additional capital is required, we may increase liquidity through a variety of means, including equity or debt placements, through the lease, sale or other disposition of assets or reductions in operating costs. Equity placements, if made, would be undertaken only to the extent necessary, so as to minimize the dilutive effect of any such placements upon our existing stockholders.\nAs we continue to actively pursue our business strategy, additional financing will continue to be required. See \"Outlook\" below. The covenants in the term debt do not prohibit our use of additional equity financing and allow us to retain 100% of the proceeds of any equity financing. We do not expect the loan covenants to materially limit our ability to finance our water development activities.\nAt December 31, 2017, we had no outstanding credit facilities other than the New Senior Secured Debt and the convertible notes.\nCash Used for Operating Activities. Cash used for operating activities totaled $10.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, $9.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, and $12.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The cash was primarily used to fund general and administrative expenses related to our water development efforts and litigation costs.\nCash Used For Investing Activities. Cash used for investing activities in the year ended December 31, 2017, was $1.0 million, compared with zero for the year ended December 31, 2016, and $906 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2015. The 2017 costs consisted of engineering and design related to the development of the Water Project, and the 2015 period primarily included additional investments in well-field and environmental work related to progressing the Water Project.\nCash Provided by (Used for) Financing Activities. Cash provided by financing activities totaled $12.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared with cash provided by financing activities of $19.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, and cash used for financing activities of $42 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2015. The 2017 results include $12.3 million of net proceeds from the issuance of long term debt. The 2016 results include proceeds of approximately $12.0 million related to the FVF Lease (see \"Agricultural Development\", above), $8.0 million in net proceeds related to convertible note financing and approximately $10.5 million in proceeds from the issuance of shares under a shelf takedown offering, offset by $960 thousand in recorded debt issuance costs and a principal payment of approximately $10.6 million on the Prior Senior Secured Debt.\n(b) Outlook\nShort-Term Outlook. Our cash resources of $13.0 million as of December 31, 2017 provide us with sufficient funds to meet our working capital needs through April 2019. As of March 5, 2018, $1.35 million of short-term debt was removed when certain of our lenders elected to convert all principal and accrued interest under the 2018 Convertible Notes. As we require additional working capital to fund operations, we expect to continue our historical practice of structuring our financing arrangements to match the anticipated needs of our development activities. See \"Long-Term Outlook\" below. No assurances can be given, however, as to the availability or terms of any new financing. Additionally, our option to acquire an additional 124-mile extension of our Northern Pipeline will require a $20 million payment by December 2018. We do not currently have the cash resources on hand to exercise this option and have engaged an investment banker to pursue alternatives that will provide the resources to allow us to exercise this option. If we are unable to exercise this option, then our Northern Pipeline opportunities will be limited to the 96-mile segment we currently own.\nLong-Term Outlook. In the longer term, we will need to raise additional capital to finance working capital needs, capital expenditures and any payments due under our Senior Secured Debt or our convertible notes at maturity (see \"Current Financing Arrangements\" above). Our future working capital needs will depend upon the specific measures we pursue in the entitlement and development of our water resources and other developments. Future capital expenditures will depend primarily on the progress of the Water Project.\nWe are evaluating the amount of cash needed, and the manner in which such cash will be raised, on an ongoing basis. We may meet any future cash requirements through a variety of means, including construction financing to be provided by the Apollo conditional commitment letter described above (see \"Debt Refinancings\" above), equity and debt placements, or through the sale or other disposition of assets. Equity placements would be undertaken only to the extent necessary, so as to minimize the dilution effect of any such placements upon our existing stockholders. Limitations on our liquidity and ability to raise capital may adversely affect us. Sufficient liquidity is critical to meet our resource development activities.\n(c) Critical Accounting Policies\nAs discussed in Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements, the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and related footnotes. In preparing these financial statements, management has made its best estimates and judgments of certain amounts included in the financial statements based on all relevant information available at the time and giving due consideration to materiality. We do not believe there is a great likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported related to the accounting policies described below. However, application of these policies involves the exercise of judgment and use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and, as a result, actual results could differ from these estimates. Management has concluded that the following critical accounting policies described below affect the most significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements.\n(1) Intangible and Other Long-Lived Assets. Property, plant and equipment, intangible and certain other long-lived assets are depreciated or amortized over their useful lives. Useful lives are based on management's estimates of the period over which the assets will generate revenue.\n(2) Goodwill. As a result of a merger in May 1988 between two companies, which eventually became known as Cadiz Inc., goodwill in the amount of $7,006,000 was recorded. Approximately $3,193,000 of this amount was amortized until the adoption of Accounting Standards Codification 350, \"Intangibles - Goodwill and Other\" on January 1, 2002.\n(3) Valuation of Goodwill and Long-Lived Assets. The Company assesses long-lived assets, excluding goodwill, for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable through the estimated undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the assets. If it is determined that the carrying value of long-lived assets may not be recoverable, the impairment is measured by using the projected discounted cash-flow method.\nThe Company uses a one-step impairment test to identify potential goodwill impairment and measure the amount of a goodwill impairment loss to be recognized (if any) for the Company. This quantitative assessment is performed at least annually and compares a reporting unit's fair value to its carrying amount to determine if there is a potential impairment. An impairment loss will be recognized for the amount by which the reporting unit's carrying amount exceeds its fair value, not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill in that reporting unit.\n(4) Deferred Tax Assets and Valuation Allowances. To date, the Company has not generated significant revenue from its water development programs, and it has a history of net operating losses. As such, the Company has generated significant deferred tax assets, including large net operating loss carryforwards for federal and state income taxes for which it has recorded a full valuation allowance. Management is currently working on water storage, water supply, and agricultural projects, including the Water Project, that are designed to generate future taxable income, although there can be no guarantee that this will occur. If taxable income is generated in future years, some portion or all of the valuation allowance will be reversed, and an increase in net income would consequently be reported.\n(5) Stock-Based Compensation. The Company applies the Black-Scholes valuation model in determining the fair value of options granted to employees and consultants. For employees, the fair value is then charged to expense on the straight-line basis over the requisite service period. For consultants, the fair value is remeasured at each reporting period and recorded as a liability until the award is settled.\nAccounting Standards Codification Topic 718, \"Compensation - Stock Compensation\" also requires the Company to estimate forfeitures in calculating the expense related to stock-based compensation as opposed to only recognizing forfeitures and the corresponding reduction in expense as they occur. As of December 31, 2017, all options outstanding are fully vested; therefore, there is no potential impact of forfeitures.\n(6) Valuation of Warrants. In November 2016, the Company issued to its then senior lenders warrants to purchase an aggregate of 357,500 shares of the Company's common stock (\"2016 Warrants\"). The 2016 Warrants had a five-year term and an exercise price of $.01 per share. The fair value of these warrants was determined using the Black-Scholes pricing model. The fair value of the 2016 Warrants was remeasured each reporting period, and the change in warrant value was recorded as an adjustment to the derivative liability with unrealized gains or losses reflected in interest expense. In October 2017, the Company agreed to issue an aggregate of 264,096 shares of the Company's common stock with an aggregate value of $3.3 million in connection with a Payoff Agreement the Company entered into with prior lenders on May 24, 2017. Effective upon the delivery of the 264,096 shares, the 2016 Warrants were deemed cancelled. The Company recorded a $3.1 million expense in 2017 for the issuance of these shares and cancellation of the warrants. The expense is included in interest expense.\nIn May 2017, the Company issued to its senior lenders warrants to purchase an aggregate 362,500 shares of the Company's common stock (\"2017 Warrants\"). The 2017 Warrants have a five-year term and an exercise price of $14.94 per share, subject to adjustment. The 2017 Warrants are valued using a lattice model that uses unobservable inputs such as volatility and future probability of issuing new shares. The fair value of the 2017 Warrants are remeasured each reporting period, and the change in warrant value is recorded as an adjustment to the derivative liability with unrealized gains or losses reflect in interest expense.\n(d) New Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\".\n(e) Off Balance Sheet Arrangements\nThe Company does not have any off balance sheet arrangements at this time.\n(f) Certain Known Contractual Obligations\n\nLong-term debt included in the table above primarily reflects the Senior Secured Term Loan and the convertible notes, which is described above in Item 7, \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation; Liquidity and Capital Resources\". Operating leases include the lease of the Company's executive offices, as described in Item 2, \"Properties\", and the right-of-way lease with the Arizona & California Railroad Company, as described in Item 1, \"Business\".", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nIn connection with the \"safe harbor\" provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, the following discussion contains trend analysis and other forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of words such as \"intends\", \"anticipates\", \"believes\", \"estimates\", \"projects\", \"forecasts\", \"expects\", \"plans\" and \"proposes\". Although we believe that the expectations reflected in these forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, there are a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward-looking statements. These include, among others, our ability to maximize value from our land and water resources and our ability to obtain new financings as needed to meet our ongoing working capital needs. See additional discussion under the heading \"Risk Factors\" above.\nOverview\nWe are a land and water resource development company with 45,000 acres of land in three areas of eastern San Bernardino County, California. Virtually all of this land is underlain by high-quality, naturally recharging groundwater resources, and is situated in proximity to the Colorado River and the Colorado River Aqueduct (\"CRA\"), California's primary mode of water transportation for imports from the Colorado River into the State. Our properties are suitable for various uses, including large-scale agricultural development, groundwater storage and water supply projects. Our main objective is to realize the highest and best use of these land and water resources in an environmentally responsible way.\nWe believe that the long-term highest and best use of our land and water assets will be realized through the development of a combination of water supply and storage projects at our properties. Therefore, we have primarily focused on the development of the Cadiz Valley Water Conservation, Recovery and Storage Project (\"Water Project\" or \"Project\"), which will capture and conserve millions of acre-feet2 of native groundwater currently being lost to evaporation from the aquifer system beneath our 34,500-acre property in the Cadiz and Fenner valleys of eastern San Bernardino County (the \"Cadiz/Fenner Property\"), and deliver it to water providers throughout Southern California (see \"Water Resource Development\"). A second phase of the Water Project would offer storage of up to one million acre-feet of imported water in the aquifer system. We believe that the ultimate implementation of this Water Project will provide a significant source of future cash flow.\n2 One acre-foot is equal to approximately 326,000 gallons or the volume of water that will cover an area of one acre to a depth of one-foot. An acre-foot is generally considered to be enough water to meet the annual water needs of one average California household.\nThe primary factor driving the value of such projects is ongoing pressure on California's traditional water supplies and the resulting demand for new, reliable supply solutions that can meet both immediate and long-term water needs. Available supply is constrained by regulatory restrictions on each of the State's three main water sources: the CRA, the State Water Project, which provides water supplies from Northern California to the central and southern parts of the state, and the Los Angeles Aqueduct, which delivers water from the eastern Sierra Nevada mountains to Los Angeles. Southern California's water providers rely on imports from these systems for a majority of their water supplies, but deliveries from all three into the region have been below capacity over the last several years, even in wet years.\nFurther, the availability of supplies in California differs greatly from year to year due to natural hydrological variability. Over the last decade, California struggled through an historic drought featuring record-low winter precipitation. Then, following a series of strong storms that delivered record amounts of rain and snow during the 2016-2017 winter, state officials declared an end to the drought. Yet, the 2017-2018 winter has delivered few precipitation events and, through February 2018, 82% of the State is again abnormally dry according to the US Drought Monitor. The rapid swings between wet and dry years challenges California's traditional supply system and supports the need for reliable storage and local supply.\nSouthern California water providers are presently pursuing investments in storage, supply and infrastructure to meet long-term demand given the variety of challenges and limitations faced by the State's traditional infrastructure. The Cadiz Water Project is a local supply option in Southern California that could help address the region's water supply challenges by providing new reliable supply and local groundwater storage opportunities (see \"Water Resource Development\" below) in both dry and wet years. Following a multi-year California Environmental Quality Act (\"CEQA\") review and permitting process, the Water Project received permits that allow the capture and conservation of 2.5 million acre-feet of groundwater over 50 years in accordance with the terms of a groundwater management plan approved by San Bernardino County, the public agency responsible for groundwater use at the project area.\nOur current working capital requirements relate largely to the final development activities associated with the Water Project and those activities consistent with the Water Project related to further development of our land and agricultural assets. While we continue to believe that the ultimate implementation of the Water Project will provide the primary source of our future cash flow, we also believe there is significant additional value in our underlying agricultural assets.\nDemand for agricultural land with water rights is at an all-time high; therefore, in addition to our Water Project proposal, we are engaged in agricultural joint ventures at the Cadiz/Fenner Property that put some of the groundwater currently being lost to evaporation from the underlying aquifer system to immediate beneficial use. We have farmed portions of the Cadiz/Fenner Property since the late 1980s relying on groundwater from the aquifer system for irrigation and the site is well suited for various permanent and seasonal crops. Presently, the property has 2,100 acres leased for cultivation of a variety of crops, including citrus, dried-on-the-vine raisins and seasonal vegetables.\nWe also continue to explore additional uses of our land and water resource assets, including the marketing of our approved desert tortoise land conservation bank, which is located on our properties outside the Water Project area, and other long-term legacy uses of our properties, such as habitat conservation and cultural development.\nWater Resource Development\nThe Water Project is designed to capture and conserve billions of gallons of renewable native groundwater currently being lost to evaporation from the aquifer system underlying our Cadiz/Fenner Property, and provide a new reliable water supply for approximately 400,000 people in Southern California. In this first phase, Phase 1, the total quantity of groundwater to be recovered and conveyed to Water Project participants will not exceed a long-term annual average of 50,000 acre-feet per year for 50 years. The Water Project also offers participants in Phase 1 the ability to carry-over their annual supply and store it in the groundwater basin from year to year. A second phase of the Water Project, Phase II, will offer up to one million acre-feet of storage capacity that can be used to hold water supplies imported to the project area.\nWater Project facilities required for Phase I primarily include, among other things:\n \u00b7 High-yield wells designed to efficiently recover available native groundwater from beneath the Water Project area; \n \u00b7 A water conveyance pipeline to deliver water from the well-field to the Colorado River Aqueduct (\"CRA\") for further delivery to Project participants; and \n \u00b7 An energy source to provide power to the well-field, pipeline and pumping facilities. \nIf an imported water storage component of the Project is ultimately implemented in Phase II, the following additional facilities would be required, among other things:\n \u00b7 Facilities to pump water through the conveyance pipeline from the CRA to the Water Project well-field and/or through the Company's pipeline from Cadiz to Barstow, CA; and \n \u00b7 Spreading basins, which are shallow settling ponds that will be configured to efficiently percolate water from the ground surface down to the water table using subsurface storage capacity for the storage of water. \nPhase I\nPhase I has been fully reviewed and permitted in accordance with the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA). In May 2016, all permits and approvals were sustained in the California Court of Appeal and are no longer subject to further litigation. As a result, the Project presently is permitted to provide an average of 50,000 acre-feet of water for 50 years to meet municipal and industrial (M&I) water needs in Southern California.\nIn October 2017, the US Bureau of Land Management (\"BLM\") provided a letter finding that the Project's proposed use of a portion of the Arizona & California Railroad Company (\"ARZC\") right-of-way from Cadiz to Freda, California to construct and operate the Water Project's water conveyance pipeline and related railroad improvements from Cadiz to the CRA is within the scope of the original right of way grant and not subject to additional permitting or review. The buried pipeline would be constructed parallel to the railroad tracks and be used to convey water between our Cadiz Valley property and the CRA.\nConstruction of Phase I Water Project facilities is expected to cost approximately $250 million and will require capital financing that we expect will be secured by definitive Purchase and Sale Agreements with Project participants and the new facility assets. On May 25, 2017, the Company closed a strategic transaction with funds affiliated with Apollo Global Management, LLC (\"Apollo\"), a leading global alternative investment manager with approximately $197 billion of assets under management, to initiate financial arrangements for the construction of Phase I. In furtherance of the strategic transaction, funds managed by affiliates of Apollo and the Company executed a conditional commitment of up to $240 million for Phase I construction finance expenditures. The conditional commitment is intended to provide the additional resources necessary to complete the construction of Phase I of the Water Project. However, Cadiz is not obligated to accept such financing from Apollo, and Apollo's commitment is conditional (see \"Liquidity and Capital Resources\", below). We expect to finalize construction financing after the final terms of contracts and conveyance are negotiated, as described below.\nIn addition to finalizing construction financing terms as described above, prior to construction, the Water Project must (1) finalize contracts with Project participating agencies, (2) secure transportation arrangements to deliver water into each participant's service area, and (3) complete final design, engineering and construction permitting. Below is a discussion of present activities to advance these objectives.\n(1) Contracts with Public Water Agencies or Private Water Utilities\nThe Company has executed Letters of Intent (\"LOIs\"), option agreements and purchase agreements, or contracts (collectively, \"Agreements\") with public water agencies and private water utilities in California during the Project's development. These participating agencies serve more than one million customers in cities throughout California's San Bernardino, Riverside, Los Angeles, Orange, Imperial and Ventura Counties. Twenty percent of Water Project supplies have been reserved for San Bernardino County-based agencies.\nSanta Margarita Water District (\"SMWD\"), Orange County's second largest water provider, was the first participant to convert its option agreement and adopt resolutions approving a Water Purchase and Sale Agreement for 5,000 acre-feet of water. The structure of the SMWD purchase agreement calls for an annually adjusted water supply payment, plus a pro rata portion of the capital recovery charge and operating and maintenance costs. The capital recovery charge is calculated by amortizing the total capital investment by the Company over a 30-year term.\nAgreements entered into prior to the beginning of the CEQA review process provide the right to acquire an annual supply of 5,000 acre-feet of water at $775 per acre-foot (2010 dollars, subject to adjustment), which is competitive with the incremental cost of new water. In addition, these agencies received options to acquire storage rights in the Water Project to allow for the management of their Water Project supplies in complement with their own water resources. Up to 150,000 acre-feet of carry-over storage is available for reservation by the agencies prior to construction commencement. Participants that elect to achieve year-to-year flexibility in their use of Project water by utilizing carry-over storage will reserve storage capacity for $1,500 per acre-foot prior to construction.\nLOIs that have been entered into since completion of the CEQA review process reserve supplies from the Water Project at $960 per acre-foot (2014 dollars, subject to adjustment). These LOIs also include the option to reserve carry-over storage capacity for $1,500 per acre-foot prior to construction.\nPresently, total reservations of supplies from the Water Project via these Agreements are in excess of Water Project capacity. Prior to construction of the Water Project, we expect to convert existing option agreements and LOIs to purchase agreements. We are working collaboratively with the participating water agencies to account for any oversubscription in the final definitive Purchase and Sale Agreements we enter into with these agencies and allow for inclusive participation across Southern California.\n(2) Conveyance Arrangements\nPrior to construction of the Water Project, and in coordination with final participation contracts described in (1) above, an agreement and terms for moving water supplies in the CRA must be negotiated with Metropolitan Water District of Southern California (\"Metropolitan\"), which owns and controls the CRA.\nWater supplies conserved by the Project would enter the CRA at the termination of the project's conveyance pipeline near Rice, CA. The CEQA process considered a variety of options to enter the CRA and assumed final entry into the CRA would be determined by MWD in consultation with the Project's participating agencies. Once arrangements are reached, the Metropolitan Board would take action as a responsible agency under CEQA regarding the terms and conditions of the Water Project's use of the CRA to transport water to its participating agencies.\nThere is no application yet before Metropolitan related to entry and transportation of Project supplies, but we expect such a formal application will be filed in 2018 as the Project's contractual arrangements with participants are finalized. Any agreement as to the terms and conditions of the Water Project's use of the CRA will be negotiated between and entered into by Metropolitan and the Project participating agencies, not the Company. Discussions with Metropolitan regarding conveyance of Project water in the CRA have been led by SMWD, the Water Project's CEQA lead agency.\nWater Project supplies entering the CRA will comply with Metropolitan's published engineering, design and water quality standards and will be subject to all applicable fees and charges routinely established by Metropolitan for the conveyance of water within its service territory. We believe there are multiple benefits that can be secured by MWD upon making space reasonably available for the Water Project supplies and having the flexibility of relying on the Water Project in both wet and dry years.\n(3) Final Design and Permitting\nAs a component of completing contract terms with participating agencies and related wheeling arrangements with Metropolitan, we must also finalize design of Project facilities and acquire relevant construction permits with state and local agencies. Together with SMWD we have engaged engineering and environmental consultants to complete design plans for the 43-mile pipeline, Project wellfield, any necessary water treatment facilities, and facilities required to connect to the Metropolitan system at and near the CRA. This work is ongoing and expected to proceed in coordination with the negotiation of contracts and wheeling arrangements.\nOnce facility design and layout near completion, we will need to obtain additional permits and approvals from state or local entities prior to construction. This may include but is not limited to confirmation of existing access rights, easements and rights-of-way, for areas that may be crossed by Project facilities in the Project area subject to final pipeline configuration.\nPhase II\nIn a second phase of the Water Project, we expect to make available up to one million acre-feet of capacity in the aquifer system for storage of surplus water conveyed to the Project area. Under the Imported Water Storage Component, or Phase II, water from the Colorado River or the State Water Project could be conveyed to spreading basins that would be constructed on our private property to percolate into the aquifer system and held in storage. When needed, previously stored water would be returned to Phase II participating agencies via the Project's 43-mile conveyance pipeline to the CRA, described above, or via an existing 96-mile pipeline that extends from our Cadiz property northwest to Barstow and Bakersfield, California (see \"Northern Pipeline\" below).\nPhase II has already been the subject of programmatic environmental review in accordance with CEQA, but still requires project-level environmental review and permitting once participating agencies are identified. Phase II may also require federal permits subject to the National Environmental Policy Act, or NEPA.\nNorthern Pipeline\nWe currently own a 96-mile existing idle natural gas pipeline that extends from the Cadiz/Fenner Property to Barstow, California and we intend to convert this pipeline to allow for the transportation of water. The Barstow area serves as a hub for water delivered from northern and central California to communities in Southern California's High Desert. In addition, we hold an option to purchase a further 124-mile segment of this pipeline from Barstow to Wheeler Ridge, California for $20 million. This option expires in December 2018. We do not currently have the cash resources on hand to exercise this option and have engaged an investment banker to pursue alternatives that will provide the resources to allow us to exercise this option. If we are unable to exercise this option, then our Northern Pipeline opportunities will be limited to the 96- mile segment we currently own.\nInitial feasibility studies indicated that, upon conversion, the 30-inch pipeline could transport between 18,000 and 30,000 acre-feet of water per year between the Water Project area and various points along the Central and Northern California water transportation network. As a result, this pipeline could create significant opportunities for our water resource development efforts.\nIf this pipeline were to become operational, then the Water Project would link two major water delivery systems in California, providing flexible opportunities for both supply and storage. The Northern Pipeline could deliver Phase I supplies, either directly or via exchange, to existing and potential customers of Phase I of the Project. Any use of the pipeline would be conducted in conformity with the Water Project's groundwater management plan and is subject to further CEQA evaluation and potentially federal environmental permitting.\nThe Northern Pipeline also represents new opportunities for the Company, independent of the Water Project, to offer water transportation to locations along the pipeline route that are not presently interconnected by existing water infrastructure. The entire 220-mile pipeline crosses California's major water infrastructure as well as urban and agricultural centers and can be utilized to transport water, independent of the Water Project, between users who presently lack direct interconnections along the pipeline route. We are presently engaged in discussions with parties that may be interested in such transportation.\nAgricultural Development\nWithin the Cadiz/Fenner Property, all of the existing 34,500 acres are currently zoned for agriculture. In 1993, we secured conditional use permits to develop agriculture on up to 9,600 acres of the property and withdraw groundwater from the underlying aquifer system for irrigation. We have since maintained various levels of crops on the Property as we developed the Water Project. In 2013, we entered into a lease agreement with a third party to develop up to 1,480 acres of lemons at the site, 640 acres of which have been planted to date.\nIn February 2016, we entered into a lease agreement with Fenner Valley Farms LLC (\"FVF\"), a subsidiary of Water Asset Management LLC, a related party, pursuant to which FVF leased, for a 99-year term, 2,100 acres at the Cadiz/Fenner property to be used to plant, grow and harvest agricultural crops (\"FVF Lease\"). As consideration for the lease, FVF paid the Company a one-time payment of $12,000,000 in February 2016. The acreage that was historically farmed by the Company and the acreage that is leased to a third party to develop lemons was included within the leased acreage. Following entry into this lease, we are no longer directly involved in the current agricultural operations at the site and all agricultural revenue is derived pursuant to the FVF Lease.\nAs part of the agricultural development to be conducted under the lease arrangements, the groundwater production capacity of the property's existing well-field is expected to be enhanced through infrastructure improvements that are complementary to the Water Project. While any additional well-field development for agricultural use would be financed by our agricultural partners as provided under our agricultural lease arrangements, we retained a call feature that allows us, at any time in the initial 20 years, to acquire the well-field and integrate any new agricultural well-field infrastructure developed into the Water Project's facilities.\nAdditional Eastern Mojave Properties\nWe also own approximately 11,000 acres outside of the Cadiz/Fenner Valley area in two locations within the Mojave Desert in eastern San Bernardino County.\nOur primary landholding outside of the Cadiz area is approximately 9,000 acres in the Piute Valley. This landholding is located approximately 15 miles from the resort community of Laughlin, Nevada, and about 12 miles from the Colorado River town of Needles, California. Extensive hydrological studies, including the drilling and testing of a full-scale production well, have demonstrated that this landholding is underlain by high-quality groundwater. The aquifer system underlying this property is naturally recharged by precipitation (both rain and snow) within a watershed of approximately 975 square miles and could be suitable for a water supply project, agricultural development or solar energy production. These properties are located in or adjacent to areas designated by the federal government as National Monument, Critical Desert Tortoise Habitat and/or Desert Wilderness Areas and are suitable candidates for preservation and conservation (see \"Land Conservation Bank\" below).\nAdditionally, we own acreage located near Danby Dry Lake in Ward Valley, approximately 30 miles southeast of our Cadiz/Fenner Valley properties. The Danby Dry Lake property is located approximately 10 miles north of the CRA. Initial hydrological studies indicate that the area has excellent potential for a water supply project. Certain of the properties in this area may also be suitable for agricultural development and/or preservation and conservation.\nLand Conservation Bank\nApproximately 7,500 acres of our properties outside of the Cadiz/Fenner Valley area in the Piute Valley are located within terrain designated by the federal government as Critical Desert Tortoise Habitat and/or Desert Wilderness Areas and offer limited development opportunities. In February 2015, the California Department of Fish and Wildlife approved our establishment of the Fenner Valley Desert Tortoise Conservation Bank (\"Fenner Bank\"), a land conservation bank that makes available these properties for mitigation of impacts to tortoise and other sensitive species that would be caused by development across the Southern California desert. Under its enabling documents, the Fenner Bank offers credits that can be acquired by entities that must mitigate or offset impacts linked to planned development. For example, this bank can service the mitigation requirements of renewable energy, military, residential and commercial development projects being considered throughout the desert. Credits sold by the Fenner Bank will fund our permanent preservation of the land as well as research by outside entities, including San Diego Zoo Global, into desert tortoise health and species protection.\nOther Opportunities\nOther opportunities in the water and agricultural or related infrastructure business complementary to our current objectives could provide new opportunities for our Company.\nOver the longer-term, we believe the population of Southern California, Nevada and Arizona will continue to grow, and that, in time, the economics of commercial and residential development at our properties may become attractive.\nWe remain committed to the sustainable use of our land and water assets, and will continue to explore all opportunities for environmentally responsible development of these assets. We cannot estimate which of these opportunities will ultimately be utilized.\nResults of Operations\n (a) Year Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2016 \nWe have not received significant revenues from our water resource and real estate development activities to date. Our revenues have been limited to rental income from the FVF Lease (see \"Agricultural Development\", above). As a result, we have historically incurred a net loss from operations. We had revenues of $437 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2017, and $412 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2016. The net loss totaled $33.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared with a net loss of $26.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The higher loss in 2017 was primarily related to a $3.5 million loss on extinguishment of debt and $2.6 million in unrealized losses recorded for warrant liabilities. The higher 2017 loss was also related to an increase in stock compensation resulting from the vesting of milestone shares earned by employees, an increase in cash bonus awards to employees, and an increase in general and administrative expense due to pre-construction engineering activities in connection with the Water Project.\nOur primary expenses are our ongoing overhead costs associated with the development of the Water Project (i.e., general and administrative expense) and our interest expense. We will continue to incur non-cash expense in connection with our management and director equity incentive compensation plans.\nRevenues. Revenue totaled $437 thousand during the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $412 thousand during the year ended December 31, 2016. The 2017 revenue is primarily related to rental income from the FVF Lease (see \"Agricultural Development\", above).\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses. General and administrative expenses during the year ended December 31, 2017, totaled $12.8 million compared with $9.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Non-cash compensation costs related to stock and option awards are included in general and administrative expenses.\nGeneral and administrative expenses, exclusive of stock-based compensation costs, totaled $10.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared with $8.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in general and administrative expense in 2017 was primarily due to pre-construction engineering activities in connection with the Water Project and an increase in cash bonus awards to employees.\nCompensation costs from stock and option awards for the year ended December 31, 2017, totaled $2.3 million compared with $1.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The higher 2017 expense primarily reflects the vesting of milestone shares earned by employees and consultants of the Company.\nDepreciation. Depreciation expense totaled $274 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2017, and $292 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2016.\nInterest Expense, net. Net interest expense totaled $17.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $14.9 million during 2016. The following table summarizes the components of net interest expense for the two periods (in thousands):\nTable 25: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest on outstanding debt\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 11,279\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 9,664\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Unrealized losses on warrants\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2,608\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Amortization of debt discount\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 3,690\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 4,973\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Amortization of deferred loan costs\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest income\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (51\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 17,719\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 14,875\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe interest on outstanding debt increased from $9.7 million to $11.3 million due to compounded interest on a larger credit facility associated with our May 2017 debt refinancing. Additionally, during the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company recorded net unrealized losses on warrants of $2.6 million, which included $3.1 million in unrealized losses related to the issuance of shares to former lenders (see Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Common Stock\") and $508 thousand in unrealized gains related to our May 2017 debt refinancing. (See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Long-Term Debt\").\nDebt Refinancings. In May 2017, we entered into a new $60 million credit agreement (\"Credit Agreement\") with funds affiliated with Apollo Global Management, LLC (\"Apollo\") that replaced and refinanced our then existing $45 million senior secured mortgage debt (\"Prior Senior Secured Debt\") and provided $15 million of new senior debt to fund immediate construction related expenditures (\"New Senior Secured Debt\"). The New Senior Secured Debt will mature on the earliest of (a) the four year anniversary of the Closing Date, and (b) the \"Springing Maturity Date\", which is defined as the date which is 91 days prior to the maturity date of the 7.00% Convertible Senior Notes of Cadiz due 2020 (the \"New Convertible Notes\") that were issued in December 2015 and April 2016 pursuant to the New Convertible Notes Indenture as defined in the Credit Agreement, if on the 91st day preceding the maturity date of the New Convertible Notes, the 5-Day VWAP, as defined in the Credit Agreement, is less than 120% of the then applicable Conversion Rate, as defined in the New Convertible Notes Indenture, and at least $10,000,000 in original principal amount of the New Convertible Notes is outstanding ((a) or (b), as applicable, the \"Maturity Date\"). Interest on the New Senior Secured Debt is due quarterly on each March 31, June 30, September 30 and December 31 (each an \"Interest Date\") beginning on June 30, 2017. Interest on the New Senior Secured Debt will (i) accrete to the outstanding principal amount at a rate per annum equal to 6% (the \"PIK Rate\") compounded quarterly on each Interest Date and (ii) accrue on the outstanding principal amount at a rate per annum equal to 2% (the \"Cash Rate\"). We, in our discretion, may make any quarterly interest payment in cash on the applicable Interest Date at the PIK Rate, in lieu of accretion of such interest to the principal amount at the PIK Rate. The proceeds from the Credit Agreement were used to repay the Prior Senior Secured Debt resulting in a loss on extinguishment of $3.5 million which consisted of the write-off of unamortized debt discount, unamortized debt issuance costs and fees paid to the former lenders. In addition, we incurred $1.5 million in legal and finders' fees which was recorded as additional debt discount and is being amortized through December 2019, which is the Springing Maturity Date as discussed above.\nIn conjunction with the closing of the New Senior Secured Debt, we issued to Apollo a warrant to purchase an aggregate of 362,500 shares of our common stock (\"2017 Warrant\"). The Company recorded a debt discount at the time of the closing of the New Senior Secured Debt in the amount of $2.9 million which was the fair value of the 2017 Warrant issued. The debt discount is being amortized through December 2019, which is the Springing Maturity Date as discussed above. The fair value of the 2017 Warrant will be remeasured each reporting period, and the change in warrant value will be recorded as interest expense and an adjustment to the derivative liability. The warrant has a five-year term and an exercise price of $14.94 per share, subject to adjustment.\n (b) Year Ended December 31, 2016 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2015 \nWe had revenues of $412 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2016, and $304 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2015. The net loss totaled $26.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared with a net loss of $24.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The higher loss in 2016 was primarily related to a $2.25 million loss on extinguishment of debt. The higher 2016 loss was also related to higher interest expense on additional convertible debt issued and higher amortization expense, offset by a decrease in litigation costs related to the Water Project due to the timing of the appellate litigation.\nRevenues. Revenue totaled $412 thousand during the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to $304 thousand during the year ended December 31, 2015. The 2016 revenue is primarily related to rental income from the FVF Lease (see \"Agricultural Development\", above).\nCost of Sales. Cost of sales were zero for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared with $334 thousand during the year ended December 31, 2015.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses. General and administrative expenses during the year ended December 31, 2016, totaled $9.3 million compared with $13.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. Non-cash compensation costs related to stock and option awards are included in general and administrative expenses.\nGeneral and administrative expenses, exclusive of stock-based compensation costs, totaled $8.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2016, compared with $12.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The decrease in general and administrative expense in 2016 was primarily due to lower litigation costs related to the Water Project due to the timing of the appellate litigation (see Item 1. - \"Business, (a) General Development of Business\", above.)\nCompensation costs from stock and option awards for the year ended December 31, 2016, totaled $1.3 million compared with $1.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The higher 2016 expense was primarily due to higher stock-based non-cash compensation costs related to shares awarded to the Brownstein law firm for certain legal and advisory services to the Company.\nDepreciation. Depreciation expense totaled $292 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2016, and $270 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nInterest Expense, net. Net interest expense totaled $14.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to $10.1 million during 2015. The following table summarizes the components of net interest expense for the two periods (in thousands):\nTable 27: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest on outstanding debt\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 9,664\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 8,237\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Amortization of debt discount\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 4,973\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1,635\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Amortization of deferred loan costs\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 14,875\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 10,070\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe interest on outstanding debt increased from $8.2 million to $9.7 million due to compounded interest on the debt facilities resulting in a higher principal balance. Amortization of debt discount increased from $1.6 million to $5.0 million primarily due to the acceleration of unamortized debt discount related to the conversion of approximately $2.8 million in original principal amount of the 2020 Notes that were issued in April 2016.\nPrior Debt Refinancings. In April 2016, we entered into a note purchase agreement with new and existing investors (the \"Investors\"). Pursuant to the agreement, we issued approximately $10.0 million of our 7.00% Convertible Senior Notes due 2020 (\"2020 Notes) in aggregate principal and accrued interest. The proceeds from the issuance of the 2020 Notes (such 2020 Notes, the \"New Notes\"), are used for general working capital purposes. The 2020 Notes accrue interest at 7.00% per year, with no principal or interest payments due prior to maturity on March 5, 2020. The 2020 Notes, including original principal and accrued interest, are convertible at any time into the Company's common stock at a price of $6.75 per share, pursuant to the terms of the Indenture dated as of December 10, 2015, by and between the Company and US Bank National Association (the \"Indenture\"), under which the New Notes were issued. As a result of this transaction, we recorded a debt discount in the amount of $2.0 million which is the difference between the proceeds from this transaction and the principal and accrued interest of New Notes on the day of the issuance. In addition, based on the conversion rate of $6.75 per share, the fair value of the shares receivable on conversion exceed the $8.0 million in net proceeds; therefore, a beneficial conversion feature was recorded in the amount of $1.48 million. This amount was recorded as additional debt discount with a corresponding amount recorded as additional paid-in capital. Such debt discount is accreted to the redemption value of the instrument over the remaining term of the loan. Furthermore, we incurred $400 thousand in placement agent fees which was recorded as additional debt discount and is being amortized over the remaining term of the loan.\nIn November 2016, we entered into an agreement with our then senior lenders which (i) extended the maturity date of our secured senior debt from September 2017 to September 2019 and (ii) permits us to satisfy the cash interest payment obligations through the issuance of shares of the Company's common stock. In connection with the agreement, we issued to our then senior lenders an aggregate of 357,500 shares of the Company's common stock and warrants to purchase an aggregate of 357,500 shares of its common stock (\"2016 Warrants\"). The Company recorded a debt discount in the amount of $3.4 million which was the fair value of the 357,500 shares issued. Such debt discount was accreted over the remaining term of the loan. The 2016 Warrants had a five- year term and an exercise price of $0.01 per share. In October 2017, the Company agreed to issue an aggregate of 264,096 shares of the Company's common stock with an aggregate value of $3.3 million in connection with a Payoff Agreement the Company entered into with prior lenders on May 24, 2017. Effective upon the delivery of the 264,096 shares, the 2016 Warrants were deemed cancelled. The Company recorded a $3.1 million expense in 2017 for the issuance of these shares and cancellation of the warrants. The expense is included in interest expense. Additionally, we filed a prospectus supplement to our S-3 registration statement, number 333-214318, indicating that we were offering 800,000 shares of our common stock to satisfy the cash interest payment obligations under the Credit Agreement in an aggregate amount equal to $5,639,916. Only 78,942 shares of the 800,000 shares offered were issued as payment of our interest obligations with an aggregate value of $866,345, prior to May 26, 2017, when we repaid in full, in cash, all amounts due under the Credit Agreement. Therefore, because the additional 721,058 (\"Unissued Shares\") included in the prospectus supplement will not be issued to pay the interest due under the Credit Agreement, the offering of the Unissued Shares with an aggregate value of $4,773,571 has been terminated.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n(a) Current Financing Arrangements\nAs we have not received significant revenues from our development activities to date, we have been required to obtain financing to bridge the gap between the time water resource and other development expenses are incurred and the time that revenue will commence. Historically, we have addressed these needs primarily through secured debt financing arrangements, private equity placements and the exercise of outstanding stock options and warrants. We have also worked with our secured lenders to structure our debt in a way which allows us to continue development of the Water Project and minimize the dilution of the ownership interests of common stockholders.\nOn May 25, 2017, we entered into a new $60 million credit agreement with funds affiliated with Apollo Global Management, LLC (\"Apollo\") that replaced and refinanced our then existing $45 million senior secured mortgage debt (\"Prior Senior Secured Debt\") and provided $15 million of new senior debt to fund immediate construction related expenditures (\"New Senior Secured Debt\"). Additionally, funds affiliated with Apollo also executed a conditional commitment letter to fund up to $240 million in construction finance expenditures for the Cadiz Water Project, subject to the satisfaction of conditions precedent. It is intended to provide the additional resources necessary to complete the construction of Phase I of the Water Project. Apollo's commitment for up to $240 million is conditional and Cadiz is not obligated to accept such financing from Apollo.\nThe New Senior Secured Debt and the convertible notes contain representations, warranties and covenants that are typical for agreements of this type, including restrictions that would limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness, incur liens, pay dividends or make restricted payments, dispose of assets, make investments and merge or consolidate with another person. However, while there are affirmative covenants, there are no financial maintenance covenants and no restrictions on our ability to issue additional common stock to fund future working capital needs. The debt covenants associated with the New Senior Secured Debt were negotiated by the parties with a view towards our operating and financial condition as it existed at the time the agreements were executed. At December 31, 2017, we were in compliance with our debt covenants.\nLimitations on our liquidity and ability to raise capital may adversely affect us. Sufficient liquidity is critical to meet our resource development activities. We currently expect our cash on hand to be sufficient to meet our working capital needs for a period beyond one year from this annual report issuance date. To the extent additional capital is required, we may increase liquidity through a variety of means, including equity or debt placements, through the lease, sale or other disposition of assets or reductions in operating costs. Equity placements, if made, would be undertaken only to the extent necessary, so as to minimize the dilutive effect of any such placements upon our existing stockholders.\nAs we continue to actively pursue our business strategy, additional financing will continue to be required. See \"Outlook\" below. The covenants in the term debt do not prohibit our use of additional equity financing and allow us to retain 100% of the proceeds of any equity financing. We do not expect the loan covenants to materially limit our ability to finance our water development activities.\nAt December 31, 2017, we had no outstanding credit facilities other than the New Senior Secured Debt and the convertible notes.\nCash Used for Operating Activities. Cash used for operating activities totaled $10.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, $9.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, and $12.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The cash was primarily used to fund general and administrative expenses related to our water development efforts and litigation costs.\nCash Used For Investing Activities. Cash used for investing activities in the year ended December 31, 2017, was $1.0 million, compared with zero for the year ended December 31, 2016, and $906 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2015. The 2017 costs consisted of engineering and design related to the development of the Water Project, and the 2015 period primarily included additional investments in well-field and environmental work related to progressing the Water Project.\nCash Provided by (Used for) Financing Activities. Cash provided by financing activities totaled $12.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared with cash provided by financing activities of $19.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, and cash used for financing activities of $42 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2015. The 2017 results include $12.3 million of net proceeds from the issuance of long term debt. The 2016 results include proceeds of approximately $12.0 million related to the FVF Lease (see \"Agricultural Development\", above), $8.0 million in net proceeds related to convertible note financing and approximately $10.5 million in proceeds from the issuance of shares under a shelf takedown offering, offset by $960 thousand in recorded debt issuance costs and a principal payment of approximately $10.6 million on the Prior Senior Secured Debt.\n(b) Outlook\nShort-Term Outlook. Our cash resources of $13.0 million as of December 31, 2017 provide us with sufficient funds to meet our working capital needs through April 2019. As of March 5, 2018, $1.35 million of short-term debt was removed when certain of our lenders elected to convert all principal and accrued interest under the 2018 Convertible Notes. As we require additional working capital to fund operations, we expect to continue our historical practice of structuring our financing arrangements to match the anticipated needs of our development activities. See \"Long-Term Outlook\" below. No assurances can be given, however, as to the availability or terms of any new financing. Additionally, our option to acquire an additional 124-mile extension of our Northern Pipeline will require a $20 million payment by December 2018. We do not currently have the cash resources on hand to exercise this option and have engaged an investment banker to pursue alternatives that will provide the resources to allow us to exercise this option. If we are unable to exercise this option, then our Northern Pipeline opportunities will be limited to the 96-mile segment we currently own.\nLong-Term Outlook. In the longer term, we will need to raise additional capital to finance working capital needs, capital expenditures and any payments due under our Senior Secured Debt or our convertible notes at maturity (see \"Current Financing Arrangements\" above). Our future working capital needs will depend upon the specific measures we pursue in the entitlement and development of our water resources and other developments. Future capital expenditures will depend primarily on the progress of the Water Project.\nWe are evaluating the amount of cash needed, and the manner in which such cash will be raised, on an ongoing basis. We may meet any future cash requirements through a variety of means, including construction financing to be provided by the Apollo conditional commitment letter described above (see \"Debt Refinancings\" above), equity and debt placements, or through the sale or other disposition of assets. Equity placements would be undertaken only to the extent necessary, so as to minimize the dilution effect of any such placements upon our existing stockholders. Limitations on our liquidity and ability to raise capital may adversely affect us. Sufficient liquidity is critical to meet our resource development activities.\n(c) Critical Accounting Policies\nAs discussed in Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements, the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and related footnotes. In preparing these financial statements, management has made its best estimates and judgments of certain amounts included in the financial statements based on all relevant information available at the time and giving due consideration to materiality. We do not believe there is a great likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported related to the accounting policies described below. However, application of these policies involves the exercise of judgment and use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and, as a result, actual results could differ from these estimates. Management has concluded that the following critical accounting policies described below affect the most significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements.\n(1) Intangible and Other Long-Lived Assets. Property, plant and equipment, intangible and certain other long-lived assets are depreciated or amortized over their useful lives. Useful lives are based on management's estimates of the period over which the assets will generate revenue.\n(2) Goodwill. As a result of a merger in May 1988 between two companies, which eventually became known as Cadiz Inc., goodwill in the amount of $7,006,000 was recorded. Approximately $3,193,000 of this amount was amortized until the adoption of Accounting Standards Codification 350, \"Intangibles - Goodwill and Other\" on January 1, 2002.\n(3) Valuation of Goodwill and Long-Lived Assets. The Company assesses long-lived assets, excluding goodwill, for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable through the estimated undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the assets. If it is determined that the carrying value of long-lived assets may not be recoverable, the impairment is measured by using the projected discounted cash-flow method.\nThe Company uses a one-step impairment test to identify potential goodwill impairment and measure the amount of a goodwill impairment loss to be recognized (if any) for the Company. This quantitative assessment is performed at least annually and compares a reporting unit's fair value to its carrying amount to determine if there is a potential impairment. An impairment loss will be recognized for the amount by which the reporting unit's carrying amount exceeds its fair value, not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill in that reporting unit.\n(4) Deferred Tax Assets and Valuation Allowances. To date, the Company has not generated significant revenue from its water development programs, and it has a history of net operating losses. As such, the Company has generated significant deferred tax assets, including large net operating loss carryforwards for federal and state income taxes for which it has recorded a full valuation allowance. Management is currently working on water storage, water supply, and agricultural projects, including the Water Project, that are designed to generate future taxable income, although there can be no guarantee that this will occur. If taxable income is generated in future years, some portion or all of the valuation allowance will be reversed, and an increase in net income would consequently be reported.\n(5) Stock-Based Compensation. The Company applies the Black-Scholes valuation model in determining the fair value of options granted to employees and consultants. For employees, the fair value is then charged to expense on the straight-line basis over the requisite service period. For consultants, the fair value is remeasured at each reporting period and recorded as a liability until the award is settled.\nAccounting Standards Codification Topic 718, \"Compensation - Stock Compensation\" also requires the Company to estimate forfeitures in calculating the expense related to stock-based compensation as opposed to only recognizing forfeitures and the corresponding reduction in expense as they occur. As of December 31, 2017, all options outstanding are fully vested; therefore, there is no potential impact of forfeitures.\n(6) Valuation of Warrants. In November 2016, the Company issued to its then senior lenders warrants to purchase an aggregate of 357,500 shares of the Company's common stock (\"2016 Warrants\"). The 2016 Warrants had a five-year term and an exercise price of $.01 per share. The fair value of these warrants was determined using the Black-Scholes pricing model. The fair value of the 2016 Warrants was remeasured each reporting period, and the change in warrant value was recorded as an adjustment to the derivative liability with unrealized gains or losses reflected in interest expense. In October 2017, the Company agreed to issue an aggregate of 264,096 shares of the Company's common stock with an aggregate value of $3.3 million in connection with a Payoff Agreement the Company entered into with prior lenders on May 24, 2017. Effective upon the delivery of the 264,096 shares, the 2016 Warrants were deemed cancelled. The Company recorded a $3.1 million expense in 2017 for the issuance of these shares and cancellation of the warrants. The expense is included in interest expense.\nIn May 2017, the Company issued to its senior lenders warrants to purchase an aggregate 362,500 shares of the Company's common stock (\"2017 Warrants\"). The 2017 Warrants have a five-year term and an exercise price of $14.94 per share, subject to adjustment. The 2017 Warrants are valued using a lattice model that uses unobservable inputs such as volatility and future probability of issuing new shares. The fair value of the 2017 Warrants are remeasured each reporting period, and the change in warrant value is recorded as an adjustment to the derivative liability with unrealized gains or losses reflect in interest expense.\n(d) New Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\".\n(e) Off Balance Sheet Arrangements\nThe Company does not have any off balance sheet arrangements at this time.\n(f) Certain Known Contractual Obligations\nTable 28: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Payments Due by Period\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Contractual Obligations\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Less than 1 year\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1-3 years\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 4-5 years\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> After 5 years\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Long-term debt and lease obligations\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 147,440\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,427\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 69,578\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 62,715\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 13,720\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest payable\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 105,871\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1,315\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 14,360\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 14,786\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 75,410\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating leases\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1,467\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 254,778\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,242\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 84,605\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 77,801\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 89,130\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n* The above table does not reflect unrecognized tax benefits of $2.8 million, the timing of which is uncertain.
