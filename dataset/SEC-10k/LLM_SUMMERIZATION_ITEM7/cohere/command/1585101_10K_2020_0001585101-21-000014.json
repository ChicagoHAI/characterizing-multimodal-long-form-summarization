Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis together with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The following information contains forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. Please see Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d above for a description of these risks and uncertainties.\nThis section of this Form 10-K generally discusses 2020 and 2019 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2020 and 2019. Discussions of 2018 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2019 and 2018 that are not included in this Form 10-K can be found in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Results of Operations\u201d in Part II, Item 7 of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019.\nExecutive Summary\nHines Global Income Trust, Inc. ( Hines Global\u201d) is a Maryland corporation formed to invest in a diversified portfolio of quality commercial real estate properties and other real estate investments located throughout the United States and internationally. Hines Global is sponsored by Hines Interests Limited Partnership ( Hines\u201d), a fully integrated global real estate investment and management firm that has acquired, developed, owned, operated and sold real estate for over 60 years.\nWe raise capital for our investments through public offerings of our common stock. We commenced our initial public offering of up to $2.5 billion in shares of our common stock (the Initial Offering\u201d) in August 2014 and commenced our second public offering of up to $2.5 billion in shares of common stock including $500,000,000 of shares offered under our distribution reinvestment plan (the Second Offering\u201d) in December 2017. Our Second Offering reflects a restructuring (the Restructuring\u201d) that our board of directors believes is in the best interests of our stockholders. We intend to commence our third public offering and terminate the Second Offering in the second quarter of 2021.\nAs of March 26, 2021, we had received aggregate gross offering proceeds of $1.2 billion from the sale of 122.4 million shares through our public offerings, including shares issued pursuant to our distribution reinvestment plan.\nWe intend to continue to meet our primary investment objectives by investing in a portfolio of quality commercial real estate properties and other real estate investments that relate to properties that are generally diversified by property type, geographic area, lease expirations and tenant industries. We acquired seven investments in real estate assets during the year ended December 31, 2020 for a total net purchase price of $447.1 million, using proceeds from our public offerings, proceeds from the sale of three properties during 2020 and proceeds from debt financing. As of December 31, 2020, we owned interests in twenty-two real estate investments consisting of 10.9 million square feet of leasable space that were 95% leased. See Item 2. Properties for additional information regarding our real estate investments.\nNAV History\nWe began determining a net asset value ( NAV\u201d) per share on a monthly basis in January 2018. Since that time, our NAV per share has increased from $9.78 in the beginning of 2018 to $10.24 in February 2020. As illustrated in the chart below, the NAV fell to $9.71 as of April 30, 2020 before increasing to $10.10 as of February 28, 2021. As described elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the Coronavirus pandemic has had, and is expected to continue to have, an adverse impact on global commercial activity and has contributed to significant volatility in financial markets. While it is difficult to ascertain the long term impact it will have on commercial real estate markets and our investments, it presents material uncertainty and risk with respect to the current and future performance and value of our investments. Investments in real properties and real estate-related securities have not been immune to the impact of the pandemic, which was the primary cause of the decline in our NAV during 2020. Set forth below is additional historical information regarding our NAV per share since February 29, 2016 (the date as of which our board of directors first determined an NAV per share).\n1.Please see Item 5 - Market for Registrant's Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities as well as our Current Reports on Form 8-K for additional information concerning the methodology used to determine, and the limitations of, the NAV per share.\n2.Our board of directors determined an NAV per share of $9.03 as of February 29, 2016. Prior to that time, $8.92 was considered to be the net investment value\u201d of our shares, which was equal to the offering price per share of $10.00 in effect at that time, as arbitrarily determined by our board of directors, net of the applicable selling commissions, dealer manager fees and issuer costs.\nDistribution History\nAs described elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we declare distributions monthly with the authorization of our board of directors. Set forth below is information regarding our historical gross annualized distribution rates, excluding any applicable distribution and stockholder servicing fees, since October 1, 2014 (the date our board first authorized distributions to be declared). As illustrated in the chart below, our gross annualized distribution rate has remained at $0.625 per share since January 2019. As described previously, the Coronavirus pandemic has had adverse effects on the operations of several of our real estate investments, which could affect our ability to maintain the current distribution rate.\n1.With the authorization of our board of directors, we declared distributions as of daily record dates and paid them on a monthly basis through December 31, 2017. Beginning in January 2018, we began declaring, and intend to continue to declare, distributions as of monthly record dates and pay them on a monthly basis.\n2. We have not generated and we may continue to be unable to generate sufficient cash flows from operations to fully fund distributions. Therefore, some or all of our distributions have been and may continue to be paid, and during the offering phase, are likely to be paid at least partially from other sources, such as proceeds from the sales of assets, proceeds from our debt financings, proceeds from our public offerings, cash advances by our Advisor and/or cash resulting from a waiver or deferral of fees. See - Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d for additional information concerning our distributions.\nPerformance Summary of Share Classes\nThe tables presented below disclose the total returns for each of our share classes. The total returns shown reflect the percent change in the NAV per share from the beginning of the applicable period, plus the amount of any distribution per share declared during the period. The total returns shown are calculated assuming reinvestment of distributions pursuant to our distribution reinvestment plan, are derived from unaudited financial information, and are net of all Hines Global expenses, including general and administrative expenses, transaction-related expenses, management fees, the performance participation allocation, and share class specific fees, but exclude the impact of early redemption deductions on the redemption of shares that have been outstanding for less than one year. The returns have been prepared using unaudited data and valuations of the underlying investments in our portfolio, which are estimates of fair value and form the basis for our NAV per share. Valuations based upon unaudited reports from the underlying investments may be subject to later adjustments, may not correspond to realized value and may not accurately reflect the price at which assets could be liquidated.\nThe table below discloses the total returns for the classes of shares that are available for investment:\nTable 19: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>As of February 28, 2021 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Shares Class (1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>1-Year </td> <td> </td> <td>3-Year </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>ITD </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Class I Shares (2)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>5.08 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>7.55 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8.02 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Class D Shares (2)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>4.82 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>7.28 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7.74 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Class S Shares (No Sales Load) (3)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>4.04 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>6.48 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6.92 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Class S Shares (With Sales Load) (4)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>0.41 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>5.24 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.70 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Class T Shares (No Sales Load) (3)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>4.04 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>6.48 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6.92 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Class T Shares (With Sales Load) (4)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>0.41 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>5.24 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.70 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1)The inception date for Class I, Class D, Class S and Class T Shares is December 6, 2017.\n(2)Class I Shares and Class D Shares are sold without an upfront sales load.\n(3)Class S Shares and Class T Shares listed as (No Sales Load) exclude up-front selling commissions and dealer manager fees.\n(4)Class S Shares and Class T Shares listed as (With Sales Load) reflect the returns after the maximum up-front selling commission and dealer manager fees, which total 3.5% for both share classes.\nThe table below discloses the total returns for the classes of shares that were sold in the Initial Offering, but are no longer available for investment:\nTable 20: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>As of February 28, 2021 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Shares Class (1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>1-Year </td> <td> </td> <td>3-Year </td> <td> </td> <td>5-Year </td> <td> </td> <td>ITD </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Class AX Shares (No Sales Load) </td> <td> </td> <td>5.08 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>7.55 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>9.09 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>8.56 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Class AX Shares (With Sales Load) </td> <td> </td> <td>N/A </td> <td> </td> <td>N/A </td> <td> </td> <td>6.62 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>6.62 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Class TX Shares (No Sales Load) </td> <td> </td> <td>4.04 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>6.48 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>8.04 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>7.92 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Class TX Shares (With Sales Load) </td> <td> </td> <td>N/A </td> <td> </td> <td>N/A </td> <td> </td> <td>6.80 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>6.78 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Class IX Shares (No Sales Load) </td> <td> </td> <td>4.82 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>7.28 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>N/A </td> <td> </td> <td>7.59 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Class IX Shares (With Sales Load) </td> <td> </td> <td>N/A </td> <td> </td> <td>N/A </td> <td> </td> <td>N/A </td> <td> </td> <td>7.35 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1)The inception date for Class AX Shares, Class TX Shares, and Class IX Shares are October 1, 2014, September 1, 2015, and May 1, 2017, respectively.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nOur discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and contingencies as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. We evaluate our assumptions and estimates on an ongoing basis. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Additionally, application of our accounting policies involves exercising judgments regarding assumptions as to future uncertainties. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. The following is a discussion of our critical accounting policies. For a discussion of all of our significant accounting policies, see Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.\nInvestment Property and Lease Intangibles\nWhen we acquire a property, we allocate the purchase price of the acquisition based upon our assessment of the fair value of various components, including to land, building and improvements, and intangible lease assets and liabilities. Fair value determinations are subjective based on estimated cash flow projections that utilize discount and/or capitalization rates, as well as certain available market information, which may include comparable land sales, market-based rental revenues, and the replacement cost of the building, in addition to other factors. The fair value of building and improvements considers the value of the property as if it were vacant. The fair value of intangible lease assets is based on our evaluation of the specific characteristics of each lease. Factors considered include estimates of carrying costs during hypothetical expected lease-up periods, current market conditions and market rates, the customer's credit quality and costs to execute similar leases. The fair value of out-of-market leases is calculated as the present value (using a discount rate that reflects the risks associated with the leases) of the difference between the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to each in-place lease and our estimate of fair market lease rates for each corresponding in-place lease. In estimating carrying costs, we include estimates of lost rentals at market rates during the expected lease-up periods, depending on local market conditions. In estimating costs to execute similar leases, we consider customer improvements, leasing commissions and legal and other related expenses.\nReal estate assets are reviewed for impairment each reporting period if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the individual property may not be recoverable. In such an event, a comparison will be made of the current and projected operating cash flows and expected proceeds from the eventual disposition of each property on an undiscounted basis to the carrying amount of such property. If the carrying amount exceeds the undiscounted cash flows, it would be written down to the estimated fair value to reflect impairment in the value of the asset. The determination of whether investment property is impaired requires a significant amount of judgment by management and is based on the best information available to management at the time of the evaluation. No impairment charges have been recorded for any period through December 31, 2020.\nRevenue Recognition and Valuation of Receivables\nWe are required to recognize minimum rent revenues on a straight-line basis over the terms of tenant leases, including rent holidays and bargain renewal options, if any. Revenues associated with tenant reimbursements are recognized in the period in which the expenses are incurred based upon the tenant's lease provision. Leases are not uniform in dealing with such cost reimbursements and there are many variations in the computation. We make quarterly accrual adjustments, positive or negative, to tenant reimbursement revenue to adjust the recorded amounts to our best estimate of the final amounts to be billed and collected with respect to the cost reimbursements. Revenues relating to lease termination fees are recognized on a straight-line basis amortized from the time that a tenant's right to occupy the leased space is modified through the end of the revised lease term and are included in other revenue in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. To the extent our leases provide for rental increases at specified intervals, we will record a receivable for rent not yet due under the lease terms. Accordingly, our management must determine, in its judgment, to what extent the unbilled rent receivable applicable to each specific tenant is collectible. Revenue from leases where collection is deemed to be less than probable is recorded on a cash basis until collectability is determined to be probable. Further, we assess whether operating lease receivables are appropriately valued based upon an analysis of balances outstanding, historical bad debt levels and current economic trends. The uncollectible portion of the portfolio is recorded as an adjustment to rental revenues.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies for a discussion regarding recent accounting pronouncements and the potential impact, if any, on our financial statements.\nFinancial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources\nOur principal demands for funds are to make real estate investments, including investments in real estate-related securities and capital expenditures, for the payment of operating expenses and distributions, and for the payment of principal and interest on any indebtedness we incur. Generally, we expect to meet operating cash needs from our cash flows from operating activities, and we expect to fund our investments using proceeds from our public offerings, debt proceeds and proceeds from the sales of real estate investments.\nAs of December 31, 2020, our portfolio was approximately 45% leveraged (based on the most recent valuations of our real estate investments) with a weighted average interest rate of 2.08%. We expect that once we have fully invested the proceeds of our public offerings and other potential subsequent offerings, our debt financing, including our pro rata share of the debt financing of entities in which we invest, will be in the range of approximately 40% to 60% of the aggregate value of our real estate investments and other assets. Financing for acquisitions and investments may be obtained at the time an asset is acquired or an investment is made or at such later time as determined to be appropriate. In addition, debt financing may be used from time to time for property improvements, lease inducements, tenant improvements, purchase of real estate-related securities and other working capital needs, including the payment of distributions and redemptions. Our real estate-related securities portfolio may have embedded leverage, including through the use of reverse repurchase agreements and derivatives, including, but not limited to, total return swaps, securities lending arrangements and credit default swaps. Additionally, the amount of debt placed on an individual property or related to a particular investment, including our pro rata share of the amount of debt incurred by an individual entity in which we invest, may be less than 40% or more than 60% of the value of such property/investment or the value of the assets owned by such entity, depending on market conditions and other factors. Our aggregate borrowings, secured and unsecured, must be reasonable in relation to our net assets and must be reviewed by our board of directors at least quarterly. Further, our charter limits our borrowing to 300% of our net assets (which approximates 75% of the cost of our assets) unless any excess borrowing is approved by a majority of our independent directors and is disclosed to our stockholders in our next quarterly report along with justification for the excess.\nNotwithstanding the above, depending on market conditions and other factors, we may choose not to place debt on our portfolio or our assets and may choose not to borrow to finance our operations or to acquire properties. Any indebtedness we do incur will likely be subject to continuing covenants, and we will likely be required to make continuing representations and warranties about our company in connection with such debt. Moreover, some or all of our debt may be secured by some or all of our assets. If we default in the payment of interest or principal on any such debt, breach any representation or warranty in connection with any borrowing or violate any covenant in any loan document, our lender may accelerate the maturity of such debt requiring us to immediately repay all outstanding principal. If we are unable to make such payment, our lender could foreclose on our assets that are pledged as collateral to such lender. The lender could also sue us or force us into bankruptcy. Any such event would have a material adverse effect on the value of an investment in our common shares. As of December 31, 2020, the Company was out of compliance with the debt yield covenant related to its mortgage debts secured by Montrose Student Residences, Queens Court Student Residences and Glasgow West End. The debt yields of these properties were adversely affected by refunds granted in response to the effects of the Coronavirus pandemic as described in Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies. See Note 5 - Debt Financing for additional information regarding our existing debt covenants and certain non-compliance waivers that we obtained in the first quarter of 2021.\nThe Coronavirus pandemic had an adverse impact on our liquidity and capital resources for the year ended December 31, 2020, which resulted from reduced rent collections at our retail properties, rent refunds at our international student housing properties and a reduction of capital raised from the Second Offering as compared to prior periods. We are still in the early stages of navigating the actual and potential long-term impacts the pandemic will have on our business. These conditions may continue to worsen as the pandemic continues.\nWe sold three properties in the first few months of the year, which bolstered our liquidity position despite the adverse effects of the pandemic. Additionally, proceeds raised from the Second Offering improved in the second half of 2020, which, along with debt capital, provided the funding for five additional real estate investments with an aggregate purchase price of $322.2 million. We expect our ongoing capital raise, available capacity on our credit facilities and mortgage financing to provide sufficient capital to fund near-term cash needs, including the acquisitions of additional real estate investments. See Note 2-Summary of Significant Accounting Policies for additional information.\nThe discussions below provide additional details regarding our cash flows.\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\nOur real estate properties generate cash flow in the form of rental revenues, which are used to pay direct leasing costs, property-level operating expenses and interest payments. Additionally, we incur corporate level costs and expenses such as general and administrative expenses, asset management fees and the performance participation allocation.\nCash flows from operating activities for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 were $9.9 million and $17.4 million, respectively. We generally expect cash flows from operating activities to increase each year as we continue to acquire additional properties. However, some of these increases in the current year were offset by the effect of the three property sales completed during the first half of 2020, including the payment of $7.8 million of taxes related to the sale of Bishop's Square in April 2020. Additionally, the increase in cash flows from operating activities was also offset by the payment of the performance participation allocation to the Advisor, which was $1.7 million higher in 2020.\nCash Flows from Investing Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 were primarily due to the following:\n\u2022Payments of $449.1 million primarily related to the acquisitions of six real estate investments during the year ended December 31, 2020.\n\u2022Capital expenditures of approximately $11.5 million at our real estate properties.\n\u2022We received proceeds of $340.2 million from the sale of the Domain Apartments in January 2020, Goodyear Crossing II in February 2020 and Bishop's Square in April 2020. We sold the Domain Apartments for a contract sales price of $80.1 million and we acquired the Domain Apartments in January 2016 for a net purchase price of $58.1 million. We sold Goodyear Crossing II for a contract sales price of $72.0 million and we acquired Goodyear Crossing II in August 2016 for a net purchase price of $56.2 million. We sold Bishop's Square for a contract sales price of \u20ac181.6 million (approximately $198.0 million assuming a rate of $1.09 per EUR as of the date of transaction) and we acquired Bishop's Square in March 2015 for $92.0 million (approximately $103.5 million assuming a rate of $1.13 per EUR as of the acquisition date). Proceeds from these sales were used to pay off the secured debt outstanding on the three real estate investments in full as well as to fund the acquisitions of real estate investments made during the year ended December 31, 2020.\n\u2022Payments of $53.1 million to purchase real estate-related securities. We also received proceeds of $38.0 million from the sale of real estate-related securities.\n\u2022Payments of $621.0 million primarily related to the acquisitions of nine real estate investments during the year ended December 31, 2019.\n\u2022Capital expenditures of approximately $8.5 million at our real estate properties.\n\u2022Payments of $45.2 million to purchase real estate-related securities. We also received proceeds of $20.6 million from the sale of real estate-related securities.\nCash Flows from Financing Activities\nPublic Offerings\nWe commenced the Initial Offering in August 2014 and terminated our offering in December 2017, except for shares issued pursuant to our distribution reinvestment plan. We commenced our Second Offering in December 2017, but did not begin raising proceeds related to the Second Offering until 2018. We received gross proceeds of $227.8 million, $392.9 million and $44.3 million, respectively, during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively, through our public offerings, excluding proceeds from our distribution reinvestment plan. As noted previously, the decrease in proceeds raised in 2020 is primarily due to the Coronavirus pandemic. Proceeds raised in late 2020 and early 2021 were restored to pre-pandemic levels.\nWe intend to commence our third public offering and terminate the Second Offering in the second quarter of 2021. During the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, we redeemed $31.6 million, $15.5 million and $12.5 million, respectively, in shares of common stock pursuant to our share redemption program. Our share redemption program allows for aggregate redemptions of up to 20% of NAV annually, which are subject to final approval by our board of directors. These amounts represent less than 5% of NAV in each year.\nIn addition to the investing activities described previously, we use proceeds from our public offerings to make certain payments to our Advisor, our Dealer Manager and Hines and its affiliates during the various phases of our organization and operation which include, without limitation, payments to our Dealer Manager for selling commissions, dealer manager fees, distribution and stockholder servicing fees and payments to our Advisor for reimbursement of organization and offering costs. During the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, we made payments of $9.4 million, $12.4 million and $3.3 million, respectively, for selling commissions, dealer manager fees and distribution and stockholder servicing fees related to our public offerings. Selling commissions, dealer manager fees and distribution and stockholder servicing fees vary for each share class as described more fully in Note 8 - Related Party Transactions. The change in these fees is generally attributable to the amount of offering proceeds raised, but is also impacted by variations in the amount of each share class sold during the year.\nBeginning December 6, 2017, the Advisor agreed to advance all of our unpaid organization and offering costs, consisting of issuer costs and certain underwriting costs (but excluding selling commissions, dealer manager fees and distribution and stockholder servicing fees) related to our public offerings, through December 31, 2018. In January 2019, we began reimbursing the Advisor in ratable amounts over 60 months for all such advanced expenses, as well as any organization and offering costs incurred subsequent to December 31, 2018, to the extent cumulative organization and offering costs paid by us do not exceed an amount equal to 2.5% of gross offering proceeds from our public offerings. The total reimbursement related to organization and offering costs, selling commissions, dealer manager fees and distribution and stockholder servicing fees may not exceed 15.0% of gross proceeds from our public offerings. During the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we reimbursed the Advisor $6.0 million and $5.7 million for organization and offering costs, respectively.\nDistributions\nWith the authorization of our board of directors, we declared distributions monthly from January 2018 through December 31, 2018 at a gross distribution rate of $0.05083 per month ($0.61 annualized), and from January 2019 through March 31, 2021 at a gross distribution rate of $0.05208 per month ($0.625 annualized) for each share class, less any applicable distribution and stockholder servicing fees. Distributions are made on all classes of the Company's common stock at the same time. All distributions were or will be paid in cash or reinvested in shares of the Company's common stock for those participating in the Company's distribution reinvestment plan and have been or will be paid or issued, respectively, on the first business day following the completion of the month to which they relate. Distributions reinvested pursuant to our distribution reinvestment plan were or will be reinvested in shares of the same class as the shares on which the distributions are made. Some or all of the cash distributions may be paid from sources other than cash flows from operations, as described below.\nDistributions paid to stockholders during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018 were $53.1 million, $33.7 million and $22.5 million, respectively, including those reinvested in shares of our common stock pursuant to our distribution reinvestment plan. We have not generated and we may continue to be unable to generate sufficient cash flows from operations to fully fund distributions paid. Therefore, some or all of our distributions have been and may continue to be paid and during the offering phase, are likely to be paid at least partially from other sources, such as proceeds from the sales of assets, proceeds from our debt financings, proceeds from our public offerings, cash advances by our Advisor and/or cash resulting from a waiver or deferral of fees. We have not placed a cap on the amount of distributions that may be paid from any of these sources. For example, we funded 60%, 42% and 32% of total distributions for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018,\nrespectively, with cash flows from other sources such as cash flows from investing activities, which may include proceeds from the sale of real estate and/or cash flows from financing activities, which may include offering proceeds.\nThe following table outlines our total distributions declared to stockholders for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, including the breakout between the distributions declared in cash and those reinvested pursuant to our distribution reinvestment plan (in thousands).\nTable 21: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Stockholders </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Sources </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Distributions for the Years Ended </td> <td> </td> <td>Cash Distributions </td> <td> </td> <td>Distributions Reinvested </td> <td> </td> <td>Total Declared </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Cash Flows From Operating Activities </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>December 31, 2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>25,398 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>28,762 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>54,161 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>21,777 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>40 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>December 31, 2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>16,112 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>19,446 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>35,558 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>20,798 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>58 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>December 31, 2018 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>10,480 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>12,146 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>22,626 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>15,484 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>68 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nDebt Financings\nAs mentioned previously, our portfolio was 45% leveraged as of December 31, 2020 (based on the most recent valuations of our real estate investments) with a weighted average interest rate of 2.08%.

As described more completely below, most amounts increased in 2020 compared to 2019 as a result of significant additional capital raised and invested in real estate, as offset by recent property dispositions. However, the Coronavirus pandemic had adverse effects on our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2020, which offset some of the increases resulting from our acquisition activity. These effects were primarily due to rent concessions at our retail properties and rent refunds at our international student housing properties. Our other segments were not materially affected. To the extent the Coronavirus pandemic causes additional adverse conditions at our properties, our results in future periods could also be affected. All amounts are in thousands, except for percentages:\nTable 22: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>

a meaningful percentage\nTotal revenues: The increase in total revenue is primarily due to the additional real estate investments acquired during 2020, offset by dispositions during the same period. We acquired seven and disposed of three real estate investments during 2020 and had a portfolio of twenty-two real estate investments as of December 31, 2020 that contained 10.9 million leasable square feet, of which 95% was leased. We also acquired nine real estate investments during 2019 which also contributed to the increases in these amounts since the properties were owned for the entire year in 2020. Despite this increase, total revenues of our same-store properties decreased $6.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2020. Please refer to our Same Store Analysis\u201d below for additional discussion on the results of operations of our portfolio.\nProperty operating expenses: The increase in property operating expenses is primarily due to our net acquisition activity during late 2019 and throughout 2020. Property operating expenses of our same-store properties increased $0.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2020. Please refer to our Same Store Analysis\u201d below for additional discussion on the results of operations of our portfolio.\nReal property taxes: The increase in real property taxes is primarily due to our net acquisition activity during late 2019 and throughout 2020. Real property taxes of our same-store properties decreased $0.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2020. Please refer to our Same Store Analysis\u201d below for additional discussion on the results of operations of our portfolio.\nProperty management fees: The increase in property management fees is primarily due to our net acquisition activity during late 2019 and throughout 2020. Property management fees of our same-store properties increased $0.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2020. Please refer to our Same Store Analysis\u201d below for additional discussion on the results of operations of our portfolio.\nDepreciation and amortization: The increase in depreciation and amortization expense is primarily due to the additional real estate investments acquired during 2019 and 2020, offset by dispositions during the same period, as previously described.\nAsset management fees: Asset management fees are charged based on the aggregate valuation of our real estate investments, as most recently determined in connection with the determination of our NAV. The increase in these fees is primarily due to the additional real estate investments made during 2019 and 2020, offset by dispositions during the same period, as previously described.\nPerformance participation allocation: The decrease in performance participation allocation is a result of the fee not being earned by the Advisor during the year ended December 31, 2020, due to a decline in our NAV per share during the year. Please see Item 7 - Management's Discussion and Analysis-NAV and Distribution for additional information concerning the change in NAV per share during the year ended December 31, 2020.\nGeneral and administrative expenses: General and administrative expenses increased primarily due to increased legal costs and shareholder costs. We generally expect our general and administrative expenses to continue to increase as we continue raising capital from our public offerings.\nGain (loss) on derivative instruments: We enter into interest rate hedging instruments in order to limit our exposure against the variability of future interest rates on our variable interest rate borrowings as well as foreign currency forward contracts as economic hedges against the variability of foreign exchange rates. During the year ended December 31, 2020, such gains were primarily related to the position of our foreign currency forward contracts.\nGain (loss) on investments in real estate-related securities: We hold investments in real estate-related securities, which consist of common equities, preferred equities and debt investments of publicly traded REITs. These amounts include realized gains (losses) related to securities sold during the year and unrealized gains (losses) based on values determined on a recurring basis. The net loss on securities during the year ended December 31, 2020 is due to realized losses on the portfolio incurred primarily as a result of market effects during the first quarter of the year related to the Coronavirus pandemic, offset by unrealized gains following the market recovery from the lows earlier in the year. For information about the valuation of our investments in real-estate related securities, see Note 9-Fair Value Measurements in the notes to the accompanying financial statements.\nGain on sale of real estate: We acquired the Domain Apartments in January 2016 for a contract purchase price of $58.1 million and we sold the Domain Apartments for a contract sales price of $80.1 million on January 7, 2020, resulting in the recognition of a gain of $29.5 million related to this sale. Additionally, we acquired Goodyear Crossing II in August 2016 for a contract purchase price of $56.2 million and we sold Goodyear Crossing II for a contract sales price of $72.0 million on February 14, 2020, resulting in a recognition of a gain of $20.2 million related to this sale. We acquired Bishop's Square in March 2015 for \u20ac92.0 million (approximately $103.5 million assuming a rate of $1.13 per EUR as of the acquisition date) and we sold Bishop's Square in April 2020 for \u20ac181.6 million (approximately $198.0 million assuming a rate of $1.09 per EUR as of the date of transaction). We recognized a gain on sale of this asset of $80.4 million, excluding taxes related to the sale, which are described below. We had no property dispositions during the year ended December 31, 2019.\nForeign currency gains (losses): Foreign currency gains (losses) primarily reflects the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on transactions that were denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the related entity. During the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, these losses were primarily related to the effect of remeasuring cash held in foreign currencies into their related functional currencies.\nInterest expense: Interest expense increased due to the net increase in our principal amount of indebtedness outstanding during the period resulting from additional real estate investments acquired in 2019 and 2020, as offset by the effects of the properties sold during 2020.\nInterest and other income: Primarily relates to interest and dividend income associated with our investments in real estate-related securities. The increase in interest and dividend income earned during the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to 2019 is due to additional investments in real estate-related securities made during the year.\nBenefit (provision) for income taxes: Benefit for income taxes increased nearly $3.4 million primarily as a result of recent changes in tax laws related to our international student housing properties and their effect on book / tax timing differences at these properties.\nProvision for income taxes related to sale of real estate: The increase during the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to 2019 relates to the income tax incurred as a result of the sale of Bishop's Square during April 2020, as described above.\nSame-Store Analysis\nWe evaluate our consolidated results of operations on a same-store basis, which allows us to analyze our property operating results excluding the effects of acquisitions and dispositions during the periods under comparison. Properties in our portfolio are considered same-store if they were owned for the full periods presented. Same-store properties for the year ended December 31, 2020 includes seven properties. The tables below include additional information regarding the operating results of our same-store properties for the current period as compared to the same period in the prior year.\nThe following table presents the same-store revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, by reportable segment. Total revenues increased by 22% primarily as a result of seven additional investments in real estate assets between December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2020 as offset by the dispositions of three properties in 2020. However, revenues of our same-store properties decreased by 9% primarily due to the adverse effects of the Coronavirus pandemic on our retail properties and international student housing properties, as described above. To the extent the Coronavirus pandemic causes additional adverse conditions at our properties, our results in future periods could also be affected. See below for additional explanations of notable changes in same-store revenues. All amounts are in thousands, except for percentages.\nTable 23: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenues </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Same-store properties </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Domestic office investments </td> <td>$ </td> <td>15,230 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>16,538 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(1,308) </td> <td> </td> <td>(1) </td> <td>(8) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Domestic residential/living investments </td> <td>5,861 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,979 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(118) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Domestic retail investments </td> <td>17,687 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>19,780 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2,093) </td> <td> </td> <td>(2) </td> <td>(11) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>International industrial investments </td> <td>19,247 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>19,016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>231 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>International residential/living investments </td> <td>4,789 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,914 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(3,125) </td> <td> </td> <td>(3) </td> <td>(39) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total same-store properties </td> <td>$ </td> <td>62,814 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>69,227 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(6,413) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(9) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Recent acquisitions </td> <td>60,143 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16,180 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>43,963 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>272 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Disposed properties </td> <td>3,658 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18,476 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(14,818) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(80) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total revenues </td> <td>$ </td> <td>126,615 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>103,883 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>22,732 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>22 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1)The decrease is due to a decline in rental revenue from tenant vacancies and one tenant reducing their leased space. The property was 94% leased at December 31, 2019 and decreased to 88% occupancy by September 30, 2020 before increasing to 93% by December 31, 2020 as a result of new leasing activity near the end of the year. We are currently in discussions with prospective tenants to re-lease the remaining vacancy, and one existing tenant has amended its lease to expand into currently vacant space during 2021. Additionally, we have recently undertaken capital projects to improve tenant amenities to enhance our ability to lease the remaining vacant space.\n(2)The decrease is primarily due to rent concessions negotiated with our tenants due to the impact of the Coronavirus pandemic.\n(3)The decrease is primarily due to rent refunds granted to our student housing tenants resulting from school closures in response to the Coronavirus pandemic, as well as due to the closing of one of our student housing properties in August 2020 for renovation and replacement of certain building safety equipment systems.\nThe following table presents the property expenses for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, by reportable segment. Property expenses increased by 30% primarily as a result of seven additional investments in real estate between December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2020, as offset by the dispositions of three properties during the year ended December 31, 2020. See below for additional explanations of notable changes in same-store property expenses.

This decrease is driven primarily by a decrease in the tax rate applied to the property value as a result of an appeal relating to 2019 property taxes awarded in 2020.\n(3)The increase is primarily due to additional reimbursable salaries and related costs of the property manager, who is an affiliate of Hines. Many of these costs represent one-time charges and are not expected to be incurred on an ongoing basis.\n(4)The increase is primarily due to legal expenses incurred associated with litigation against a previous owner of one of our student housing properties relating to renovations begun during the third quarter of 2020 to replace certain building safety equipment systems, as well as one-time costs incurred to temporarily relocate student residents before beginning the project.\nThe following table presents revenues in excess of property expenses for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, by reportable segment. In total, revenues in excess of property expenses increased by 17%, primarily as a result of our recent acquisition activity, as offset by our recent dispositions. However, total revenues in excess of property expenses of our same-store properties decreased by 17% primarily due to adverse effects of the Coronavirus pandemic on our retail properties and our international student housing properties, as well as the closing of one of our student housing properties for renovation, as described previously. To the extent the Coronavirus pandemic causes additional adverse conditions at our properties, our results in future periods could also be affected.

FFO is a non-GAAP financial performance measure defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ( NAREIT\u201d) and is widely recognized by investors and analysts as one measure of operating performance of a real estate company. FFO excludes items such as real estate depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization, as applied in accordance with GAAP, implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time and also assumes that such assets are adequately maintained and renovated as required in order to maintain their value. Since real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market conditions such as occupancy rates, rental rates, inflation, interest rates, the business cycle, unemployment and consumer spending, it is management's view, and we believe the view of many industry investors and analysts, that the presentation of operating results for real estate companies using historical cost accounting alone is insufficient. In addition, FFO excludes gains and losses from the sale of real estate, impairment charges related to depreciable real estate assets and in-substance real estate equity investments and realized and unrealized gains and losses related to investments in real estate-related securities, which we believe provides management and investors with a helpful additional measure of the historical performance of our real estate portfolio, as it allows for comparisons, year to year, that reflect the impact on operations from trends in items such as occupancy rates, rental rates, operating costs, general and administrative expenses and interest costs. A property will be evaluated for impairment if events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable (i.e. the carrying amount exceeds the total estimated undiscounted future cash flows from the property). Undiscounted future cash flows are based on anticipated operating performance, including estimated future net rental and lease revenues, net proceeds on the sale of the property, and certain other ancillary cash flows. While impairment charges are excluded from the calculation of FFO as described above, stockholders are cautioned that we may not recover any impairment charges.\nFFO should not be construed to be more relevant or accurate than the current GAAP methodology in calculating net income or in its applicability in evaluating our operating performance. In addition, FFO should not be considered as an alternative to net income (loss) or income (loss) from continuing operations as an indication of our performance or as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities as an indication of our liquidity, but rather should be reviewed in conjunction with these and other GAAP measurements. Further, FFO is not intended to be used as a liquidity measure indicative of cash flow available to fund our cash needs, including our ability to make distributions to our stockholders. Please see the limitations listed below associated with the use of FFO:\n\u2022Prior to January 1, 2018, FFO included costs related to our acquisitions, including acquisition fees payable to our Advisor. Although these amounts reduced net income for periods prior to January 1, 2018, we generally funded such costs with proceeds from our public offerings and/or acquisition-related indebtedness and did not consider these fees and expenses in the evaluation of our operating performance. In January 2018, we adopted ASU 2017-01 which clarified the definition of a business and added guidance to assist entities with evaluating whether transactions should be accounted for as acquisitions (or disposals) of assets or businesses. We expect that most of our real estate transactions completed after that date will be accounted for using the asset acquisition guidance and, accordingly, the related acquisition-related expenses incurred will be capitalized and included in the allocated purchase price and will not be expensed. Prior to ASU 2017-01, real estate acquisitions were generally considered business combinations and the acquisition-related expenses and acquisition fees were treated as operating expenses under GAAP. Additionally, effective as of December 6, 2017, we no longer pay acquisition fees to our Advisor.\n\u2022We utilize the definition of FFO as set forth by NAREIT. Our FFO may not be comparable to amounts calculated by other REITs, if they use different approaches.\n\u2022Our business is subject to volatility in the real estate markets and general economic conditions, and adverse changes in those conditions could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and FFO. Accordingly, the predictive nature of FFO is uncertain and past performance may not be indicative of future results.\nNeither the SEC, NAREIT nor any regulatory body has passed judgment on the acceptability of the adjustments that we use to calculate FFO. In the future, the SEC, NAREIT or a regulatory body may decide to standardize the allowable adjustments across the non-listed REIT industry and we would have to adjust our calculation and characterization of FFO.\nThe following section presents our calculation of FFO attributable to common stockholders and provides additional information related to our operations for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 and the period from inception through December 31, 2020 (in thousands, except per share amounts). As we are in the capital raising and acquisition phase of our operations, FFO may not be useful in comparing operations for the periods presented below. We expect revenues and expenses to increase in future periods as we raise additional offering proceeds and use them to make additional real estate investments.\nTable 26: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Years ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td>Period from July 31, 2013 (date of inception) through December 31, 2020 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income (loss) </td> <td>$ </td> <td>101,553 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(19,548) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(879) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>45,633 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization (1)\n</td> <td>68,693 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>46,193 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>32,478 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>196,679 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain on sale of real estate </td> <td>(130,094) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(14,491) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(144,585) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Taxes related to sale of real estate </td> <td>7,773 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,773 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Gain) loss on securities (2)\n</td> <td>452 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2,317) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>401 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,463) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjustments for noncontrolling interests (3)\n</td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(29) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(22) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>117 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Funds From Operations attributable to common stockholders </td> <td>$ </td> <td>48,377 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>24,299 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>17,487 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>104,154 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Basic and diluted income (loss) per common share </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1.06 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(0.31) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(0.02) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1.29 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Funds From Operations attributable to common stockholders per common share </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0.50 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0.39 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0.43 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2.95 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Weighted average shares outstanding </td> <td>95,935 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>63,039 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>40,468 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>35,353 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nNotes to the table:\n(1)Represents the depreciation and amortization of real estate assets. Historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with GAAP implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time. Since real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market conditions, we believe that such depreciation and amortization may be of limited relevance in evaluating current operating performance and, as such, these items are excluded from our determination of FFO.\n(2)Represents the realized and unrealized gains and losses related to investments in real estate-related securities, which consist of common equities, preferred equities and debt investments of publicly traded REITs. These securities are incidental to our operations. As such, these gains and losses were excluded from our determination of FFO, as defined by NAREIT, in the current period. Additionally, certain immaterial amounts have now been included in prior periods for comparative purposes.\n(3)Includes income attributable to noncontrolling interests and all adjustments to eliminate the noncontrolling interests' share of the adjustments to convert our net loss to FFO.\nSet forth below is additional information, which may be helpful in assessing our operating results:\n\u2022For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, the Dealer Manager earned distribution and stockholder servicing fees of $5.8 million, $3.8 million and $2.0 million, respectively, which are paid by Hines Global. Total distribution and stockholder servicing fees earned by the Dealer Manager from inception through December 31, 2020 were $13.5 million.\n\u2022As of December 6, 2017, through its ownership of the special limited partner interest in the Operating Partnership, our Advisor is entitled to an annual performance participation allocation of 12.5% of the Operating Partnership's total return subject to the Company earning a 5% total return annually, after considering the effect of any losses carried forward from the prior year. The performance participation allocation accrues monthly and is payable after the completion of each calendar year. See Note 8-Related Party Transactions, for additional information regarding the performance participation allocation. We do not consider the performance participation allocation in evaluating our operating performance. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we did not incur a performance participation allocation due to the Advisor. For the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, we incurred $7.7 million and $6.0 million, respectively, in performance participation allocation fees. Total performance participation allocation fees incurred were $13.9 million from inception through December 31, 2020.\n\u2022For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, we recorded adjustments primarily related to amortization of out-of-market lease intangibles and lease incentives and straight-line rent adjustments, which resulted in a net increase to rental revenue of $3.7 million, $4.4 million and $2.3 million, respectively. Total of such adjustments from inception through December 31, 2020 were $15.4 million. Included in these adjustments is the amortization of deferred financing costs, which amounted to $2.8 million, $1.4 million and $0.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\n\u2022We recorded adjustments related to derivative instruments and foreign currencies, which increased net income by approximately $6.3 million and reduced net income by approximately $2.9 million and $93,000 for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 respectively. The total of such adjustments from inception through December 31, 2020 increased net income by $3.3 million.\nAs noted previously, our cash flows from operations have been and may continue to be insufficient to fund distributions to stockholders. We may continue to choose to use proceeds from the sales of assets, proceeds from our debt financings, proceeds from our public offerings, cash advances by our Advisor and/or cash resulting from a waiver or deferral of fees to fund distributions to our stockholders. For example, we funded 60%, 42% and 32% of total distributions for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively, with cash flows from other sources such as cash flows from investing activities, which may include proceeds from the sale of real estate and/or cash flows from financing activities, which may include offering proceeds. We have not placed a cap on the amount of our distributions that may be paid from sources other than cash flows from operations, including proceeds from our debt financings, proceeds from our public offerings, cash advances by our Advisor and cash resulting from a waiver or deferral of fees.\nFrom inception through December 31, 2020, we declared $145.2 million of distributions to our stockholders, compared to our total aggregate FFO of $104.2 million and our total aggregate net loss of $45.6 million for that period. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we declared $54.2 million of distributions to our stockholders compared to our total aggregate FFO of $48.4 million. For the years ended December 2019 and 2018, we declared $35.6 million and $22.6 million, respectively, of distributions to our stockholders compared to our total aggregate FFO of $24.3 million and $17.5 million, respectively.\nRelated Party Transactions and Agreements\nWe have entered into agreements with our Advisor, our Dealer Manager and Hines and its affiliates, whereby we pay certain fees and reimbursements to these entities during the various phases of our organization and operation. During the organization and offering stage, these include payments to our Dealer Manager for selling commissions, the dealer manager fee, distribution and stockholder servicing fees, and payments to our Advisor for reimbursement of organization and offering costs. During the acquisition and operational stages, these include payments for certain services related to the management and performance of our investments and operations provided to us by our Advisor and Hines and its affiliates pursuant to various agreements we have entered into with these entities. See Note 8 - Related Party Transactions in the Notes to the consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information concerning our related party transactions and agreements.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs of December 31, 2020 and 2019, we had no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table lists our known contractual obligations as of December 31, 2020.\nTable 27: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Payments due by Period </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Contractual Obligations </td> <td>Less Than 1 Year </td> <td> </td> <td>1-3 Years </td> <td> </td> <td>3-5 Years </td> <td> </td> <td>More Than 5 Years </td> <td> </td> <td>Total (2)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Notes payable (1)\n</td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>363,697 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>148,264 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>511,961 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Organization and Offering Costs(2)\n</td> <td>2,663 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,600 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,263 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total contractual obligations(3)\n</td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,663 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>367,297 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>148,264 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>518,224 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1)Includes all future principal outstanding as of December 31, 2020 and future interest payments.\n(2)See Note 8 - Related Party Transactions for additional information regarding the reimbursement of organization and offering costs to our Advisor.\n(3)Excluded from the table above is the $26.3 million distribution and stockholder servicing fee liability payable to our Dealer Manager with respect to certain classes of shares of our common stock as of December 31, 2020. We cannot predict the length of time over which this fee will be paid due to potential changes in the NAV per share of the Company's common stock and future redemptions of shares of our common stock. If we assumed a constant NAV per share, the distribution and stockholder servicing fee would be paid over a range of 5-6 years from the date of purchase for certain classes of shares of our common stock, and over 35 years from the date of purchase with respect to Class T shares. See Note 8 - Related Party Transactions for additional information regarding the distribution and stockholder servicing fees.\nRecent Developments and Subsequent Events\n5301 Patrick Henry Drive\nIn February 2021, we acquired 5301 Patrick Henry Drive, an industrial research and development property located in Santa Clara, California. The property consists of 129,199 square feet and is 100% leased to one tenant. The net purchase price was $68.0 million, exclusive of transaction costs and closing prorations. The seller is not affiliated with us or our affiliates.\nOfficer Appointment\nOn March 24, 2021, our board of directors appointed Mr. A. Gordon Findlay, our Chief Accounting Officer and Treasurer, to serve as our Secretary, filling the vacancy created by the resignation of the prior Secretary earlier in the month.", "summary": "- Hines Global Income Trust, Inc.

Discussions of 2018 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2019 and 2018 that are not included in this Form 10-K can be found in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Results of Operations\u201d in Part II, Item 7 of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019.\nExecutive Summary\nHines Global Income Trust, Inc. ( Hines Global\u201d) is a Maryland corporation formed to invest in a diversified portfolio of quality commercial real estate properties and other real estate investments located throughout the United States and internationally. Hines Global is sponsored by Hines Interests Limited Partnership ( Hines\u201d), a fully integrated global real estate investment and management firm that has acquired, developed, owned, operated and sold real estate for over 60 years.\nWe raise capital for our investments through public offerings of our common stock. We commenced our initial public offering of up to $2.5 billion in shares of our common stock (the Initial Offering\u201d) in August 2014 and commenced our second public offering of up to $2.5 billion in shares of common stock including $500,000,000 of shares offered under our distribution reinvestment plan (the Second Offering\u201d) in December 2017. Our Second Offering reflects a restructuring (the Restructuring\u201d) that our board of directors believes is in the best interests of our stockholders. We intend to commence our third public offering and terminate the Second Offering in the second quarter of 2021.\nAs of March 26, 2021, we had received aggregate gross offering proceeds of $1.2 billion from the sale of 122.4 million shares through our public offerings, including shares issued pursuant to our distribution reinvestment plan.\nWe intend to continue to meet our primary investment objectives by investing in a portfolio of quality commercial real estate properties and other real estate investments that relate to properties that are generally diversified by property type, geographic area, lease expirations and tenant industries. We acquired seven investments in real estate assets during the year ended December 31, 2020 for a total net purchase price of $447.1 million, using proceeds from our public offerings, proceeds from the sale of three properties during 2020 and proceeds from debt financing. As of December 31, 2020, we owned interests in twenty-two real estate investments consisting of 10.9 million square feet of leasable space that were 95% leased. See Item 2. Properties for additional information regarding our real estate investments.\nNAV History\nWe began determining a net asset value ( NAV\u201d) per share on a monthly basis in January 2018. Since that time, our NAV per share has increased from $9.78 in the beginning of 2018 to $10.24 in February 2020. As illustrated in the chart below, the NAV fell to $9.71 as of April 30, 2020 before increasing to $10.10 as of February 28, 2021. As described elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the Coronavirus pandemic has had, and is expected to continue to have, an adverse impact on global commercial activity and has contributed to significant volatility in financial markets. While it is difficult to ascertain the long term impact it will have on commercial real estate markets and our investments, it presents material uncertainty and risk with respect to the current and future performance and value of our investments. Investments in real properties and real estate-related securities have not been immune to the impact of the pandemic, which was the primary cause of the decline in our NAV during 2020. Set forth below is additional historical information regarding our NAV per share since February 29, 2016 (the date as of which our board of directors first determined an NAV per share).\n1.Please see Item 5 - Market for Registrant's Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities as well as our Current Reports on Form 8-K for additional information concerning the methodology used to determine, and the limitations of, the NAV per share.\n2.Our board of directors determined an NAV per share of $9.03 as of February 29, 2016. Prior to that time, $8.92 was considered to be the net investment value\u201d of our shares, which was equal to the offering price per share of $10.00 in effect at that time, as arbitrarily determined by our board of directors, net of the applicable selling commissions, dealer manager fees and issuer costs.\nDistribution History\nAs described elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we declare distributions monthly with the authorization of our board of directors. Set forth below is information regarding our historical gross annualized distribution rates, excluding any applicable distribution and stockholder servicing fees, since October 1, 2014 (the date our board first authorized distributions to be declared). As illustrated in the chart below, our gross annualized distribution rate has remained at $0.625 per share since January 2019. As described previously, the Coronavirus pandemic has had adverse effects on the operations of several of our real estate investments, which could affect our ability to maintain the current distribution rate.\n1.With the authorization of our board of directors, we declared distributions as of daily record dates and paid them on a monthly basis through December 31, 2017. Beginning in January 2018, we began declaring, and intend to continue to declare, distributions as of monthly record dates and pay them on a monthly basis.\n2. We have not generated and we may continue to be unable to generate sufficient cash flows from operations to fully fund distributions. Therefore, some or all of our distributions have been and may continue to be paid, and during the offering phase, are likely to be paid at least partially from other sources, such as proceeds from the sales of assets, proceeds from our debt financings, proceeds from our public offerings, cash advances by our Advisor and/or cash resulting from a waiver or deferral of fees. See - Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d for additional information concerning our distributions.\nPerformance Summary of Share Classes\nThe tables presented below disclose the total returns for each of our share classes. The total returns shown reflect the percent change in the NAV per share from the beginning of the applicable period, plus the amount of any distribution per share declared during the period. The total returns shown are calculated assuming reinvestment of distributions pursuant to our distribution reinvestment plan, are derived from unaudited financial information, and are net of all Hines Global expenses, including general and administrative expenses, transaction-related expenses, management fees, the performance participation allocation, and share class specific fees, but exclude the impact of early redemption deductions on the redemption of shares that have been outstanding for less than one year. The returns have been prepared using unaudited data and valuations of the underlying investments in our portfolio, which are estimates of fair value and form the basis for our NAV per share. Valuations based upon unaudited reports from the underlying investments may be subject to later adjustments, may not correspond to realized value and may not accurately reflect the price at which assets could be liquidated.\nThe table below discloses the total returns for the classes of shares that are available for investment:\n\n(1)The inception date for Class I, Class D, Class S and Class T Shares is December 6, 2017.\n(2)Class I Shares and Class D Shares are sold without an upfront sales load.\n(3)Class S Shares and Class T Shares listed as (No Sales Load) exclude up-front selling commissions and dealer manager fees.\n(4)Class S Shares and Class T Shares listed as (With Sales Load) reflect the returns after the maximum up-front selling commission and dealer manager fees, which total 3.5% for both share classes.\nThe table below discloses the total returns for the classes of shares that were sold in the Initial Offering, but are no longer available for investment:\n\n(1)The inception date for Class AX Shares, Class TX Shares, and Class IX Shares are October 1, 2014, September 1, 2015, and May 1, 2017, respectively.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nOur discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and contingencies as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. We evaluate our assumptions and estimates on an ongoing basis. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Additionally, application of our accounting policies involves exercising judgments regarding assumptions as to future uncertainties. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. The following is a discussion of our critical accounting policies. For a discussion of all of our significant accounting policies, see Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.\nInvestment Property and Lease Intangibles\nWhen we acquire a property, we allocate the purchase price of the acquisition based upon our assessment of the fair value of various components, including to land, building and improvements, and intangible lease assets and liabilities. Fair value determinations are subjective based on estimated cash flow projections that utilize discount and/or capitalization rates, as well as certain available market information, which may include comparable land sales, market-based rental revenues, and the replacement cost of the building, in addition to other factors. The fair value of building and improvements considers the value of the property as if it were vacant. The fair value of intangible lease assets is based on our evaluation of the specific characteristics of each lease. Factors considered include estimates of carrying costs during hypothetical expected lease-up periods, current market conditions and market rates, the customer's credit quality and costs to execute similar leases. The fair value of out-of-market leases is calculated as the present value (using a discount rate that reflects the risks associated with the leases) of the difference between the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to each in-place lease and our estimate of fair market lease rates for each corresponding in-place lease. In estimating carrying costs, we include estimates of lost rentals at market rates during the expected lease-up periods, depending on local market conditions. In estimating costs to execute similar leases, we consider customer improvements, leasing commissions and legal and other related expenses.\nReal estate assets are reviewed for impairment each reporting period if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the individual property may not be recoverable. In such an event, a comparison will be made of the current and projected operating cash flows and expected proceeds from the eventual disposition of each property on an undiscounted basis to the carrying amount of such property. If the carrying amount exceeds the undiscounted cash flows, it would be written down to the estimated fair value to reflect impairment in the value of the asset. The determination of whether investment property is impaired requires a significant amount of judgment by management and is based on the best information available to management at the time of the evaluation. No impairment charges have been recorded for any period through December 31, 2020.\nRevenue Recognition and Valuation of Receivables\nWe are required to recognize minimum rent revenues on a straight-line basis over the terms of tenant leases, including rent holidays and bargain renewal options, if any. Revenues associated with tenant reimbursements are recognized in the period in which the expenses are incurred based upon the tenant's lease provision. Leases are not uniform in dealing with such cost reimbursements and there are many variations in the computation. We make quarterly accrual adjustments, positive or negative, to tenant reimbursement revenue to adjust the recorded amounts to our best estimate of the final amounts to be billed and collected with respect to the cost reimbursements. Revenues relating to lease termination fees are recognized on a straight-line basis amortized from the time that a tenant's right to occupy the leased space is modified through the end of the revised lease term and are included in other revenue in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. To the extent our leases provide for rental increases at specified intervals, we will record a receivable for rent not yet due under the lease terms. Accordingly, our management must determine, in its judgment, to what extent the unbilled rent receivable applicable to each specific tenant is collectible. Revenue from leases where collection is deemed to be less than probable is recorded on a cash basis until collectability is determined to be probable. Further, we assess whether operating lease receivables are appropriately valued based upon an analysis of balances outstanding, historical bad debt levels and current economic trends. The uncollectible portion of the portfolio is recorded as an adjustment to rental revenues.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies for a discussion regarding recent accounting pronouncements and the potential impact, if any, on our financial statements.\nFinancial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources\nOur principal demands for funds are to make real estate investments, including investments in real estate-related securities and capital expenditures, for the payment of operating expenses and distributions, and for the payment of principal and interest on any indebtedness we incur. Generally, we expect to meet operating cash needs from our cash flows from operating activities, and we expect to fund our investments using proceeds from our public offerings, debt proceeds and proceeds from the sales of real estate investments.\nAs of December 31, 2020, our portfolio was approximately 45% leveraged (based on the most recent valuations of our real estate investments) with a weighted average interest rate of 2.08%. We expect that once we have fully invested the proceeds of our public offerings and other potential subsequent offerings, our debt financing, including our pro rata share of the debt financing of entities in which we invest, will be in the range of approximately 40% to 60% of the aggregate value of our real estate investments and other assets. Financing for acquisitions and investments may be obtained at the time an asset is acquired or an investment is made or at such later time as determined to be appropriate. In addition, debt financing may be used from time to time for property improvements, lease inducements, tenant improvements, purchase of real estate-related securities and other working capital needs, including the payment of distributions and redemptions. Our real estate-related securities portfolio may have embedded leverage, including through the use of reverse repurchase agreements and derivatives, including, but not limited to, total return swaps, securities lending arrangements and credit default swaps. Additionally, the amount of debt placed on an individual property or related to a particular investment, including our pro rata share of the amount of debt incurred by an individual entity in which we invest, may be less than 40% or more than 60% of the value of such property/investment or the value of the assets owned by such entity, depending on market conditions and other factors. Our aggregate borrowings, secured and unsecured, must be reasonable in relation to our net assets and must be reviewed by our board of directors at least quarterly. Further, our charter limits our borrowing to 300% of our net assets (which approximates 75% of the cost of our assets) unless any excess borrowing is approved by a majority of our independent directors and is disclosed to our stockholders in our next quarterly report along with justification for the excess.\nNotwithstanding the above, depending on market conditions and other factors, we may choose not to place debt on our portfolio or our assets and may choose not to borrow to finance our operations or to acquire properties. Any indebtedness we do incur will likely be subject to continuing covenants, and we will likely be required to make continuing representations and warranties about our company in connection with such debt. Moreover, some or all of our debt may be secured by some or all of our assets. If we default in the payment of interest or principal on any such debt, breach any representation or warranty in connection with any borrowing or violate any covenant in any loan document, our lender may accelerate the maturity of such debt requiring us to immediately repay all outstanding principal. If we are unable to make such payment, our lender could foreclose on our assets that are pledged as collateral to such lender. The lender could also sue us or force us into bankruptcy. Any such event would have a material adverse effect on the value of an investment in our common shares. As of December 31, 2020, the Company was out of compliance with the debt yield covenant related to its mortgage debts secured by Montrose Student Residences, Queens Court Student Residences and Glasgow West End. The debt yields of these properties were adversely affected by refunds granted in response to the effects of the Coronavirus pandemic as described in Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies. See Note 5 - Debt Financing for additional information regarding our existing debt covenants and certain non-compliance waivers that we obtained in the first quarter of 2021.\nThe Coronavirus pandemic had an adverse impact on our liquidity and capital resources for the year ended December 31, 2020, which resulted from reduced rent collections at our retail properties, rent refunds at our international student housing properties and a reduction of capital raised from the Second Offering as compared to prior periods. We are still in the early stages of navigating the actual and potential long-term impacts the pandemic will have on our business. These conditions may continue to worsen as the pandemic continues.\nWe sold three properties in the first few months of the year, which bolstered our liquidity position despite the adverse effects of the pandemic. Additionally, proceeds raised from the Second Offering improved in the second half of 2020, which, along with debt capital, provided the funding for five additional real estate investments with an aggregate purchase price of $322.2 million. We expect our ongoing capital raise, available capacity on our credit facilities and mortgage financing to provide sufficient capital to fund near-term cash needs, including the acquisitions of additional real estate investments. See Note 2-Summary of Significant Accounting Policies for additional information.\nThe discussions below provide additional details regarding our cash flows.\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\nOur real estate properties generate cash flow in the form of rental revenues, which are used to pay direct leasing costs, property-level operating expenses and interest payments. Additionally, we incur corporate level costs and expenses such as general and administrative expenses, asset management fees and the performance participation allocation.\nCash flows from operating activities for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 were $9.9 million and $17.4 million, respectively. We generally expect cash flows from operating activities to increase each year as we continue to acquire additional properties. However, some of these increases in the current year were offset by the effect of the three property sales completed during the first half of 2020, including the payment of $7.8 million of taxes related to the sale of Bishop's Square in April 2020. Additionally, the increase in cash flows from operating activities was also offset by the payment of the performance participation allocation to the Advisor, which was $1.7 million higher in 2020.\nCash Flows from Investing Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 were primarily due to the following:\n\u2022Payments of $449.1 million primarily related to the acquisitions of six real estate investments during the year ended December 31, 2020.\n\u2022Capital expenditures of approximately $11.5 million at our real estate properties.\n\u2022We received proceeds of $340.2 million from the sale of the Domain Apartments in January 2020, Goodyear Crossing II in February 2020 and Bishop's Square in April 2020. We sold the Domain Apartments for a contract sales price of $80.1 million and we acquired the Domain Apartments in January 2016 for a net purchase price of $58.1 million. We sold Goodyear Crossing II for a contract sales price of $72.0 million and we acquired Goodyear Crossing II in August 2016 for a net purchase price of $56.2 million. We sold Bishop's Square for a contract sales price of \u20ac181.6 million (approximately $198.0 million assuming a rate of $1.09 per EUR as of the date of transaction) and we acquired Bishop's Square in March 2015 for $92.0 million (approximately $103.5 million assuming a rate of $1.13 per EUR as of the acquisition date). Proceeds from these sales were used to pay off the secured debt outstanding on the three real estate investments in full as well as to fund the acquisitions of real estate investments made during the year ended December 31, 2020.\n\u2022Payments of $53.1 million to purchase real estate-related securities. We also received proceeds of $38.0 million from the sale of real estate-related securities.\n\u2022Payments of $621.0 million primarily related to the acquisitions of nine real estate investments during the year ended December 31, 2019.\n\u2022Capital expenditures of approximately $8.5 million at our real estate properties.\n\u2022Payments of $45.2 million to purchase real estate-related securities. We also received proceeds of $20.6 million from the sale of real estate-related securities.\nCash Flows from Financing Activities\nPublic Offerings\nWe commenced the Initial Offering in August 2014 and terminated our offering in December 2017, except for shares issued pursuant to our distribution reinvestment plan. We commenced our Second Offering in December 2017, but did not begin raising proceeds related to the Second Offering until 2018. We received gross proceeds of $227.8 million, $392.9 million and $44.3 million, respectively, during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively, through our public offerings, excluding proceeds from our distribution reinvestment plan. As noted previously, the decrease in proceeds raised in 2020 is primarily due to the Coronavirus pandemic. Proceeds raised in late 2020 and early 2021 were restored to pre-pandemic levels.\nWe intend to commence our third public offering and terminate the Second Offering in the second quarter of 2021. During the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, we redeemed $31.6 million, $15.5 million and $12.5 million, respectively, in shares of common stock pursuant to our share redemption program. Our share redemption program allows for aggregate redemptions of up to 20% of NAV annually, which are subject to final approval by our board of directors. These amounts represent less than 5% of NAV in each year.\nIn addition to the investing activities described previously, we use proceeds from our public offerings to make certain payments to our Advisor, our Dealer Manager and Hines and its affiliates during the various phases of our organization and operation which include, without limitation, payments to our Dealer Manager for selling commissions, dealer manager fees, distribution and stockholder servicing fees and payments to our Advisor for reimbursement of organization and offering costs. During the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, we made payments of $9.4 million, $12.4 million and $3.3 million, respectively, for selling commissions, dealer manager fees and distribution and stockholder servicing fees related to our public offerings. Selling commissions, dealer manager fees and distribution and stockholder servicing fees vary for each share class as described more fully in Note 8 - Related Party Transactions. The change in these fees is generally attributable to the amount of offering proceeds raised, but is also impacted by variations in the amount of each share class sold during the year.\nBeginning December 6, 2017, the Advisor agreed to advance all of our unpaid organization and offering costs, consisting of issuer costs and certain underwriting costs (but excluding selling commissions, dealer manager fees and distribution and stockholder servicing fees) related to our public offerings, through December 31, 2018. In January 2019, we began reimbursing the Advisor in ratable amounts over 60 months for all such advanced expenses, as well as any organization and offering costs incurred subsequent to December 31, 2018, to the extent cumulative organization and offering costs paid by us do not exceed an amount equal to 2.5% of gross offering proceeds from our public offerings. The total reimbursement related to organization and offering costs, selling commissions, dealer manager fees and distribution and stockholder servicing fees may not exceed 15.0% of gross proceeds from our public offerings. During the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we reimbursed the Advisor $6.0 million and $5.7 million for organization and offering costs, respectively.\nDistributions\nWith the authorization of our board of directors, we declared distributions monthly from January 2018 through December 31, 2018 at a gross distribution rate of $0.05083 per month ($0.61 annualized), and from January 2019 through March 31, 2021 at a gross distribution rate of $0.05208 per month ($0.625 annualized) for each share class, less any applicable distribution and stockholder servicing fees. Distributions are made on all classes of the Company's common stock at the same time. All distributions were or will be paid in cash or reinvested in shares of the Company's common stock for those participating in the Company's distribution reinvestment plan and have been or will be paid or issued, respectively, on the first business day following the completion of the month to which they relate. Distributions reinvested pursuant to our distribution reinvestment plan were or will be reinvested in shares of the same class as the shares on which the distributions are made. Some or all of the cash distributions may be paid from sources other than cash flows from operations, as described below.\nDistributions paid to stockholders during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018 were $53.1 million, $33.7 million and $22.5 million, respectively, including those reinvested in shares of our common stock pursuant to our distribution reinvestment plan. We have not generated and we may continue to be unable to generate sufficient cash flows from operations to fully fund distributions paid. Therefore, some or all of our distributions have been and may continue to be paid and during the offering phase, are likely to be paid at least partially from other sources, such as proceeds from the sales of assets, proceeds from our debt financings, proceeds from our public offerings, cash advances by our Advisor and/or cash resulting from a waiver or deferral of fees. We have not placed a cap on the amount of distributions that may be paid from any of these sources. For example, we funded 60%, 42% and 32% of total distributions for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018,\nrespectively, with cash flows from other sources such as cash flows from investing activities, which may include proceeds from the sale of real estate and/or cash flows from financing activities, which may include offering proceeds.\nThe following table outlines our total distributions declared to stockholders for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, including the breakout between the distributions declared in cash and those reinvested pursuant to our distribution reinvestment plan (in thousands).\n\nDebt Financings\nAs mentioned previously, our portfolio was 45% leveraged as of December 31, 2020 (based on the most recent valuations of our real estate investments) with a weighted average interest rate of 2.08%. Below is additional information regarding our loan activity for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018. See Note 5 - Debt Financing for additional information regarding our outstanding debt.\n\u2022We received proceeds from notes payable of $446.5 million, which included $259.0 million in draws on our revolving credit facility with JPMorgan as well as $187.5 million in permanent mortgage financing. Use of these proceeds was primarily to provide cash for the acquisitions of real estate investments during the year ended December 31, 2020.\n\u2022We made payments on notes payable of $382.6 million, which included $223.0 million in payments on our revolving credit facility with JPMorgan as well as principal payments of $159.6 million relating to our permanent mortgage financing. Included in payments made on permanent mortgage financing is $123.1 million in payments of outstanding principal remaining on our three properties sold during 2020, $29.9 million in payments of principal in conjunction with term modification of facilities secured by two of our properties, as well as other principal payments made on our permanent mortgage financing. Our Revolving Credit Facility with JPMorgan had an outstanding balance of $240.0 million as of December 31, 2020.\n\u2022We made payments of $1.4 million in financing costs primarily related to our mortgage loans.\n\u2022We made payments of $75.0 million under the Hines Credit Facility to pay off our outstanding balance in April 2020. We have not had any amounts outstanding under this facility since that time.\n\u2022We received proceeds from notes payable of $327.1 million, which included $131.5 million in draws on our revolving credit facility with JPMorgan as well as $195.6 million in permanent mortgage financing. These proceeds were used primarily to provide cash for the acquisition of real estate investments during the year ended December 31, 2019.\n\u2022We made payments on notes payable of $31.0 million, which included $27.5 million in payments on our revolving credit facility with JPMorgan as well as principal payments of $3.5 million relating to our permanent mortgage financing. Our Revolving Credit Facility with JPMorgan had an outstanding balance of $104.0 million as of December 31, 2019.\n\u2022We made payments of $3.7 million in financing costs primarily related to our mortgage loans.\n\u2022We borrowed $134.0 million under the Hines Credit Facility primarily to provide cash for the acquisitions of real estate investments during the year ended December 31, 2019, and made payments of $114.0 million on this facility. We had an outstanding balance of $75.0 million under this facility as of December 31, 2019.\nResults of Operations\nYear ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019\nThe table below includes information regarding changes in our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, including explanations for significant changes and any significant or unusual activity. As described more completely below, most amounts increased in 2020 compared to 2019 as a result of significant additional capital raised and invested in real estate, as offset by recent property dispositions. However, the Coronavirus pandemic had adverse effects on our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2020, which offset some of the increases resulting from our acquisition activity. These effects were primarily due to rent concessions at our retail properties and rent refunds at our international student housing properties. Our other segments were not materially affected. To the extent the Coronavirus pandemic causes additional adverse conditions at our properties, our results in future periods could also be affected. All amounts are in thousands, except for percentages:\n\n* Not a meaningful percentage\nTotal revenues: The increase in total revenue is primarily due to the additional real estate investments acquired during 2020, offset by dispositions during the same period. We acquired seven and disposed of three real estate investments during 2020 and had a portfolio of twenty-two real estate investments as of December 31, 2020 that contained 10.9 million leasable square feet, of which 95% was leased. We also acquired nine real estate investments during 2019 which also contributed to the increases in these amounts since the properties were owned for the entire year in 2020. Despite this increase, total revenues of our same-store properties decreased $6.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2020. Please refer to our Same Store Analysis\u201d below for additional discussion on the results of operations of our portfolio.\nProperty operating expenses: The increase in property operating expenses is primarily due to our net acquisition activity during late 2019 and throughout 2020. Property operating expenses of our same-store properties increased $0.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2020. Please refer to our Same Store Analysis\u201d below for additional discussion on the results of operations of our portfolio.\nReal property taxes: The increase in real property taxes is primarily due to our net acquisition activity during late 2019 and throughout 2020. Real property taxes of our same-store properties decreased $0.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2020. Please refer to our Same Store Analysis\u201d below for additional discussion on the results of operations of our portfolio.\nProperty management fees: The increase in property management fees is primarily due to our net acquisition activity during late 2019 and throughout 2020. Property management fees of our same-store properties increased $0.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2020. Please refer to our Same Store Analysis\u201d below for additional discussion on the results of operations of our portfolio.\nDepreciation and amortization: The increase in depreciation and amortization expense is primarily due to the additional real estate investments acquired during 2019 and 2020, offset by dispositions during the same period, as previously described.\nAsset management fees: Asset management fees are charged based on the aggregate valuation of our real estate investments, as most recently determined in connection with the determination of our NAV. The increase in these fees is primarily due to the additional real estate investments made during 2019 and 2020, offset by dispositions during the same period, as previously described.\nPerformance participation allocation: The decrease in performance participation allocation is a result of the fee not being earned by the Advisor during the year ended December 31, 2020, due to a decline in our NAV per share during the year. Please see Item 7 - Management's Discussion and Analysis-NAV and Distribution for additional information concerning the change in NAV per share during the year ended December 31, 2020.\nGeneral and administrative expenses: General and administrative expenses increased primarily due to increased legal costs and shareholder costs. We generally expect our general and administrative expenses to continue to increase as we continue raising capital from our public offerings.\nGain (loss) on derivative instruments: We enter into interest rate hedging instruments in order to limit our exposure against the variability of future interest rates on our variable interest rate borrowings as well as foreign currency forward contracts as economic hedges against the variability of foreign exchange rates. During the year ended December 31, 2020, such gains were primarily related to the position of our foreign currency forward contracts.\nGain (loss) on investments in real estate-related securities: We hold investments in real estate-related securities, which consist of common equities, preferred equities and debt investments of publicly traded REITs. These amounts include realized gains (losses) related to securities sold during the year and unrealized gains (losses) based on values determined on a recurring basis. The net loss on securities during the year ended December 31, 2020 is due to realized losses on the portfolio incurred primarily as a result of market effects during the first quarter of the year related to the Coronavirus pandemic, offset by unrealized gains following the market recovery from the lows earlier in the year. For information about the valuation of our investments in real-estate related securities, see Note 9-Fair Value Measurements in the notes to the accompanying financial statements.\nGain on sale of real estate: We acquired the Domain Apartments in January 2016 for a contract purchase price of $58.1 million and we sold the Domain Apartments for a contract sales price of $80.1 million on January 7, 2020, resulting in the recognition of a gain of $29.5 million related to this sale. Additionally, we acquired Goodyear Crossing II in August 2016 for a contract purchase price of $56.2 million and we sold Goodyear Crossing II for a contract sales price of $72.0 million on February 14, 2020, resulting in a recognition of a gain of $20.2 million related to this sale. We acquired Bishop's Square in March 2015 for \u20ac92.0 million (approximately $103.5 million assuming a rate of $1.13 per EUR as of the acquisition date) and we sold Bishop's Square in April 2020 for \u20ac181.6 million (approximately $198.0 million assuming a rate of $1.09 per EUR as of the date of transaction). We recognized a gain on sale of this asset of $80.4 million, excluding taxes related to the sale, which are described below. We had no property dispositions during the year ended December 31, 2019.\nForeign currency gains (losses): Foreign currency gains (losses) primarily reflects the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on transactions that were denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the related entity. During the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, these losses were primarily related to the effect of remeasuring cash held in foreign currencies into their related functional currencies.\nInterest expense: Interest expense increased due to the net increase in our principal amount of indebtedness outstanding during the period resulting from additional real estate investments acquired in 2019 and 2020, as offset by the effects of the properties sold during 2020.\nInterest and other income: Primarily relates to interest and dividend income associated with our investments in real estate-related securities. The increase in interest and dividend income earned during the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to 2019 is due to additional investments in real estate-related securities made during the year.\nBenefit (provision) for income taxes: Benefit for income taxes increased nearly $3.4 million primarily as a result of recent changes in tax laws related to our international student housing properties and their effect on book / tax timing differences at these properties.\nProvision for income taxes related to sale of real estate: The increase during the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to 2019 relates to the income tax incurred as a result of the sale of Bishop's Square during April 2020, as described above.\nSame-Store Analysis\nWe evaluate our consolidated results of operations on a same-store basis, which allows us to analyze our property operating results excluding the effects of acquisitions and dispositions during the periods under comparison. Properties in our portfolio are considered same-store if they were owned for the full periods presented. Same-store properties for the year ended December 31, 2020 includes seven properties. The tables below include additional information regarding the operating results of our same-store properties for the current period as compared to the same period in the prior year.\nThe following table presents the same-store revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, by reportable segment. Total revenues increased by 22% primarily as a result of seven additional investments in real estate assets between December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2020 as offset by the dispositions of three properties in 2020. However, revenues of our same-store properties decreased by 9% primarily due to the adverse effects of the Coronavirus pandemic on our retail properties and international student housing properties, as described above. To the extent the Coronavirus pandemic causes additional adverse conditions at our properties, our results in future periods could also be affected. See below for additional explanations of notable changes in same-store revenues. All amounts are in thousands, except for percentages.\n\n(1)The decrease is due to a decline in rental revenue from tenant vacancies and one tenant reducing their leased space. The property was 94% leased at December 31, 2019 and decreased to 88% occupancy by September 30, 2020 before increasing to 93% by December 31, 2020 as a result of new leasing activity near the end of the year. We are currently in discussions with prospective tenants to re-lease the remaining vacancy, and one existing tenant has amended its lease to expand into currently vacant space during 2021. Additionally, we have recently undertaken capital projects to improve tenant amenities to enhance our ability to lease the remaining vacant space.\n(2)The decrease is primarily due to rent concessions negotiated with our tenants due to the impact of the Coronavirus pandemic.\n(3)The decrease is primarily due to rent refunds granted to our student housing tenants resulting from school closures in response to the Coronavirus pandemic, as well as due to the closing of one of our student housing properties in August 2020 for renovation and replacement of certain building safety equipment systems.\nThe following table presents the property expenses for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, by reportable segment. Property expenses increased by 30% primarily as a result of seven additional investments in real estate between December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2020, as offset by the dispositions of three properties during the year ended December 31, 2020. See below for additional explanations of notable changes in same-store property expenses. All amounts are in thousands, except for percentages.\n\n(1)Property expenses include property operating expenses, real property taxes and property management fees.\n(2)The decrease is primarily due to real property taxes at one of our retail properties compared to the prior year. This decrease is driven primarily by a decrease in the tax rate applied to the property value as a result of an appeal relating to 2019 property taxes awarded in 2020.\n(3)The increase is primarily due to additional reimbursable salaries and related costs of the property manager, who is an affiliate of Hines. Many of these costs represent one-time charges and are not expected to be incurred on an ongoing basis.\n(4)The increase is primarily due to legal expenses incurred associated with litigation against a previous owner of one of our student housing properties relating to renovations begun during the third quarter of 2020 to replace certain building safety equipment systems, as well as one-time costs incurred to temporarily relocate student residents before beginning the project.\nThe following table presents revenues in excess of property expenses for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, by reportable segment. In total, revenues in excess of property expenses increased by 17%, primarily as a result of our recent acquisition activity, as offset by our recent dispositions. However, total revenues in excess of property expenses of our same-store properties decreased by 17% primarily due to adverse effects of the Coronavirus pandemic on our retail properties and our international student housing properties, as well as the closing of one of our student housing properties for renovation, as described previously. To the extent the Coronavirus pandemic causes additional adverse conditions at our properties, our results in future periods could also be affected. All amounts below are in thousands, except for percentages:\n\n(1)Revenues in excess of property expenses include total revenues less property operating expenses, real property taxes and property management fees.\n(2)Please refer to the tables above for explanations regarding these changes.\nFunds from Operations\nWe believe funds from operations ( FFO\u201d) is a meaningful supplemental non-GAAP operating metric. FFO is a non-GAAP financial performance measure defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ( NAREIT\u201d) and is widely recognized by investors and analysts as one measure of operating performance of a real estate company. FFO excludes items such as real estate depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization, as applied in accordance with GAAP, implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time and also assumes that such assets are adequately maintained and renovated as required in order to maintain their value. Since real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market conditions such as occupancy rates, rental rates, inflation, interest rates, the business cycle, unemployment and consumer spending, it is management's view, and we believe the view of many industry", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis together with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The following information contains forward-looking statements, which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. Please see Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d above for a description of these risks and uncertainties.\nThis section of this Form 10-K generally discusses 2020 and 2019 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2020 and 2019. Discussions of 2018 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2019 and 2018 that are not included in this Form 10-K can be found in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Results of Operations\u201d in Part II, Item 7 of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019.\nExecutive Summary\nHines Global Income Trust, Inc. ( Hines Global\u201d) is a Maryland corporation formed to invest in a diversified portfolio of quality commercial real estate properties and other real estate investments located throughout the United States and internationally. Hines Global is sponsored by Hines Interests Limited Partnership ( Hines\u201d), a fully integrated global real estate investment and management firm that has acquired, developed, owned, operated and sold real estate for over 60 years.\nWe raise capital for our investments through public offerings of our common stock. We commenced our initial public offering of up to $2.5 billion in shares of our common stock (the Initial Offering\u201d) in August 2014 and commenced our second public offering of up to $2.5 billion in shares of common stock including $500,000,000 of shares offered under our distribution reinvestment plan (the Second Offering\u201d) in December 2017. Our Second Offering reflects a restructuring (the Restructuring\u201d) that our board of directors believes is in the best interests of our stockholders. We intend to commence our third public offering and terminate the Second Offering in the second quarter of 2021.\nAs of March 26, 2021, we had received aggregate gross offering proceeds of $1.2 billion from the sale of 122.4 million shares through our public offerings, including shares issued pursuant to our distribution reinvestment plan.\nWe intend to continue to meet our primary investment objectives by investing in a portfolio of quality commercial real estate properties and other real estate investments that relate to properties that are generally diversified by property type, geographic area, lease expirations and tenant industries. We acquired seven investments in real estate assets during the year ended December 31, 2020 for a total net purchase price of $447.1 million, using proceeds from our public offerings, proceeds from the sale of three properties during 2020 and proceeds from debt financing. As of December 31, 2020, we owned interests in twenty-two real estate investments consisting of 10.9 million square feet of leasable space that were 95% leased. See Item 2. Properties for additional information regarding our real estate investments.\nNAV History\nWe began determining a net asset value ( NAV\u201d) per share on a monthly basis in January 2018. Since that time, our NAV per share has increased from $9.78 in the beginning of 2018 to $10.24 in February 2020. As illustrated in the chart below, the NAV fell to $9.71 as of April 30, 2020 before increasing to $10.10 as of February 28, 2021. As described elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the Coronavirus pandemic has had, and is expected to continue to have, an adverse impact on global commercial activity and has contributed to significant volatility in financial markets. While it is difficult to ascertain the long term impact it will have on commercial real estate markets and our investments, it presents material uncertainty and risk with respect to the current and future performance and value of our investments. Investments in real properties and real estate-related securities have not been immune to the impact of the pandemic, which was the primary cause of the decline in our NAV during 2020. Set forth below is additional historical information regarding our NAV per share since February 29, 2016 (the date as of which our board of directors first determined an NAV per share).\n1.Please see Item 5 - Market for Registrant's Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities as well as our Current Reports on Form 8-K for additional information concerning the methodology used to determine, and the limitations of, the NAV per share.\n2.Our board of directors determined an NAV per share of $9.03 as of February 29, 2016. Prior to that time, $8.92 was considered to be the net investment value\u201d of our shares, which was equal to the offering price per share of $10.00 in effect at that time, as arbitrarily determined by our board of directors, net of the applicable selling commissions, dealer manager fees and issuer costs.\nDistribution History\nAs described elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we declare distributions monthly with the authorization of our board of directors. Set forth below is information regarding our historical gross annualized distribution rates, excluding any applicable distribution and stockholder servicing fees, since October 1, 2014 (the date our board first authorized distributions to be declared). As illustrated in the chart below, our gross annualized distribution rate has remained at $0.625 per share since January 2019. As described previously, the Coronavirus pandemic has had adverse effects on the operations of several of our real estate investments, which could affect our ability to maintain the current distribution rate.\n1.With the authorization of our board of directors, we declared distributions as of daily record dates and paid them on a monthly basis through December 31, 2017. Beginning in January 2018, we began declaring, and intend to continue to declare, distributions as of monthly record dates and pay them on a monthly basis.\n2. We have not generated and we may continue to be unable to generate sufficient cash flows from operations to fully fund distributions. Therefore, some or all of our distributions have been and may continue to be paid, and during the offering phase, are likely to be paid at least partially from other sources, such as proceeds from the sales of assets, proceeds from our debt financings, proceeds from our public offerings, cash advances by our Advisor and/or cash resulting from a waiver or deferral of fees. See - Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d for additional information concerning our distributions.\nPerformance Summary of Share Classes\nThe tables presented below disclose the total returns for each of our share classes. The total returns shown reflect the percent change in the NAV per share from the beginning of the applicable period, plus the amount of any distribution per share declared during the period. The total returns shown are calculated assuming reinvestment of distributions pursuant to our distribution reinvestment plan, are derived from unaudited financial information, and are net of all Hines Global expenses, including general and administrative expenses, transaction-related expenses, management fees, the performance participation allocation, and share class specific fees, but exclude the impact of early redemption deductions on the redemption of shares that have been outstanding for less than one year. The returns have been prepared using unaudited data and valuations of the underlying investments in our portfolio, which are estimates of fair value and form the basis for our NAV per share. Valuations based upon unaudited reports from the underlying investments may be subject to later adjustments, may not correspond to realized value and may not accurately reflect the price at which assets could be liquidated.\nThe table below discloses the total returns for the classes of shares that are available for investment:\nTable 19: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>As of February 28, 2021 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Shares Class (1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>1-Year </td> <td> </td> <td>3-Year </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>ITD </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Class I Shares (2)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>5.08 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>7.55 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8.02 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Class D Shares (2)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>4.82 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>7.28 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7.74 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Class S Shares (No Sales Load) (3)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>4.04 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>6.48 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6.92 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Class S Shares (With Sales Load) (4)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>0.41 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>5.24 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.70 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Class T Shares (No Sales Load) (3)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>4.04 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>6.48 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6.92 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Class T Shares (With Sales Load) (4)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>0.41 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>5.24 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.70 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1)The inception date for Class I, Class D, Class S and Class T Shares is December 6, 2017.\n(2)Class I Shares and Class D Shares are sold without an upfront sales load.\n(3)Class S Shares and Class T Shares listed as (No Sales Load) exclude up-front selling commissions and dealer manager fees.\n(4)Class S Shares and Class T Shares listed as (With Sales Load) reflect the returns after the maximum up-front selling commission and dealer manager fees, which total 3.5% for both share classes.\nThe table below discloses the total returns for the classes of shares that were sold in the Initial Offering, but are no longer available for investment:\nTable 20: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>As of February 28, 2021 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Shares Class (1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>1-Year </td> <td> </td> <td>3-Year </td> <td> </td> <td>5-Year </td> <td> </td> <td>ITD </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Class AX Shares (No Sales Load) </td> <td> </td> <td>5.08 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>7.55 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>9.09 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>8.56 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Class AX Shares (With Sales Load) </td> <td> </td> <td>N/A </td> <td> </td> <td>N/A </td> <td> </td> <td>6.62 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>6.62 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Class TX Shares (No Sales Load) </td> <td> </td> <td>4.04 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>6.48 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>8.04 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>7.92 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Class TX Shares (With Sales Load) </td> <td> </td> <td>N/A </td> <td> </td> <td>N/A </td> <td> </td> <td>6.80 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>6.78 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Class IX Shares (No Sales Load) </td> <td> </td> <td>4.82 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>7.28 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>N/A </td> <td> </td> <td>7.59 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Class IX Shares (With Sales Load) </td> <td> </td> <td>N/A </td> <td> </td> <td>N/A </td> <td> </td> <td>N/A </td> <td> </td> <td>7.35 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1)The inception date for Class AX Shares, Class TX Shares, and Class IX Shares are October 1, 2014, September 1, 2015, and May 1, 2017, respectively.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nOur discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and contingencies as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. We evaluate our assumptions and estimates on an ongoing basis. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Additionally, application of our accounting policies involves exercising judgments regarding assumptions as to future uncertainties. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. The following is a discussion of our critical accounting policies. For a discussion of all of our significant accounting policies, see Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.\nInvestment Property and Lease Intangibles\nWhen we acquire a property, we allocate the purchase price of the acquisition based upon our assessment of the fair value of various components, including to land, building and improvements, and intangible lease assets and liabilities. Fair value determinations are subjective based on estimated cash flow projections that utilize discount and/or capitalization rates, as well as certain available market information, which may include comparable land sales, market-based rental revenues, and the replacement cost of the building, in addition to other factors. The fair value of building and improvements considers the value of the property as if it were vacant. The fair value of intangible lease assets is based on our evaluation of the specific characteristics of each lease. Factors considered include estimates of carrying costs during hypothetical expected lease-up periods, current market conditions and market rates, the customer's credit quality and costs to execute similar leases. The fair value of out-of-market leases is calculated as the present value (using a discount rate that reflects the risks associated with the leases) of the difference between the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to each in-place lease and our estimate of fair market lease rates for each corresponding in-place lease. In estimating carrying costs, we include estimates of lost rentals at market rates during the expected lease-up periods, depending on local market conditions. In estimating costs to execute similar leases, we consider customer improvements, leasing commissions and legal and other related expenses.\nReal estate assets are reviewed for impairment each reporting period if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the individual property may not be recoverable. In such an event, a comparison will be made of the current and projected operating cash flows and expected proceeds from the eventual disposition of each property on an undiscounted basis to the carrying amount of such property. If the carrying amount exceeds the undiscounted cash flows, it would be written down to the estimated fair value to reflect impairment in the value of the asset. The determination of whether investment property is impaired requires a significant amount of judgment by management and is based on the best information available to management at the time of the evaluation. No impairment charges have been recorded for any period through December 31, 2020.\nRevenue Recognition and Valuation of Receivables\nWe are required to recognize minimum rent revenues on a straight-line basis over the terms of tenant leases, including rent holidays and bargain renewal options, if any. Revenues associated with tenant reimbursements are recognized in the period in which the expenses are incurred based upon the tenant's lease provision. Leases are not uniform in dealing with such cost reimbursements and there are many variations in the computation. We make quarterly accrual adjustments, positive or negative, to tenant reimbursement revenue to adjust the recorded amounts to our best estimate of the final amounts to be billed and collected with respect to the cost reimbursements. Revenues relating to lease termination fees are recognized on a straight-line basis amortized from the time that a tenant's right to occupy the leased space is modified through the end of the revised lease term and are included in other revenue in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. To the extent our leases provide for rental increases at specified intervals, we will record a receivable for rent not yet due under the lease terms. Accordingly, our management must determine, in its judgment, to what extent the unbilled rent receivable applicable to each specific tenant is collectible. Revenue from leases where collection is deemed to be less than probable is recorded on a cash basis until collectability is determined to be probable. Further, we assess whether operating lease receivables are appropriately valued based upon an analysis of balances outstanding, historical bad debt levels and current economic trends. The uncollectible portion of the portfolio is recorded as an adjustment to rental revenues.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies for a discussion regarding recent accounting pronouncements and the potential impact, if any, on our financial statements.\nFinancial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources\nOur principal demands for funds are to make real estate investments, including investments in real estate-related securities and capital expenditures, for the payment of operating expenses and distributions, and for the payment of principal and interest on any indebtedness we incur. Generally, we expect to meet operating cash needs from our cash flows from operating activities, and we expect to fund our investments using proceeds from our public offerings, debt proceeds and proceeds from the sales of real estate investments.\nAs of December 31, 2020, our portfolio was approximately 45% leveraged (based on the most recent valuations of our real estate investments) with a weighted average interest rate of 2.08%. We expect that once we have fully invested the proceeds of our public offerings and other potential subsequent offerings, our debt financing, including our pro rata share of the debt financing of entities in which we invest, will be in the range of approximately 40% to 60% of the aggregate value of our real estate investments and other assets. Financing for acquisitions and investments may be obtained at the time an asset is acquired or an investment is made or at such later time as determined to be appropriate. In addition, debt financing may be used from time to time for property improvements, lease inducements, tenant improvements, purchase of real estate-related securities and other working capital needs, including the payment of distributions and redemptions. Our real estate-related securities portfolio may have embedded leverage, including through the use of reverse repurchase agreements and derivatives, including, but not limited to, total return swaps, securities lending arrangements and credit default swaps. Additionally, the amount of debt placed on an individual property or related to a particular investment, including our pro rata share of the amount of debt incurred by an individual entity in which we invest, may be less than 40% or more than 60% of the value of such property/investment or the value of the assets owned by such entity, depending on market conditions and other factors. Our aggregate borrowings, secured and unsecured, must be reasonable in relation to our net assets and must be reviewed by our board of directors at least quarterly. Further, our charter limits our borrowing to 300% of our net assets (which approximates 75% of the cost of our assets) unless any excess borrowing is approved by a majority of our independent directors and is disclosed to our stockholders in our next quarterly report along with justification for the excess.\nNotwithstanding the above, depending on market conditions and other factors, we may choose not to place debt on our portfolio or our assets and may choose not to borrow to finance our operations or to acquire properties. Any indebtedness we do incur will likely be subject to continuing covenants, and we will likely be required to make continuing representations and warranties about our company in connection with such debt. Moreover, some or all of our debt may be secured by some or all of our assets. If we default in the payment of interest or principal on any such debt, breach any representation or warranty in connection with any borrowing or violate any covenant in any loan document, our lender may accelerate the maturity of such debt requiring us to immediately repay all outstanding principal. If we are unable to make such payment, our lender could foreclose on our assets that are pledged as collateral to such lender. The lender could also sue us or force us into bankruptcy. Any such event would have a material adverse effect on the value of an investment in our common shares. As of December 31, 2020, the Company was out of compliance with the debt yield covenant related to its mortgage debts secured by Montrose Student Residences, Queens Court Student Residences and Glasgow West End. The debt yields of these properties were adversely affected by refunds granted in response to the effects of the Coronavirus pandemic as described in Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies. See Note 5 - Debt Financing for additional information regarding our existing debt covenants and certain non-compliance waivers that we obtained in the first quarter of 2021.\nThe Coronavirus pandemic had an adverse impact on our liquidity and capital resources for the year ended December 31, 2020, which resulted from reduced rent collections at our retail properties, rent refunds at our international student housing properties and a reduction of capital raised from the Second Offering as compared to prior periods. We are still in the early stages of navigating the actual and potential long-term impacts the pandemic will have on our business. These conditions may continue to worsen as the pandemic continues.\nWe sold three properties in the first few months of the year, which bolstered our liquidity position despite the adverse effects of the pandemic. Additionally, proceeds raised from the Second Offering improved in the second half of 2020, which, along with debt capital, provided the funding for five additional real estate investments with an aggregate purchase price of $322.2 million. We expect our ongoing capital raise, available capacity on our credit facilities and mortgage financing to provide sufficient capital to fund near-term cash needs, including the acquisitions of additional real estate investments. See Note 2-Summary of Significant Accounting Policies for additional information.\nThe discussions below provide additional details regarding our cash flows.\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\nOur real estate properties generate cash flow in the form of rental revenues, which are used to pay direct leasing costs, property-level operating expenses and interest payments. Additionally, we incur corporate level costs and expenses such as general and administrative expenses, asset management fees and the performance participation allocation.\nCash flows from operating activities for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 were $9.9 million and $17.4 million, respectively. We generally expect cash flows from operating activities to increase each year as we continue to acquire additional properties. However, some of these increases in the current year were offset by the effect of the three property sales completed during the first half of 2020, including the payment of $7.8 million of taxes related to the sale of Bishop's Square in April 2020. Additionally, the increase in cash flows from operating activities was also offset by the payment of the performance participation allocation to the Advisor, which was $1.7 million higher in 2020.\nCash Flows from Investing Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 were primarily due to the following:\n\u2022Payments of $449.1 million primarily related to the acquisitions of six real estate investments during the year ended December 31, 2020.\n\u2022Capital expenditures of approximately $11.5 million at our real estate properties.\n\u2022We received proceeds of $340.2 million from the sale of the Domain Apartments in January 2020, Goodyear Crossing II in February 2020 and Bishop's Square in April 2020. We sold the Domain Apartments for a contract sales price of $80.1 million and we acquired the Domain Apartments in January 2016 for a net purchase price of $58.1 million. We sold Goodyear Crossing II for a contract sales price of $72.0 million and we acquired Goodyear Crossing II in August 2016 for a net purchase price of $56.2 million. We sold Bishop's Square for a contract sales price of \u20ac181.6 million (approximately $198.0 million assuming a rate of $1.09 per EUR as of the date of transaction) and we acquired Bishop's Square in March 2015 for $92.0 million (approximately $103.5 million assuming a rate of $1.13 per EUR as of the acquisition date). Proceeds from these sales were used to pay off the secured debt outstanding on the three real estate investments in full as well as to fund the acquisitions of real estate investments made during the year ended December 31, 2020.\n\u2022Payments of $53.1 million to purchase real estate-related securities. We also received proceeds of $38.0 million from the sale of real estate-related securities.\n\u2022Payments of $621.0 million primarily related to the acquisitions of nine real estate investments during the year ended December 31, 2019.\n\u2022Capital expenditures of approximately $8.5 million at our real estate properties.\n\u2022Payments of $45.2 million to purchase real estate-related securities. We also received proceeds of $20.6 million from the sale of real estate-related securities.\nCash Flows from Financing Activities\nPublic Offerings\nWe commenced the Initial Offering in August 2014 and terminated our offering in December 2017, except for shares issued pursuant to our distribution reinvestment plan. We commenced our Second Offering in December 2017, but did not begin raising proceeds related to the Second Offering until 2018. We received gross proceeds of $227.8 million, $392.9 million and $44.3 million, respectively, during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively, through our public offerings, excluding proceeds from our distribution reinvestment plan. As noted previously, the decrease in proceeds raised in 2020 is primarily due to the Coronavirus pandemic. Proceeds raised in late 2020 and early 2021 were restored to pre-pandemic levels.\nWe intend to commence our third public offering and terminate the Second Offering in the second quarter of 2021. During the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, we redeemed $31.6 million, $15.5 million and $12.5 million, respectively, in shares of common stock pursuant to our share redemption program. Our share redemption program allows for aggregate redemptions of up to 20% of NAV annually, which are subject to final approval by our board of directors. These amounts represent less than 5% of NAV in each year.\nIn addition to the investing activities described previously, we use proceeds from our public offerings to make certain payments to our Advisor, our Dealer Manager and Hines and its affiliates during the various phases of our organization and operation which include, without limitation, payments to our Dealer Manager for selling commissions, dealer manager fees, distribution and stockholder servicing fees and payments to our Advisor for reimbursement of organization and offering costs. During the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, we made payments of $9.4 million, $12.4 million and $3.3 million, respectively, for selling commissions, dealer manager fees and distribution and stockholder servicing fees related to our public offerings. Selling commissions, dealer manager fees and distribution and stockholder servicing fees vary for each share class as described more fully in Note 8 - Related Party Transactions. The change in these fees is generally attributable to the amount of offering proceeds raised, but is also impacted by variations in the amount of each share class sold during the year.\nBeginning December 6, 2017, the Advisor agreed to advance all of our unpaid organization and offering costs, consisting of issuer costs and certain underwriting costs (but excluding selling commissions, dealer manager fees and distribution and stockholder servicing fees) related to our public offerings, through December 31, 2018. In January 2019, we began reimbursing the Advisor in ratable amounts over 60 months for all such advanced expenses, as well as any organization and offering costs incurred subsequent to December 31, 2018, to the extent cumulative organization and offering costs paid by us do not exceed an amount equal to 2.5% of gross offering proceeds from our public offerings. The total reimbursement related to organization and offering costs, selling commissions, dealer manager fees and distribution and stockholder servicing fees may not exceed 15.0% of gross proceeds from our public offerings. During the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we reimbursed the Advisor $6.0 million and $5.7 million for organization and offering costs, respectively.\nDistributions\nWith the authorization of our board of directors, we declared distributions monthly from January 2018 through December 31, 2018 at a gross distribution rate of $0.05083 per month ($0.61 annualized), and from January 2019 through March 31, 2021 at a gross distribution rate of $0.05208 per month ($0.625 annualized) for each share class, less any applicable distribution and stockholder servicing fees. Distributions are made on all classes of the Company's common stock at the same time. All distributions were or will be paid in cash or reinvested in shares of the Company's common stock for those participating in the Company's distribution reinvestment plan and have been or will be paid or issued, respectively, on the first business day following the completion of the month to which they relate. Distributions reinvested pursuant to our distribution reinvestment plan were or will be reinvested in shares of the same class as the shares on which the distributions are made. Some or all of the cash distributions may be paid from sources other than cash flows from operations, as described below.\nDistributions paid to stockholders during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018 were $53.1 million, $33.7 million and $22.5 million, respectively, including those reinvested in shares of our common stock pursuant to our distribution reinvestment plan. We have not generated and we may continue to be unable to generate sufficient cash flows from operations to fully fund distributions paid. Therefore, some or all of our distributions have been and may continue to be paid and during the offering phase, are likely to be paid at least partially from other sources, such as proceeds from the sales of assets, proceeds from our debt financings, proceeds from our public offerings, cash advances by our Advisor and/or cash resulting from a waiver or deferral of fees. We have not placed a cap on the amount of distributions that may be paid from any of these sources. For example, we funded 60%, 42% and 32% of total distributions for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018,\nrespectively, with cash flows from other sources such as cash flows from investing activities, which may include proceeds from the sale of real estate and/or cash flows from financing activities, which may include offering proceeds.\nThe following table outlines our total distributions declared to stockholders for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, including the breakout between the distributions declared in cash and those reinvested pursuant to our distribution reinvestment plan (in thousands).\nTable 21: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Stockholders </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Sources </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Distributions for the Years Ended </td> <td> </td> <td>Cash Distributions </td> <td> </td> <td>Distributions Reinvested </td> <td> </td> <td>Total Declared </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Cash Flows From Operating Activities </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>December 31, 2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>25,398 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>28,762 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>54,161 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>21,777 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>40 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>December 31, 2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>16,112 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>19,446 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>35,558 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>20,798 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>58 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>December 31, 2018 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>10,480 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>12,146 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>22,626 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>15,484 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>68 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nDebt Financings\nAs mentioned previously, our portfolio was 45% leveraged as of December 31, 2020 (based on the most recent valuations of our real estate investments) with a weighted average interest rate of 2.08%. Below is additional information regarding our loan activity for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018. See Note 5 - Debt Financing for additional information regarding our outstanding debt.\n\u2022We received proceeds from notes payable of $446.5 million, which included $259.0 million in draws on our revolving credit facility with JPMorgan as well as $187.5 million in permanent mortgage financing. Use of these proceeds was primarily to provide cash for the acquisitions of real estate investments during the year ended December 31, 2020.\n\u2022We made payments on notes payable of $382.6 million, which included $223.0 million in payments on our revolving credit facility with JPMorgan as well as principal payments of $159.6 million relating to our permanent mortgage financing. Included in payments made on permanent mortgage financing is $123.1 million in payments of outstanding principal remaining on our three properties sold during 2020, $29.9 million in payments of principal in conjunction with term modification of facilities secured by two of our properties, as well as other principal payments made on our permanent mortgage financing. Our Revolving Credit Facility with JPMorgan had an outstanding balance of $240.0 million as of December 31, 2020.\n\u2022We made payments of $1.4 million in financing costs primarily related to our mortgage loans.\n\u2022We made payments of $75.0 million under the Hines Credit Facility to pay off our outstanding balance in April 2020. We have not had any amounts outstanding under this facility since that time.\n\u2022We received proceeds from notes payable of $327.1 million, which included $131.5 million in draws on our revolving credit facility with JPMorgan as well as $195.6 million in permanent mortgage financing. These proceeds were used primarily to provide cash for the acquisition of real estate investments during the year ended December 31, 2019.\n\u2022We made payments on notes payable of $31.0 million, which included $27.5 million in payments on our revolving credit facility with JPMorgan as well as principal payments of $3.5 million relating to our permanent mortgage financing. Our Revolving Credit Facility with JPMorgan had an outstanding balance of $104.0 million as of December 31, 2019.\n\u2022We made payments of $3.7 million in financing costs primarily related to our mortgage loans.\n\u2022We borrowed $134.0 million under the Hines Credit Facility primarily to provide cash for the acquisitions of real estate investments during the year ended December 31, 2019, and made payments of $114.0 million on this facility. We had an outstanding balance of $75.0 million under this facility as of December 31, 2019.\nResults of Operations\nYear ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019\nThe table below includes information regarding changes in our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, including explanations for significant changes and any significant or unusual activity. As described more completely below, most amounts increased in 2020 compared to 2019 as a result of significant additional capital raised and invested in real estate, as offset by recent property dispositions. However, the Coronavirus pandemic had adverse effects on our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2020, which offset some of the increases resulting from our acquisition activity. These effects were primarily due to rent concessions at our retail properties and rent refunds at our international student housing properties. Our other segments were not materially affected. To the extent the Coronavirus pandemic causes additional adverse conditions at our properties, our results in future periods could also be affected. All amounts are in thousands, except for percentages:\nTable 22: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>

a meaningful percentage\nTotal revenues: The increase in total revenue is primarily due to the additional real estate investments acquired during 2020, offset by dispositions during the same period. We acquired seven and disposed of three real estate investments during 2020 and had a portfolio of twenty-two real estate investments as of December 31, 2020 that contained 10.9 million leasable square feet, of which 95% was leased. We also acquired nine real estate investments during 2019 which also contributed to the increases in these amounts since the properties were owned for the entire year in 2020. Despite this increase, total revenues of our same-store properties decreased $6.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2020. Please refer to our Same Store Analysis\u201d below for additional discussion on the results of operations of our portfolio.\nProperty operating expenses: The increase in property operating expenses is primarily due to our net acquisition activity during late 2019 and throughout 2020. Property operating expenses of our same-store properties increased $0.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2020. Please refer to our Same Store Analysis\u201d below for additional discussion on the results of operations of our portfolio.\nReal property taxes: The increase in real property taxes is primarily due to our net acquisition activity during late 2019 and throughout 2020. Real property taxes of our same-store properties decreased $0.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2020. Please refer to our Same Store Analysis\u201d below for additional discussion on the results of operations of our portfolio.\nProperty management fees: The increase in property management fees is primarily due to our net acquisition activity during late 2019 and throughout 2020. Property management fees of our same-store properties increased $0.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2020. Please refer to our Same Store Analysis\u201d below for additional discussion on the results of operations of our portfolio.\nDepreciation and amortization: The increase in depreciation and amortization expense is primarily due to the additional real estate investments acquired during 2019 and 2020, offset by dispositions during the same period, as previously described.\nAsset management fees: Asset management fees are charged based on the aggregate valuation of our real estate investments, as most recently determined in connection with the determination of our NAV. The increase in these fees is primarily due to the additional real estate investments made during 2019 and 2020, offset by dispositions during the same period, as previously described.\nPerformance participation allocation: The decrease in performance participation allocation is a result of the fee not being earned by the Advisor during the year ended December 31, 2020, due to a decline in our NAV per share during the year. Please see Item 7 - Management's Discussion and Analysis-NAV and Distribution for additional information concerning the change in NAV per share during the year ended December 31, 2020.\nGeneral and administrative expenses: General and administrative expenses increased primarily due to increased legal costs and shareholder costs. We generally expect our general and administrative expenses to continue to increase as we continue raising capital from our public offerings.\nGain (loss) on derivative instruments: We enter into interest rate hedging instruments in order to limit our exposure against the variability of future interest rates on our variable interest rate borrowings as well as foreign currency forward contracts as economic hedges against the variability of foreign exchange rates. During the year ended December 31, 2020, such gains were primarily related to the position of our foreign currency forward contracts.\nGain (loss) on investments in real estate-related securities: We hold investments in real estate-related securities, which consist of common equities, preferred equities and debt investments of publicly traded REITs. These amounts include realized gains (losses) related to securities sold during the year and unrealized gains (losses) based on values determined on a recurring basis. The net loss on securities during the year ended December 31, 2020 is due to realized losses on the portfolio incurred primarily as a result of market effects during the first quarter of the year related to the Coronavirus pandemic, offset by unrealized gains following the market recovery from the lows earlier in the year. For information about the valuation of our investments in real-estate related securities, see Note 9-Fair Value Measurements in the notes to the accompanying financial statements.\nGain on sale of real estate: We acquired the Domain Apartments in January 2016 for a contract purchase price of $58.1 million and we sold the Domain Apartments for a contract sales price of $80.1 million on January 7, 2020, resulting in the recognition of a gain of $29.5 million related to this sale. Additionally, we acquired Goodyear Crossing II in August 2016 for a contract purchase price of $56.2 million and we sold Goodyear Crossing II for a contract sales price of $72.0 million on February 14, 2020, resulting in a recognition of a gain of $20.2 million related to this sale. We acquired Bishop's Square in March 2015 for \u20ac92.0 million (approximately $103.5 million assuming a rate of $1.13 per EUR as of the acquisition date) and we sold Bishop's Square in April 2020 for \u20ac181.6 million (approximately $198.0 million assuming a rate of $1.09 per EUR as of the date of transaction). We recognized a gain on sale of this asset of $80.4 million, excluding taxes related to the sale, which are described below. We had no property dispositions during the year ended December 31, 2019.\nForeign currency gains (losses): Foreign currency gains (losses) primarily reflects the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on transactions that were denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the related entity. During the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, these losses were primarily related to the effect of remeasuring cash held in foreign currencies into their related functional currencies.\nInterest expense: Interest expense increased due to the net increase in our principal amount of indebtedness outstanding during the period resulting from additional real estate investments acquired in 2019 and 2020, as offset by the effects of the properties sold during 2020.\nInterest and other income: Primarily relates to interest and dividend income associated with our investments in real estate-related securities. The increase in interest and dividend income earned during the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to 2019 is due to additional investments in real estate-related securities made during the year.\nBenefit (provision) for income taxes: Benefit for income taxes increased nearly $3.4 million primarily as a result of recent changes in tax laws related to our international student housing properties and their effect on book / tax timing differences at these properties.\nProvision for income taxes related to sale of real estate: The increase during the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to 2019 relates to the income tax incurred as a result of the sale of Bishop's Square during April 2020, as described above.\nSame-Store Analysis\nWe evaluate our consolidated results of operations on a same-store basis, which allows us to analyze our property operating results excluding the effects of acquisitions and dispositions during the periods under comparison. Properties in our portfolio are considered same-store if they were owned for the full periods presented. Same-store properties for the year ended December 31, 2020 includes seven properties. The tables below include additional information regarding the operating results of our same-store properties for the current period as compared to the same period in the prior year.\nThe following table presents the same-store revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, by reportable segment. Total revenues increased by 22% primarily as a result of seven additional investments in real estate assets between December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2020 as offset by the dispositions of three properties in 2020. However, revenues of our same-store properties decreased by 9% primarily due to the adverse effects of the Coronavirus pandemic on our retail properties and international student housing properties, as described above.

The property was 94% leased at December 31, 2019 and decreased to 88% occupancy by September 30, 2020 before increasing to 93% by December 31, 2020 as a result of new leasing activity near the end of the year. We are currently in discussions with prospective tenants to re-lease the remaining vacancy, and one existing tenant has amended its lease to expand into currently vacant space during 2021. Additionally, we have recently undertaken capital projects to improve tenant amenities to enhance our ability to lease the remaining vacant space.\n(2)The decrease is primarily due to rent concessions negotiated with our tenants due to the impact of the Coronavirus pandemic.\n(3)The decrease is primarily due to rent refunds granted to our student housing tenants resulting from school closures in response to the Coronavirus pandemic, as well as due to the closing of one of our student housing properties in August 2020 for renovation and replacement of certain building safety equipment systems.\nThe following table presents the property expenses for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, by reportable segment. Property expenses increased by 30% primarily as a result of seven additional investments in real estate between December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2020, as offset by the dispositions of three properties during the year ended December 31, 2020.

This decrease is driven primarily by a decrease in the tax rate applied to the property value as a result of an appeal relating to 2019 property taxes awarded in 2020.\n(3)The increase is primarily due to additional reimbursable salaries and related costs of the property manager, who is an affiliate of Hines. Many of these costs represent one-time charges and are not expected to be incurred on an ongoing basis.\n(4)The increase is primarily due to legal expenses incurred associated with litigation against a previous owner of one of our student housing properties relating to renovations begun during the third quarter of 2020 to replace certain building safety equipment systems, as well as one-time costs incurred to temporarily relocate student residents before beginning the project.\nThe following table presents revenues in excess of property expenses for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, by reportable segment. In total, revenues in excess of property expenses increased by 17%, primarily as a result of our recent acquisition activity, as offset by our recent dispositions. However, total revenues in excess of property expenses of our same-store properties decreased by 17% primarily due to adverse effects of the Coronavirus pandemic on our retail properties and our international student housing properties, as well as the closing of one of our student housing properties for renovation, as described previously. To the extent the Coronavirus pandemic causes additional adverse conditions at our properties, our results in future periods could also be affected.

FFO is a non-GAAP financial performance measure defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ( NAREIT\u201d) and is widely recognized by investors and analysts as one measure of operating performance of a real estate company. FFO excludes items such as real estate depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization, as applied in accordance with GAAP, implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time and also assumes that such assets are adequately maintained and renovated as required in order to maintain their value. Since real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market conditions such as occupancy rates, rental rates, inflation, interest rates, the business cycle, unemployment and consumer spending, it is management's view, and we believe the view of many industry"}
