Additionally, it addresses accounting policies and estimates that management has deemed are critical accounting policies and estimates.\u201d This discussion and analysis is intended as a supplement to and should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements and other sections of this Form 10-K.\nThe following discussion contains forward-looking statements. You should refer to the Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d set forth in Part I of this Annual Report.\nWe report financial information on a quarterly and fiscal year basis with the most recent being the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021. All references herein to a fiscal year\u201d or Fiscal\u201d refer to the applicable fiscal year ended June 30.\nCompany Overview\nLannett Company, Inc. (a Delaware corporation) and its subsidiaries (collectively, the Company\u201d, Lannett\u201d, we\u201d or us\u201d) primarily develop, manufacture, package, market and distribute solid oral and extended release (tablets and capsules), topical, liquids, nasal and oral solution finished dosage forms of drugs, generic forms of both small molecule and biologic medications, that address a wide range of therapeutic areas. Certain of these products are manufactured by others and distributed by the Company. Additionally, the Company is pursuing partnerships, research contracts and internal expansion for the development and production of other dosage forms including: ophthalmic, nasal, patch, foam, buccal, sublingual, suspensions, soft gel, injectable and oral dosages.\nThe Company operates pharmaceutical manufacturing plants in Carmel, New York and Seymour, Indiana. The Company's customers include generic pharmaceutical distributors, drug wholesalers, chain drug stores, private label distributors, mail-order pharmacies, other pharmaceutical manufacturers, managed care organizations, hospital buying groups, governmental entities and health maintenance organizations.\nImpact of COVID-19 Pandemic\nIn December 2019, the COVID-19 virus emerged in Wuhan, China and spread to other parts of the world. In March 2020, the World Health Organization ( WHO\u201d) designated COVID-19 a global pandemic. Governments on the national, state and local level in the United States, and around the world, have implemented lockdown and shelter-in-place orders, requiring many non-essential businesses to shut down operations for the time being. The Company's business, however, is deemed essential\u201d and it has continued to operate and has continued to manufacture and distribute its medicines to customers. The Company has developed a comprehensive plan that enables it to maintain operational continuity with an emphasis on manufacturing, distribution and R&D facilities during this crisis, and to date, has not encountered any significant obstacles implementing its business continuity plans. However, the Company continually assesses COVID-19 related developments and adjusts its risk mitigation planning and business continuity activities as needed.\nIn mid-March, 2020, the Company instituted a work from home process for all employees, other than employees in our manufacturing plants, distribution center, and R&D facilities which support manufacturing. For employees who cannot perform their job remotely, the Company has implemented enhanced cleaning and sanitizing procedures, weekly fogging and provided additional personal hygiene supplies and personal protective equipment such as rubber gloves, N95 respirators and powered air-purifying respirator that are in line with Centers for Disease Control and Preventions ( CDC\u201d) recommendations. The Company has also implemented thermal screening for all employees and visitors entering its facilities. Employees are required to adhere to the CDC guidelines, social distancing and any employee experiencing any symptoms of COVID-19 is required to stay home and seek medical attention. Any employee who tests positive for COVID-19 is required to quarantine and is not allowed to return to the facilities without a physician's release. The Company has closed its facilities to outside persons that are not critical to continuing our operations. In cases where they are essential, visitors undergo a pre-admittance check to include a thermal screening and risk evaluation. The Company has experienced an increase in absenteeism arising from intermittent spikes in cases across the country, which has caused an increase in overtime and cost to produce the products, but to date the rate of employee absenteeism has not had any material effect on the Company's business or its ability to manufacture and distribute products and plants continue to operate at normal capacity. As the pandemic continues to linger due to variants or limited vaccine supplies, there is an ongoing risk of employee absenteeism which could materially impact the Company's operations. To date, the Company's work from home process has not materially impacted the Company's financial reporting systems or controls over financial reporting and disclosures nor do we expect that the remote work arrangement will have a material impact in the future.\nCurrently and as anticipated for the near future, the supply chain supporting the Company's products remains intact, enabling the Company to receive sufficient inventory of the key materials needed across the Company's network. The Company is experiencing some delays and allocations for certain API and other raw materials of higher demand, which, to date, have not had a material impact on its results of operations. However, the Company is regularly communicating with its suppliers, third-party partners, customers, healthcare providers and government officials in order to respond rapidly to any issues as they arise. The longer the current situation continues, it is more likely that the Company may experience some sort of interruption to its supply chain, and such an interruption could materially affect its business, including but not limited to, our ability to timely manufacture and distribute its products as well as unfavorably impact our results of operations. Additionally, subsequent to an initial stocking up of supplies at the start of the pandemic, the total volume of drug prescriptions written during the pandemic has decreased causing less demand for our products. Specifically, the pandemic has resulted in fewer elective surgeries being performed, causing less demand for our Numbrino cocaine hydrochloride product.\nAs a result of the pandemic, certain clinical trials which were underway or scheduled to begin were temporarily placed on hold, although all such clinical trials were resumed and have been completed. Such delays impacted the Company's timing for filing applications for product approvals with the FDA as well as related timing of FDA approval of such filings. Additionally, the pandemic has slowed down the Company's efforts to expand its product portfolio through acquisitions and distribution opportunities, impacting the speed with which the Company is able to bring additional products to market. While there have been some efforts by some of our customers to increase their inventory levels for the Company's products in the near term, the Company has not seen significant increases in demand. The Company does not anticipate any significant changes in demand for its products in the future, however, depending on the duration and severity of the outbreak, levels of demand may change.\nIn light of the economic impacts of COVID-19, the Company reviewed the assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of June 30, 2021, including intangible and other long-lived assets. Based on our review, the Company determined that no impairments or other write-downs specifically related to COVID-19 were necessary during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021. Our assessment is based on information currently available and is highly reliant on various assumptions. Changes in market conditions could impact the Company's future outlook and may lead to impairments in the future.\nBased on the foregoing, the Company cannot reasonably predict the ultimate impact of COVID-19 on our future results of operations and cash flows due to the continued uncertainty around the duration and severity of the pandemic.\n2020 Restructuring Plan\nOn July 10, 2020, the Board of Directors authorized a restructuring and cost savings plan (the 2020 Restructuring Plan\u201d) to enhance manufacturing efficiencies, streamline operations and reduce the Company's cost structure. The 2020 Restructuring Plan was implemented, in part, as a result of previously anticipated near-term competition and pricing pressure with respect to certain key products. The 2020 Restructuring Plan included lowering operating costs and reducing the workforce by approximately 80 positions. The 2020 Restructuring Plan was initiated on July 13, 2020 and completed as of December 31, 2020.\nThe Company incurred approximately $4.0 million in severance-related costs in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021, in connection with the 2020 Restructuring Plan. The Company expects the 2020 Restructuring Plan to result in annual cost savings in excess of $15.0 million.\nClimate Change\nThe Company believes in a more sustainable future with a reduced environmental footprint, effective use of natural resources and a multi-pronged approach to reducing our effect on the climate while maintaining our focus on providing affordable medicines to our customers and ultimately the patients who depend on them. Commitment to this belief, however, may come at increased costs to the Company including, but not limited to, capital investments, additional management and compliance costs, and reduced output, all of which may be material. Costs incurred by our suppliers and vendors to comply with their own sustainability commitments may also be passed through the supply chain resulting in higher operational costs to the Company. Climate change and the associated risks continues to evolve over time and could materially impact the Company's results of operations and cash flows in any given year. The Company monitors such changes and strives to address these risks in a timely manner.\nResults of Operations - Fiscal 2021 compared to Fiscal 2020\nNet sales decreased 12% to $478.8 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021. The following table identifies the Company's net product sales by medical indication for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2021 and 2020.\nTable 18: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal Year Ended June 30,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Medical Indication\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Analgesic\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 14,684\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 8,680\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Anti-Psychosis\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 43,720\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 104,934\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cardiovascular\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 65,987\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 88,576\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Central Nervous System\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 95,115\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 77,256\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Endocrinology\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 27,070\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gastrointestinal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 67,540\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 73,477\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Infectious Disease\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 67,761\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 73,237\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Migraine\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 25,554\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 44,266\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Respiratory/Allergy/Cough/Cold\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9,258\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11,576\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Urinary\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,786\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,225\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 35,312\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 35,013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Contract manufacturing revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 20,991\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 24,504\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total net sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 478,778\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 545,744\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe decrease in net sales was driven by a decrease in the selling price of products of $90.1 million partially offset by increased volumes of $23.1 million. The decrease in the selling price of products was primarily driven by lower sales prices of Fluphenazine, which is included within the Anti-Psychosis medical indication, and Posaconazole, which is included in Infectious Disease medical indication, due to new competitors entering the market, as well as lower average selling price across the remaining medical indications. Overall volumes increased primarily due to increased volumes of Posaconazole and from new product launches, including Levothyroxine Tablets and Capsules, partially offset by lower volumes of Fluphenazine. The Company has seen increased competitive market pressure in recent years, which has resulted in overall decreases in selling prices of products and sales volume across our product portfolio. We have partially offset these competitive pressures with new product launches and will continue to seek opportunities for additional launches.\nIn January 2017, a provision in the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 required drug manufacturers to pay additional rebates to state Medicaid programs if the prices of their generic drugs rise at a rate faster than inflation. The provision negatively impacted the Company's net sales by $18.9 million and $35.7 million in Fiscal 2021 and Fiscal 2020, respectively, which contributed to the overall decreased average selling price.\nThe following chart details price and volume changes by medical indication between Fiscal 2021 and Fiscal 2020:\nTable 19: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Sales volume\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Sales price\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Medical indication\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>change %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>change %\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Analgesic\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 73\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td> (4)\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Anti-Psychosis\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (29)\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td> (29)\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cardiovascular\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (17)\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td> (9)\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Central Nervous System\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 44\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td> (21)\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Endocrinology\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 100\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gastrointestinal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td> (8)\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Infectious Disease\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 16\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td> (23)\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Migraine\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (17)\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td> (25)\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Respiratory/Allergy/Cough/Cold\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (14)\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td> (6)\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Urinary\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 26\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td> 11\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Company sells its products to customers through various distribution channels.

We have partially offset these competitive pressures with new product launches and will continue to seek opportunities for additional launches.\nCocaine Hydrochloride Solution\nIn December 2017, a competitor received approval from the FDA to market and sell a Cocaine Hydrochloride topical product. In March 2018, in accordance with FDA guidance, the FDA requested the Company cease manufacturing and distributing our unapproved cocaine hydrochloride solution product as a result of an approved product on the market. The Company committed to not manufacture or distribute cocaine hydrochloride 10% solution, which was not sold during Fiscal 2019, and also ceased manufacturing its unapproved cocaine hydrochloride 4% solution on June 15, 2019 and ceased distributing the product on August 15, 2019.\nThe competitor filed a series of Citizen Petitions beginning in 2019, seeking to block approval of the Company's Section 505(b)(2) NDA for its cocaine hydrochloride solution product by claiming that the grant of the New Chemical Entity ( NCE\u201d) exclusivity issued to the competitor blocks the approval of the Company's application for five years. Following the FDA's rejection of the competitor's argument and approval of the Company's Section 505(b)(2) NDA, the competitor filed two lawsuits against the FDA (one in federal court in the District of Columbia and one in federal court in the District of Maryland) seeking a court order in two different federal courts directing the FDA to withdraw approval of the Section 505(b)(2) NDA. To date, neither court has directed the FDA to withdraw the NDA. The Company has intervened in both lawsuits and there are currently cross motions for summary judgment pending in the case filed in federal court for the District of Columbia and a motion to dismiss the complaint filed in the federal court for the District of Maryland.\nSeparately, on June 6, 2020, the competitor filed a patent infringement complaint, since amended, in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware, asserting that the Company's approved cocaine hydrochloride product infringes six patents issued to the competitor. The Company filed an answer and counterclaim, alleging that the Company either does not infringe or that the six asserted patents and three additional unasserted patents are invalid. The competitor filed a motion to partially dismiss a portion of the counterclaim as to the unasserted patents. The motion to dismiss is pending a determination by the court and discovery is ongoing. The Company continues to market its approved cocaine hydrochloride product.\nOn August 16, 2021, the Company and the competitor reached an agreement in principle to amicably resolve all pending cases, including the cases in the federal courts in the District of Columbia, District of Maryland and District of Delaware. The parties are working to negotiate and finalize the settlement documents over the next 45 days and have filed motions in each of the courts to stay the cases pending the finalization of the settlement documents.\nThalomid\u00ae\nThe Company filed with the FDA an ANDA No. 206601, along with a paragraph IV certification, alleging that the fifteen patents associated with the Thalomid drug product are invalid, unenforceable and/or not infringed. On January 30, 2015, Celgene Corporation and Children's Medical Center Corporation filed a patent infringement lawsuit in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey, alleging that the Company's filing of ANDA No. 206601 constitutes an act of patent infringement and seeking a declaration that the patents at issue are valid and infringed. A settlement agreement was reached, and the Court dismissed the lawsuit in October 2017. Pursuant to the settlement agreement, the Company entered into a license agreement that permitted Lannett to manufacture and market in the U.S. its generic thalidomide product as of August 1, 2019 or earlier under certain circumstances. In the second quarter of Fiscal 2019, the Company received a Major Complete Response Letter ( CRL\u201d) related to issues at its API supplier. The Company filed a response to the CRL. The Company received a second Major CRL in the first quarter of Fiscal 2020 related to continued issues at the API supplier, as well as issues with the Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy ( REMS\u201d) program hosted by Celgene. On March 26, 2021, the Company received a third Major CRL from the FDA relating to continuing issues with the API supplier. The Company is working on addressing the FDA comments and cannot reasonably predict timing of the product launch.\nRanitidine Oral Solution, USP\nAs part of an industry-wide action, the Company issued a voluntary recall on all lots within expiry of Ranitidine Syrup (Ranitidine Oral Solution, USP), 15mg/mL to the consumer level due to levels of N-Nitrosodimethylamine ( NDMA\u201d), a probable human carcinogen, above the levels recently established by the FDA. On September 17, 2019, the FDA notified the Company about the possible presence of NDMA in its Ranitidine Oral Solution product and the Company immediately commenced testing and analysis of the active pharmaceutical ingredient ( API\u201d) and drug product and confirmed the presence of NDMA. The Company's net sales of Ranitidine Oral Solution in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019 totaled $1.9 million. On April 1, 2020, the FDA ordered all Ranitidine products (including the Company's product) withdrawn from the U.S. market and provided guidance on the requirements for submitting additional information to the FDA in order to re-introduce the product to the market. Since initiating the voluntary recall, the Company has not been marketing its Ranitidine Oral Solution product and has no future plans to attempt to re-introduce the product at this time. The Company does not believe the recall will have a significant impact on our future expected financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nOn June 1, 2020, a class action complaint was served upon the Company and approximately forty-five (45) other companies asserting claims for personal injury arising from the presence of NDMA in Ranitidine products. The complaint is consolidated in a multidistrict litigation ( MDL\u201d) pending in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida. Similar complaints were filed in state court in New Mexico and state court in Maryland and served upon the Company. Subsequently, a number of similar complaints were served on the Company. The Company has filed a motion to dismiss the complaint filed in the MDL which, on December 31, 2020, was granted with leave to amend as to certain of the claims. The plaintiffs filed a First Amended complaint on February 9, 2021, to which the generic manufacturer defendants, including the Company, filed a renewed motion to dismiss all claims. On July 8, 2021, the Court issued an Order granting the motion and dismissing all claims with prejudice based on federal preemption. Separately, the New Mexico case was conditionally transferred to the MDL, but ultimately remanded back to the state court. Since the Company was not licensed to do business in New Mexico and, based upon the information received to date, did not sell Ranitidine in New Mexico, we plan to file a motion to dismiss based, among other things, federal preemption and lack of jurisdiction. Separately, the Company filed a notice to remove and transfer the Maryland case to the MDL which the plaintiff has opposed. On April 1, 2021, the case was remanded back to the state court. On August 17, 2021, Helena Hilbert & William Hilbert III, Individually and on behalf of their minor child \"WH\", filed a complaint in the Philadelphia Court of Common Pleas against the Company and approximately seven other defendants, alleging personal injury as a result of using the Company's Ranitidine products. The Company intends to file a motion to dismiss all of the pending state claims, among other reasons, based on federal preemption. The Company has placed its insurance carrier on notice of the claim and the carrier has appointed counsel to defend the Company.\nCost of Sales, including amortization of intangibles. Cost of sales, including amortization of intangibles, for Fiscal 2021 increased 6% to $403.2 million from $380.5 million in the same prior-year period. The increase was attributable to an increase of $13.2 million in write-downs for excess and obsolete inventory, which primarily relates to the Company's decision to discontinue 23 lower margin product lines, as well as additional volumes from new product launches. The Company also recorded $5.0 million in consideration to renew the Company's distribution agreement with Recro Gainesville, LLC ( Recro\u201d) during the second quarter of Fiscal Year 2021.\nGross Profit. Gross profit for Fiscal 2021 decreased 54% to $75.6 million or 16% of total net sales. In comparison, gross profit for Fiscal 2020 was $165.2 million or 30% of total net sales. The decrease in gross profit percentage was primarily attributable to lower volumes of Fluphenazine, which had higher than average gross profit margins, as well as overall lower average selling prices of our products. The Company also recorded an increase in the write-downs for excess and obsolete inventory as well as consideration to renew the distribution agreement with Recro in the second quarter of Fiscal 2021.\nResearch and Development Expenses. Research and development expenses decreased 19% to $24.2 million in Fiscal 2021 from $30.0 million in Fiscal 2020. The decrease was primarily due to lower R&D expenses as a result of timing of certain milestones related to product development projects as well as employee headcount reductions related to the 2020 Restructuring Plan.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased 14% to $68.1 million in Fiscal 2021 compared with $79.5 million in Fiscal 2020. The decrease was primarily driven by a lower branded prescription drug fee, lower incentive-based compensation, lower expenses at the Company's Cody Labs subsidiary and other cost reduction initiatives.\nAsset impairment charges. In Fiscal 2021, the Company recorded various asset impairment charges totaling $216.6 million. The Company reviewed its product portfolio during Fiscal 2021 and decided to discontinue 23 lower gross margin product lines, including product lines that were acquired through various past business and product acquisitions. As a result of the discontinuance and the reduction in net sales and gross margin of certain other product lines, the Company recorded an impairment charge of $193.0 million related to the KUPI product rights intangible assets. The impairment charge is primarily a result of the decline in net sales and gross margin of certain product lines acquired in connection with the KUPI acquisition, including those product lines being discontinued. In addition, the Company recorded a $17.0 million impairment charge to its intangible asset for a distribution and supply agreement with Cediprof, Inc., which is included within the other product rights category of definite-lived intangible assets, as a result of increased competition and lower projected cash flows for the Levothyroxine product. The Company also recorded a $5.0 million impairment charge to its KUPI in-process research and development intangible asset due to delays in the expected launch of a product within the portfolio, which results in reduced projected cash flows. See Note 8 Goodwill and Intangible Assets\u201d for more information.\nOther Loss. Interest expense for the year ended June 30, 2021 totaled $53.8 million compared to $66.8 million for the year ended June 30, 2020. The decrease was due to a lower average debt balance in Fiscal 2021 as compared to the prior-year as well as a lower weighted-average interest rate due to the full repayment of the outstanding Term Loan A in November 2020. The weighted average interest rate for Fiscal 2021 and 2020 was 8.0% and 8.8%, respectively. The Company also recorded a $10.3 million loss on extinguishment of debt related to the payoff of the Term Loan B Facility during Fiscal 2021.\nIncome Tax. The Company recorded income tax expense in Fiscal 2021 of $60.6 million compared to income tax benefit of $15.3 million in Fiscal 2020. The effective tax rate for Fiscal 2021 was (20.0)%, compared to 31.4% for Fiscal 2020. The income tax expense recorded in Fiscal 2021 was primarily driven by the full valuation allowance recorded against the Company's deferred tax assets. See Note 17 Income Taxes\u201d for more information.\nNet Loss. For the year ended June 30, 2021, the Company reported net loss of $363.5 million, or $(9.23) per diluted share. Comparatively, net loss in the corresponding prior-year period was $33.4 million, or $(0.86) per diluted share.\nResults of Operations - Fiscal 2020 compared to Fiscal 2019\nNet sales decreased 17% to $545.7 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020. The following table identifies the Company's net product sales by medical indication for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2020 and 2019.

Overall volumes decreased primarily due to the loss of Levothyroxine sales associated with the expiration of the JSP Distribution Agreement, partially offset by additional volumes from product launches and increased market share in certain key products. Average selling prices were impacted by product mix and price decreases in certain key products due to competitive pricing pressures. Although the Company has benefited in the past from favorable pricing trends, these trends have reversed. Net sales within the infectious disease category increased significantly as a result of the distribution and supply agreement with Sinotherapeutics Inc., which was signed in August 2019, to distribute Posaconazole tablets.\nIn January 2017, a provision in the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 required drug manufacturers to pay additional rebates to state Medicaid programs if the prices of their generic drugs rise at a rate faster than inflation. The provision negatively impacted the Company's net sales by $35.7 million and $30.8 million in Fiscal 2020 and Fiscal 2019, respectively, which contributed to the overall decreased average selling price.\nThe following chart details price and volume changes by medical indication between Fiscal 2020 and Fiscal 2019:\nTable 22: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Sales volume\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Sales price\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Medical indication\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>change %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>change %\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Analgesic\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 25\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td> (20)\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Anti-Psychosis\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 33\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td> 10\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cardiovascular\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (12)\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td> (1)\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Central Nervous System\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 47\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td> (16)\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Endocrinology\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (100)\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gastrointestinal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 16\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td> 1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Infectious Disease\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 346\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td> (14)\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Migraine\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 21\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td> (14)\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Respiratory/Allergy/Cough/Cold\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (5)\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td> (2)\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Urinary\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (34)\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td> (3)\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Company sells its products to customers through various distribution channels.

The decrease in sales to wholesalers, as well as mail-order pharmacies, was also primarily due to the loss of Levothyroxine sales.\nCost of Sales, including amortization of intangibles. Cost of sales, including amortization of intangibles, for Fiscal 2020 decreased 8% to $380.5 million from $411.8 million in the same prior-year period. The decrease was primarily attributable to the loss of Levothyroxine sales associated with the expiration of the JSP Distribution Agreement as well as lower cost of sales as a result of the Company's decision to cease operations at Cody Labs, partially offset by additional volumes of other products sold as well as increased product royalties expense related to various distribution agreements.\nGross Profit. Gross profit for Fiscal 2020 decreased 32% to $165.2 million or 30% of total net sales. In comparison, gross profit for Fiscal 2019 was $243.6 million or 37% of total net sales. The decrease in gross profit percentage was primarily attributable to the loss of Levothyroxine sales associated with the expiration of the JSP Distribution Agreement, which had higher than average gross profit margins, price decreases across our product portfolio as well as increased product royalties related to various distribution agreements, partially offset by manufacturing efficiencies as a result of cost reduction initiatives and an increase in volumes of certain key products with higher than average gross margins.\nResearch and Development Expenses. Research and development expenses decreased 23% to $30.0 million in Fiscal 2020 from $38.8 million in Fiscal 2019. The decrease was primarily due to lower R&D expenses as a result of the Company's decision to cease operations at Cody Labs as well as the timing of certain milestones related to product development projects.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased 9% to $79.5 million in Fiscal 2020 compared with $87.6 million in Fiscal 2019. The decrease was primarily driven by lower financial advisory costs, a decrease in regulatory-related costs, lower expenses at the Company's Cody Labs subsidiary and other cost reduction initiatives, partially offset by a branded prescription drug fee as well as increased legal costs.\nAsset impairment charges. In Fiscal 2020, the Company recorded various asset impairment charges totaling $34.4 million. During Fiscal 2020, the Company performed an impairment analysis of its AB-rated Methylphenidate Hydrochloride product, which is distributed under a license agreement with Andor, due to significant declines in the projected profitability of the distribution arrangement. As a result of the analysis, the Company recorded a $14.0 million impairment charge. The Company also performed an annual impairment analysis of our indefinite-lived intangible assets. As a result, the Company recorded a $9.0 million and an $8.0 million impairment charge to its KUPI IPR&D and Silarx IPR&D assets, respectively, due to the abandonment of several pipeline products within both portfolios. The Company recorded a ROU lease asset totaling $1.2 million related to an existing lease at Cody Labs upon adoption of ASU No. 2016-02 and subsequently recorded a full impairment of the asset as a result of the decision to cease operations at Cody Labs.\nOther Income (Loss). Interest expense for the year ended June 30, 2020 totaled $66.8 million compared to $84.6 million for the year ended June 30, 2019. The decrease was due to a lower average debt balance in Fiscal 2020 as compared to the prior-year period as well as a lower weighted-average interest rate due to the partial repayment of the outstanding Term Loan A balance with proceeds from the issuance of the 4.50% Convertible Senior Notes. The weighted average interest rate for Fiscal 2020 and 2019 was 8.8% and 9.7%, respectively. Investment income totaled $1.6 million in Fiscal 2020 compared with $3.2 million in Fiscal 2019.\nIncome Tax. The Company recorded income tax benefit in Fiscal 2020 of $15.3 million compared to income tax benefit of $74.1 million in Fiscal 2019. The effective tax rate for Fiscal 2020 was 31.4%, compared to 21.4% for Fiscal 2019. The effective tax rate for the period ended June 30, 2020 was higher compared to the same prior-year period primarily due to the impact of the CARES Act which allowed the Company to carryback its 2020 taxable loss into its Fiscal 2015 tax year, where the statutory tax rate was 35%. The increase was slightly offset by excess tax shortfalls related to stock compensation as well as a non-deductible branded prescription drug fee.\nNet Income (Loss). For the year ended June 30, 2020, the Company reported net loss of $33.4 million, or $(0.86) per diluted share. Comparatively, net loss in the corresponding prior-year period was $272.1 million, or $(7.20) per diluted share.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nCash Flow\nThe Company finances its operations with cash flow generated from operations and has $45.0 million available to draw upon under the Amended ABL Credit Facility, which is discussed further below. At June 30, 2021, working capital was $263.1 million as compared to $228.3 million at June 30, 2020, an increase of $34.8 million. Current product portfolio sales as well as sales related to future product approvals are anticipated to continue to generate positive cash flow from operations.\nNet cash provided by operating activities of $60.9 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021 reflected net loss of $363.5 million, adjustments for non-cash items of $441.0 million, as well as cash used in operating assets and liabilities of $16.6 million. In comparison, net cash from operating activities of $116.0 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020 reflected net loss of $33.4 million, adjustments for non-cash items of $110.7 million, as well as cash provided by changes in operating assets and liabilities of $38.7 million.\nSignificant changes in operating assets and liabilities from June 30, 2020 to June 30, 2021 are comprised of:\nTable 24: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>A decrease in accounts receivable of $26.9 million mainly due to the overall decrease in sales, as well as the timing of sales and cash receipts.

Net cash used in investing activities of $40.0 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020 was mainly the result of purchases of intangible assets of $28.8 million and purchases of property, plant and equipment of $18.3 million, partially offset by proceeds from the sale of property, plant and equipment of $7.4 million.\nNet cash used in financing activities of $92.2 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021 was primarily due to debt repayments of $437.9 million and payment of debt issuance costs of $10.1 million, partially offset by proceeds from issuance of long-term debt of $356.2 million. The financing activities during Fiscal 2021 were primarily related to the refinancing in April 2021. Net cash used in financing activities of $71.9 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020 was due to debt repayments of $146.7 million, purchase of capped calls in connection with the 4.50% Convertible Senior Notes offering totaling $7.1 million, payments of debt issuance costs totaling $3.5 million, and purchases of treasury stock totaling $1.9 million, partially offset by proceeds from issuance of 4.50% Convertible Senior Notes of $86.3 million and proceeds from sale of stock pursuant to stock compensation plans of $1.0 million.\nCredit Facility and Other Indebtedness\nThe Company has previously entered into and may enter future agreements with various financial institutions to provide additional cash to help finance the Company's acquisitions, various capital investments and potential strategic opportunities. These borrowing arrangements as of June 30, 2021 are as follows:\n7.750% Senior Secured Notes due 2026\nOn April 22, 2021, the Company issued $350.0 million aggregate principal amount of 7.750% senior secured notes due 2026 (the Notes\u201d) in a private placement to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act\u201d) and outside the United States to persons other than U.S. persons in reliance upon Regulation S under the Securities Act. The Notes bear interest semi-annually in arrears on April 15 and October 15 of each year, beginning on October 15, 2021, at a rate of 7.750% per annum in cash. The Notes will mature on April 15, 2026, unless earlier redeemed or repurchased in accordance with their terms.\nSecond Lien Secured Loan Facility\nOn April 5, 2021, the Company entered into an Exchange Agreement with certain participating lenders to exchange a portion of their existing Term B Loans for Second Lien Loans pursuant to a new $190.0 million Second Lien Secured Loan Facility ( Second Lien Facility\u201d). On April 22, 2021, in connection with the issuance of the Notes and the entrance into the Amended ABL Credit Facility, which is discussed further below, the exchange between the Company and the participating lenders was consummated. From the Closing Date until the one-year anniversary of the Closing Date, the Second Lien Loans bear 10.0% PIK interest. Thereafter, the Second Lien notes will bear 5.0% cash interest and 5.0% PIK interest until maturity, except to the extent the Company elects to pay all or portion of the PIK interest in cash. The Second Lien Loans will mature on July 21, 2026. In connection with the Second Lien Facility, the Company issued to the Participating Lenders warrants to purchase up to 8,280,000 shares of common stock of the Company (the Warrants\u201d) at an exercise price of $6.88 per share. The Warrants were issued on April 22, 2021 with an eight-year term. The Participating Lenders received registration rights with respect to the shares of common stock of the Company to be received upon exercise of the Warrants. The holders of the Warrants are entitled to receive dividends or distributions of any kind made to the common stockholders to the same extent as if the holder had exercised the Warrant into common stock. The Warrants are considered participating securities under ASC 260, Earnings per share.\nAmended ABL Credit Facility\nOn December 7, 2020, the Company entered into a credit and guaranty agreement, which provided for an asset-based revolving credit facility (the ABL Credit Facility\u201d) of up to $30 million, subject to borrowing base availability, and included letter of credit and swing line sub-facilities. On April 22, 2021, the Company entered into an amendment to that certain Credit and Guaranty Agreement, dated as of December 7, 2020 (such agreement as so amended, the Amended ABL Credit Agreement\u201d), among the Company, certain of its wholly-owned domestic subsidiaries party thereto, as borrowers or as guarantors, Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as administrative agent and as collateral agent and the other lenders party thereto, for the purpose of, among other things, increasing the aggregate amount of the revolving credit facility from $30.0 million to $45.0 million and extending the maturity thereof to the fifth anniversary of the closing date of Notes Offering (subject to a springing maturity as set forth therein).\nThe Amended ABL Credit Agreement provides for a revolving credit facility (the Amended ABL Credit Facility\u201d) that includes letter of credit and swing line sub-facilities. Borrowing availability under the Amended ABL Credit Facility is determined by a monthly borrowing base collateral calculation that is based on specified percentages of eligible accounts receivable less certain reserves and subject to certain other adjustments as set forth in the Amended ABL Credit Agreement. Availability is reduced by issuance of letters of credit as well as any borrowings. Loans outstanding under the Amended ABL Credit Agreement bear interest at a floating rate measured by reference to, at the Company's option, either an adjusted London Inter-Bank Offered Rate ( LIBOR\u201d) (subject to a floor of 0.75%) plus an applicable margin of 2.50% per annum, or an alternate base rate plus an applicable margin of 1.50% per annum. Unused commitments under the Amended ABL Credit Facility are subject to a fee of 0.50% per annum, which fee increases to 0.75% per annum for any quarter during which the Company's average usage under the Amended ABL Credit Facility is less than $5.0 million.\nIn connection with the Second Lien Facility, the Company is required to maintain at least $5.0 million in a deposit account at all times subject to control by the Second Lien Collateral Agent, and a minimum cash balance of $15.0 million as of the last day of each month. At June 30, 2021, the Company classified the $5.0 million required deposit account balance as restricted cash, which is included in other assets caption in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\n4.50% Convertible Senior Notes due 2026\nOn September 27, 2019, the Company issued $86.3 million aggregate principal amount of the 4.50% Convertible Senior Notes (the Convertible Notes\u201d) in a private offering to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The Convertible Notes are senior unsecured obligations of the Company and bear interest at an annual rate of 4.50% payable semi-annually in arrears on April 1 and October 1 of each year, beginning on April 1, 2020. The Convertible Notes will mature on October 1, 2026, unless earlier repurchased, redeemed or converted in accordance with their terms. The Convertible Notes are convertible into shares of the Company's common stock at an initial conversion rate of 65.4022 shares per $1,000 principal amount of Convertible Notes (which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $15.29 per share), subject to adjustments upon the occurrence of certain events (but will not be adjusted for any accrued and unpaid interest). The Company may redeem all or a part of the Convertible Notes on or after October 6, 2023 at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Convertible Notes redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, up to, but excluding, the redemption date, subject to certain conditions relating to the Company's stock price having been met. Following certain corporate events that occur prior to the maturity date or if the Company delivers a notice of redemption, the Company will, in certain circumstances, increase the conversion rate for a holder who elects to convert its Convertible Notes in connection with such corporate event or notice of redemption. The indenture covering the Convertible Notes contains certain other customary terms and covenants, including that upon certain events of default occurring and continuing, either the trustee or holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the outstanding Convertible Notes may declare 100% of the principal of, and accrued and unpaid interest on, all the Convertible Notes to be due and payable.\nIn connection with the offering of the Convertible Notes, the Company also entered into privately negotiated capped call\u201d transactions with several counterparties. The capped call transaction will initially cover, subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments, the number of shares of common stock that initially underlie the Convertible Notes. The capped call transactions are expected to generally reduce the potential dilutive effect on the Company's common stock upon any conversion of the Convertible Notes with such reduction subject to a cap which is initially $19.46 per share.\nOther Liquidity Matters\nRefer to the Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic\u201d section above for the impact on our future liquidity.\nFuture Acquisitions\nWe are continuously evaluating the potential for product and company acquisitions as a part of our future growth strategy. In conjunction with a potential acquisition, the Company may utilize current resources or seek additional sources of capital to finance any such acquisition, which could have an impact on future liquidity.\nWe may also from time to time depending on market conditions and prices, contractual restrictions, our financial liquidity and other factors, seek to prepay outstanding debt or repurchase our outstanding debt through open market purchases, privately negotiated purchases, or otherwise. The amounts involved in any such transactions, individually or in the aggregate, may be material and may be funded from available cash or from additional borrowings.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table represents material annual contractual obligations as of June 30, 2021:\nTable 32: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Less than 1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>More than 5\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1-3 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3-5 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-Term Debt (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 631,950\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 350,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 281,950\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest on Obligations (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 278,580\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 30,885\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 84,991\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 87,342\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 75,362\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating Lease Obligations (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 18,939\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,051\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,147\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,228\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8,513\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Asset Purchase Payment Obligations (3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 13,627\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,250\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12,377\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 943,096\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 34,186\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 101,515\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 441,570\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 365,825\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 33: <table><tr><td>(1) </td> <td>Long-term debt amounts above relate to principal amounts due for the Notes, Second Lien Facility, and the Convertible Notes.

Under the terms of the License and Collaboration Agreement with HEC to develop an insulin glargine product, the Company agreed to fund up to the initial $32 million of the development costs and split 50/50 any development costs in excess thereof. As of June 30, 2021, the Company has incurred approximately $4 million of development costs towards the $32 million commitment made by the Company. Under the terms of a separate License and Collaboration Agreement with HEC and affiliates to develop a biosimilar insulin aspart product, the Company agreed to fund up to the initial $32 million of the development costs, provided that if total development and other costs paid by Lannett are less than $32 million then the difference will be paid to Sunshine over the first year of commercialization. As of June 30, 2021, the Company has not yet incurred material costs towards the $32 million commitment made by the Company. Refer to Note 11 Commitments\u201d for additional information.\nResearch and Development Arrangements\nIn the normal course of business, the Company has entered into certain research and development and other arrangements. As part of these arrangements, the Company has agreed to certain contingent payments, which generally become due and payable only upon the achievement of certain developmental, regulatory, commercial and/or other milestones. In addition, under certain arrangements, we may be required to make royalty payments based on a percentage of future sales, or other metric, for products currently in development in the event that the Company begins to market and sell the product. Due to the inherent uncertainty related to these developmental, regulatory, commercial and/or other milestones, it is unclear if the Company will ever be required to make such payments.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and the rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission requires the use of estimates and assumptions. A listing of the Company's significant accounting policies is detailed in Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.\u201d A subsection of these accounting policies has been identified by management as Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates.\u201d Critical accounting policies and estimates are those which require management to make estimates using assumptions that were uncertain at the time the estimates were made and for which the use of different assumptions, which reasonably could have been used, could have a material impact on the financial condition or results of operations.\nManagement has identified the following as Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates\u201d: Revenue Recognition, Inventories, Income Taxes, and Valuation of Long-Lived Assets, including Intangible Assets.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company complies with Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC\u201d) Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which superseded ASC Topic 605, Revenue Recognition. Under ASC 606, the Company recognizes revenue when title and risk of loss of promised goods or services have transferred to the customer at an amount that reflects the consideration the Company is expected to be entitled. Our revenue consists almost entirely of sales of our pharmaceutical products to customers, whereby we ship product to a customer pursuant to a purchase order. Revenue contracts such as these do not generally give rise to contract assets or contract liabilities because: (i) the underlying contracts generally have only a single performance obligation and (ii) we do not generally receive consideration until the performance obligation is fully satisfied. The new revenue standard also impacts the timing of the Company's revenue recognition by requiring recognition of certain contract manufacturing arrangements to change from upon shipment or delivery\u201d to over time.\u201d However, the recognition of these arrangements over time does not currently have a material impact on the Company's consolidated results of operations or financial position. The Company adopted ASC 606 using the modified retrospective method.\nWhen revenue is recognized, a simultaneous adjustment to gross sales is made for estimated chargebacks, rebates, returns, promotional adjustments and other potential adjustments. These provisions are primarily estimated based on historical experience, future expectations, contractual arrangements with wholesalers and indirect customers and other factors known to management at the time of accrual. Accruals for provisions are presented in the Consolidated Financial Statements as a reduction to gross sales with the corresponding reserve presented as a reduction of accounts receivable or included as rebates payable, depending on the nature of the reserve.\nProvisions for chargebacks, rebates, returns and other adjustments require varying degrees of subjectivity. While rebates generally are based on contractual terms and require minimal estimation, chargebacks and returns require management to make more subjective assumptions. Each major category is discussed in detail below:\nChargebacks\nThe provision for chargebacks is the most significant and complex estimate used in the recognition of revenue. The Company sells its products directly to wholesale distributors, generic distributors, retail pharmacy chains and mail-order pharmacies. The Company also sells its products indirectly to independent pharmacies, managed care organizations, hospitals, nursing homes and group purchasing organizations, collectively referred to as indirect customers.\u201d The Company enters into agreements with its indirect customers to establish pricing for certain products. The indirect customers then independently select a wholesaler from which to purchase the products. If the price paid by the indirect customers is lower than the price paid by the wholesaler, the Company will provide a credit, called a chargeback, to the wholesaler for the difference between the contractual price with the indirect customers and the wholesaler purchase price. The provision for chargebacks is based on expected sell-through levels by the Company's wholesale customers to the indirect customers and estimated wholesaler inventory levels. As sales to the large wholesale customers, such as Cardinal Health, AmerisourceBergen and McKesson increase (decrease), the reserve for chargebacks will also generally increase (decrease). However, the size of the increase (decrease) depends on product mix and the amount of sales made to indirect customers with which the Company has specific chargeback agreements. The Company continually monitors the reserve for chargebacks and makes adjustments when management believes that expected chargebacks may differ from the actual chargeback reserve.\nRebates\nRebates are offered to the Company's key chain drug store, distributor and wholesaler customers to promote customer loyalty and increase product sales. These rebate programs provide customers with credits upon attainment of pre-established volumes or attainment of net sales milestones for a specified period. Other promotional programs are incentive programs offered to the customers. Additionally, as a result of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act ( PPACA\u201d) enacted in the U.S. in March 2010, the Company participates in a new cost-sharing program for certain Medicare Part D beneficiaries designed primarily for the sale of brand drugs and certain generic drugs if their FDA approval was granted under a NDA or 505(b) NDA versus an ANDA. Drugs purchased within the Medicare Part D coverage gap (commonly referred to as the donut hole\u201d) result in additional rebates. The Company estimates the reserve for rebates and other promotional credit programs based on the specific terms in each agreement when revenue is recognized. The reserve for rebates increases (decreases) as sales to certain wholesale and retail customers increase (decrease). However, since these rebate programs are not identical for all customers, the size of the reserve will depend on the mix of sales to customers that are eligible to receive rebates.\nReturns\nConsistent with industry practice, the Company has a product returns policy that allows customers to return product within a specified time period prior to and subsequent to the product's expiration date in exchange for a credit to be applied to future purchases. The Company's policy requires that the customer obtain pre-approval from the Company for any qualifying return. The Company estimates its provision for returns based on historical experience, changes to business practices, credit terms and any extenuating circumstances known to management. While historical experience has allowed for reasonable estimations in the past, future returns may or may not follow historical trends. The Company continually monitors the reserve for returns and makes adjustments when management believes that actual product returns may differ from the established reserve. Generally, the reserve for returns increases as net sales increase.\nOther Adjustments\nOther adjustments consist primarily of price adjustments, also known as shelf-stock adjustments\u201d and price protections,\u201d which are both credits issued to reflect increases or decreases in the invoice or contract prices of the Company's products. In the case of a price decrease, a credit is given for product remaining in customer's inventories at the time of the price reduction. Contractual price protection results in a similar credit when the invoice or contract prices of the Company's products increase, effectively allowing customers to purchase products at previous prices for a specified period of time. Amounts recorded for estimated shelf-stock adjustments and price protections are based upon specified terms with direct customers, estimated changes in market prices and estimates of inventory held by customers. The Company regularly monitors these and other factors and evaluates the reserve as additional information becomes available. Other adjustments also include prompt payment discounts and failure-to-supply\u201d adjustments. If the Company is unable to fulfill certain customer orders, the customer can purchase products from our competitors at their prices and charge the Company for any difference in our contractually agreed upon prices.\nInventories\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value determined by the first-in, first-out method. Inventories are regularly reviewed and write-downs for excess and obsolete inventory are recorded based primarily on current inventory levels, expiration date and estimated sales forecasts. While estimated sales forecasts are subjective in nature, the projections allow management to reasonably predict the net realizable value of current inventory based on expected demand. A decrease in the estimated sales forecasts would indicate the need to write-down excess and obsolete inventory. Management continuously monitors the market activity and assesses inventory levels.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company uses the liability method to account for income taxes as prescribed by ASC 740, Income Taxes. Deferred taxes are recorded to reflect the tax consequences on future years of events that the Company has already recognized in the financial statement or tax returns. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are adjusted to recognize the effect of changes in tax law or tax rates in the period during which the new law is enacted. Under ASC 740, Income Taxes, a valuation allowance is required when it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized through generating sufficient future taxable income. Failure to achieve forecasted taxable income in applicable tax jurisdictions could affect the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets and could result in an increase in the Company's effective tax rate on future earnings.\nThe Company may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position claimed on a tax return only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position should be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. The benefit from uncertain tax positions recorded in the financial statements was immaterial for all periods presented.\nThe Company's future effective income tax rate is highly reliant on future projections of taxable income, tax legislation, and potential tax planning strategies. A change in any of these factors could materially affect the effective income tax rate of the Company in future periods.\nValuation of Long-Lived Assets, including Intangible Assets\nThe Company's long-lived assets primarily consist of property, plant and equipment and definite-lived intangible assets.\nProperty, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is computed on a straight-line basis over the assets' estimated useful lives, generally for periods ranging from 5 to 39 years. Definite-lived intangible assets are stated at cost less accumulated amortization and are amortized on a straight-line basis over the assets' estimated useful lives, generally for periods ranging from 5 to 15 years. The Company continually evaluates the reasonableness of the useful lives of these assets.\nProperty, plant and equipment and definite-lived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances ( triggering events\u201d) indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. The nature and timing of triggering events by their very nature are unpredictable; however, management regularly considers the performance of an asset as compared to its expectations, industry events, industry and economic trends, as well as any other relevant information known to management when determining if a triggering event occurred.\nIf a triggering event is determined to have occurred, the first step in the impairment test is to compare the asset's carrying value to the undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the carrying value exceeds the undiscounted cash flows of the asset, then an impairment exists. An impairment loss is measured as the excess of the asset's carrying value over its fair value, which in most cases is calculated using a discounted cash flow model. Discounted cash flow models are highly reliant on various assumptions which are considered Level 3 inputs, including estimates of future cash flows (including long-term growth rates), discount rates and the probability of achieving the estimated cash flows. Management regularly reviews estimated future cash flows for reasonableness and considers how recent activity, including a triggering event, may impact those projections. Management also compares various industry benchmarks when determining the discount rate to use in an impairment. A higher (lower) estimate of future cash flows and/or discount rate would result in a larger (smaller) impairment. assessment. The judgments made in determining the estimated fair value can materially impact our results of operations. There can be no assurances as to when, or if, future impairments may occur.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, which changes the impairment model used to measure credit losses for most financial assets. We are required to recognize an allowance that reflects the Company's current estimate of credit losses expected to be incurred over the life of the financial asset, including trade receivables. The Company adopted this guidance in the first quarter of Fiscal 2021. The adoption of ASU 2016-13 did not have a material impact on the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021.\nIn August 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-06, Debt - Debt with Conversion and Other Options and Derivatives and Hedging - Contracts in Entity's Own Equity, with changes to modify and simplify the application of U.S. GAAP for certain financial instruments with characteristics of liabilities and equity. ASU 2020-06 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021, including interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted. The ASU requires adoption using either the retrospective basis or the modified retrospective basis. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of ASU 2020-06 on its Consolidated Financial Statements.", "summary": "- Lannett Company, Inc., a Delaware corporation and its subsidiaries

following discussion and analysis describes significant changes in the financial condition and results of operations, as well as liquidity and capital resources of the Company. Additionally, it addresses accounting policies and estimates that management has deemed are critical accounting policies and estimates.\u201d This discussion and analysis is intended as a supplement to and should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements and other sections of this Form 10-K.\nThe following discussion contains forward-looking statements. You should refer to the Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d set forth in Part I of this Annual Report.\nWe report financial information on a quarterly and fiscal year basis with the most recent being the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021. All references herein to a fiscal year\u201d or Fiscal\u201d refer to the applicable fiscal year ended June 30.\nCompany Overview\nLannett Company, Inc. (a Delaware corporation) and its subsidiaries (collectively, the Company\u201d, Lannett\u201d, we\u201d or us\u201d) primarily develop, manufacture, package, market and distribute solid oral and extended release (tablets and capsules), topical, liquids, nasal and oral solution finished dosage forms of drugs, generic forms of both small molecule and biologic medications, that address a wide range of therapeutic areas. Certain of these products are manufactured by others and distributed by the Company. Additionally, the Company is pursuing partnerships, research contracts and internal expansion for the development and production of other dosage forms including: ophthalmic, nasal, patch, foam, buccal, sublingual, suspensions, soft gel, injectable and oral dosages.\nThe Company operates pharmaceutical manufacturing plants in Carmel, New York and Seymour, Indiana. The Company's customers include generic pharmaceutical distributors, drug wholesalers, chain drug stores, private label distributors, mail-order pharmacies, other pharmaceutical manufacturers, managed care organizations, hospital buying groups, governmental entities and health maintenance organizations.\nImpact of COVID-19 Pandemic\nIn December 2019, the COVID-19 virus emerged in Wuhan, China and spread to other parts of the world. In March 2020, the World Health Organization ( WHO\u201d) designated COVID-19 a global pandemic. Governments on the national, state and local level in the United States, and around the world, have implemented lockdown and shelter-in-place orders, requiring many non-essential businesses to shut down operations for the time being. The Company's business, however, is deemed essential\u201d and it has continued to operate and has continued to manufacture and distribute its medicines to customers. The Company has developed a comprehensive plan that enables it to maintain operational continuity with an emphasis on manufacturing, distribution and R&D facilities during this crisis, and to date, has not encountered any significant obstacles implementing its business continuity plans. However, the Company continually assesses COVID-19 related developments and adjusts its risk mitigation planning and business continuity activities as needed.\nIn mid-March, 2020, the Company instituted a work from home process for all employees, other than employees in our manufacturing plants, distribution center, and R&D facilities which support manufacturing. For employees who cannot perform their job remotely, the Company has implemented enhanced cleaning and sanitizing procedures, weekly fogging and provided additional personal hygiene supplies and personal protective equipment such as rubber gloves, N95 respirators and powered air-purifying respirator that are in line with Centers for Disease Control and Preventions ( CDC\u201d) recommendations. The Company has also implemented thermal screening for all employees and visitors entering its facilities. Employees are required to adhere to the CDC guidelines, social distancing and any employee experiencing any symptoms of COVID-19 is required to stay home and seek medical attention. Any employee who tests positive for COVID-19 is required to quarantine and is not allowed to return to the facilities without a physician's release. The Company has closed its facilities to outside persons that are not critical to continuing our operations. In cases where they are essential, visitors undergo a pre-admittance check to include a thermal screening and risk evaluation. The Company has experienced an increase in absenteeism arising from intermittent spikes in cases across the country, which has caused an increase in overtime and cost to produce the products, but to date the rate of employee absenteeism has not had any material effect on the Company's business or its ability to manufacture and distribute products and plants continue to operate at normal capacity. As the pandemic continues to linger due to variants or limited vaccine supplies, there is an ongoing risk of employee absenteeism which could materially impact the Company's operations. To date, the Company's work from home process has not materially impacted the Company's financial reporting systems or controls over financial reporting and disclosures nor do we expect that the remote work arrangement will have a material impact in the future.\nCurrently and as anticipated for the near future, the supply chain supporting the Company's products remains intact, enabling the Company to receive sufficient inventory of the key materials needed across the Company's network. The Company is experiencing some delays and allocations for certain API and other raw materials of higher demand, which, to date, have not had a material impact on its results of operations. However, the Company is regularly communicating with its suppliers, third-party partners, customers, healthcare providers and government officials in order to respond rapidly to any issues as they arise. The longer the current situation continues, it is more likely that the Company may experience some sort of interruption to its supply chain, and such an interruption could materially affect its business, including but not limited to, our ability to timely manufacture and distribute its products as well as unfavorably impact our results of operations. Additionally, subsequent to an initial stocking up of supplies at the start of the pandemic, the total volume of drug prescriptions written during the pandemic has decreased causing less demand for our products. Specifically, the pandemic has resulted in fewer elective surgeries being performed, causing less demand for our Numbrino cocaine hydrochloride product.\nAs a result of the pandemic, certain clinical trials which were underway or scheduled to begin were temporarily placed on hold, although all such clinical trials were resumed and have been completed. Such delays impacted the Company's timing for filing applications for product approvals with the FDA as well as related timing of FDA approval of such filings. Additionally, the pandemic has slowed down the Company's efforts to expand its product portfolio through acquisitions and distribution opportunities, impacting the speed with which the Company is able to bring additional products to market. While there have been some efforts by some of our customers to increase their inventory levels for the Company's products in the near term, the Company has not seen significant increases in demand. The Company does not anticipate any significant changes in demand for its products in the future, however, depending on the duration and severity of the outbreak, levels of demand may change.\nIn light of the economic impacts of COVID-19, the Company reviewed the assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of June 30, 2021, including intangible and other long-lived assets. Based on our review, the Company determined that no impairments or other write-downs specifically related to COVID-19 were necessary during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021. Our assessment is based on information currently available and is highly reliant on various assumptions. Changes in market conditions could impact the Company's future outlook and may lead to impairments in the future.\nBased on the foregoing, the Company cannot reasonably predict the ultimate impact of COVID-19 on our future results of operations and cash flows due to the continued uncertainty around the duration and severity of the pandemic.\n2020 Restructuring Plan\nOn July 10, 2020, the Board of Directors authorized a restructuring and cost savings plan (the 2020 Restructuring Plan\u201d) to enhance manufacturing efficiencies, streamline operations and reduce the Company's cost structure. The 2020 Restructuring Plan was implemented, in part, as a result of previously anticipated near-term competition and pricing pressure with respect to certain key products. The 2020 Restructuring Plan included lowering operating costs and reducing the workforce by approximately 80 positions. The 2020 Restructuring Plan was initiated on July 13, 2020 and completed as of December 31, 2020.\nThe Company incurred approximately $4.0 million in severance-related costs in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021, in connection with the 2020 Restructuring Plan. The Company expects the 2020 Restructuring Plan to result in annual cost savings in excess of $15.0 million.\nClimate Change\nThe Company believes in a more sustainable future with a reduced environmental footprint, effective use of natural resources and a multi-pronged approach to reducing our effect on the climate while maintaining our focus on providing affordable medicines to our customers and ultimately the patients who depend on them. Commitment to this belief, however, may come at increased costs to the Company including, but not limited to, capital investments, additional management and compliance costs, and reduced output, all of which may be material. Costs incurred by our suppliers and vendors to comply with their own sustainability commitments may also be passed through the supply chain resulting in higher operational costs to the Company. Climate change and the associated risks continues to evolve over time and could materially impact the Company's results of operations and cash flows in any given year. The Company monitors such changes and strives to address these risks in a timely manner.\nResults of Operations - Fiscal 2021 compared to Fiscal 2020\nNet sales decreased 12% to $478.8 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021. The following table identifies the Company's net product sales by medical indication for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2021 and 2020.\n\nThe decrease in net sales was driven by a decrease in the selling price of products of $90.1 million partially offset by increased volumes of $23.1 million. The decrease in the selling price of products was primarily driven by lower sales prices of Fluphenazine, which is included within the Anti-Psychosis medical indication, and Posaconazole, which is included in Infectious Disease medical indication, due to new competitors entering the market, as well as lower average selling price across the remaining medical indications. Overall volumes increased primarily due to increased volumes of Posaconazole and from new product launches, including Levothyroxine Tablets and Capsules, partially offset by lower volumes of Fluphenazine. The Company has seen increased competitive market pressure in recent years, which has resulted in overall decreases in selling prices of products and sales volume across our product portfolio. We have partially offset these competitive pressures with new product launches and will continue to seek opportunities for additional launches.\nIn January 2017, a provision in the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 required drug manufacturers to pay additional rebates to state Medicaid programs if the prices of their generic drugs rise at a rate faster than inflation. The provision negatively impacted the Company's net sales by $18.9 million and $35.7 million in Fiscal 2021 and Fiscal 2020, respectively, which contributed to the overall decreased average selling price.\nThe following chart details price and volume changes by medical indication between Fiscal 2021 and Fiscal 2020:\n\nThe Company sells its products to customers through various distribution channels. The table below presents the Company's net sales to each distribution channel for the fiscal year ended June 30:\n\nThe overall decrease in sales was primarily driven by lower sales of Fluphenazine and Posaconazole due to new competitors entering the market partially offset by sales from new product launches. The Company has seen increased competitive market pressure in recent years, which has resulted in overall decrease in sales to the distribution channels above. We have partially offset these competitive pressures with new product launches and will continue to seek opportunities for additional launches.\nCocaine Hydrochloride Solution\nIn December 2017, a competitor received approval from the FDA to market and sell a Cocaine Hydrochloride topical product. In March 2018, in accordance with FDA guidance, the FDA requested the Company cease manufacturing and distributing our unapproved cocaine hydrochloride solution product as a result of an approved product on the market. The Company committed to not manufacture or distribute cocaine hydrochloride 10% solution, which was not sold during Fiscal 2019, and also ceased manufacturing its unapproved cocaine hydrochloride 4% solution on June 15, 2019 and ceased distributing the product on August 15, 2019.\nThe competitor filed a series of Citizen Petitions beginning in 2019, seeking to block approval of the Company's Section 505(b)(2) NDA for its cocaine hydrochloride solution product by claiming that the grant of the New Chemical Entity ( NCE\u201d) exclusivity issued to the competitor blocks the approval of the Company's application for five years. Following the FDA's rejection of the competitor's argument and approval of the Company's Section 505(b)(2) NDA, the competitor filed two lawsuits against the FDA (one in federal court in the District of Columbia and one in federal court in the District of Maryland) seeking a court order in two different federal courts directing the FDA to withdraw approval of the Section 505(b)(2) NDA. To date, neither court has directed the FDA to withdraw the NDA. The Company has intervened in both lawsuits and there are currently cross motions for summary judgment pending in the case filed in federal court for the District of Columbia and a motion to dismiss the complaint filed in the federal court for the District of Maryland.\nSeparately, on June 6, 2020, the competitor filed a patent infringement complaint, since amended, in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware, asserting that the Company's approved cocaine hydrochloride product infringes six patents issued to the competitor. The Company filed an answer and counterclaim, alleging that the Company either does not infringe or that the six asserted patents and three additional unasserted patents are invalid. The competitor filed a motion to partially dismiss a portion of the counterclaim as to the unasserted patents. The motion to dismiss is pending a determination by the court and discovery is ongoing. The Company continues to market its approved cocaine hydrochloride product.\nOn August 16, 2021, the Company and the competitor reached an agreement in principle to amicably resolve all pending cases, including the cases in the federal courts in the District of Columbia, District of Maryland and District of Delaware. The parties are working to negotiate and finalize the settlement documents over the next 45 days and have filed motions in each of the courts to stay the cases pending the finalization of the settlement documents.\nThalomid\u00ae\nThe Company filed with the FDA an ANDA No. 206601, along with a paragraph IV certification, alleging that the fifteen patents associated with the Thalomid drug product are invalid, unenforceable and/or not infringed. On January 30, 2015, Celgene Corporation and Children's Medical Center Corporation filed a patent infringement lawsuit in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey, alleging that the Company's filing of ANDA No. 206601 constitutes an act of patent infringement and seeking a declaration that the patents at issue are valid and infringed. A settlement agreement was reached, and the Court dismissed the lawsuit in October 2017. Pursuant to the settlement agreement, the Company entered into a license agreement that permitted Lannett to manufacture and market in the U.S. its generic thalidomide product as of August 1, 2019 or earlier under certain circumstances. In the second quarter of Fiscal 2019, the Company received a Major Complete Response Letter ( CRL\u201d) related to issues at its API supplier. The Company filed a response to the CRL. The Company received a second Major CRL in the first quarter of Fiscal 2020 related to continued issues at the API supplier, as well as issues with the Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy ( REMS\u201d) program hosted by Celgene. On March 26, 2021, the Company received a third Major CRL from the FDA relating to continuing issues with the API supplier. The Company is working on addressing the FDA comments and cannot reasonably predict timing of the product launch.\nRanitidine Oral Solution, USP\nAs part of an industry-wide action, the Company issued a voluntary recall on all lots within expiry of Ranitidine Syrup (Ranitidine Oral Solution, USP), 15mg/mL to the consumer level due to levels of N-Nitrosodimethylamine ( NDMA\u201d), a probable human carcinogen, above the levels recently established by the FDA. On September 17, 2019, the FDA notified the Company about the possible presence of NDMA in its Ranitidine Oral Solution product and the Company immediately commenced testing and analysis of the active pharmaceutical ingredient ( API\u201d) and drug product and confirmed the presence of NDMA. The Company's net sales of Ranitidine Oral Solution in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019 totaled $1.9 million. On April 1, 2020, the FDA ordered all Ranitidine products (including the Company's product) withdrawn from the U.S. market and provided guidance on the requirements for submitting additional information to the FDA in order to re-introduce the product to the market. Since initiating the voluntary recall, the Company has not been marketing its Ranitidine Oral Solution product and has no future plans to attempt to re-introduce the product at this time. The Company does not believe the recall will have a significant impact on our future expected financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nOn June 1, 2020, a class action complaint was served upon the Company and approximately forty-five (45) other companies asserting claims for personal injury arising from the presence of NDMA in Ranitidine products. The complaint is consolidated in a multidistrict litigation ( MDL\u201d) pending in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida. Similar complaints were filed in state court in New Mexico and state court in Maryland and served upon the Company. Subsequently, a number of similar complaints were served on the Company. The Company has filed a motion to dismiss the complaint filed in the MDL which, on December 31, 2020, was granted with leave to amend as to certain of the claims. The plaintiffs filed a First Amended complaint on February 9, 2021, to which the generic manufacturer defendants, including the Company, filed a renewed motion to dismiss all claims. On July 8, 2021, the Court issued an Order granting the motion and dismissing all claims with prejudice based on federal preemption. Separately, the New Mexico case was conditionally transferred to the MDL, but ultimately remanded back to the state court. Since the Company was not licensed to do business in New Mexico and, based upon the information received to date, did not sell Ranitidine in New Mexico, we plan to file a motion to dismiss based, among other things, federal preemption and lack of jurisdiction. Separately, the Company filed a notice to remove and transfer the Maryland case to the MDL which the plaintiff has opposed. On April 1, 2021, the case was remanded back to the state court. On August 17, 2021, Helena Hilbert & William Hilbert III, Individually and on behalf of their minor child \"WH\", filed a complaint in the Philadelphia Court of Common Pleas against the Company and approximately seven other defendants, alleging personal injury as a result of using the Company's Ranitidine products. The Company intends to file a motion to dismiss all of the pending state claims, among other reasons, based on federal preemption. The Company has placed its insurance carrier on notice of the claim and the carrier has appointed counsel to defend the Company.\nCost of Sales, including amortization of intangibles. Cost of sales, including amortization of intangibles, for Fiscal 2021 increased 6% to $403.2 million from $380.5 million in the same prior-year period. The increase was attributable to an increase of $13.2 million in write-downs for excess and obsolete inventory, which primarily relates to the Company's decision to discontinue 23 lower margin product lines, as well as additional volumes from new product launches. The Company also recorded $5.0 million in consideration to renew the Company's distribution agreement with Recro Gainesville, LLC ( Recro\u201d) during the second quarter of Fiscal Year 2021.\nGross Profit. Gross profit for Fiscal 2021 decreased 54% to $75.6 million or 16% of total net sales. In comparison, gross profit for Fiscal 2020 was $165.2 million or 30% of total net sales. The decrease in gross profit percentage was primarily attributable to lower volumes of Fluphenazine, which had higher than average gross profit margins, as well as overall lower average selling prices of our products. The Company also recorded an increase in the write-downs for excess and obsolete inventory as well as consideration to renew the distribution agreement with Recro in the second quarter of Fiscal 2021.\nResearch and Development Expenses. Research and development expenses decreased 19% to $24.2 million in Fiscal 2021 from $30.0 million in Fiscal 2020. The decrease was primarily due to lower R&D expenses as a result of timing of certain milestones related to product development projects as well as employee headcount reductions related to the 2020 Restructuring Plan.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased 14% to $68.1 million in Fiscal 2021 compared with $79.5 million in Fiscal 2020. The decrease was primarily driven by a lower branded prescription drug fee, lower incentive-based compensation, lower expenses at the Company's Cody Labs subsidiary and other cost reduction initiatives.\nAsset impairment charges. In Fiscal 2021, the Company recorded various asset impairment charges totaling $216.6 million. The Company reviewed its product portfolio during Fiscal 2021 and decided to discontinue 23 lower gross margin product lines, including product lines that were acquired through various past business and product acquisitions. As a result of the discontinuance and the reduction in net sales and gross margin of certain other product lines, the Company recorded an impairment charge of $193.0 million related to the KUPI product rights intangible assets. The impairment charge is primarily a result of the decline in net sales and gross margin of certain product lines acquired in connection with the KUPI acquisition, including those product lines being discontinued. In addition, the Company recorded a $17.0 million impairment charge to its intangible asset for a distribution and supply agreement with Cediprof, Inc., which is included within the other product rights category of definite-lived intangible assets, as a result of increased competition and lower projected cash flows for the Levothyroxine product. The Company also recorded a $5.0 million impairment charge to its KUPI in-process research and development intangible asset due to delays in the expected launch of a product within the portfolio, which results in reduced projected cash flows. See Note 8 Goodwill and Intangible Assets\u201d for more information.\nOther Loss. Interest expense for the year ended June 30, 2021 totaled $53.8 million compared to $66.8 million for the year ended June 30, 2020. The decrease was due to a lower average debt balance in Fiscal 2021 as compared to the prior-year as well as a lower weighted-average interest rate due to the full repayment of the outstanding Term Loan A in November 2020. The weighted average interest rate for Fiscal 2021 and 2020 was 8.0% and 8.8%, respectively. The Company also recorded a $10.3 million loss on extinguishment of debt related to the payoff of the Term Loan B Facility during Fiscal 2021.\nIncome Tax. The Company recorded income tax expense in Fiscal 2021 of $60.6 million compared to income tax benefit of $15.3 million in Fiscal 2020. The effective tax rate for Fiscal 2021 was (20.0)%, compared to 31.4% for Fiscal 2020. The income tax expense recorded in Fiscal 2021 was primarily driven by the full valuation allowance recorded against the Company's deferred tax assets. See Note 17 Income Taxes\u201d for more information.\nNet Loss. For the year ended June 30, 2021, the Company reported net loss of $363.5 million, or $(9.23) per diluted share. Comparatively, net loss in the corresponding prior-year period was $33.4 million, or $(0.86) per diluted share.\nResults of Operations - Fiscal 2020 compared to Fiscal 2019\nNet sales decreased 17% to $545.7 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020. The following table identifies the Company's net product sales by medical indication for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2020 and 2019. The medical indication categories for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019 were reclassified to better align with industry standards and the Company's peers.\n\nThe decrease in net sales was driven by decreased volumes of $79.4 million and, to a lesser extent, decreased average selling price of products of $30.3 million. Overall volumes decreased primarily due to the loss of Levothyroxine sales associated with the expiration of the JSP Distribution Agreement, partially offset by additional volumes from product launches and increased market share in certain key products. Average selling prices were impacted by product mix and price decreases in certain key products due to competitive pricing pressures. Although the Company has benefited in the past from favorable pricing trends, these trends have reversed. Net sales within the infectious disease category increased significantly as a result of the distribution and supply agreement with Sinotherapeutics Inc., which was signed in August 2019, to distribute Posaconazole tablets.\nIn January 2017, a provision in the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 required drug manufacturers to pay additional rebates to state Medicaid programs if the prices of their generic drugs rise at a rate faster than inflation. The provision negatively impacted the Company's net sales by $35.7 million and $30.8 million in Fiscal 2020 and Fiscal 2019, respectively, which contributed to the overall decreased average selling price.\nThe following chart details price and volume changes by medical indication between Fiscal 2020 and Fiscal 2019:\n\nThe Company sells its products to customers through various distribution channels. The table below presents the Company's net sales to each distribution channel for the fiscal year ended June 30:\n\nOverall net sales decreased primarily due to the loss of the Levothyroxine sales associated with the expiration of the JSP Distribution Agreement, partially offset by additional volumes from product launches and increased market share in certain key products. The decrease in sales to wholesalers, as well as mail-order pharmacies, was also primarily due to the loss of Levothyroxine sales.\nCost of Sales, including amortization of intangibles. Cost of sales, including amortization of intangibles, for Fiscal 2020 decreased 8% to $380.5 million from $411.8 million in the same prior-year period. The decrease was primarily attributable to the loss of Levothyroxine sales associated with the expiration of the JSP Distribution Agreement as well as lower cost of sales as a result of the Company's decision to cease operations at Cody Labs, partially offset by additional volumes of other products sold as well as increased product royalties expense related to various distribution agreements.\nGross Profit. Gross profit for Fiscal 2020 decreased 32% to $165.2 million or 30% of total net sales. In comparison, gross profit for Fiscal 2019 was $243.6 million or 37% of total net sales. The decrease in gross profit percentage was primarily attributable to the loss of Levothyroxine sales associated with the expiration of the JSP Distribution Agreement, which had higher than average gross profit margins, price decreases across our product portfolio as well as increased product royalties related to various distribution agreements, partially offset by manufacturing efficiencies as a result of cost reduction initiatives and an increase in volumes of certain key products with higher than average gross margins.\nResearch and Development Expenses. Research and development expenses decreased 23% to $30.0 million in Fiscal 2020 from $38.8 million in Fiscal 2019. The decrease was primarily due to lower R&D expenses as a result of the Company's decision to cease operations at Cody Labs as well as the timing of certain milestones related to product development projects.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased 9% to $79.5 million in Fiscal 2020 compared with $87.6 million in Fiscal 2019. The decrease was primarily driven by lower financial advisory costs, a decrease in regulatory-related costs, lower expenses at the Company's Cody Labs subsidiary and other cost reduction initiatives, partially offset by a branded prescription drug fee as well as increased legal costs.\nAsset impairment charges. In Fiscal 2020, the Company recorded various asset impairment charges totaling $34.4 million. During Fiscal 2020, the Company performed an impairment analysis of its AB-rated Methylphenidate Hydrochloride product, which is distributed under a license agreement with Andor, due to significant declines in the projected profitability of the distribution arrangement. As a result of the analysis, the Company recorded a $14.0 million impairment charge. The Company also performed an annual impairment analysis of our indefinite-lived intangible assets. As a result, the Company recorded a $9.0 million and an $8.0 million impairment charge to its KUPI IPR&D and Silarx IPR&D assets, respectively, due to the abandonment of several pipeline products within both portfolios. The Company recorded a ROU lease asset totaling $1.2 million related to an existing lease at Cody Labs upon adoption of ASU No. 2016-02 and subsequently recorded a full impairment of the asset as a result of the decision to cease operations at Cody Labs.\nOther Income (Loss). Interest expense for the year ended June 30, 2020 totaled $66.8 million compared to $84.6 million for the year ended June 30, 2019. The decrease was due to a lower average debt balance in Fiscal 2020 as compared to the prior-year period as well as a lower weighted-average interest rate due to the partial repayment of the outstanding Term Loan A balance with proceeds from the issuance of the 4.50% Convertible Senior Notes. The weighted average interest rate for Fiscal 2020 and 2019 was 8.8% and 9.7%, respectively. Investment income totaled $1.6 million in Fiscal 2020 compared with $3.2 million in Fiscal 2019.\nIncome Tax. The Company recorded income tax benefit in Fiscal 2020 of $15.3 million compared to income tax benefit of $74.1 million in Fiscal 2019. The effective tax rate for Fiscal 2020 was 31.4%, compared to 21.4% for Fiscal 2019. The effective tax rate for the period ended June 30, 2020 was higher compared to the same prior-year period primarily due to the impact of the CARES Act which allowed the Company to carryback its 2020 taxable loss into its Fiscal 2015 tax year, where the statutory tax rate was 35%. The increase was slightly offset by excess tax shortfalls related to stock compensation as well as a non-deductible branded prescription drug fee.\nNet Income (Loss). For the year ended June 30, 2020, the Company reported net loss of $33.4 million, or $(0.86) per diluted share. Comparatively, net loss in the corresponding prior-year period was $272.1 million, or $(7.20) per diluted share.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nCash Flow\nThe Company finances its operations with cash flow generated from operations and has $45.0 million available to draw upon under the Amended ABL Credit Facility, which is discussed further below. At June 30, 2021, working capital was $263.1 million as compared to $228.3 million at June 30, 2020, an increase of $34.8 million. Current product portfolio sales as well as sales related to future product approvals are anticipated to continue to generate positive cash flow from operations.\nNet cash provided by operating activities of $60.9 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021 reflected net loss of $363.5 million, adjustments for non-cash items of $441.0 million, as well as cash used in operating assets and liabilities of $16.6 million. In comparison, net cash from operating activities of $116.0 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020 reflected net loss of $33.4 million, adjustments for non-cash items of $110.7 million, as well as cash provided by changes in operating assets and liabilities of $38.7 million.\nSignificant changes in operating assets and liabilities from June 30, 2020 to June 30, 2021 are comprised of:\n \u25cf A decrease in accounts receivable of $26.9 million mainly due to the overall decrease in sales, as well as the timing of sales and cash receipts. The Company's days sales outstanding ( DSO\u201d) at June 30, 2021, based on gross sales for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021 and gross accounts receivable at June 30, 2021, was 77 days. The level of DSO at June 30, 2021 was comparable to the Company's expectation that DSO will be in the 70 to 85-day range based on customer payment terms. \n \u25cf An increase in income taxes receivable totaling $20.4 million primarily due to additional estimated tax refunds related to provisions of the CARES Act and an anticipated Fiscal 2021 taxable loss, partially offset by income tax receipts of $36.8 million. \n \u25cf A decrease in rebates payable of $19.2 million primarily due to lower sales of Fluphenazine in Fiscal 2021, which had higher than average government-related rebates. \n \u25cf A decrease in royalties payable of $7.1 million primarily due to lower sales of distributed products with royalty arrangements in Fiscal 2021. \n \u25cf A decrease in accrued payroll and payroll-related costs of $5.6 million primarily related to payments made in August 2020 in connection with incentive-based compensation accrued in Fiscal Year 2020 as well as lower incentive-based compensation accrued in Fiscal Year 2021. \nSignificant changes in operating assets and liabilities from June 30, 2019 to June 30, 2020 are comprised of:\n \u25cf A decrease in accounts receivable of $39.1 million mainly due to the timing of sales and cash receipts, as well as adjustments to wholesale acquisition pricing to our customers. The Company's days sales outstanding ( DSO\u201d) at June 30, 2020, based on gross sales for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020 and gross accounts receivable at June 30, 2020, was 61 days. The level of DSO at June 30, 2020 was significantly lower than the Company's expectation that DSO will be in the 70 to 85-day range based on customer payment terms, due to higher gross sales in the three months ended March 31, 2020 compared to the three months ended June 30, 2020. \n \u25cf An increase in accounts payable totaling $19.0 million primarily due to the timing of vendor invoices and payments. \n \u25cf An increase in prepaid income taxes totaling $14.5 million primarily due to the carryback of the Company's Fiscal 2020 taxable loss into the Fiscal 2015 tax year as a result of the CARES Act as well as tax payments made in Fiscal 2020. \nNet cash used in investing activities of $14.8 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021 was mainly the result of purchases of property, plant and equipment of $10.4 million and purchases of intangible assets of $4.5 million. Net cash used in investing activities of $40.0 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020 was mainly the result of purchases of intangible assets of $28.8 million and purchases of property, plant and equipment of $18.3 million, partially offset by proceeds from the sale of property, plant and equipment of $7.4 million.\nNet cash used in financing activities of $92.2 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021 was primarily due to debt repayments of $437.9 million and payment of debt issuance costs of $10.1 million, partially offset by proceeds from issuance of long-term debt of $356.2 million. The financing activities during Fiscal 2021 were primarily related to the refinancing in April 2021. Net cash used in financing activities of $71.9 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020 was due to debt repayments of $146.7 million, purchase of capped calls in connection with the 4.50% Convertible Senior Notes offering totaling $7.1 million, payments of debt issuance costs totaling $3.5 million, and purchases of treasury stock totaling $1.9 million, partially offset by proceeds from issuance of 4.50% Convertible Senior Notes of $86.3 million and proceeds from sale of stock pursuant to stock compensation plans of $1.0 million.\nCredit Facility and Other Indebtedness\nThe Company has previously entered into and may enter future agreements with various financial institutions to provide additional cash to help finance the Company's acquisitions, various capital investments and potential strategic opportunities. These borrowing arrangements as of June 30, 2021 are as follows:\n7.750% Senior Secured Notes due 2026\nOn April 22, 2021, the Company issued $350.0 million aggregate principal amount of 7.750% senior secured notes due 2026 (the Notes\u201d) in a private placement to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act\u201d) and outside the United States to persons other than U.S. persons in reliance upon Regulation S under the Securities Act. The Notes bear interest semi-annually in arrears on April 15 and October 15 of each year, beginning on October 15, 2021, at a rate of 7.750% per annum in cash. The Notes will mature on April 15, 2026, unless earlier redeemed or repurchased in accordance with their terms.\nSecond Lien Secured Loan Facility\nOn April 5, 2021, the Company entered into an Exchange Agreement with certain participating lenders to exchange a portion of their existing Term B Loans for Second Lien Loans pursuant to a new $190.0 million Second Lien Secured Loan Facility ( Second Lien Facility\u201d). On April 22, 2021, in connection with the issuance of the Notes and the entrance into the Amended ABL Credit Facility, which is discussed further below, the exchange between the Company and the participating lenders was consummated. From the Closing Date until the one-year anniversary of the Closing Date, the Second Lien Loans bear 10.0% PIK interest. Thereafter, the Second Lien notes will bear 5.0% cash interest and 5.0% PIK interest until maturity, except to the extent the Company elects to pay all or portion of the PIK interest in cash. The Second Lien Loans will mature on July 21, 2026. In connection with the Second Lien Facility, the Company issued to the Participating Lenders warrants to purchase up to 8,280,000 shares of common stock of the Company (the Warrants\u201d) at an exercise price of $6.88 per share. The Warrants were issued on April 22, 2021 with an eight-year term. The Participating Lenders received registration rights with respect to the shares of common stock of the Company to be received upon exercise of the Warrants. The holders of the Warrants are entitled to receive dividends or distributions of any kind made to the common stockholders to the same extent as if the holder had exercised the Warrant into common stock. The Warrants are considered participating securities under ASC 260, Earnings per share.\nAmended ABL Credit Facility\nOn December 7, 2020, the Company entered into a credit and guaranty agreement, which provided for an asset-based revolving credit facility (the ABL Credit Facility\u201d) of up to $30 million, subject to borrowing base availability, and included letter of credit and swing line sub-facilities. On April 22, 2021, the Company entered into an amendment to that certain Credit and Guaranty Agreement, dated as of December 7, 2020 (such agreement as so amended, the Amended ABL Credit Agreement\u201d), among the Company, certain of its wholly-owned domestic subsidiaries party thereto, as borrowers or as guarantors, Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as administrative agent and as collateral agent and the other lenders party thereto, for the purpose of, among other things, increasing the aggregate amount of the revolving credit facility from $30.0 million to $45.0 million and extending the maturity thereof to the fifth anniversary of the closing date of Notes Offering (subject to a springing maturity as set forth therein).\nThe Amended ABL Credit Agreement provides for a revolving credit facility (the Amended ABL Credit Facility\u201d) that includes letter of credit and swing line sub-facilities. Borrowing availability under the Amended ABL Credit Facility is determined by a monthly borrowing base collateral calculation that is based on specified percentages of eligible accounts receivable less certain reserves and subject to certain other adjustments as set forth in the Amended ABL Credit Agreement. Availability is reduced by issuance of letters of credit as well as any borrowings. Loans outstanding under the Amended ABL Credit Agreement bear interest at a floating rate measured by reference to, at the Company's option, either an adjusted London Inter-Bank Offered Rate ( LIBOR\u201d) (subject to a floor of 0.75%) plus an applicable margin of 2.50% per annum, or an alternate base rate plus an applicable margin of 1.50% per annum. Unused commitments under the Amended ABL Credit Facility are subject to a fee of 0.50% per annum, which fee increases to 0.75% per annum for any quarter during which the Company's average usage under the Amended ABL Credit Facility is less than $5.0 million.\nIn connection with the Second Lien Facility, the Company is required to maintain at least $5.0 million in a deposit account at all times subject to control by the Second Lien Collateral Agent, and a minimum cash balance of $15.0 million as of the last day of each month. At June 30, 2021, the Company classified the $5.0 million required deposit account balance as restricted cash, which is included in other assets caption in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\n4.50% Convertible Senior Notes due 2026\nOn September 27, 2019, the Company issued $86.3 million aggregate principal amount of the 4.50% Convertible Senior Notes (the Convertible Notes\u201d) in a private offering to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The Convertible Notes are senior unsecured obligations of the Company and bear interest at an annual rate of 4.50% payable semi-annually in arrears on April 1 and October 1 of each year, beginning on April 1, 2020. The Convertible Notes will mature on October 1, 2026, unless earlier repurchased, redeemed or converted in accordance with their terms. The Convertible Notes are convertible into shares of the Company's common stock at an initial conversion rate of 65.4022 shares per $1,000 principal amount of Convertible Notes (which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $15.29 per share), subject to adjustments upon the occurrence of certain events (but will not be adjusted for any accrued and unpaid interest). The Company may redeem all or a part of the Convertible Notes on or after October 6, 2023 at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Convertible Notes redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, up to, but excluding, the redemption date, subject to certain conditions relating to the Company's stock price having been met. Following certain corporate events that occur prior to the maturity date or if the Company delivers a notice of redemption, the Company will, in certain circumstances, increase the conversion rate for a holder who elects to convert its Convertible Notes in connection with such corporate event or notice of redemption. The indenture covering the Convertible Notes contains certain other customary terms and covenants, including that upon certain events of default occurring and continuing, either the trustee or holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the outstanding Convertible Notes may declare 100% of the principal of, and accrued and unpaid interest on, all the Convertible Notes to be due and payable.\nIn connection with the offering of the Convertible Notes, the Company also entered into privately negotiated capped call\u201d transactions with several counterparties. The capped call transaction will initially cover, subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments, the number of shares of common stock that initially underlie the Convertible Notes. The capped call transactions are expected to generally reduce the potential dilutive effect on the Company's common stock upon any conversion of the Convertible Notes with such reduction subject to a cap which is initially $19.46 per share.\nOther Liquidity Matters\nRefer to the Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic\u201d section above for the impact on our future liquidity.\nFuture Acquisitions\nWe are continuously evaluating the potential for product and company acquisitions as a part of our future growth strategy. In conjunction with a potential acquisition, the Company may utilize current resources or seek additional sources of capital to finance any such acquisition, which could have an impact on future liquidity.\nWe may also from time to time depending on market conditions and prices, contractual restrictions, our financial liquidity and other factors, seek to prepay outstanding debt or repurchase our outstanding debt through open market purchases, privately negotiated purchases, or otherwise. The amounts involved in any such transactions, individually or in the aggregate, may be material and may be funded from available cash or from additional borrowings.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table represents material annual contractual obligations as of June 30, 2021:\n\n (1) Long-term debt amounts above relate to principal amounts due for the Notes, Second Lien Facility, and the Convertible Notes. Interest on obligations primarily consists of cash interest on the Notes, Second Lien Facility and the Convertible Notes. PIK interest on the Second Lien Facility is due upon maturity and is also included in the interest on obligations line above. However, following the one-year anniversary of the closing date of the Second Lien Facility, the Company may elect to pay in cash any interest required to be paid in the form of PIK interest. Refer to Note 9 Long-Term Debt\u201d for additional information. \n (2) Operating lease obligations primarily relate to an eight-year lease for the Company's headquarters in Trevose, Pennsylvania as well as a 116,000 square foot leased warehouse in Seymour, Indiana. \n (3) The asset purchase payment obligation above refers to the consideration due to Andor Pharmaceuticals, LLC for the AB-rated Methylphenidate Hydrochloride perpetual license agreement. \nIn the normal course of business, the Company may enter into noncancelable purchase orders for API and has various ongoing capital expenditure projects that may result in contractual obligations. Under the terms of the License and Collaboration Agreement with HEC to develop an insulin glargine product, the Company agreed to fund up to the initial $32 million of the development costs and split 50/50 any development costs in excess thereof. As of June 30, 2021, the Company has incurred approximately $4 million of development costs towards the $32 million commitment made by the Company. Under the terms of a separate License and Collaboration Agreement with HEC and affiliates to develop a biosimilar insulin aspart product, the Company agreed to fund up to the initial $32 million of the development costs, provided that if total development and other costs paid by Lannett are less than $32 million then the difference will be paid to Sunshine over the first year of commercialization. As of June 30, 2021, the Company has not yet incurred material costs towards the $32 million commitment made by the Company. Refer to Note 11 Commitments\u201d for additional information.\nResearch and Development Arrangements\nIn the normal course of business, the Company has entered into certain research and development and other arrangements. As part of these arrangements, the Company has agreed to certain contingent payments, which generally become due and payable only upon the achievement of certain developmental, regulatory, commercial and/or other milestones. In addition, under certain arrangements, we may be required to make royalty payments based on a percentage of future sales, or other metric, for products currently in development in the event that the Company begins to market and sell the product. Due to the inherent uncertainty related to these developmental, regulatory, commercial and/or other milestones, it is unclear if the Company will ever be required to make such payments.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and the rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission requires the use of estimates and assumptions. A listing of the Company's significant accounting policies is detailed in Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.\u201d A subsection of these accounting policies has been identified by management as Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates.\u201d Critical accounting policies and estimates are those which require management to make estimates using assumptions that were uncertain at the time the estimates were made and for which the use of different assumptions, which reasonably could have been used, could have a material impact on the financial condition or results of operations.\nManagement has identified the following as Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates\u201d: Revenue Recognition, Inventories, Income Taxes, and Valuation of Long-Lived Assets, including Intangible Assets.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company complies with Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC\u201d) Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which superseded ASC Topic 605, Revenue Recognition. Under ASC 606, the Company recognizes revenue when title and risk of loss of promised goods or services have transferred to the customer at an amount that reflects the consideration the Company is expected to be entitled. Our revenue consists almost entirely of sales of our pharmaceutical products to customers, whereby we ship product to a customer pursuant to a purchase order. Revenue contracts such as these do not generally give rise to contract assets or contract liabilities because: (i) the underlying contracts generally have only a single performance obligation and (ii) we do not generally receive consideration until the performance obligation is fully satisfied. The new revenue standard also impacts the timing of the Company's revenue recognition by requiring recognition of certain contract manufacturing arrangements to change from upon shipment or delivery\u201d to over time.\u201d However, the recognition of these arrangements over time does not currently have a material impact on the Company's consolidated results of operations or financial position. The Company adopted ASC 606 using the modified retrospective method.\nWhen revenue is recognized, a simultaneous adjustment to gross sales is made for estimated chargebacks, rebates, returns, promotional adjustments and other potential adjustments. These provisions are primarily estimated based on historical experience, future expectations, contractual arrangements with wholesalers and indirect customers and other factors known to management at the time of accrual. Accruals for provisions are presented in the Consolidated Financial Statements as a reduction to gross sales with the corresponding reserve presented as a reduction of accounts receivable or included as rebates payable, depending on the nature of the reserve.\nProvisions for chargebacks, rebates, returns and other adjustments require varying degrees of subjectivity. While rebates generally are based on contractual terms and require minimal estimation, chargebacks and returns require management to make more subjective assumptions. Each major category is discussed in detail below:\nChargebacks\nThe provision for chargebacks is the most significant and complex estimate used in the recognition of revenue. The Company sells its products directly to wholesale distributors, generic distributors, retail pharmacy chains and mail-order pharmacies. The Company also sells its products indirectly to independent pharmacies, managed care organizations, hospitals, nursing homes and group purchasing organizations, collectively referred to as indirect customers.\u201d The Company enters into agreements with its indirect customers to establish pricing for certain products. The indirect customers then independently select a wholesaler from which to purchase the products. If the price paid by the indirect customers is lower than the price paid by the wholesaler, the Company will provide a credit, called a chargeback, to the wholesaler for the difference between the contractual price with the indirect customers and the wholesaler purchase price. The provision for chargebacks is based on expected sell-through levels by the Company's wholesale customers to the indirect customers and estimated wholesaler inventory levels. As sales to the large wholesale customers, such as Cardinal Health, AmerisourceBergen and McKesson increase (decrease), the reserve for chargebacks will also generally increase (decrease). However, the size of the increase (decrease) depends on product mix and the amount of sales made to indirect customers with which the Company has specific chargeback agreements. The Company continually monitors the reserve for chargebacks and makes adjustments when management believes that expected chargebacks may differ from the actual chargeback reserve.\nRebates\nRebates are offered to the Company's key chain drug store, distributor and wholesaler customers to promote customer loyalty and increase product sales. These rebate programs provide customers with credits upon attainment of pre-established volumes or attainment of net sales milestones for a specified period. Other promotional programs are incentive programs offered to the customers. Additionally, as a result of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act ( PPACA\u201d) enacted in the U.S. in March 2010, the Company participates in a new cost-sharing program for certain Medicare Part D beneficiaries designed primarily for the sale of brand drugs and certain generic drugs if their FDA approval was granted under a NDA or 505(b) NDA versus an ANDA. Drugs purchased within the Medicare Part D coverage gap (commonly referred to as the donut hole\u201d) result in additional rebates. The Company estimates the reserve for rebates and other promotional credit programs based on the specific terms in each agreement when revenue is recognized. The reserve for rebates increases (decreases) as sales to certain wholesale and retail customers increase (decrease). However, since these rebate programs are not identical for all customers, the size of the reserve will depend on the mix of sales to customers that are eligible to receive rebates.\nReturns\nConsistent with industry practice, the Company has a product returns policy that allows customers to return product within a specified time period prior to and subsequent to the product's expiration date in exchange for a credit to be applied to future purchases. The Company's policy requires that the customer obtain pre-approval from the Company for any qualifying return. The Company estimates its provision for returns based on historical experience, changes to business practices, credit terms and any extenuating circumstances known to management. While historical experience has allowed for reasonable estimations in the past, future returns may or may not follow historical trends. The Company continually monitors the reserve for returns and makes adjustments when management believes that actual product returns may differ from the established reserve. Generally, the reserve for returns increases as net sales increase.\nOther Adjustments\nOther adjustments consist primarily of price adjustments, also known as shelf-stock adjustments\u201d and price protections,\u201d which are both credits issued to reflect increases or decreases in the invoice or contract prices of the Company's products. In the case of a price decrease, a credit is given for product remaining in customer's inventories at the time of the price reduction. Contractual price protection results in a similar credit when the invoice or contract prices of the Company's products increase, effectively allowing customers to purchase products at previous prices for a specified period of time. Amounts recorded for estimated shelf-stock adjustments and price protections are based upon specified terms with direct customers, estimated changes in market prices and estimates of inventory held by customers. The Company regularly monitors these and other factors and evaluates the reserve as additional information becomes available. Other adjustments also include prompt payment discounts and failure-to-supply\u201d adjustments. If the Company is unable to fulfill certain customer orders, the customer can purchase products from our competitors at their prices and charge the Company for any difference in our contractually agreed upon prices.\nInventories\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value determined by the first-in, first-out method. Inventories are regularly reviewed and write-downs for excess and obsolete inventory are recorded based primarily on current inventory levels, expiration date and estimated sales forecasts. While estimated sales forecasts are subjective in nature, the projections allow management to reasonably predict the net realizable value of current inventory based on expected demand. A decrease in the estimated sales forecasts would indicate the need to write-down excess and obsolete inventory. Management continuously monitors the market activity and assesses inventory levels.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company uses the liability method to account for income taxes as prescribed by ASC 740, Income Taxes. Deferred taxes are recorded to reflect the tax consequences on future years of events that the Company has already recognized in the financial statement or tax", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7.MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion and analysis describes significant changes in the financial condition and results of operations, as well as liquidity and capital resources of the Company. Additionally, it addresses accounting policies and estimates that management has deemed are critical accounting policies and estimates.\u201d This discussion and analysis is intended as a supplement to and should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements and other sections of this Form 10-K.\nThe following discussion contains forward-looking statements. You should refer to the Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d set forth in Part I of this Annual Report.\nWe report financial information on a quarterly and fiscal year basis with the most recent being the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021. All references herein to a fiscal year\u201d or Fiscal\u201d refer to the applicable fiscal year ended June 30.\nCompany Overview\nLannett Company, Inc. (a Delaware corporation) and its subsidiaries (collectively, the Company\u201d, Lannett\u201d, we\u201d or us\u201d) primarily develop, manufacture, package, market and distribute solid oral and extended release (tablets and capsules), topical, liquids, nasal and oral solution finished dosage forms of drugs, generic forms of both small molecule and biologic medications, that address a wide range of therapeutic areas. Certain of these products are manufactured by others and distributed by the Company. Additionally, the Company is pursuing partnerships, research contracts and internal expansion for the development and production of other dosage forms including: ophthalmic, nasal, patch, foam, buccal, sublingual, suspensions, soft gel, injectable and oral dosages.\nThe Company operates pharmaceutical manufacturing plants in Carmel, New York and Seymour, Indiana. The Company's customers include generic pharmaceutical distributors, drug wholesalers, chain drug stores, private label distributors, mail-order pharmacies, other pharmaceutical manufacturers, managed care organizations, hospital buying groups, governmental entities and health maintenance organizations.\nImpact of COVID-19 Pandemic\nIn December 2019, the COVID-19 virus emerged in Wuhan, China and spread to other parts of the world. In March 2020, the World Health Organization ( WHO\u201d) designated COVID-19 a global pandemic. Governments on the national, state and local level in the United States, and around the world, have implemented lockdown and shelter-in-place orders, requiring many non-essential businesses to shut down operations for the time being. The Company's business, however, is deemed essential\u201d and it has continued to operate and has continued to manufacture and distribute its medicines to customers. The Company has developed a comprehensive plan that enables it to maintain operational continuity with an emphasis on manufacturing, distribution and R&D facilities during this crisis, and to date, has not encountered any significant obstacles implementing its business continuity plans. However, the Company continually assesses COVID-19 related developments and adjusts its risk mitigation planning and business continuity activities as needed.\nIn mid-March, 2020, the Company instituted a work from home process for all employees, other than employees in our manufacturing plants, distribution center, and R&D facilities which support manufacturing. For employees who cannot perform their job remotely, the Company has implemented enhanced cleaning and sanitizing procedures, weekly fogging and provided additional personal hygiene supplies and personal protective equipment such as rubber gloves, N95 respirators and powered air-purifying respirator that are in line with Centers for Disease Control and Preventions ( CDC\u201d) recommendations. The Company has also implemented thermal screening for all employees and visitors entering its facilities. Employees are required to adhere to the CDC guidelines, social distancing and any employee experiencing any symptoms of COVID-19 is required to stay home and seek medical attention. Any employee who tests positive for COVID-19 is required to quarantine and is not allowed to return to the facilities without a physician's release. The Company has closed its facilities to outside persons that are not critical to continuing our operations. In cases where they are essential, visitors undergo a pre-admittance check to include a thermal screening and risk evaluation. The Company has experienced an increase in absenteeism arising from intermittent spikes in cases across the country, which has caused an increase in overtime and cost to produce the products, but to date the rate of employee absenteeism has not had any material effect on the Company's business or its ability to manufacture and distribute products and plants continue to operate at normal capacity. As the pandemic continues to linger due to variants or limited vaccine supplies, there is an ongoing risk of employee absenteeism which could materially impact the Company's operations. To date, the Company's work from home process has not materially impacted the Company's financial reporting systems or controls over financial reporting and disclosures nor do we expect that the remote work arrangement will have a material impact in the future.\nCurrently and as anticipated for the near future, the supply chain supporting the Company's products remains intact, enabling the Company to receive sufficient inventory of the key materials needed across the Company's network. The Company is experiencing some delays and allocations for certain API and other raw materials of higher demand, which, to date, have not had a material impact on its results of operations. However, the Company is regularly communicating with its suppliers, third-party partners, customers, healthcare providers and government officials in order to respond rapidly to any issues as they arise. The longer the current situation continues, it is more likely that the Company may experience some sort of interruption to its supply chain, and such an interruption could materially affect its business, including but not limited to, our ability to timely manufacture and distribute its products as well as unfavorably impact our results of operations. Additionally, subsequent to an initial stocking up of supplies at the start of the pandemic, the total volume of drug prescriptions written during the pandemic has decreased causing less demand for our products. Specifically, the pandemic has resulted in fewer elective surgeries being performed, causing less demand for our Numbrino cocaine hydrochloride product.\nAs a result of the pandemic, certain clinical trials which were underway or scheduled to begin were temporarily placed on hold, although all such clinical trials were resumed and have been completed. Such delays impacted the Company's timing for filing applications for product approvals with the FDA as well as related timing of FDA approval of such filings. Additionally, the pandemic has slowed down the Company's efforts to expand its product portfolio through acquisitions and distribution opportunities, impacting the speed with which the Company is able to bring additional products to market. While there have been some efforts by some of our customers to increase their inventory levels for the Company's products in the near term, the Company has not seen significant increases in demand. The Company does not anticipate any significant changes in demand for its products in the future, however, depending on the duration and severity of the outbreak, levels of demand may change.\nIn light of the economic impacts of COVID-19, the Company reviewed the assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of June 30, 2021, including intangible and other long-lived assets. Based on our review, the Company determined that no impairments or other write-downs specifically related to COVID-19 were necessary during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021. Our assessment is based on information currently available and is highly reliant on various assumptions. Changes in market conditions could impact the Company's future outlook and may lead to impairments in the future.\nBased on the foregoing, the Company cannot reasonably predict the ultimate impact of COVID-19 on our future results of operations and cash flows due to the continued uncertainty around the duration and severity of the pandemic.\n2020 Restructuring Plan\nOn July 10, 2020, the Board of Directors authorized a restructuring and cost savings plan (the 2020 Restructuring Plan\u201d) to enhance manufacturing efficiencies, streamline operations and reduce the Company's cost structure. The 2020 Restructuring Plan was implemented, in part, as a result of previously anticipated near-term competition and pricing pressure with respect to certain key products. The 2020 Restructuring Plan included lowering operating costs and reducing the workforce by approximately 80 positions. The 2020 Restructuring Plan was initiated on July 13, 2020 and completed as of December 31, 2020.\nThe Company incurred approximately $4.0 million in severance-related costs in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021, in connection with the 2020 Restructuring Plan. The Company expects the 2020 Restructuring Plan to result in annual cost savings in excess of $15.0 million.\nClimate Change\nThe Company believes in a more sustainable future with a reduced environmental footprint, effective use of natural resources and a multi-pronged approach to reducing our effect on the climate while maintaining our focus on providing affordable medicines to our customers and ultimately the patients who depend on them. Commitment to this belief, however, may come at increased costs to the Company including, but not limited to, capital investments, additional management and compliance costs, and reduced output, all of which may be material. Costs incurred by our suppliers and vendors to comply with their own sustainability commitments may also be passed through the supply chain resulting in higher operational costs to the Company. Climate change and the associated risks continues to evolve over time and could materially impact the Company's results of operations and cash flows in any given year. The Company monitors such changes and strives to address these risks in a timely manner.\nResults of Operations - Fiscal 2021 compared to Fiscal 2020\nNet sales decreased 12% to $478.8 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021. The following table identifies the Company's net product sales by medical indication for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2021 and 2020.\nTable 18: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal Year Ended June 30,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Medical Indication\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2021\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Analgesic\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 14,684\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 8,680\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Anti-Psychosis\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 43,720\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 104,934\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cardiovascular\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 65,987\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 88,576\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Central Nervous System\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 95,115\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 77,256\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Endocrinology\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 27,070\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gastrointestinal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 67,540\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 73,477\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Infectious Disease\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 67,761\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 73,237\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Migraine\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 25,554\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 44,266\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Respiratory/Allergy/Cough/Cold\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9,258\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11,576\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Urinary\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,786\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,225\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 35,312\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 35,013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Contract manufacturing revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 20,991\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 24,504\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total net sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 478,778\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 545,744\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe decrease in net sales was driven by a decrease in the selling price of products of $90.1 million partially offset by increased volumes of $23.1 million. The decrease in the selling price of products was primarily driven by lower sales prices of Fluphenazine, which is included within the Anti-Psychosis medical indication, and Posaconazole, which is included in Infectious Disease medical indication, due to new competitors entering the market, as well as lower average selling price across the remaining medical indications. Overall volumes increased primarily due to increased volumes of Posaconazole and from new product launches, including Levothyroxine Tablets and Capsules, partially offset by lower volumes of Fluphenazine. The Company has seen increased competitive market pressure in recent years, which has resulted in overall decreases in selling prices of products and sales volume across our product portfolio. We have partially offset these competitive pressures with new product launches and will continue to seek opportunities for additional launches.\nIn January 2017, a provision in the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 required drug manufacturers to pay additional rebates to state Medicaid programs if the prices of their generic drugs rise at a rate faster than inflation. The provision negatively impacted the Company's net sales by $18.9 million and $35.7 million in Fiscal 2021 and Fiscal 2020, respectively, which contributed to the overall decreased average selling price.\nThe following chart details price and volume changes by medical indication between Fiscal 2021 and Fiscal 2020:\nTable 19: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Sales volume\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Sales price\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Medical indication\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>change %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>change %\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Analgesic\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 73\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td> (4)\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Anti-Psychosis\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (29)\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td> (29)\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cardiovascular\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (17)\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td> (9)\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Central Nervous System\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 44\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td> (21)\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Endocrinology\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 100\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gastrointestinal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td> (8)\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Infectious Disease\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 16\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td> (23)\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Migraine\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (17)\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td> (25)\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Respiratory/Allergy/Cough/Cold\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (14)\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td> (6)\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Urinary\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 26\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td> 11\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Company sells its products to customers through various distribution channels.

We have partially offset these competitive pressures with new product launches and will continue to seek opportunities for additional launches.\nCocaine Hydrochloride Solution\nIn December 2017, a competitor received approval from the FDA to market and sell a Cocaine Hydrochloride topical product. In March 2018, in accordance with FDA guidance, the FDA requested the Company cease manufacturing and distributing our unapproved cocaine hydrochloride solution product as a result of an approved product on the market. The Company committed to not manufacture or distribute cocaine hydrochloride 10% solution, which was not sold during Fiscal 2019, and also ceased manufacturing its unapproved cocaine hydrochloride 4% solution on June 15, 2019 and ceased distributing the product on August 15, 2019.\nThe competitor filed a series of Citizen Petitions beginning in 2019, seeking to block approval of the Company's Section 505(b)(2) NDA for its cocaine hydrochloride solution product by claiming that the grant of the New Chemical Entity ( NCE\u201d) exclusivity issued to the competitor blocks the approval of the Company's application for five years. Following the FDA's rejection of the competitor's argument and approval of the Company's Section 505(b)(2) NDA, the competitor filed two lawsuits against the FDA (one in federal court in the District of Columbia and one in federal court in the District of Maryland) seeking a court order in two different federal courts directing the FDA to withdraw approval of the Section 505(b)(2) NDA. To date, neither court has directed the FDA to withdraw the NDA. The Company has intervened in both lawsuits and there are currently cross motions for summary judgment pending in the case filed in federal court for the District of Columbia and a motion to dismiss the complaint filed in the federal court for the District of Maryland.\nSeparately, on June 6, 2020, the competitor filed a patent infringement complaint, since amended, in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware, asserting that the Company's approved cocaine hydrochloride product infringes six patents issued to the competitor. The Company filed an answer and counterclaim, alleging that the Company either does not infringe or that the six asserted patents and three additional unasserted patents are invalid. The competitor filed a motion to partially dismiss a portion of the counterclaim as to the unasserted patents. The motion to dismiss is pending a determination by the court and discovery is ongoing. The Company continues to market its approved cocaine hydrochloride product.\nOn August 16, 2021, the Company and the competitor reached an agreement in principle to amicably resolve all pending cases, including the cases in the federal courts in the District of Columbia, District of Maryland and District of Delaware. The parties are working to negotiate and finalize the settlement documents over the next 45 days and have filed motions in each of the courts to stay the cases pending the finalization of the settlement documents.\nThalomid\u00ae\nThe Company filed with the FDA an ANDA No. 206601, along with a paragraph IV certification, alleging that the fifteen patents associated with the Thalomid drug product are invalid, unenforceable and/or not infringed. On January 30, 2015, Celgene Corporation and Children's Medical Center Corporation filed a patent infringement lawsuit in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey, alleging that the Company's filing of ANDA No. 206601 constitutes an act of patent infringement and seeking a declaration that the patents at issue are valid and infringed. A settlement agreement was reached, and the Court dismissed the lawsuit in October 2017. Pursuant to the settlement agreement, the Company entered into a license agreement that permitted Lannett to manufacture and market in the U.S. its generic thalidomide product as of August 1, 2019 or earlier under certain circumstances. In the second quarter of Fiscal 2019, the Company received a Major Complete Response Letter ( CRL\u201d) related to issues at its API supplier. The Company filed a response to the CRL. The Company received a second Major CRL in the first quarter of Fiscal 2020 related to continued issues at the API supplier, as well as issues with the Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy ( REMS\u201d) program hosted by Celgene. On March 26, 2021, the Company received a third Major CRL from the FDA relating to continuing issues with the API supplier. The Company is working on addressing the FDA comments and cannot reasonably predict timing of the product launch.\nRanitidine Oral Solution, USP\nAs part of an industry-wide action, the Company issued a voluntary recall on all lots within expiry of Ranitidine Syrup (Ranitidine Oral Solution, USP), 15mg/mL to the consumer level due to levels of N-Nitrosodimethylamine ( NDMA\u201d), a probable human carcinogen, above the levels recently established by the FDA. On September 17, 2019, the FDA notified the Company about the possible presence of NDMA in its Ranitidine Oral Solution product and the Company immediately commenced testing and analysis of the active pharmaceutical ingredient ( API\u201d) and drug product and confirmed the presence of NDMA. The Company's net sales of Ranitidine Oral Solution in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019 totaled $1.9 million. On April 1, 2020, the FDA ordered all Ranitidine products (including the Company's product) withdrawn from the U.S. market and provided guidance on the requirements for submitting additional information to the FDA in order to re-introduce the product to the market. Since initiating the voluntary recall, the Company has not been marketing its Ranitidine Oral Solution product and has no future plans to attempt to re-introduce the product at this time. The Company does not believe the recall will have a significant impact on our future expected financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nOn June 1, 2020, a class action complaint was served upon the Company and approximately forty-five (45) other companies asserting claims for personal injury arising from the presence of NDMA in Ranitidine products. The complaint is consolidated in a multidistrict litigation ( MDL\u201d) pending in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida. Similar complaints were filed in state court in New Mexico and state court in Maryland and served upon the Company. Subsequently, a number of similar complaints were served on the Company. The Company has filed a motion to dismiss the complaint filed in the MDL which, on December 31, 2020, was granted with leave to amend as to certain of the claims. The plaintiffs filed a First Amended complaint on February 9, 2021, to which the generic manufacturer defendants, including the Company, filed a renewed motion to dismiss all claims. On July 8, 2021, the Court issued an Order granting the motion and dismissing all claims with prejudice based on federal preemption. Separately, the New Mexico case was conditionally transferred to the MDL, but ultimately remanded back to the state court. Since the Company was not licensed to do business in New Mexico and, based upon the information received to date, did not sell Ranitidine in New Mexico, we plan to file a motion to dismiss based, among other things, federal preemption and lack of jurisdiction. Separately, the Company filed a notice to remove and transfer the Maryland case to the MDL which the plaintiff has opposed. On April 1, 2021, the case was remanded back to the state court. On August 17, 2021, Helena Hilbert & William Hilbert III, Individually and on behalf of their minor child \"WH\", filed a complaint in the Philadelphia Court of Common Pleas against the Company and approximately seven other defendants, alleging personal injury as a result of using the Company's Ranitidine products. The Company intends to file a motion to dismiss all of the pending state claims, among other reasons, based on federal preemption. The Company has placed its insurance carrier on notice of the claim and the carrier has appointed counsel to defend the Company.\nCost of Sales, including amortization of intangibles. Cost of sales, including amortization of intangibles, for Fiscal 2021 increased 6% to $403.2 million from $380.5 million in the same prior-year period. The increase was attributable to an increase of $13.2 million in write-downs for excess and obsolete inventory, which primarily relates to the Company's decision to discontinue 23 lower margin product lines, as well as additional volumes from new product launches. The Company also recorded $5.0 million in consideration to renew the Company's distribution agreement with Recro Gainesville, LLC ( Recro\u201d) during the second quarter of Fiscal Year 2021.\nGross Profit. Gross profit for Fiscal 2021 decreased 54% to $75.6 million or 16% of total net sales. In comparison, gross profit for Fiscal 2020 was $165.2 million or 30% of total net sales. The decrease in gross profit percentage was primarily attributable to lower volumes of Fluphenazine, which had higher than average gross profit margins, as well as overall lower average selling prices of our products. The Company also recorded an increase in the write-downs for excess and obsolete inventory as well as consideration to renew the distribution agreement with Recro in the second quarter of Fiscal 2021.\nResearch and Development Expenses. Research and development expenses decreased 19% to $24.2 million in Fiscal 2021 from $30.0 million in Fiscal 2020. The decrease was primarily due to lower R&D expenses as a result of timing of certain milestones related to product development projects as well as employee headcount reductions related to the 2020 Restructuring Plan.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased 14% to $68.1 million in Fiscal 2021 compared with $79.5 million in Fiscal 2020. The decrease was primarily driven by a lower branded prescription drug fee, lower incentive-based compensation, lower expenses at the Company's Cody Labs subsidiary and other cost reduction initiatives.\nAsset impairment charges. In Fiscal 2021, the Company recorded various asset impairment charges totaling $216.6 million. The Company reviewed its product portfolio during Fiscal 2021 and decided to discontinue 23 lower gross margin product lines, including product lines that were acquired through various past business and product acquisitions. As a result of the discontinuance and the reduction in net sales and gross margin of certain other product lines, the Company recorded an impairment charge of $193.0 million related to the KUPI product rights intangible assets. The impairment charge is primarily a result of the decline in net sales and gross margin of certain product lines acquired in connection with the KUPI acquisition, including those product lines being discontinued. In addition, the Company recorded a $17.0 million impairment charge to its intangible asset for a distribution and supply agreement with Cediprof, Inc., which is included within the other product rights category of definite-lived intangible assets, as a result of increased competition and lower projected cash flows for the Levothyroxine product. The Company also recorded a $5.0 million impairment charge to its KUPI in-process research and development intangible asset due to delays in the expected launch of a product within the portfolio, which results in reduced projected cash flows. See Note 8 Goodwill and Intangible Assets\u201d for more information.\nOther Loss. Interest expense for the year ended June 30, 2021 totaled $53.8 million compared to $66.8 million for the year ended June 30, 2020. The decrease was due to a lower average debt balance in Fiscal 2021 as compared to the prior-year as well as a lower weighted-average interest rate due to the full repayment of the outstanding Term Loan A in November 2020. The weighted average interest rate for Fiscal 2021 and 2020 was 8.0% and 8.8%, respectively. The Company also recorded a $10.3 million loss on extinguishment of debt related to the payoff of the Term Loan B Facility during Fiscal 2021.\nIncome Tax. The Company recorded income tax expense in Fiscal 2021 of $60.6 million compared to income tax benefit of $15.3 million in Fiscal 2020. The effective tax rate for Fiscal 2021 was (20.0)%, compared to 31.4% for Fiscal 2020. The income tax expense recorded in Fiscal 2021 was primarily driven by the full valuation allowance recorded against the Company's deferred tax assets. See Note 17 Income Taxes\u201d for more information.\nNet Loss. For the year ended June 30, 2021, the Company reported net loss of $363.5 million, or $(9.23) per diluted share. Comparatively, net loss in the corresponding prior-year period was $33.4 million, or $(0.86) per diluted share.\nResults of Operations - Fiscal 2020 compared to Fiscal 2019\nNet sales decreased 17% to $545.7 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020. The following table identifies the Company's net product sales by medical indication for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2020 and 2019. The medical indication categories for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019 were reclassified to better align with industry standards and the Company's peers.\nTable 21: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Fiscal Year Ended June 30,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Medical Indication\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Analgesic\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 8,680\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 8,251\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Anti-Psychosis\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 104,934\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 73,453\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cardiovascular\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 88,576\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 101,467\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Central Nervous System\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 77,256\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 59,019\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Endocrinology\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 197,522\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gastrointestinal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 73,477\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 63,043\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Infectious Disease\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 73,237\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 16,950\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Migraine\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 44,266\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 41,592\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Respiratory/Allergy/Cough/Cold\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11,576\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12,479\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Urinary\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,225\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6,755\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 35,013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 51,517\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Contract manufacturing revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 24,504\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 23,359\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total net sales\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 545,744\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 655,407\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe decrease in net sales was driven by decreased volumes of $79.4 million and, to a lesser extent, decreased average selling price of products of $30.3 million. Overall volumes decreased primarily due to the loss of Levothyroxine sales associated with the expiration of the JSP Distribution Agreement, partially offset by additional volumes from product launches and increased market share in certain key products. Average selling prices were impacted by product mix and price decreases in certain key products due to competitive pricing pressures. Although the Company has benefited in the past from favorable pricing trends, these trends have reversed. Net sales within the infectious disease category increased significantly as a result of the distribution and supply agreement with Sinotherapeutics Inc., which was signed in August 2019, to distribute Posaconazole tablets.\nIn January 2017, a provision in the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 required drug manufacturers to pay additional rebates to state Medicaid programs if the prices of their generic drugs rise at a rate faster than inflation. The provision negatively impacted the Company's net sales by $35.7 million and $30.8 million in Fiscal 2020 and Fiscal 2019, respectively, which contributed to the overall decreased average selling price.\nThe following chart details price and volume changes by medical indication between Fiscal 2020 and Fiscal 2019:\nTable 22: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Sales volume\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Sales price\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Medical indication\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>change %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>change %\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Analgesic\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 25\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td> (20)\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Anti-Psychosis\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 33\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td> 10\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cardiovascular\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (12)\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td> (1)\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Central Nervous System\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 47\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td> (16)\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Endocrinology\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (100)\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gastrointestinal\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 16\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td> 1\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Infectious Disease\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 346\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td> (14)\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Migraine\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 21\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td> (14)\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Respiratory/Allergy/Cough/Cold\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (5)\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td> (2)\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Urinary\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (34)\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td> (3)\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Company sells its products to customers through various distribution channels.

The decrease in sales to wholesalers, as well as mail-order pharmacies, was also primarily due to the loss of Levothyroxine sales.\nCost of Sales, including amortization of intangibles. Cost of sales, including amortization of intangibles, for Fiscal 2020 decreased 8% to $380.5 million from $411.8 million in the same prior-year period. The decrease was primarily attributable to the loss of Levothyroxine sales associated with the expiration of the JSP Distribution Agreement as well as lower cost of sales as a result of the Company's decision to cease operations at Cody Labs, partially offset by additional volumes of other products sold as well as increased product royalties expense related to various distribution agreements.\nGross Profit. Gross profit for Fiscal 2020 decreased 32% to $165.2 million or 30% of total net sales. In comparison, gross profit for Fiscal 2019 was $243.6 million or 37% of total net sales. The decrease in gross profit percentage was primarily attributable to the loss of Levothyroxine sales associated with the expiration of the JSP Distribution Agreement, which had higher than average gross profit margins, price decreases across our product portfolio as well as increased product royalties related to various distribution agreements, partially offset by manufacturing efficiencies as a result of cost reduction initiatives and an increase in volumes of certain key products with higher than average gross margins.\nResearch and Development Expenses. Research and development expenses decreased 23% to $30.0 million in Fiscal 2020 from $38.8 million in Fiscal 2019. The decrease was primarily due to lower R&D expenses as a result of the Company's decision to cease operations at Cody Labs as well as the timing of certain milestones related to product development projects.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased 9% to $79.5 million in Fiscal 2020 compared with $87.6 million in Fiscal 2019. The decrease was primarily driven by lower financial advisory costs, a decrease in regulatory-related costs, lower expenses at the Company's Cody Labs subsidiary and other cost reduction initiatives, partially offset by a branded prescription drug fee as well as increased legal costs.\nAsset impairment charges. In Fiscal 2020, the Company recorded various asset impairment charges totaling $34.4 million. During Fiscal 2020, the Company performed an impairment analysis of its AB-rated Methylphenidate Hydrochloride product, which is distributed under a license agreement with Andor, due to significant declines in the projected profitability of the distribution arrangement. As a result of the analysis, the Company recorded a $14.0 million impairment charge. The Company also performed an annual impairment analysis of our indefinite-lived intangible assets. As a result, the Company recorded a $9.0 million and an $8.0 million impairment charge to its KUPI IPR&D and Silarx IPR&D assets, respectively, due to the abandonment of several pipeline products within both portfolios. The Company recorded a ROU lease asset totaling $1.2 million related to an existing lease at Cody Labs upon adoption of ASU No. 2016-02 and subsequently recorded a full impairment of the asset as a result of the decision to cease operations at Cody Labs.\nOther Income (Loss). Interest expense for the year ended June 30, 2020 totaled $66.8 million compared to $84.6 million for the year ended June 30, 2019. The decrease was due to a lower average debt balance in Fiscal 2020 as compared to the prior-year period as well as a lower weighted-average interest rate due to the partial repayment of the outstanding Term Loan A balance with proceeds from the issuance of the 4.50% Convertible Senior Notes. The weighted average interest rate for Fiscal 2020 and 2019 was 8.8% and 9.7%, respectively. Investment income totaled $1.6 million in Fiscal 2020 compared with $3.2 million in Fiscal 2019.\nIncome Tax. The Company recorded income tax benefit in Fiscal 2020 of $15.3 million compared to income tax benefit of $74.1 million in Fiscal 2019. The effective tax rate for Fiscal 2020 was 31.4%, compared to 21.4% for Fiscal 2019. The effective tax rate for the period ended June 30, 2020 was higher compared to the same prior-year period primarily due to the impact of the CARES Act which allowed the Company to carryback its 2020 taxable loss into its Fiscal 2015 tax year, where the statutory tax rate was 35%. The increase was slightly offset by excess tax shortfalls related to stock compensation as well as a non-deductible branded prescription drug fee.\nNet Income (Loss). For the year ended June 30, 2020, the Company reported net loss of $33.4 million, or $(0.86) per diluted share. Comparatively, net loss in the corresponding prior-year period was $272.1 million, or $(7.20) per diluted share.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nCash Flow\nThe Company finances its operations with cash flow generated from operations and has $45.0 million available to draw upon under the Amended ABL Credit Facility, which is discussed further below. At June 30, 2021, working capital was $263.1 million as compared to $228.3 million at June 30, 2020, an increase of $34.8 million. Current product portfolio sales as well as sales related to future product approvals are anticipated to continue to generate positive cash flow from operations.\nNet cash provided by operating activities of $60.9 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021 reflected net loss of $363.5 million, adjustments for non-cash items of $441.0 million, as well as cash used in operating assets and liabilities of $16.6 million. In comparison, net cash from operating activities of $116.0 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020 reflected net loss of $33.4 million, adjustments for non-cash items of $110.7 million, as well as cash provided by changes in operating assets and liabilities of $38.7 million.\nSignificant changes in operating assets and liabilities from June 30, 2020 to June 30, 2021 are comprised of:\n \u25cf A decrease in accounts receivable of $26.9 million mainly due to the overall decrease in sales, as well as the timing of sales and cash receipts. The Company's days sales outstanding ( DSO\u201d) at June 30, 2021, based on gross sales for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021 and gross accounts receivable at June 30, 2021, was 77 days. The level of DSO at June 30, 2021 was comparable to the Company's expectation that DSO will be in the 70 to 85-day range based on customer payment terms. \n \u25cf An increase in income taxes receivable totaling $20.4 million primarily due to additional estimated tax refunds related to provisions of the CARES Act and an anticipated Fiscal 2021 taxable loss, partially offset by income tax receipts of $36.8 million. \n \u25cf A decrease in rebates payable of $19.2 million primarily due to lower sales of Fluphenazine in Fiscal 2021, which had higher than average government-related rebates. \n \u25cf A decrease in royalties payable of $7.1 million primarily due to lower sales of distributed products with royalty arrangements in Fiscal 2021. \n \u25cf A decrease in accrued payroll and payroll-related costs of $5.6 million primarily related to payments made in August 2020 in connection with incentive-based compensation accrued in Fiscal Year 2020 as well as lower incentive-based compensation accrued in Fiscal Year 2021. \nSignificant changes in operating assets and liabilities from June 30, 2019 to June 30, 2020 are comprised of:\n \u25cf A decrease in accounts receivable of $39.1 million mainly due to the timing of sales and cash receipts, as well as adjustments to wholesale acquisition pricing to our customers. The Company's days sales outstanding ( DSO\u201d) at June 30, 2020, based on gross sales for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020 and gross accounts receivable at June 30, 2020, was 61 days. The level of DSO at June 30, 2020 was significantly lower than the Company's expectation that DSO will be in the 70 to 85-day range based on customer payment terms, due to higher gross sales in the three months ended March 31, 2020 compared to the three months ended June 30, 2020. \n \u25cf An increase in accounts payable totaling $19.0 million primarily due to the timing of vendor invoices and payments. \n \u25cf An increase in prepaid income taxes totaling $14.5 million primarily due to the carryback of the Company's Fiscal 2020 taxable loss into the Fiscal 2015 tax year as a result of the CARES Act as well as tax payments made in Fiscal 2020. \nNet cash used in investing activities of $14.8 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021 was mainly the result of purchases of property, plant and equipment of $10.4 million and purchases of intangible assets of $4.5 million. Net cash used in investing activities of $40.0 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020 was mainly the result of purchases of intangible assets of $28.8 million and purchases of property, plant and equipment of $18.3 million, partially offset by proceeds from the sale of property, plant and equipment of $7.4 million.\nNet cash used in financing activities of $92.2 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021 was primarily due to debt repayments of $437.9 million and payment of debt issuance costs of $10.1 million, partially offset by proceeds from issuance of long-term debt of $356.2 million. The financing activities during Fiscal 2021 were primarily related to the refinancing in April 2021. Net cash used in financing activities of $71.9 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020 was due to debt repayments of $146.7 million, purchase of capped calls in connection with the 4.50% Convertible Senior Notes offering totaling $7.1 million, payments of debt issuance costs totaling $3.5 million, and purchases of treasury stock totaling $1.9 million, partially offset by proceeds from issuance of 4.50% Convertible Senior Notes of $86.3 million and proceeds from sale of stock pursuant to stock compensation plans of $1.0 million.\nCredit Facility and Other Indebtedness\nThe Company has previously entered into and may enter future agreements with various financial institutions to provide additional cash to help finance the Company's acquisitions, various capital investments and potential strategic opportunities. These borrowing arrangements as of June 30, 2021 are as follows:\n7.750% Senior Secured Notes due 2026\nOn April 22, 2021, the Company issued $350.0 million aggregate principal amount of 7.750% senior secured notes due 2026 (the Notes\u201d) in a private placement to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act\u201d) and outside the United States to persons other than U.S. persons in reliance upon Regulation S under the Securities Act. The Notes bear interest semi-annually in arrears on April 15 and October 15 of each year, beginning on October 15, 2021, at a rate of 7.750% per annum in cash. The Notes will mature on April 15, 2026, unless earlier redeemed or repurchased in accordance with their terms.\nSecond Lien Secured Loan Facility\nOn April 5, 2021, the Company entered into an Exchange Agreement with certain participating lenders to exchange a portion of their existing Term B Loans for Second Lien Loans pursuant to a new $190.0 million Second Lien Secured Loan Facility ( Second Lien Facility\u201d). On April 22, 2021, in connection with the issuance of the Notes and the entrance into the Amended ABL Credit Facility, which is discussed further below, the exchange between the Company and the participating lenders was consummated. From the Closing Date until the one-year anniversary of the Closing Date, the Second Lien Loans bear 10.0% PIK interest. Thereafter, the Second Lien notes will bear 5.0% cash interest and 5.0% PIK interest until maturity, except to the extent the Company elects to pay all or portion of the PIK interest in cash. The Second Lien Loans will mature on July 21, 2026. In connection with the Second Lien Facility, the Company issued to the Participating Lenders warrants to purchase up to 8,280,000 shares of common stock of the Company (the Warrants\u201d) at an exercise price of $6.88 per share. The Warrants were issued on April 22, 2021 with an eight-year term. The Participating Lenders received registration rights with respect to the shares of common stock of the Company to be received upon exercise of the Warrants. The holders of the Warrants are entitled to receive dividends or distributions of any kind made to the common stockholders to the same extent as if the holder had exercised the Warrant into common stock. The Warrants are considered participating securities under ASC 260, Earnings per share.\nAmended ABL Credit Facility\nOn December 7, 2020, the Company entered into a credit and guaranty agreement, which provided for an asset-based revolving credit facility (the ABL Credit Facility\u201d) of up to $30 million, subject to borrowing base availability, and included letter of credit and swing line sub-facilities. On April 22, 2021, the Company entered into an amendment to that certain Credit and Guaranty Agreement, dated as of December 7, 2020 (such agreement as so amended, the Amended ABL Credit Agreement\u201d), among the Company, certain of its wholly-owned domestic subsidiaries party thereto, as borrowers or as guarantors, Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as administrative agent and as collateral agent and the other lenders party thereto, for the purpose of, among other things, increasing the aggregate amount of the revolving credit facility from $30.0 million to $45.0 million and extending the maturity thereof to the fifth anniversary of the closing date of Notes Offering (subject to a springing maturity as set forth therein).\nThe Amended ABL Credit Agreement provides for a revolving credit facility (the Amended ABL Credit Facility\u201d) that includes letter of credit and swing line sub-facilities. Borrowing availability under the Amended ABL Credit Facility is determined by a monthly borrowing base collateral calculation that is based on specified percentages of eligible accounts receivable less certain reserves and subject to certain other adjustments as set forth in the Amended ABL Credit Agreement. Availability is reduced by issuance of letters of credit as well as any borrowings. Loans outstanding under the Amended ABL Credit Agreement bear interest at a floating rate measured by reference to, at the Company's option, either an adjusted London Inter-Bank Offered Rate ( LIBOR\u201d) (subject to a floor of 0.75%) plus an applicable margin of 2.50% per annum, or an alternate base rate plus an applicable margin of 1.50% per annum. Unused commitments under the Amended ABL Credit Facility are subject to a fee of 0.50% per annum, which fee increases to 0.75% per annum for any quarter during which the Company's average usage under the Amended ABL Credit Facility is less than $5.0 million.\nIn connection with the Second Lien Facility, the Company is required to maintain at least $5.0 million in a deposit account at all times subject to control by the Second Lien Collateral Agent, and a minimum cash balance of $15.0 million as of the last day of each month. At June 30, 2021, the Company classified the $5.0 million required deposit account balance as restricted cash, which is included in other assets caption in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\n4.50% Convertible Senior Notes due 2026\nOn September 27, 2019, the Company issued $86.3 million aggregate principal amount of the 4.50% Convertible Senior Notes (the Convertible Notes\u201d) in a private offering to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. The Convertible Notes are senior unsecured obligations of the Company and bear interest at an annual rate of 4.50% payable semi-annually in arrears on April 1 and October 1 of each year, beginning on April 1, 2020. The Convertible Notes will mature on October 1, 2026, unless earlier repurchased, redeemed or converted in accordance with their terms. The Convertible Notes are convertible into shares of the Company's common stock at an initial conversion rate of 65.4022 shares per $1,000 principal amount of Convertible Notes (which is equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $15.29 per share), subject to adjustments upon the occurrence of certain events (but will not be adjusted for any accrued and unpaid interest). The Company may redeem all or a part of the Convertible Notes on or after October 6, 2023 at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Convertible Notes redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, up to, but excluding, the redemption date, subject to certain conditions relating to the Company's stock price having been met. Following certain corporate events that occur prior to the maturity date or if the Company delivers a notice of redemption, the Company will, in certain circumstances, increase the conversion rate for a holder who elects to convert its Convertible Notes in connection with such corporate event or notice of redemption. The indenture covering the Convertible Notes contains certain other customary terms and covenants, including that upon certain events of default occurring and continuing, either the trustee or holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the outstanding Convertible Notes may declare 100% of the principal of, and accrued and unpaid interest on, all the Convertible Notes to be due and payable.\nIn connection with the offering of the Convertible Notes, the Company also entered into privately negotiated capped call\u201d transactions with several counterparties. The capped call transaction will initially cover, subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments, the number of shares of common stock that initially underlie the Convertible Notes. The capped call transactions are expected to generally reduce the potential dilutive effect on the Company's common stock upon any conversion of the Convertible Notes with such reduction subject to a cap which is initially $19.46 per share.\nOther Liquidity Matters\nRefer to the Impact of COVID-19 Pandemic\u201d section above for the impact on our future liquidity.\nFuture Acquisitions\nWe are continuously evaluating the potential for product and company acquisitions as a part of our future growth strategy. In conjunction with a potential acquisition, the Company may utilize current resources or seek additional sources of capital to finance any such acquisition, which could have an impact on future liquidity.\nWe may also from time to time depending on market conditions and prices, contractual restrictions, our financial liquidity and other factors, seek to prepay outstanding debt or repurchase our outstanding debt through open market purchases, privately negotiated purchases, or otherwise. The amounts involved in any such transactions, individually or in the aggregate, may be material and may be funded from available cash or from additional borrowings.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table represents material annual contractual obligations as of June 30, 2021:\nTable 32: <table><tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Less than 1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>More than 5\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1-3 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3-5 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-Term Debt (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 631,950\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 350,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 281,950\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest on Obligations (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 278,580\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 30,885\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 84,991\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 87,342\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 75,362\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating Lease Obligations (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 18,939\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,051\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,147\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,228\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8,513\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Asset Purchase Payment Obligations (3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 13,627\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,250\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12,377\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 943,096\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 34,186\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 101,515\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 441,570\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td> 365,825\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) Long-term debt amounts above relate to principal amounts due for the Notes, Second Lien Facility, and the Convertible Notes. Interest on obligations primarily consists of cash interest on the Notes, Second Lien Facility and the Convertible Notes. PIK interest on the Second Lien Facility is due upon maturity and is also included in the interest on obligations line above. However, following the one-year anniversary of the closing date of the Second Lien Facility, the Company may elect to pay in cash any interest required to be paid in the form of PIK interest. Refer to Note 9 Long-Term Debt\u201d for additional information. \n (2) Operating lease obligations primarily relate to an eight-year lease for the Company's headquarters in Trevose, Pennsylvania as well as a 116,000 square foot leased warehouse in Seymour, Indiana. \n (3) The asset purchase payment obligation above refers to the consideration due to Andor Pharmaceuticals, LLC for the AB-rated Methylphenidate Hydrochloride perpetual license agreement. \nIn the normal course of business, the Company may enter into noncancelable purchase orders for API and has various ongoing capital expenditure projects that may result in contractual obligations. Under the terms of the License and Collaboration Agreement with HEC to develop an insulin glargine product, the Company agreed to fund up to the initial $32 million of the development costs and split 50/50 any development costs in excess thereof. As of June 30, 2021, the Company has incurred approximately $4 million of development costs towards the $32 million commitment made by the Company. Under the terms of a separate License and Collaboration Agreement with HEC and affiliates to develop a biosimilar insulin aspart product, the Company agreed to fund up to the initial $32 million of the development costs, provided that if total development and other costs paid by Lannett are less than $32 million then the difference will be paid to Sunshine over the first year of commercialization. As of June 30, 2021, the Company has not yet incurred material costs towards the $32 million commitment made by the Company. Refer to Note 11 Commitments\u201d for additional information.\nResearch and Development Arrangements\nIn the normal course of business, the Company has entered into certain research and development and other arrangements. As part of these arrangements, the Company has agreed to certain contingent payments, which generally become due and payable only upon the achievement of certain developmental, regulatory, commercial and/or other milestones. In addition, under certain arrangements, we may be required to make royalty payments based on a percentage of future sales, or other metric, for products currently in development in the event that the Company begins to market and sell the product. Due to the inherent uncertainty related to these developmental, regulatory, commercial and/or other milestones, it is unclear if the Company will ever be required to make such payments.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and the rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission requires the use of estimates and assumptions. A listing of the Company's significant accounting policies is detailed in Note 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.\u201d A subsection of these accounting policies has been identified by management as Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates.\u201d Critical accounting policies and estimates are those which require management to make estimates using assumptions that were uncertain at the time the estimates were made and for which the use of different assumptions, which reasonably could have been used, could have a material impact on the financial condition or results of operations.\nManagement has identified the following as Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates\u201d: Revenue Recognition, Inventories, Income Taxes, and Valuation of Long-Lived Assets, including Intangible Assets.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company complies with Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC\u201d) Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which superseded ASC Topic 605, Revenue Recognition. Under ASC 606, the Company recognizes revenue when title and risk of loss of promised goods or services have transferred to the customer at an amount that reflects the consideration the Company is expected to be entitled. Our revenue consists almost entirely of sales of our pharmaceutical products to customers, whereby we ship product to a customer pursuant to a purchase order. Revenue contracts such as these do not generally give rise to contract assets or contract liabilities because: (i) the underlying contracts generally have only a single performance obligation and (ii) we do not generally receive consideration until the performance obligation is fully satisfied. The new revenue standard also impacts the timing of the Company's revenue recognition by requiring recognition of certain contract manufacturing arrangements to change from upon shipment or delivery\u201d to over time.\u201d However, the recognition of these arrangements over time does not currently have a material impact on the Company's consolidated results of operations or financial position. The Company adopted ASC 606 using the modified retrospective method.\nWhen revenue is recognized, a simultaneous adjustment to gross sales is made for estimated chargebacks, rebates, returns, promotional adjustments and other potential adjustments. These provisions are primarily estimated based on historical experience, future expectations, contractual arrangements with wholesalers and indirect customers and other factors known to management at the time of accrual. Accruals for provisions are presented in the Consolidated Financial Statements as a reduction to gross sales with the corresponding reserve presented as a reduction of accounts receivable or included as rebates payable, depending on the nature of the reserve.\nProvisions for chargebacks, rebates, returns and other adjustments require varying degrees of subjectivity. While rebates generally are based on contractual terms and require minimal estimation, chargebacks and returns require management to make more subjective assumptions. Each major category is discussed in detail below:\nChargebacks\nThe provision for chargebacks is the most significant and complex estimate used in the recognition of revenue. The Company sells its products directly to wholesale distributors, generic distributors, retail pharmacy chains and mail-order pharmacies. The Company also sells its products indirectly to independent pharmacies, managed care organizations, hospitals, nursing homes and group purchasing organizations, collectively referred to as indirect customers.\u201d The Company enters into agreements with its indirect customers to establish pricing for certain products. The indirect customers then independently select a wholesaler from which to purchase the products. If the price paid by the indirect customers is lower than the price paid by the wholesaler, the Company will provide a credit, called a chargeback, to the wholesaler for the difference between the contractual price with the indirect customers and the wholesaler purchase price. The provision for chargebacks is based on expected sell-through levels by the Company's wholesale customers to the indirect customers and estimated wholesaler inventory levels. As sales to the large wholesale customers, such as Cardinal Health, AmerisourceBergen and McKesson increase (decrease), the reserve for chargebacks will also generally increase (decrease). However, the size of the increase (decrease) depends on product mix and the amount of sales made to indirect customers with which the Company has specific chargeback agreements. The Company continually monitors the reserve for chargebacks and makes adjustments when management believes that expected chargebacks may differ from the actual chargeback reserve.\nRebates\nRebates are offered to the Company's key chain drug store, distributor and wholesaler customers to promote customer loyalty and increase product sales. These rebate programs provide customers with credits upon attainment of pre-established volumes or attainment of net sales milestones for a specified period. Other promotional programs are incentive programs offered to the customers. Additionally, as a result of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act ( PPACA\u201d) enacted in the U.S. in March 2010, the Company participates in a new cost-sharing program for certain Medicare Part D beneficiaries designed primarily for the sale of brand drugs and certain generic drugs if their FDA approval was granted under a NDA or 505(b) NDA versus an ANDA. Drugs purchased within the Medicare Part D coverage gap (commonly referred to as the donut hole\u201d) result in additional rebates. The Company estimates the reserve for rebates and other promotional credit programs based on the specific terms in each agreement when revenue is recognized. The reserve for rebates increases (decreases) as sales to certain wholesale and retail customers increase (decrease). However, since these rebate programs are not identical for all customers, the size of the reserve will depend on the mix of sales to customers that are eligible to receive rebates.\nReturns\nConsistent with industry practice, the Company has a product returns policy that allows customers to return product within a specified time period prior to and subsequent to the product's expiration date in exchange for a credit to be applied to future purchases. The Company's policy requires that the customer obtain pre-approval from the Company for any qualifying return. The Company estimates its provision for returns based on historical experience, changes to business practices, credit terms and any extenuating circumstances known to management. While historical experience has allowed for reasonable estimations in the past, future returns may or may not follow historical trends. The Company continually monitors the reserve for returns and makes adjustments when management believes that actual product returns may differ from the established reserve. Generally, the reserve for returns increases as net sales increase.\nOther Adjustments\nOther adjustments consist primarily of price adjustments, also known as shelf-stock adjustments\u201d and price protections,\u201d which are both credits issued to reflect increases or decreases in the invoice or contract prices of the Company's products. In the case of a price decrease, a credit is given for product remaining in customer's inventories at the time of the price reduction. Contractual price protection results in a similar credit when the invoice or contract prices of the Company's products increase, effectively allowing customers to purchase products at previous prices for a specified period of time. Amounts recorded for estimated shelf-stock adjustments and price protections are based upon specified terms with direct customers, estimated changes in market prices and estimates of inventory held by customers. The Company regularly monitors these and other factors and evaluates the reserve as additional information becomes available. Other adjustments also include prompt payment discounts and failure-to-supply\u201d adjustments. If the Company is unable to fulfill certain customer orders, the customer can purchase products from our competitors at their prices and charge the Company for any difference in our contractually agreed upon prices.\nInventories\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value determined by the first-in, first-out method. Inventories are regularly reviewed and write-downs for excess and obsolete inventory are recorded based primarily on current inventory levels, expiration date and estimated sales forecasts. While estimated sales forecasts are subjective in nature, the projections allow management to reasonably predict the net realizable value of current inventory based on expected demand. A decrease in the estimated sales forecasts would indicate the need to write-down excess and obsolete inventory. Management continuously monitors the market activity and assesses inventory levels.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company uses the liability method to account for income taxes as prescribed by ASC 740, Income Taxes. Deferred taxes are recorded to reflect the tax consequences on future years of events that the Company has already recognized in the financial statement or tax"}
