    "item_7": "ITEM 7.\n</td> <td> MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOverview\nRCM participates in a market that is cyclical in nature and sensitive to economic changes. As a result, the impact of economic changes on revenue and operations can be substantial, resulting in significant volatility in the Company's financial performance.\nThe Company believes it has developed and assembled an attractive portfolio of capabilities, established a proven record of performance and credibility and built an efficient pricing structure. The Company is committed to optimizing its business model as a single-source premier provider of business and technology solutions with a strong vertical focus offering an integrated suite of services through a global delivery platform.\nThe Company believes that most companies recognize the importance of advanced technologies and business processes to compete in today's business climate. However, the process of designing, developing and implementing business and technology solutions is becoming increasingly complex. The Company believes that many businesses today are focused on return on investment analysis in prioritizing their initiatives. This has had an adverse impact on spending by current and prospective clients for many emerging new solutions.\nNonetheless, the Company continues to believe that businesses must implement more advanced information technology and engineering solutions to upgrade their systems, applications and processes so that they can maximize their productivity and optimize their performance in order to maintain a competitive advantage. Although working under budgetary, personnel and expertise constraints, companies are driven to support increasingly complex systems, applications and processes of significant strategic value. This has given rise to a demand for outsourcing. The Company believes that its current and prospective clients are continuing to evaluate the potential for outsourcing business critical systems, applications and processes.\nThe Company provides project management and consulting services, which are billed based on either agreed-upon fixed fees or hourly rates, or a combination of both. The billing rates and profit margins for project management and solutions services are generally higher than those for professional consulting services. The Company generally endeavors to expand its sales of higher margin solutions and project management services. The Company also realizes revenue from client engagements that range from the placement of contract and temporary technical consultants to project assignments that entail the delivery of end-to-end solutions. These services are primarily provided to the client at hourly rates that are established for each of the Company's consultants based upon their skill level, experience and the type of work performed.\nThe majority of the Company's services are provided under purchase orders. Contracts are utilized on certain of the more complex assignments where the engagements are for longer terms or where precise documentation on the nature and scope of the assignment is necessary. Although contracts normally relate to longer-term and more complex engagements, they do not obligate the customer to purchase a minimum level of services and are generally terminable by the customer on 60 to 90 days' notice. The Company, from time to time, enters into contracts requiring the completion of specific deliverables. Typically, these contracts are for less than one year. In certain instances, the Company recognizes revenue when invoiced at the time certain milestones are reached, as defined in the contract. The Company may also recognize revenue between milestones when costs are incurred using the percentage of completion method.\nCosts of services consist primarily of salaries and compensation-related expenses for billable consultants and employees, including payroll taxes, employee benefits and insurance. Selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and benefits of personnel responsible for business development, recruiting, operating activities, and training, and include corporate overhead expenses. Corporate overhead expenses relate to salaries and benefits of personnel responsible for corporate activities, including the Company's corporate marketing, administrative and financial reporting responsibilities and acquisition program. The Company records these expenses when incurred. Corporate overhead expenses are allocated to the segments based on revenue for the purpose of segment financial reporting.\nTable 48: <table> <tr> <td> ITEM 7.\n</td> <td> MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThis Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( U.S. GAAP\u201d). The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. In our condensed consolidated financial statements, estimates are used for, but not limited to, accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts, goodwill, long-lived intangible assets, accounting for stock options and restricted stock units, insurance liabilities, accounting for income taxes and accrued bonuses.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company records revenue under Accounting Standards Codification (\"ASC\") Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. Revenue is recognized when we satisfy a performance obligation by transferring services promised in a contract to a customer, in an amount that reflects the consideration that we expect to receive in exchange for those services. Performance obligations in our contracts represent distinct or separate service streams that we provide to our customers.\nWe evaluate our revenue contracts with customers based on the five-step model under ASC 606: (1) Identify the contract with the customer; (2) Identify the performance obligations in the contract; (3) Determine the transaction price; (4) Allocate the transaction price to separate performance obligations; and (5) Recognize revenue when (or as) each performance obligation is satisfied.\nThe Company derives its revenue from several sources. The Company's Engineering Services and Information Technology Services segments perform consulting and project solution services. All of the Company's segments perform staff augmentation services and derive revenue from permanent placement fees. The majority of the Company's revenue is invoiced on a time and materials basis.\nThe following table presents our revenues disaggregated by revenue source for the fifty-two week periods ended December 28, 2019 and December 29, 2018:\nTable 49: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> December 28,\n</td> <td> </td> <td> December 29,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Engineering:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Time and Material\n</td> <td> $55,195\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $71,639\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Fixed Fee\n</td> <td> 12,678\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 14,424\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Permanent Placement Services\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total Engineering\n</td> <td> $67,873\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $86,078\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Specialty Health Care:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Time and Material\n</td> <td> $88,057\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $82,153\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Permanent Placement Services\n</td> <td> 1,291\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 1,510\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total Specialty Health Care\n</td> <td> $89,348\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $83,663\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Information Technology:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Time and Material\n</td> <td> $33,384\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $30,361\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Permanent Placement Services\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total Information Technology\n</td> <td> $33,879\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $30,611\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> $191,100\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $200,352\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 50: <table> <tr> <td> ITEM 7.\n</td> <td> MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenue Recognition (Continued)\nTime and Material\nThe Company's IT and Healthcare segments predominantly recognize revenue through time and material work while its Engineering segment recognizes revenue through both time and material and fixed fee work. The Company's time and material contracts are typically based on the number of hours worked at contractually agreed upon rates, therefore revenue associated with these time and materials contracts are recognized based on hours worked at contracted rates.\nFixed fee\nFrom time to time and predominantly in our Engineering segment, the Company will enter into contracts requiring the completion of specific deliverables. The Company has master services agreements with many of its customers that broadly define terms and conditions. Actual services performed under fixed fee arrangements are typically delivered under purchase orders that more specifically define terms and conditions related to that fixed fee project. While these master services agreements can often span several years, the Company's fixed fee purchase orders are typically performed over six to nine-month periods. In instances where project services are provided on a fixed-price basis, revenue is recorded in accordance with the terms of each contract. In certain instances, revenue is invoiced at the time certain milestones are reached, as defined in the contract. Revenue under these arrangements are recognized as the costs on these contracts are incurred. On an infrequent basis, amounts paid in excess of revenue earned and recognized are recorded as deferred revenue, included in accounts payable and accrued expenses on the accompanying balance sheets. In other instances, revenue is billed and recorded based upon contractual rates per hour. Additionally, some contracts contain Performance Fees\u201d (bonuses) for completing a contract under budget. Performance Fees, if any, are recorded when earned. Some contracts also limit revenue and billings to specified maximum amounts. Provisions for contract losses, if any, are made in the period such losses are determined. For contracts where there is a specific deliverable, the work is not complete and the revenue is not recognized, the costs incurred are deferred as a prepaid asset. The associated costs are expensed when the related revenue is recognized.\nPermanent Placement Services\nThe Company earns permanent placement fees from providing permanent placement services. These fees are typically based on a percentage of the compensation paid to the person placed with the Company's client.\nDeferred revenue was $0.4 million and $0.2 million at December 28, 2019 and December 29, 2018, respectively and is included in accounts payable and accrued expenses in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet at those dates. Revenue is recognized when the service has been performed. Deferred revenue may be recognized over a period exceeding one year from the time it was recorded on the balance sheet. For the fifty-two week period ended December 28, 2019, the Company recognized revenue of $0.2 million that was included in deferred revenue at the beginning of the reporting period.\nAccounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts\nThe Company's accounts receivable are primarily due from trade customers. Credit is extended based on evaluation of customers' financial condition and, generally, collateral is not required. Accounts receivable payment terms vary and are stated in the financial statements at amounts due from customers net of an allowance for doubtful accounts. Accounts outstanding longer than the payment terms are considered past due. The Company determines its allowance by considering a number of factors, including the length of time trade accounts receivable are past due, the Company's previous loss history, the customer's current ability to pay its obligation to the Company, and the condition of the general economy and the industry as a whole. The Company writes off accounts receivable when they become uncollectible, and payments subsequently received on such receivables previously written off are credited to bad debt expense.\nTable 51: <table> <tr> <td> ITEM 7.\n</td> <td> MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nGoodwill\nGoodwill is not amortized but is subject to periodic testing for impairment in accordance with ASC Topic 350 Intangibles - Goodwill and Other - Testing Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets for Impairment\u201d ( ASC Topic 350\u201d). The Company tests goodwill for impairment on an annual basis as of the last day of the Company's fiscal December each year or more frequently if events occur or circumstances change indicating that the fair value of the goodwill may be below its carrying amount. The Company has three reporting units. The Company uses a market-based approach to determine the fair value of the reporting units. This approach uses earnings/revenue multiples of similar companies recently completing acquisitions and the ability of our reporting units to generate cash flows as measures of fair value of our reporting units. The Company adopted Accounting Standards Update ( ASU\u201d) 2017-04, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment\u201d effective December 29, 2018 which has eliminated Step 2 from the goodwill impairment test. Under this update, an entity should perform its goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount.\nThere was no goodwill impairment in fiscal 2019 or 2018. During all periods presented, the Company determined that the existing qualitative factors did not suggest that an impairment of goodwill exists. There can be no assurance that future indicators of impairment and tests of goodwill impairment will not result in impairment charges for both its Engineering and Specialty Healthcare segments.\nLong-Lived and Intangible Assets\nThe Company evaluates long-lived assets and intangible assets with definite lives for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. When the Company determines that it is probable that undiscounted future cash flows will not be sufficient to recover an asset's carrying amount, the asset is written down to its fair value. Assets to be disposed of by sale, if any, are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell.\nAccounting for Restricted Stock Units\nThe Company uses restricted stock units to attract, retain and reward employees for long-term service. The Company follows Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB), Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 718 Compensation - Stock Compensation\u201d which requires that the compensation cost relating to stock-based payment transactions be recognized in the financial statements. This compensation cost is measured based on the fair value of the equity or liability instruments issued. The Company measures stock-based compensation cost using the Black-Scholes option pricing model for stock options and the fair value of the underlying common stock at the date of grant for restricted stock units.\nInsurance Liabilities\nThe Company has risk participation arrangements with respect to workers compensation and health care insurance. The Company establishes loss provisions based on historical experience and in the case of expected losses from workers compensation, considers input from third parties. The amounts included in the Company's costs related to this risk participation are estimated and can vary based on changes in assumptions, the Company's claims experience or the providers included in the associated insurance programs.\nTable 52: <table> <tr> <td> ITEM 7.\n</td> <td> MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAccounting for Income Taxes\nIn establishing the provision for income taxes and deferred income tax assets and liabilities and valuation allowances against deferred tax assets, the Company makes judgments and interpretations based on enacted tax laws, published tax guidance and estimates of future earnings. As of December 28, 2019, the Company had both domestic and foreign net deferred tax net liabilities of $0.4 million. The domestic long term deferred tax net liability includes $1.2 million in deferred assets offset by $1.6 million in deferred tax liabilities. The domestic deferred tax assets consist of a net operating loss carryforward of $0.3 million and various deferred expense accruals and reserves of $0.9 million. The deferred tax liabilities consist of prepaid expenses of $0.7 million, acquisition amortization of $0.6 million and advance depreciation deductions of $0.3 million. The realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the likelihood that future taxable income will be sufficient to realize these benefits over time, and the effectiveness of tax planning strategies in the relevant tax jurisdictions. If actual results differ from these estimates and assessments, valuation allowances may be required.\nThe Company conducts its operations in multiple tax jurisdictions in the United States, Canada, Puerto Rico and Serbia. The Company and its subsidiaries file a consolidated United States Federal income tax return and file in various states. The Company's federal income tax returns have been examined through 2012. The Internal Revenue Service is currently examining fiscal tax years 2013, 2015, 2016 and 2017. The State of New Jersey is currently examining fiscal tax years 2009 through 2012. Except for New Jersey and other limited exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to audits by state and local tax authorities for tax years prior to 2015. The Company is no longer subject to audit in Canada for the tax years prior to tax year 2015. The Company is no longer subject to audit in Puerto Rico for the tax years prior to tax year 2009.\nThe Company's future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by changes in the valuation of its deferred tax assets or liabilities or changes in tax laws or interpretations thereof. In addition, the Company is subject to the examination of its income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities. The Company regularly assesses the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for income taxes.\nAccrued Bonuses\nThe Company pays bonuses to certain executive management, field management and corporate employees based on, or after giving consideration to, a variety of financial performance measures. Bonuses for executive management, field management and certain corporate employees are accrued throughout the year for payment during the first quarter of the following year, based in part upon anticipated annual results compared to annual budgets. In addition, the Company pays discretionary bonuses to certain employees, which are not related to budget performance. Variances in actual results versus budgeted amounts can have a significant impact on the calculations and therefore on the estimates of the required accruals. Accordingly, the actual earned bonuses may be materially different from the estimates used to determine the quarterly accruals.\nTable 53: <table> <tr> <td> ITEM 7.\n</td> <td> MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nPerformance-Based Restricted Stock Units\nFrom time-to-time the Company issues performance-based restricted stock units to its executives. Performance-based restricted stock units are typically vested based on certain multi-year performance metrics as determined by the Board of Directors Compensation Committee. The Company will reassess at each reporting date whether achievement of any performance condition is probable and would begin recognizing additional compensation cost if and when achievement of the performance condition becomes probable. The Company will then recognize the appropriate expense cumulatively in the year performance becomes probable and recognize the remaining compensation cost over the remaining requisite service period. If at a later measurement date the Company determines that performance-based restricted stock units deemed as likely to vest are deemed as unlikely to vest, the expense recognized will be reversed. These performance-based restricted stock units typically include dividend accrual equivalents, which means that any dividends paid by the Company during the vesting period become due and payable after the vesting period on any stock units that actually vest, if any. Dividends for these grants are accrued on the dividend payment dates and included in accounts payable and accrued expenses on the accompanying consolidated balance sheet. Dividends for performance-based restricted stock units that ultimately do not vest are forfeited.\nForward-looking Information\nThe Company's growth prospects are influenced by broad economic trends. The pace of customer capital spending programs, new product launches and similar activities have a direct impact on the need for engineering and information technology services. When the U.S., Canadian or global economies decline, the Company's operating performance could be adversely impacted. The Company believes that its fiscal discipline, strategic focus on targeted vertical markets and diversification of service offerings provides some insulation from adverse trends. However, declines in the economy could result in the need for future cost reductions or changes in strategy.\nAdditionally, changes in government regulations could result in prohibition or restriction of certain types of employment services or the imposition of new or additional employee benefits, licensing or tax requirements with respect to the provision of employment services that may reduce the Company's future earnings. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to increase the fees charged to its clients in a timely manner and in a sufficient amount to cover increased costs as a result of any of the foregoing.\nThe consulting and employment services market is highly competitive with limited barriers to entry. The Company competes in global, national, regional and local markets with numerous competitors in all of the Company's service lines. Price competition in the industries the Company serves is significant, and pricing pressures from competitors and customers are increasing. The Company expects that the level of competition will remain high in the future, which could limit the Company's ability to maintain or increase its market share or profitability.\nTable 54: <table> <tr> <td> ITEM 7.\n</td> <td> MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFiscal Year Ended December 28, 2019 Compared to Fiscal Year Ended December 29, 2018\nA summary of operating results for the fifty-two week periods ended December 28, 2019 and December 29, 2018 is as follows (in thousands):\nTable 55: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> Fiscal Years Ended\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> December 28, 2019\n</td> <td> </td> <td> December 29, 2018\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>\nAmount\n</td> <td> </td> <td> % of Revenue\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\nAmount\n</td> <td> </td> <td> % of Revenue\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revenues\n</td> <td> $191,100\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $200,352\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 100.0\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cost of services\n</td> <td> 142,508\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 74.6\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 151,042\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 75.4\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gross profit\n</td> <td> 48,592\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 25.4\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 49,310\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 24.6\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Selling, general and administrative\n</td> <td> 40,390\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 21.1\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 40,386\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 20.2\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Depreciation and amortization of property and\nequipment\n</td> <td> 1,261\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 0.7\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 1,442\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 0.7\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Amortization of acquired intangible assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 0.2\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 0.1\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Severance, professional fees, office closures and\nother charges\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 1,571\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 0.7\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Tax credit professional fees\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 0.0\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 0.2\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating costs and expenses\n</td> <td> 42,025\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 22.0\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 43,895\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 21.9\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating income\n</td> <td> 6,567\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 3.4\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 5,415\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 2.7\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other expense, net and foreign currency transactions\n</td> <td> (1,745\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> (0.9\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> (1,507\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> (0.7\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income before income taxes\n</td> <td> 4,822\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 2.5\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 3,908\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 2.0\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income tax expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 0.4\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 1,193\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 0.6\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net income\n</td> <td> $4,058\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 2.1\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $2,715\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 1.4\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Company follows a 52/53 week fiscal reporting calendar ending on the Saturday closest to December 31. The fiscal years ended December 28, 2019 (fiscal 2019) and December 29, 2018 (fiscal 2018) consisted of fifty-two weeks each.\nRevenue. Revenue decreased 4.6%, or $9.3 million, for the fifty-two week period ended December 28, 2019 as compared to the fifty-two week period ended December 29, 2018 (the comparable prior year period\u201d). Revenue decreased $18.2 million in the Engineering segment, increased $5.7 million in the Specialty Health Care segment and increased $3.3 million in the Information Technology segment. See Segment Discussion for further information on revenue changes.\nThe Company has material operations in Canada, primarily from the Company's Engineering segment; this business is conducted primarily in Canadian dollars. Since the Company reports its consolidated results in U.S. dollars the consolidated results are subject to potentially material fluctuations as a result of changes in the Canadian dollar to U.S. dollar exchange rate (the Exchange Rate\u201d). For the fifty-two week period ended December 28, 2019, the Company generated total revenue from its Canadian clients of $16.8 million in U.S. dollars at an Exchange Rate of 75.3% as compared to $27.9 million in U.S. dollars at an Exchange Rate of 77.3% for the comparable prior year period.\nTable 56: <table> <tr> <td> ITEM 7.\n</td> <td> MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFiscal Year Ended December 28, 2019 Compared to Fiscal Year Ended December 29, 2018\nCost of Services and Gross Profit. Cost of services decreased 5.7%, or $8.5 million, for the fifty-two week period ended December 28, 2019 as compared to the comparable prior year period. Cost of services decreased due to the decrease in revenue. Cost of services as a percentage of revenue for the fifty-two week periods ended December 28, 2019 and December 29, 2018 were 74.6% and 75.4%, respectively. See Segment Discussion for further information regarding changes in cost of services and gross profit.\nSelling, General and Administrative. Selling, general and administrative ( SGA\u201d) expenses were $40.4 million for both the fifty-two week periods ended December 28, 2019 and December 29, 2018. As a percentage of revenue, SGA expenses were 21.1% for the fifty-two week period ended December 28, 2019 and 20.2% for the comparable prior year period. See Segment Discussion for further information on SGA expense changes.\nSeverance, Professional Fees and Other Charges. The Company did not incur any comparative severance, professional fees and other charges for the fifty-two week period ended December 28, 2019 as compared to $1.6 million for the fifty-two week period ended December 29, 2018. The fiscal 2018 charges include severance accrued for the Company's former chief executive officer and related payroll taxes, continuation of certain benefits and professional fees, totaling approximately $0.9 million. The additional charges of $0.7 million incurred related to transactional financial advisory fees, legal fees associated with defending a frivolous lawsuit by a competitor of the Company, professional fees associated with the acquisition of Thermal Kinetics and search fees associated with hiring a senior executive.\nTax Credit Professional Fees. The Company incurred de minimis tax credit professional fees in the fifty-two week period ended December 28, 2019 as compared to $0.4 million in the comparable prior year period.\nOther Expense. Other expense consists of interest expense, unused line fees and amortized loan costs on the Company's line of credit, net of interest income imputed interest on contingent consideration and gains and losses on foreign currency transactions. Other expense, net increased to $1.7 million as compared to $1.5 million for the comparable prior year period. The primary component of the increase was interest expense which increased due to increased borrowings under the Company's line of credit. The primary reason for the increased borrowing was to fund the Company's increase in accounts receivable during the fifty-two week period ended December 28, 2019, as compared to the comparable prior year period.\nIncome Tax Expense. The Company recognized $0.8 million of income tax expense for the fifty-two week period ended December 28, 2019, as compared to $1.2 million for the comparable prior year period. The Company recognized a tax benefit of $0.7 million in fiscal 2019 due to settlements with the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and state New Jersey regarding research and development tax credits generated in prior years. Otherwise, the consolidated effective income tax rate for the current period was 29.6% as compared to 30.5% for the comparable prior year period. Not including the research and development tax credits and other discrete tax adjustments in fiscal 2018, the Company has income tax rates as of December 28, 2019 of approximately 28.0%, 26.5% and 15.0% in the United States, Canada and Serbia, respectively. The relative income or loss generated in each jurisdiction can materially impact the overall effective income tax rate of the Company, particularly the ratio of Canadian and Serbian pretax income versus U.S. pretax income.\nTable 57: <table> <tr> <td> ITEM 7.\n</td> <td> MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFiscal Year Ended December 28, 2019 Compared to Fiscal Year Ended December 29, 2018 (Continued)\nSegment Discussion\nEngineering\nEngineering revenues of $67.9 million for the fifty-two week period ended December 28, 2019 decreased 21.1%, or $18.2 million, as compared to the comparable prior year period. The decrease was principally due to a decrease of $7.7 million from the Company's Energy Services Group, a decrease of $7.7 million from the Company's Canadian Power Systems Group, and a decrease of $2.8 million from the Company's Aerospace Group, partially offset by an increase of $1.9 million from the TKE acquisition. The Company attributes these revenue declines to decreased spending on the part of its Canadian Power Systems and Aerospace clients, increased competition from other vendors to its Canadian Power Systems clients, and timing of large projects from the Company's Energy Services clients. Gross profit decreased by 18.2%, or $4.1 million, as compared to the comparable prior year period. Gross profit decreased primarily because of the decrease in revenue. Gross margin of 27.2% for the current period increased from 26.2% for the comparable prior year period. The increase in gross margin was primarily due to a concerted effort to improve utilization of the Engineering segment's billable consultants. The Engineering segment operating income decreased by $1.7 million to $3.7 million for the fifty-two week period ended December 28, 2019, as compared to $5.4 million for the comparable prior year period. The decrease in operating income was primarily due to the decreases in revenue and gross profit and offset by a decrease of $2.4 million to SGA expense. The decrease in SGA expense was primarily due to a concerted effort to reduce expenses to an efficient level commensurate with current revenue and gross profit and a lower allocation of corporate-generated SGA expense relative to the Company's other two segments.\nSpecialty Health Care\nSpecialty Health Care revenue of $89.3 million for the fifty-two week period ended December 28, 2019 increased 6.8%, or $5.7 million, as compared to the comparable prior year period. The increase was primarily driven by increases of $7.2 million from the New York City office, and $3.2 million from the Honolulu office, offset by decreases of $2.2 million from the travel nursing staffing group, $0.7 million from the Chicago office, $0.6 million from the HIM practice, $0.5 million from the Locum Tenens Group and $0.2 million from the Permanent Placement Group. The primary reason for revenue increases in New York City and Hawaii was the incremental addition of paraprofessionals billed on school contracts. The Company primarily attributes the decline in revenue from its travel nursing staffing group to increased competition from large national competitors. The Specialty Health Care segment's gross profit increased by 11.1%, or $2.1 million, to $20.9 million for the fifty-two week period ended December 28, 2019, as compared to $18.8 million for the prior year period. The increase in gross profit was primarily driven by the increase in revenue. Gross profit margin for the fifty-two week period ended December 28, 2019 increased to 23.4% as compared to 22.5% for the comparable prior year period. The Company primarily attributes the increase in gross profit margin to bill rate increases on certain major school contracts. Specialty Health Care experienced operating income of $2.9 million for the fifty-two week period ended December 28, 2019, as compared to $1.9 million for the comparable prior year period. The primary reason for the increase in operating income was the increase to revenue and gross profit. SGA expense increased by $1.1 million to $17.6 million, as compared to $16.5 million in the comparable prior year period. The increase in SGA expense was primarily due to the need to increase SGA infrastructure expense to support the increased activity levels associated with higher revenue and a higher allocation of corporate-generated SGA expense.\nTable 58: <table> <tr> <td> ITEM 7.\n</td> <td> MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFiscal Year Ended December 28, 2019 Compared to Fiscal Year Ended December 29, 2018 (Continued)\nSegment Discussion (Continued)\nInformation Technology\nInformation Technology revenue of $33.9 million for the fifty-two week period ended December 28, 2019 increased 10.7%, or $3.3 million, as compared to $30.6 million for the comparable prior year period. The Company experienced increases to revenue from most of its Information Technology business lines. The Company attributes these increases to investments in management and sales personnel. Gross profit of $9.2 million for the fifty-two week period ended December 28, 2019 increased 16.6%, or $1.3 million, as compared to $7.9 million for the comparable prior year period. The increase in gross profit was primarily due to the increase in revenue. The Information Technology gross profit margin for the fifty-two week period ended December 28, 2019 was 27.2% as compared to 25.9% for the comparable prior year period. The Company attributes the gross margin increase to higher utilization of the Information Technology's fixed labor consultants. SGA expense increased by $1.3 million to $9.1 million. The increase in SGA expense was primarily due to increased investments in management and sales personnel and a higher allocation of corporate-generated SGA expense. The Information Technology segment experienced a negligible increase to operating income as the increase in gross profit approximately offset the increase in SGA expense.\nTable 59: <table> <tr> <td> ITEM 7.\n</td> <td> MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFiscal Year Ended December 28, 2019 Compared to Fiscal Year Ended December 29, 2018 (Continued)\nSupplemental Operating Results on a Non-GAAP Basis\nThe following non-GAAP measures, which adjust for the categories of expenses described below, primarily changes in contingent consideration as a result of re-measurement in the amount of contingent consideration we expect to pay with respect to past acquisitions, are non-GAAP financial measures. Our management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures ( EBITDA\u201d and Adjusted EBITDA\u201d) are useful information for investors, shareholders and other stakeholders of our company in gauging our results of operations on an ongoing basis and to enhance investors' overall understanding of our current financial performance and period-to-period comparisons. We believe that both EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are performance measures and not liquidity measures, and therefore a reconciliation between net income and EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA has been provided. Neither EBITDA nor Adjusted EBITDA should be considered as an alternative to net income as an indicator of performance. In addition, neither EBITDA nor Adjusted EBITDA takes into account changes in certain assets and liabilities as well as interest and income taxes that can affect cash flows. We do not intend the presentation of these non-GAAP measures to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for results prepared in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP measures should be read only in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP.\nThe following unaudited table presents the Company's GAAP Net Income measure and the corresponding adjustments used to calculate EBITDA\u201d and Adjusted EBITDA\u201d for the fifty-two week periods ended December 28, 2019 and December 29, 2018.\nTable 60: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> Fifty-Two Week Periods Ended\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> December 28, 2019\n</td> <td> </td> <td> December 29,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> GAAP net income\n</td> <td> $4,058\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $2,715\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income tax expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 1,193\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest expense\n</td> <td> 1,695\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 1,367\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Imputed interest on contingent consideration\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Depreciation of property and equipment\n</td> <td> 1,261\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 1,442\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Amortization of acquired intangible assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> EBITDA (non-GAAP)\n</td> <td> $8,166\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $6,946\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Adjustments\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Severance, professional fees, office closures\nand other charges\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 1,571\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Tax credit professional fees\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loss on foreign currency transactions\n</td> <td> (11\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Adjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP)\n</td> <td> $8,202\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $8,924\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 61: <table> <tr> <td> ITEM 7.\n</td> <td> MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nThe following table summarizes the major captions from the Company's Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows\n($ in thousands):\nTable 62: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> Fiscal Years Ended\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> December 28,\n</td> <td> </td> <td> December 29,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash (used in) provided by:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> Operating activities\n</td> <td> ($4,778\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> ($64\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> Investing activities\n</td> <td> ($363\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> ($2,583\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> Financing activities\n</td> <td> $6,627\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $346\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating Activities\nOperating activities used $4.8 million of cash for the fifty-two week period ended December 28, 2019 as compared to $0.1 million in the comparable prior year period. The major components of cash used in or provided by operating activities in the fifty-two week period ended December 28, 2019 and the comparable prior year period are as follows: net income and changes in accounts receivable, the net of transit accounts payable and transit accounts receivable, prepaid expenses and other current assets, accounts payable and accrued expenses and accrued payroll and related costs.\nNet income for the fifty-two week period ended December 28, 2019 was $4.1 million as compared to $2.7 million for the comparable prior year period. An increase in accounts receivables in the fifty-two week period ended December 28, 2019 used $7.6 million of cash as compared to $7.7 million in the comparable prior year period. The Company attributes the increase in accounts receivables for the fifty-two week period ended December 28, 2019 to several different clients in both its Engineering and Specialty Health Care segments that experienced temporary delays in its approval and payment processes. The Company anticipates that its accounts receivable balance relative to revenue will improve during the first quarter of fiscal 2020.\nThe Company's transit accounts payable usually exceeds the Company's transit accounts receivable, but absolute amounts and differences fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter in the normal course of business. The net of transit accounts payable and transit accounts receivable was a net receivable of $0.3 million as of December 28, 2019 and negligible as of December 29, 2018, using $0.3 million of cash during the fifty-two week period ended December 28, 2019. The net of transit accounts payable and transit accounts receivable was a net receivable of $0.1 million and a net payable of $1.7 million as of December 29, 2018 and December 30, 2017, respectively, the cash impact during the fifty-two week period ended December 29, 2018 used $1.8 million in cash.\nPrepaid expenses and other current assets used $0.6 million of cash for the fifty-two week period ended December 28, 2019 as compared to using $0.2 million of cash for the comparable prior year period. The Company attributes changes to prepaid expenses and other current assets, if any, to general timing of payments in the normal course of business.\nA decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses used $3.1 million for the fifty-two week period ended December 28, 2019 as compared to providing $1.0 million of cash for the comparable prior year period. The Company attributes these changes to general timing of payments to vendors in the normal course of business.\nTable 63: <table> <tr> <td> ITEM 7.\n</td> <td> MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nLiquidity and Capital Resources (Continued)\nOperating Activities (Continued)\nChanges in accrued payroll and related costs used $1.3 million for the fifty-two week period ended December 28, 2019 as compared to providing $1.3 million for the fifty-two week period December 29, 2018. There are three primary factors that generally impact accrued payroll and related costs: 1) there is a general correlation to operating expenses as payroll and related costs is the Company's largest expense group, so as operating costs increase or decrease, absent all other factors, so will the accrued payroll and related costs; 2) the Company pays the majority of its payroll every two weeks and normally has thirteen weeks in a fiscal quarter, which means that the Company normally has a major payroll on the last business day of every other quarter; and 3) most of the Company's senior management participate in annual incentive plans and while progress advances are sometimes made during the fiscal year, these accrued bonus balances, to the extent they are projected to be achieved, generally accumulate throughout the year. A significant portion of these incentive plan accruals are typically paid at the beginning of one fiscal year, pertaining to the prior fiscal year. The Company's last major payroll for the fifty-two week period ended December 28, 2019 was paid on December 20, 2019. Additionally, the Company accrued $0.8 million as of December 29, 2018 for severance and other benefits for its former CEO that terminated in fiscal 2018. The entire balance was paid in fiscal 2019.\nInvesting Activities\nInvesting activities used cash of $0.4 million and $2.6 million for the fifty-two week periods ended December 28, 2019 and December 29, 2018, respectively. Investing activities included expenditures for property and equipment of $0.4 million and $1.5 million for the current and comparable prior year period, respectively. The decrease was due to an abnormally high outlay for software in fiscal 2018. The Company spent $1.1 million on the TKE acquisition in fiscal 2018 and did not make any acquisitions in fiscal 2019.\nFinancing Activities\nFinancing activities provided $6.7 million of cash for the fifty-two week period ended December 28, 2019 as compared to $0.3 million in the comparable prior year period. The Company made net borrowings under its line of credit of $7.2 million during the fifty-two week period ended December 28, 2019 as compared to net borrowings of $0.3 million in the comparable prior year period. The primary reason for net borrowings during the fifty-two week period ended December 28, 2019 was to fund the $7.6 million increase in accounts receivable. The Company generated cash of $0.3 million from sales of shares from its equity plans for the current period and $0.4 million for the comparable prior year period. The Company paid $0.6 million in contingent consideration during the fifty-two week period ended December 28, 2019, as compared to $0.3 million in the comparable prior year period.\nThe Company and its subsidiaries amended and restated its Revolving Credit Facility with Citizens Bank of Pennsylvania on October 18, 2019. As amended and restated, the Revolving Credit Facility provides for a $45.0 million revolving credit facility, has no sub-limit for letters of credit, and expires on August 8, 2023.\nBorrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility bear interest at one of two alternative rates, as selected by the Company at each incremental borrowing. These alternatives are: (i) LIBOR (London Interbank Offered Rate), plus applicable margin, typically borrowed in fixed 30-day increments or (ii) the agent bank's prime rate generally borrowed over shorter durations. The Company also pays unused line fees based on the amount of the Revolving Credit Facility that is not drawn. Unused line fees are recorded as interest expense. The effective weighted average interest rate, including unused line fees, for the fifty-two week period ended December 28, 2019 was 4.4%.\nTable 64: <table> <tr> <td> ITEM 7.\n</td> <td> MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nLiquidity and Capital Resources (Continued)\nFinancing Activities (Continued)\nAll borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility are collateralized by all of the assets of the Company and its subsidiaries and a pledge of the stock of its subsidiaries. The Revolving Credit Facility contains various financial and non-financial covenants, such as a covenant that restricts on the Company's ability to borrow in order to pay dividends. As of December 28, 2019, the Company was in compliance with all covenants contained in the Revolving Credit Facility.\nBorrowings under the line of credit as of December 28, 2019 and December 29, 2018 were $34.8 million and $27.5 million, respectively. At December 28, 2019 and December 29, 2018 there were letters of credit outstanding for $1.6 million. At December 28, 2019, the Company had availability for additional borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility of $8.6 million.\nDividends\nAll restricted share units contain a dividend equivalent provision entitling holders to dividends paid between the restricted stock unit grant date and ultimate share distribution date. Total accrued dividends as of December 28, 2019 were $40,000 and are eligible to be paid in fiscal 2020. Dividends on any forfeited restricted share units will be forfeited.\nWhile the Company, at this time, has no plans to issue any future dividends, any future payment of dividends will depend upon, among other things, the Company's earnings, financial condition, capital requirements, level of indebtedness, contractual restrictions, and other factors that the Board of Directors deems relevant. The Revolving Credit Facility (as discussed above) prohibits the payment of any dividends or distributions on account of the Company's capital stock without the prior consent of the majority of the Company's lenders.\nCommitments and Contingencies\nThe Company anticipates that its primary uses of capital in future periods will be for working capital purposes. Funding for any long-term and short-term capital requirements as well as future acquisitions will be derived from one or more of the Revolving Credit Facility (or a replacement thereof), funds generated through operations or future financing transactions. The Company is subject to legal proceedings and claims that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of its business, which may or may not be covered by insurance. Were an unfavorable final outcome to occur, there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact on our financial position, liquidity, and the results of operations.\nThe Company's business strategy is to achieve growth both internally through operations and externally through strategic acquisitions. The Company from time to time engages in discussions with potential acquisition candidates. The Company has acquired numerous companies throughout its history and those acquisitions have generally included significant future contingent consideration. As the size of the Company and its financial resources increase however, acquisition opportunities requiring significant commitments of capital may arise. In order to pursue such opportunities, the Company may be required to incur debt or issue potentially dilutive securities in the future. No assurance can be given as to the Company's future acquisition and expansion opportunities or how such opportunities will be financed.\nTable 65: <table> <tr> <td> ITEM 7.\n</td> <td> MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nLiquidity and Capital Resources (Continued)\nCommitments and Contingencies (Continued)\nThe Company has a dispute with a customer that is a major utility in the United States. Both parties agreed in fiscal 2017 to resolve this dispute through binding arbitration. Arbitration hearings with this customer started in fiscal 2018. Essentially, the customer has not paid the balance of accounts receivable the Company believes are owed for certain disputed projects. As of December 28, 2019 and December 29, 2018, the total amount of outstanding receivables from this customer on these disputed projects was $14.1 million and $8.9 million, respectively, subject to potential upward adjustment in damages claimed in arbitration. Additionally, as part of the arbitration process, the customer has asserted counter-claims. While the total amount of asserted counter-claims is unknown as of December 28, 2019, the total amount of such counter-claims is anticipated to be at least $10.3 million. The Company believes these counter-claims are retaliatory in nature. Prior to the Company asserting its claims, the customer had not asserted any counter-claims. The Company believes these counter-claims asserted by its customer have no merit and were merely asserted as a strategy to reduce the Company's own claims in any arbitration award or potential settlement agreement. The Company believes that its accounts receivable balance, subject to reserves, is fully collectible. Furthermore, the Company believes that this arbitration will conclude prior to reporting its first quarter of fiscal 2020 financial results. While the Company believes the customer's counter-claims to be frivolous and without merit, it can give no assurances that it will ultimately not have to pay all or a portion of such counter-claims. The Company is continuing work on one of the engagements that have given rise to this dispute and also on several engagements from the same client that are not currently part of the arbitration.\nThe Company utilizes SAP software for its financial reporting and accounting system which was implemented in 1999 and has not undergone significant upgrades since its initial implementation. The Company believes that it will become necessary to upgrade or replace its SAP financial reporting and accounting system at some point in the future and anticipates a comprehensive review of the system may take place during fiscal 2020. The Company has not determined when this contemplated replacement may be necessary. The Company estimates this upgrade or replacement of their financial reporting and accounting system will cost between $0.5 million and $1.0 million. These estimates are subject to material change.\nThe Company's current commitments consist primarily of lease obligations for office space. The Company believes that its capital resources are sufficient to meet its present obligations and those to be incurred in the normal course of business for at least the next 12 months.\nThe Company leases office facilities and various equipment under non-cancelable leases expiring at various dates through May 2024. Certain leases are subject to escalation clauses based upon changes in various factors.\nMaturities of lease liabilities are as follows:\nTable 66: <table> <tr> <td>\nFiscal Year Ending\n</td> <td> Operating Leases\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Finance\nLeases\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> $2,334\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $322\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,760\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,301\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Thereafter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total lease payments\n</td> <td> 6,467\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Less: imputed interest\n</td> <td> (412\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> (10\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td> $6,055\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $504\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 67: <table> <tr> <td> ITEM 7.\n</td> <td> MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nLiquidity and Capital Resources (Continued)\nFuture Contingent Payments\nAs of December 28, 2019, the Company had two active acquisition agreements whereby additional contingent consideration may be earned by the former shareholders: 1) effective October 1, 2017, the Company acquired all of the stock of PSR Engineering Solutions d.o.o. Beograd (Vo\u017edovac) ( PSR\u201d) and 2) effective September 30, 2018 the Company acquired certain assets of Thermal Kinetics Engineering, PLLC and Thermal Kinetics Systems, LLC (together, TKE\u201d). The Company estimates future contingent payments at December 28, 2019 as follows:\nTable 68: <table> <tr> <td> Fiscal Year Ending\n</td> <td> Total\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> January 2, 2021\n</td> <td> $344\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> January 1, 2022\n</td> <td> 1,438\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> December 31, 2022\n</td> <td> 1,276\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Estimated future contingent consideration payments\n</td> <td> $3,058\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nEstimates of future contingent payments are subject to significant judgment and actual payments may materially differ from estimates. Potential future contingent payments to be made to all active acquisitions after December 28, 2019 are capped at a cumulative maximum of $6.3 million. The Company estimates future contingent consideration payments based on forecasted performance and recorded the fair value of those expected payments as of December 28, 2019. During the fifty-two week period ended December 28, 2019, the Company measured the intangibles acquired at fair value on a non-recurring basis. Contingent consideration related to acquisitions are recorded at fair value (level 3) with changes in fair value recorded in other (expense) income, net.\nSignificant employment agreements are as follows:\nExecutive Severance Agreements\nThe Company is a party to an Executive Severance Agreement (the Executive Severance Agreement\u201d) with each of Bradley S. Vizi, the Company's Executive Chairman and President (dated as of June 1, 2018), and Kevin Miller, the Company's Chief Financial Officer (dated as of February 28, 2014, as amended) which sets forth the terms and conditions of certain payments to be made by the Company to executive in the event that, while employed by the Company, (a) the Executive experiences a termination of employment unrelated to a Change in Control\u201d (as defined therein) or (b) there occurs a Change in Control and either (i) the Executive's employment is terminated for a reason related to the Change in Control or (ii) in the case of Mr. Miller, Mr. Miller remains continuously employed with the Company for three months following the Change in Control.\nUnder the terms of the Executive Severance Agreement, if either (a) the Executive is involuntarily terminated by the Company for any reason other than Cause\u201d (as defined therein), Disability\u201d (as defined therein) or death, or (b) the Executive resigns for Good Reason\u201d (as defined therein), and, in each case, the termination is not a Termination Related to a Change in Control\u201d (as defined below), the Executive will receive the following severance payments: (i) an amount equal to 1.5 times the sum of (a) the\nExecutive's annual base salary as in effect immediately prior to the termination date (before taking into account any reduction that constitutes Good Reason) ( Annual Base Salary\u201d) and (b) the highest annual bonus paid to the Executive in any of the three fiscal years immediately preceding his termination date ( Bonus\u201d), to be paid in installments over the twelve month period following the Executive's termination date; and (ii) for a period of eighteen months following the Executive's termination date, a monthly payment equal to the monthly COBRA premium that the Executive is required to pay to continue medical, vision, and dental coverage, for himself and, where applicable, his spouse and eligible dependents.\nTable 69: <table> <tr> <td> ITEM 7.\n</td> <td> MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nLiquidity and Capital Resources (Continued)\nFuture Contingent Payments (Continued)\nExecutive Severance Agreements (Continued)\nNotwithstanding the above, if the Executive has a termination as described above and can reasonably demonstrate that such termination would constitute a Termination Related to a Change in Control, and a Change in Control occurs within 120 days following the Executive's termination date, the Executive will be entitled to receive the payments set forth below for a Termination Related to a Change in Control, less any amounts already paid to the Executive, upon consummation of the Change in Control.\nUnder the terms of the Executive Severance Agreement, if a Change in Control occurs and (a) the Executive experiences a Termination Related to a Change in Control on account of (i) an involuntary termination by the Company for any reason other than Cause, death, or Disability, (ii) an involuntary termination by the Company within twelve months (for Mr. Vizi) or three months (for Mr. Miller) following a Change in Control on account of Disability or death, or (iii) a resignation by the Executive with Good Reason; or (b) in the case of Mr. Miller, a resignation by Mr. Miller, with or without Good Reason, which results in a termination date that is the last day of the three month period following a Change in Control, then the Executive will receive the following severance payments: (1) a lump sum payment equal to two times the sum of the Executive's (a) Annual Base Salary and (b) Bonus; and (2) a lump sum payment equal to twenty-four multiplied by the monthly COBRA premium cost, as in effect immediately prior to the Executive's termination date, for the Executive to continue medical, dental and vision coverage, as applicable, in such Company plans for himself and, if applicable, his spouse and eligible dependents. Upon the occurrence of a Change in Control, the Company shall establish an irrevocable rabbi trust and contribute to the rabbi trust the applicable amounts due under the Executive Severance Agreements.\nMr. Miller's Executive Severance Agreement provides that if Mr. Miller remains continuously employed for three months following a Change in Control and is employed by the Company on the last day of such specified period, Mr. Miller will receive a lump sum payment equal to two times the sum of his (a) Annual Base Salary and (b) Bonus (the Change in Control Payment\u201d). If Mr. Miller receives the Change in Control Payment, he will not be eligible to receive any severance payments under his Executive Severance Agreement.\nMr. Petraglia and Mr. Saks, along with several other members of the Company's senior management (not including Mr. Vizi), are covered by our Change in Control Plan for Selected Executive Management (the CIC Plan\u201d).\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nNone.\nImpact of Inflation\nConsulting, staffing, and project services are generally priced based on mark-ups on prevailing rates of pay, and as a result are able to generally maintain their relationship to direct labor costs. Permanent placement services are priced as a function of salary levels of the job candidates.\nThe Company's business is labor intensive; therefore, the Company has a high exposure to increasing health care benefit costs. The Company attempts to compensate for these escalating costs in its business cost models and customer pricing by passing along some of these increased health care benefit costs to its customers and employees, however, the Company has not been able to pass on all increases. The Company is continuing to review its options to further control these costs, which the Company does not believe are representative of general inflationary trends. Otherwise, inflation has not been a meaningful factor in the Company's operations.\nTable 70: <table> <tr> <td> ITEM 7.\n</td> <td> MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nNew Accounting Standards\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326). The new standard amends guidance on reporting credit losses for assets held at amortized cost basis and available-for-sale debt securities. In February 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-02, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326) and Leases (Topic 842) - Amendments to SEC Paragraphs Pursuant to SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 119 and Update to SEC Section on Effective Date Related to Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), which amends the effective date of the original pronouncement for smaller reporting companies. ASU 2016-13 and its amendments will be effective for the Company for interim and annual periods in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022. The Company believes the adoption will modify the way the Company analyzes financial instruments, but it does not anticipate a material impact on results of operations. The Company is in the process of determining the effects the adoption will have on its consolidated financial statements.\nIn December 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-12, Income Taxes (Topic 740), which enhances and simplifies various aspects of the income tax accounting guidance, including requirements such as tax basis step-up in goodwill obtained in a transaction that is not a business combination, ownership changes in investments, and interim-period accounting for enacted changes in tax law. The amendment will be effective for public companies with fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020; early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently assessing the impact of this pronouncement to its consolidated financial statements.\nTable 71: <table> <tr> <td>",

    "item_7_text": "ITEM 7.\n</td> <td> MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOverview\nRCM participates in a market that is cyclical in nature and sensitive to economic changes. As a result, the impact of economic changes on revenue and operations can be substantial, resulting in significant volatility in the Company's financial performance.\nThe Company believes it has developed and assembled an attractive portfolio of capabilities, established a proven record of performance and credibility and built an efficient pricing structure. The Company is committed to optimizing its business model as a single-source premier provider of business and technology solutions with a strong vertical focus offering an integrated suite of services through a global delivery platform.\nThe Company believes that most companies recognize the importance of advanced technologies and business processes to compete in today's business climate. However, the process of designing, developing and implementing business and technology solutions is becoming increasingly complex. The Company believes that many businesses today are focused on return on investment analysis in prioritizing their initiatives. This has had an adverse impact on spending by current and prospective clients for many emerging new solutions.\nNonetheless, the Company continues to believe that businesses must implement more advanced information technology and engineering solutions to upgrade their systems, applications and processes so that they can maximize their productivity and optimize their performance in order to maintain a competitive advantage. Although working under budgetary, personnel and expertise constraints, companies are driven to support increasingly complex systems, applications and processes of significant strategic value. This has given rise to a demand for outsourcing. The Company believes that its current and prospective clients are continuing to evaluate the potential for outsourcing business critical systems, applications and processes.\nThe Company provides project management and consulting services, which are billed based on either agreed-upon fixed fees or hourly rates, or a combination of both. The billing rates and profit margins for project management and solutions services are generally higher than those for professional consulting services. The Company generally endeavors to expand its sales of higher margin solutions and project management services. The Company also realizes revenue from client engagements that range from the placement of contract and temporary technical consultants to project assignments that entail the delivery of end-to-end solutions. These services are primarily provided to the client at hourly rates that are established for each of the Company's consultants based upon their skill level, experience and the type of work performed.\nThe majority of the Company's services are provided under purchase orders. Contracts are utilized on certain of the more complex assignments where the engagements are for longer terms or where precise documentation on the nature and scope of the assignment is necessary. Although contracts normally relate to longer-term and more complex engagements, they do not obligate the customer to purchase a minimum level of services and are generally terminable by the customer on 60 to 90 days' notice. The Company, from time to time, enters into contracts requiring the completion of specific deliverables. Typically, these contracts are for less than one year. In certain instances, the Company recognizes revenue when invoiced at the time certain milestones are reached, as defined in the contract. The Company may also recognize revenue between milestones when costs are incurred using the percentage of completion method.\nCosts of services consist primarily of salaries and compensation-related expenses for billable consultants and employees, including payroll taxes, employee benefits and insurance. Selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and benefits of personnel responsible for business development, recruiting, operating activities, and training, and include corporate overhead expenses. Corporate overhead expenses relate to salaries and benefits of personnel responsible for corporate activities, including the Company's corporate marketing, administrative and financial reporting responsibilities and acquisition program. The Company records these expenses when incurred. Corporate overhead expenses are allocated to the segments based on revenue for the purpose of segment financial reporting.\n ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) \nCritical Accounting Policies\nThis Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( U.S. GAAP\u201d). The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. In our condensed consolidated financial statements, estimates are used for, but not limited to, accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts, goodwill, long-lived intangible assets, accounting for stock options and restricted stock units, insurance liabilities, accounting for income taxes and accrued bonuses.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company records revenue under Accounting Standards Codification (\"ASC\") Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. Revenue is recognized when we satisfy a performance obligation by transferring services promised in a contract to a customer, in an amount that reflects the consideration that we expect to receive in exchange for those services. Performance obligations in our contracts represent distinct or separate service streams that we provide to our customers.\nWe evaluate our revenue contracts with customers based on the five-step model under ASC 606: (1) Identify the contract with the customer; (2) Identify the performance obligations in the contract; (3) Determine the transaction price; (4) Allocate the transaction price to separate performance obligations; and (5) Recognize revenue when (or as) each performance obligation is satisfied.\nThe Company derives its revenue from several sources. The Company's Engineering Services and Information Technology Services segments perform consulting and project solution services. All of the Company's segments perform staff augmentation services and derive revenue from permanent placement fees. The majority of the Company's revenue is invoiced on a time and materials basis.\nThe following table presents our revenues disaggregated by revenue source for the fifty-two week periods ended December 28, 2019 and December 29, 2018:\n\n ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) \nRevenue Recognition (Continued)\nTime and Material\nThe Company's IT and Healthcare segments predominantly recognize revenue through time and material work while its Engineering segment recognizes revenue through both time and material and fixed fee work. The Company's time and material contracts are typically based on the number of hours worked at contractually agreed upon rates, therefore revenue associated with these time and materials contracts are recognized based on hours worked at contracted rates.\nFixed fee\nFrom time to time and predominantly in our Engineering segment, the Company will enter into contracts requiring the completion of specific deliverables. The Company has master services agreements with many of its customers that broadly define terms and conditions. Actual services performed under fixed fee arrangements are typically delivered under purchase orders that more specifically define terms and conditions related to that fixed fee project. While these master services agreements can often span several years, the Company's fixed fee purchase orders are typically performed over six to nine-month periods. In instances where project services are provided on a fixed-price basis, revenue is recorded in accordance with the terms of each contract. In certain instances, revenue is invoiced at the time certain milestones are reached, as defined in the contract. Revenue under these arrangements are recognized as the costs on these contracts are incurred. On an infrequent basis, amounts paid in excess of revenue earned and recognized are recorded as deferred revenue, included in accounts payable and accrued expenses on the accompanying balance sheets. In other instances, revenue is billed and recorded based upon contractual rates per hour. Additionally, some contracts contain Performance Fees\u201d (bonuses) for completing a contract under budget. Performance Fees, if any, are recorded when earned. Some contracts also limit revenue and billings to specified maximum amounts. Provisions for contract losses, if any, are made in the period such losses are determined. For contracts where there is a specific deliverable, the work is not complete and the revenue is not recognized, the costs incurred are deferred as a prepaid asset. The associated costs are expensed when the related revenue is recognized.\nPermanent Placement Services\nThe Company earns permanent placement fees from providing permanent placement services. These fees are typically based on a percentage of the compensation paid to the person placed with the Company's client.\nDeferred revenue was $0.4 million and $0.2 million at December 28, 2019 and December 29, 2018, respectively and is included in accounts payable and accrued expenses in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet at those dates. Revenue is recognized when the service has been performed. Deferred revenue may be recognized over a period exceeding one year from the time it was recorded on the balance sheet. For the fifty-two week period ended December 28, 2019, the Company recognized revenue of $0.2 million that was included in deferred revenue at the beginning of the reporting period.\nAccounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts\nThe Company's accounts receivable are primarily due from trade customers. Credit is extended based on evaluation of customers' financial condition and, generally, collateral is not required. Accounts receivable payment terms vary and are stated in the financial statements at amounts due from customers net of an allowance for doubtful accounts. Accounts outstanding longer than the payment terms are considered past due. The Company determines its allowance by considering a number of factors, including the length of time trade accounts receivable are past due, the Company's previous loss history, the customer's current ability to pay its obligation to the Company, and the condition of the general economy and the industry as a whole. The Company writes off accounts receivable when they become uncollectible, and payments subsequently received on such receivables previously written off are credited to bad debt expense.\n ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) \nGoodwill\nGoodwill is not amortized but is subject to periodic testing for impairment in accordance with ASC Topic 350 Intangibles - Goodwill and Other - Testing Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets for Impairment\u201d ( ASC Topic 350\u201d). The Company tests goodwill for impairment on an annual basis as of the last day of the Company's fiscal December each year or more frequently if events occur or circumstances change indicating that the fair value of the goodwill may be below its carrying amount. The Company has three reporting units. The Company uses a market-based approach to determine the fair value of the reporting units. This approach uses earnings/revenue multiples of similar companies recently completing acquisitions and the ability of our reporting units to generate cash flows as measures of fair value of our reporting units. The Company adopted Accounting Standards Update ( ASU\u201d) 2017-04, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment\u201d effective December 29, 2018 which has eliminated Step 2 from the goodwill impairment test. Under this update, an entity should perform its goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount.\nThere was no goodwill impairment in fiscal 2019 or 2018. During all periods presented, the Company determined that the existing qualitative factors did not suggest that an impairment of goodwill exists. There can be no assurance that future indicators of impairment and tests of goodwill impairment will not result in impairment charges for both its Engineering and Specialty Healthcare segments.\nLong-Lived and Intangible Assets\nThe Company evaluates long-lived assets and intangible assets with definite lives for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. When the Company determines that it is probable that undiscounted future cash flows will not be sufficient to recover an asset's carrying amount, the asset is written down to its fair value. Assets to be disposed of by sale, if any, are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell.\nAccounting for Restricted Stock Units\nThe Company uses restricted stock units to attract, retain and reward employees for long-term service. The Company follows Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB), Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 718 Compensation - Stock Compensation\u201d which requires that the compensation cost relating to stock-based payment transactions be recognized in the financial statements. This compensation cost is measured based on the fair value of the equity or liability instruments issued. The Company measures stock-based compensation cost using the Black-Scholes option pricing model for stock options and the fair value of the underlying common stock at the date of grant for restricted stock units.\nInsurance Liabilities\nThe Company has risk participation arrangements with respect to workers compensation and health care insurance. The Company establishes loss provisions based on historical experience and in the case of expected losses from workers compensation, considers input from third parties. The amounts included in the Company's costs related to this risk participation are estimated and can vary based on changes in assumptions, the Company's claims experience or the providers included in the associated insurance programs.\n ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) \nAccounting for Income Taxes\nIn establishing the provision for income taxes and deferred income tax assets and liabilities and valuation allowances against deferred tax assets, the Company makes judgments and interpretations based on enacted tax laws, published tax guidance and estimates of future earnings. As of December 28, 2019, the Company had both domestic and foreign net deferred tax net liabilities of $0.4 million. The domestic long term deferred tax net liability includes $1.2 million in deferred assets offset by $1.6 million in deferred tax liabilities. The domestic deferred tax assets consist of a net operating loss carryforward of $0.3 million and various deferred expense accruals and reserves of $0.9 million. The deferred tax liabilities consist of prepaid expenses of $0.7 million, acquisition amortization of $0.6 million and advance depreciation deductions of $0.3 million. The realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the likelihood that future taxable income will be sufficient to realize these benefits over time, and the effectiveness of tax planning strategies in the relevant tax jurisdictions. If actual results differ from these estimates and assessments, valuation allowances may be required.\nThe Company conducts its operations in multiple tax jurisdictions in the United States, Canada, Puerto Rico and Serbia. The Company and its subsidiaries file a consolidated United States Federal income tax return and file in various states. The Company's federal income tax returns have been examined through 2012. The Internal Revenue Service is currently examining fiscal tax years 2013, 2015, 2016 and 2017. The State of New Jersey is currently examining fiscal tax years 2009 through 2012. Except for New Jersey and other limited exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to audits by state and local tax authorities for tax years prior to 2015. The Company is no longer subject to audit in Canada for the tax years prior to tax year 2015. The Company is no longer subject to audit in Puerto Rico for the tax years prior to tax year 2009.\nThe Company's future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by changes in the valuation of its deferred tax assets or liabilities or changes in tax laws or interpretations thereof. In addition, the Company is subject to the examination of its income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities. The Company regularly assesses the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for income taxes.\nAccrued Bonuses\nThe Company pays bonuses to certain executive management, field management and corporate employees based on, or after giving consideration to, a variety of financial performance measures. Bonuses for executive management, field management and certain corporate employees are accrued throughout the year for payment during the first quarter of the following year, based in part upon anticipated annual results compared to annual budgets. In addition, the Company pays discretionary bonuses to certain employees, which are not related to budget performance. Variances in actual results versus budgeted amounts can have a significant impact on the calculations and therefore on the estimates of the required accruals. Accordingly, the actual earned bonuses may be materially different from the estimates used to determine the quarterly accruals.\n ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) \nPerformance-Based Restricted Stock Units\nFrom time-to-time the Company issues performance-based restricted stock units to its executives. Performance-based restricted stock units are typically vested based on certain multi-year performance metrics as determined by the Board of Directors Compensation Committee. The Company will reassess at each reporting date whether achievement of any performance condition is probable and would begin recognizing additional compensation cost if and when achievement of the performance condition becomes probable. The Company will then recognize the appropriate expense cumulatively in the year performance becomes probable and recognize the remaining compensation cost over the remaining requisite service period. If at a later measurement date the Company determines that performance-based restricted stock units deemed as likely to vest are deemed as unlikely to vest, the expense recognized will be reversed. These performance-based restricted stock units typically include dividend accrual equivalents, which means that any dividends paid by the Company during the vesting period become due and payable after the vesting period on any stock units that actually vest, if any. Dividends for these grants are accrued on the dividend payment dates and included in accounts payable and accrued expenses on the accompanying consolidated balance sheet. Dividends for performance-based restricted stock units that ultimately do not vest are forfeited.\nForward-looking Information\nThe Company's growth prospects are influenced by broad economic trends. The pace of customer capital spending programs, new product launches and similar activities have a direct impact on the need for engineering and information technology services. When the U.S., Canadian or global economies decline, the Company's operating performance could be adversely impacted. The Company believes that its fiscal discipline, strategic focus on targeted vertical markets and diversification of service offerings provides some insulation from adverse trends. However, declines in the economy could result in the need for future cost reductions or changes in strategy.\nAdditionally, changes in government regulations could result in prohibition or restriction of certain types of employment services or the imposition of new or additional employee benefits, licensing or tax requirements with respect to the provision of employment services that may reduce the Company's future earnings. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to increase the fees charged to its clients in a timely manner and in a sufficient amount to cover increased costs as a result of any of the foregoing.\nThe consulting and employment services market is highly competitive with limited barriers to entry. The Company competes in global, national, regional and local markets with numerous competitors in all of the Company's service lines. Price competition in the industries the Company serves is significant, and pricing pressures from competitors and customers are increasing. The Company expects that the level of competition will remain high in the future, which could limit the Company's ability to maintain or increase its market share or profitability.\n ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) \nFiscal Year Ended December 28, 2019 Compared to Fiscal Year Ended December 29, 2018\nA summary of operating results for the fifty-two week periods ended December 28, 2019 and December 29, 2018 is as follows (in thousands):\n\nThe Company follows a 52/53 week fiscal reporting calendar ending on the Saturday closest to December 31. The fiscal years ended December 28, 2019 (fiscal 2019) and December 29, 2018 (fiscal 2018) consisted of fifty-two weeks each.\nRevenue. Revenue decreased 4.6%, or $9.3 million, for the fifty-two week period ended December 28, 2019 as compared to the fifty-two week period ended December 29, 2018 (the comparable prior year period\u201d). Revenue decreased $18.2 million in the Engineering segment, increased $5.7 million in the Specialty Health Care segment and increased $3.3 million in the Information Technology segment. See Segment Discussion for further information on revenue changes.\nThe Company has material operations in Canada, primarily from the Company's Engineering segment; this business is conducted primarily in Canadian dollars. Since the Company reports its consolidated results in U.S. dollars the consolidated results are subject to potentially material fluctuations as a result of changes in the Canadian dollar to U.S. dollar exchange rate (the Exchange Rate\u201d). For the fifty-two week period ended December 28, 2019, the Company generated total revenue from its Canadian clients of $16.8 million in U.S. dollars at an Exchange Rate of 75.3% as compared to $27.9 million in U.S. dollars at an Exchange Rate of 77.3% for the comparable prior year period.\n ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) \nFiscal Year Ended December 28, 2019 Compared to Fiscal Year Ended December 29, 2018\nCost of Services and Gross Profit. Cost of services decreased 5.7%, or $8.5 million, for the fifty-two week period ended December 28, 2019 as compared to the comparable prior year period. Cost of services decreased due to the decrease in revenue. Cost of services as a percentage of revenue for the fifty-two week periods ended December 28, 2019 and December 29, 2018 were 74.6% and 75.4%, respectively. See Segment Discussion for further information regarding changes in cost of services and gross profit.\nSelling, General and Administrative. Selling, general and administrative ( SGA\u201d) expenses were $40.4 million for both the fifty-two week periods ended December 28, 2019 and December 29, 2018. As a percentage of revenue, SGA expenses were 21.1% for the fifty-two week period ended December 28, 2019 and 20.2% for the comparable prior year period. See Segment Discussion for further information on SGA expense changes.\nSeverance, Professional Fees and Other Charges. The Company did not incur any comparative severance, professional fees and other charges for the fifty-two week period ended December 28, 2019 as compared to $1.6 million for the fifty-two week period ended December 29, 2018. The fiscal 2018 charges include severance accrued for the Company's former chief executive officer and related payroll taxes, continuation of certain benefits and professional fees, totaling approximately $0.9 million. The additional charges of $0.7 million incurred related to transactional financial advisory fees, legal fees associated with defending a frivolous lawsuit by a competitor of the Company, professional fees associated with the acquisition of Thermal Kinetics and search fees associated with hiring a senior executive.\nTax Credit Professional Fees. The Company incurred de minimis tax credit professional fees in the fifty-two week period ended December 28, 2019 as compared to $0.4 million in the comparable prior year period.\nOther Expense. Other expense consists of interest expense, unused line fees and amortized loan costs on the Company's line of credit, net of interest income imputed interest on contingent consideration and gains and losses on foreign currency transactions. Other expense, net increased to $1.7 million as compared to $1.5 million for the comparable prior year period. The primary component of the increase was interest expense which increased due to increased borrowings under the Company's line of credit. The primary reason for the increased borrowing was to fund the Company's increase in accounts receivable during the fifty-two week period ended December 28, 2019, as compared to the comparable prior year period.\nIncome Tax Expense. The Company recognized $0.8 million of income tax expense for the fifty-two week period ended December 28, 2019, as compared to $1.2 million for the comparable prior year period. The Company recognized a tax benefit of $0.7 million in fiscal 2019 due to settlements with the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and state New Jersey regarding research and development tax credits generated in prior years. Otherwise, the consolidated effective income tax rate for the current period was 29.6% as compared to 30.5% for the comparable prior year period. Not including the research and development tax credits and other discrete tax adjustments in fiscal 2018, the Company has income tax rates as of December 28, 2019 of approximately 28.0%, 26.5% and 15.0% in the United States, Canada and Serbia, respectively. The relative income or loss generated in each jurisdiction can materially impact the overall effective income tax rate of the Company, particularly the ratio of Canadian and Serbian pretax income versus U.S. pretax income.\n ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) \nFiscal Year Ended December 28, 2019 Compared to Fiscal Year Ended December 29, 2018 (Continued)\nSegment Discussion\nEngineering\nEngineering revenues of $67.9 million for the fifty-two week period ended December 28, 2019 decreased 21.1%, or $18.2 million, as compared to the comparable prior year period. The decrease was principally due to a decrease of $7.7 million from the Company's Energy Services Group, a decrease of $7.7 million from the Company's Canadian Power Systems Group, and a decrease of $2.8 million from the Company's Aerospace Group, partially offset by an increase of $1.9 million from the TKE acquisition. The Company attributes these revenue declines to decreased spending on the part of its Canadian Power Systems and Aerospace clients, increased competition from other vendors to its Canadian Power Systems clients, and timing of large projects from the Company's Energy Services clients. Gross profit decreased by 18.2%, or $4.1 million, as compared to the comparable prior year period. Gross profit decreased primarily because of the decrease in revenue. Gross margin of 27.2% for the current period increased from 26.2% for the comparable prior year period. The increase in gross margin was primarily due to a concerted effort to improve utilization of the Engineering segment's billable consultants. The Engineering segment operating income decreased by $1.7 million to $3.7 million for the fifty-two week period ended December 28, 2019, as compared to $5.4 million for the comparable prior year period. The decrease in operating income was primarily due to the decreases in revenue and gross profit and offset by a decrease of $2.4 million to SGA expense. The decrease in SGA expense was primarily due to a concerted effort to reduce expenses to an efficient level commensurate with current revenue and gross profit and a lower allocation of corporate-generated SGA expense relative to the Company's other two segments.\nSpecialty Health Care\nSpecialty Health Care revenue of $89.3 million for the fifty-two week period ended December 28, 2019 increased 6.8%, or $5.7 million, as compared to the comparable prior year period. The increase was primarily driven by increases of $7.2 million from the New York City office, and $3.2 million from the Honolulu office, offset by decreases of $2.2 million from the travel nursing staffing group, $0.7 million from the Chicago office, $0.6 million from the HIM practice, $0.5 million from the Locum Tenens Group and $0.2 million from the Permanent Placement Group. The primary reason for revenue increases in New York City and Hawaii was the incremental addition of paraprofessionals billed on school contracts. The Company primarily attributes the decline in revenue from its travel nursing staffing group to increased competition from large national competitors. The Specialty Health Care segment's gross profit increased by 11.1%, or $2.1 million, to $20.9 million for the fifty-two week period ended December 28, 2019, as compared to $18.8 million for the prior year period. The increase in gross profit was primarily driven by the increase in revenue. Gross profit margin for the fifty-two week period ended December 28, 2019 increased to 23.4% as compared to 22.5% for the comparable prior year period. The Company primarily attributes the increase in gross profit margin to bill rate increases on certain major school contracts. Specialty Health Care experienced operating income of $2.9 million for the fifty-two week period ended December 28, 2019, as compared to $1.9 million for the comparable prior year period. The primary reason for the increase in operating income was the increase to revenue and gross profit. SGA expense increased by $1.1 million to $17.6 million, as compared to $16.5 million in the comparable prior year period. The increase in SGA expense was primarily due to the need to increase SGA infrastructure expense to support the increased activity levels associated with higher revenue and a higher allocation of corporate-generated SGA expense.\n ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) \nFiscal Year Ended December 28, 2019 Compared to Fiscal Year Ended December 29, 2018 (Continued)\nSegment Discussion (Continued)\nInformation Technology\nInformation Technology revenue of $33.9 million for the fifty-two week period ended December 28, 2019 increased 10.7%, or $3.3 million, as compared to $30.6 million for the comparable prior year period. The Company experienced increases to revenue from most of its Information Technology business lines. The Company attributes these increases to investments in management and sales personnel. Gross profit of $9.2 million for the fifty-two week period ended December 28, 2019 increased 16.6%, or $1.3 million, as compared to $7.9 million for the comparable prior year period. The increase in gross profit was primarily due to the increase in revenue. The Information Technology gross profit margin for the fifty-two week period ended December 28, 2019 was 27.2% as compared to 25.9% for the comparable prior year period. The Company attributes the gross margin increase to higher utilization of the Information Technology's fixed labor consultants. SGA expense increased by $1.3 million to $9.1 million. The increase in SGA expense was primarily due to increased investments in management and sales personnel and a higher allocation of corporate-generated SGA expense. The Information Technology segment experienced a negligible increase to operating income as the increase in gross profit approximately offset the increase in SGA expense.\n ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) \nFiscal Year Ended December 28, 2019 Compared to Fiscal Year Ended December 29, 2018 (Continued)\nSupplemental Operating Results on a Non-GAAP Basis\nThe following non-GAAP measures, which adjust for the categories of expenses described below, primarily changes in contingent consideration as a result of re-measurement in the amount of contingent consideration we expect to pay with respect to past acquisitions, are non-GAAP financial measures. Our management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures ( EBITDA\u201d and Adjusted EBITDA\u201d) are useful information for investors, shareholders and other stakeholders of our company in gauging our results of operations on an ongoing basis and to enhance investors' overall understanding of our current financial performance and period-to-period comparisons. We believe that both EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are performance measures and not liquidity measures, and therefore a reconciliation between net income and EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA has been provided. Neither EBITDA nor Adjusted EBITDA should be considered as an alternative to net income as an indicator of performance. In addition, neither EBITDA nor Adjusted EBITDA takes into account changes in certain assets and liabilities as well as interest and income taxes that can affect cash flows. We do not intend the presentation of these non-GAAP measures to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for results prepared in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP measures should be read only in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP.\nThe following unaudited table presents the Company's GAAP Net Income measure and the corresponding adjustments used to calculate EBITDA\u201d and Adjusted EBITDA\u201d for the fifty-two week periods ended December 28, 2019 and December 29, 2018.\n\n ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) \nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nThe following table summarizes the major captions from the Company's Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows\n($ in thousands):\n\nOperating Activities\nOperating activities used $4.8 million of cash for the fifty-two week period ended December 28, 2019 as compared to $0.1 million in the comparable prior year period. The major components of cash used in or provided by operating activities in the fifty-two week period ended December 28, 2019 and the comparable prior year period are as follows: net income and changes in accounts receivable, the net of transit accounts payable and transit accounts receivable, prepaid expenses and other current assets, accounts payable and accrued expenses and accrued payroll and related costs.\nNet income for the fifty-two week period ended December 28, 2019 was $4.1 million as compared to $2.7 million for the comparable prior year period. An increase in accounts receivables in the fifty-two week period ended December 28, 2019 used $7.6 million of cash as compared to $7.7 million in the comparable prior year period. The Company attributes the increase in accounts receivables for the fifty-two week period ended December 28, 2019 to several different clients in both its Engineering and Specialty Health Care segments that experienced temporary delays in its approval and payment processes. The Company anticipates that its accounts receivable balance relative to revenue will improve during the first quarter of fiscal 2020.\nThe Company's transit accounts payable usually exceeds the Company's transit accounts receivable, but absolute amounts and differences fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter in the normal course of business. The net of transit accounts payable and transit accounts receivable was a net receivable of $0.3 million as of December 28, 2019 and negligible as of December 29, 2018, using $0.3 million of cash during the fifty-two week period ended December 28, 2019. The net of transit accounts payable and transit accounts receivable was a net receivable of $0.1 million and a net payable of $1.7 million as of December 29, 2018 and December 30, 2017, respectively, the cash impact during the fifty-two week period ended December 29, 2018 used $1.8 million in cash.\nPrepaid expenses and other current assets used $0.6 million of cash for the fifty-two week period ended December 28, 2019 as compared to using $0.2 million of cash for the comparable prior year period. The Company attributes changes to prepaid expenses and other current assets, if any, to general timing of payments in the normal course of business.\nA decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses used $3.1 million for the fifty-two week period ended December 28, 2019 as compared to providing $1.0 million of cash for the comparable prior year period. The Company attributes these changes to general timing of payments to vendors in the normal course of business.\n ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) \nLiquidity and Capital Resources (Continued)\nOperating Activities (Continued)\nChanges in accrued payroll and related costs used $1.3 million for the fifty-two week period ended December 28, 2019 as compared to providing $1.3 million for the fifty-two week period December 29, 2018. There are three primary factors that generally impact accrued payroll and related costs: 1) there is a general correlation to operating expenses as payroll and related costs is the Company's largest expense group, so as operating costs increase or decrease, absent all other factors, so will the accrued payroll and related costs; 2) the Company pays the majority of its payroll every two weeks and normally has thirteen weeks in a fiscal quarter, which means that the Company normally has a major payroll on the last business day of every other quarter; and 3) most of the Company's senior management participate in annual incentive plans and while progress advances are sometimes made during the fiscal year, these accrued bonus balances, to the extent they are projected to be achieved, generally accumulate throughout the year. A significant portion of these incentive plan accruals are typically paid at the beginning of one fiscal year, pertaining to the prior fiscal year. The Company's last major payroll for the fifty-two week period ended December 28, 2019 was paid on December 20, 2019. Additionally, the Company accrued $0.8 million as of December 29, 2018 for severance and other benefits for its former CEO that terminated in fiscal 2018. The entire balance was paid in fiscal 2019.\nInvesting Activities\nInvesting activities used cash of $0.4 million and $2.6 million for the fifty-two week periods ended December 28, 2019 and December 29, 2018, respectively. Investing activities included expenditures for property and equipment of $0.4 million and $1.5 million for the current and comparable prior year period, respectively. The decrease was due to an abnormally high outlay for software in fiscal 2018. The Company spent $1.1 million on the TKE acquisition in fiscal 2018 and did not make any acquisitions in fiscal 2019.\nFinancing Activities\nFinancing activities provided $6.7 million of cash for the fifty-two week period ended December 28, 2019 as compared to $0.3 million in the comparable prior year period. The Company made net borrowings under its line of credit of $7.2 million during the fifty-two week period ended December 28, 2019 as compared to net borrowings of $0.3 million in the comparable prior year period. The primary reason for net borrowings during the fifty-two week period ended December 28, 2019 was to fund the $7.6 million increase in accounts receivable. The Company generated cash of $0.3 million from sales of shares from its equity plans for the current period and $0.4 million for the comparable prior year period. The Company paid $0.6 million in contingent consideration during the fifty-two week period ended December 28, 2019, as compared to $0.3 million in the comparable prior year period.\nThe Company and its subsidiaries amended and restated its Revolving Credit Facility with Citizens Bank of Pennsylvania on October 18, 2019. As amended and restated, the Revolving Credit Facility provides for a $45.0 million revolving credit facility, has no sub-limit for letters of credit, and expires on August 8, 2023.\nBorrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility bear interest at one of two alternative rates, as selected by the Company at each incremental borrowing. These alternatives are: (i) LIBOR (London Interbank Offered Rate), plus applicable margin, typically borrowed in fixed 30-day increments or (ii) the agent bank's prime rate generally borrowed over shorter durations. The Company also pays unused line fees based on the amount of the Revolving Credit Facility that is not drawn. Unused line fees are recorded as interest expense. The effective weighted average interest rate, including unused line fees, for the fifty-two week period ended December 28, 2019 was 4.4%.\n ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) \nLiquidity and Capital Resources (Continued)\nFinancing Activities (Continued)\nAll borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility are collateralized by all of the assets of the Company and its subsidiaries and a pledge of the stock of its subsidiaries. The Revolving Credit Facility contains various financial and non-financial covenants, such as a covenant that restricts on the Company's ability to borrow in order to pay dividends. As of December 28, 2019, the Company was in compliance with all covenants contained in the Revolving Credit Facility.\nBorrowings under the line of credit as of December 28, 2019 and December 29, 2018 were $34.8 million and $27.5 million, respectively. At December 28, 2019 and December 29, 2018 there were letters of credit outstanding for $1.6 million. At December 28, 2019, the Company had availability for additional borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility of $8.6 million.\nDividends\nAll restricted share units contain a dividend equivalent provision entitling holders to dividends paid between the restricted stock unit grant date and ultimate share distribution date. Total accrued dividends as of December 28, 2019 were $40,000 and are eligible to be paid in fiscal 2020. Dividends on any forfeited restricted share units will be forfeited.\nWhile the Company, at this time, has no plans to issue any future dividends, any future payment of dividends will depend upon, among other things, the Company's earnings, financial condition, capital requirements, level of indebtedness, contractual restrictions, and other factors that the Board of Directors deems relevant. The Revolving Credit Facility (as discussed above) prohibits the payment of any dividends or distributions on account of the Company's capital stock without the prior consent of the majority of the Company's lenders.\nCommitments and Contingencies\nThe Company anticipates that its primary uses of capital in future periods will be for working capital purposes. Funding for any long-term and short-term capital requirements as well as future acquisitions will be derived from one or more of the Revolving Credit Facility (or a replacement thereof), funds generated through operations or future financing transactions. The Company is subject to legal proceedings and claims that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of its business, which may or may not be covered by insurance. Were an unfavorable final outcome to occur, there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact on our financial position, liquidity, and the results of operations.\nThe Company's business strategy is to achieve growth both internally through operations and externally through strategic acquisitions. The Company from time to time engages in discussions with potential acquisition candidates. The Company has acquired numerous companies throughout its history and those acquisitions have generally included significant future contingent consideration. As the size of the Company and its financial resources increase however, acquisition opportunities requiring significant commitments of capital may arise. In order to pursue such opportunities, the Company may be required to incur debt or issue potentially dilutive securities in the future. No assurance can be given as to the Company's future acquisition and expansion opportunities or how such opportunities will be financed.\n ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) \nLiquidity and Capital Resources (Continued)\nCommitments and Contingencies (Continued)\nThe Company has a dispute with a customer that is a major utility in the United States. Both parties agreed in fiscal 2017 to resolve this dispute through binding arbitration. Arbitration hearings with this customer started in fiscal 2018. Essentially, the customer has not paid the balance of accounts receivable the Company believes are owed for certain disputed projects. As of December 28, 2019 and December 29, 2018, the total amount of outstanding receivables from this customer on these disputed projects was $14.1 million and $8.9 million, respectively, subject to potential upward adjustment in damages claimed in arbitration. Additionally, as part of the arbitration process, the customer has asserted counter-claims. While the total amount of asserted counter-claims is unknown as of December 28, 2019, the total amount of such counter-claims is anticipated to be at least $10.3 million. The Company believes these counter-claims are retaliatory in nature. Prior to the Company asserting its claims, the customer had not asserted any counter-claims. The Company believes these counter-claims asserted by its customer have no merit and were merely asserted as a strategy to reduce the Company's own claims in any arbitration award or potential settlement agreement. The Company believes that its accounts receivable balance, subject to reserves, is fully collectible. Furthermore, the Company believes that this arbitration will conclude prior to reporting its first quarter of fiscal 2020 financial results. While the Company believes the customer's counter-claims to be frivolous and without merit, it can give no assurances that it will ultimately not have to pay all or a portion of such counter-claims. The Company is continuing work on one of the engagements that have given rise to this dispute and also on several engagements from the same client that are not currently part of the arbitration.\nThe Company utilizes SAP software for its financial reporting and accounting system which was implemented in 1999 and has not undergone significant upgrades since its initial implementation. The Company believes that it will become necessary to upgrade or replace its SAP financial reporting and accounting system at some point in the future and anticipates a comprehensive review of the system may take place during fiscal 2020. The Company has not determined when this contemplated replacement may be necessary. The Company estimates this upgrade or replacement of their financial reporting and accounting system will cost between $0.5 million and $1.0 million. These estimates are subject to material change.\nThe Company's current commitments consist primarily of lease obligations for office space. The Company believes that its capital resources are sufficient to meet its present obligations and those to be incurred in the normal course of business for at least the next 12 months.\nThe Company leases office facilities and various equipment under non-cancelable leases expiring at various dates through May 2024. Certain leases are subject to escalation clauses based upon changes in various factors.\nMaturities of lease liabilities are as follows:\n\n ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) \nLiquidity and Capital Resources (Continued)\nFuture Contingent Payments\nAs of December 28, 2019, the Company had two active acquisition agreements whereby additional contingent consideration may be earned by the former shareholders: 1) effective October 1, 2017, the Company acquired all of the stock of PSR Engineering Solutions d.o.o. Beograd (Vo\u017edovac) ( PSR\u201d) and 2) effective September 30, 2018 the Company acquired certain assets of Thermal Kinetics Engineering, PLLC and Thermal Kinetics Systems, LLC (together, TKE\u201d). The Company estimates future contingent payments at December 28, 2019 as follows:\n\nEstimates of future contingent payments are subject to significant judgment and actual payments may materially differ from estimates. Potential future contingent payments to be made to all active acquisitions after December 28, 2019 are capped at a cumulative maximum of $6.3 million. The Company estimates future contingent consideration payments based on forecasted performance and recorded the fair value of those expected payments as of December 28, 2019. During the fifty-two week period ended December 28, 2019, the Company measured the intangibles acquired at fair value on a non-recurring basis. Contingent consideration related to acquisitions are recorded at fair value (level 3) with changes in fair value recorded in other (expense) income, net.\nSignificant employment agreements are as follows:\nExecutive Severance Agreements\nThe Company is a party to an Executive Severance Agreement (the Executive Severance Agreement\u201d) with each of Bradley S. Vizi, the Company's Executive Chairman and President (dated as of June 1, 2018), and Kevin Miller, the Company's Chief Financial Officer (dated as of February 28, 2014, as amended) which sets forth the terms and conditions of certain payments to be made by the Company to executive in the event that, while employed by the Company, (a) the Executive experiences a termination of employment unrelated to a Change in Control\u201d (as defined therein) or (b) there occurs a Change in Control and either (i) the Executive's employment is terminated for a reason related to the Change in Control or (ii) in the case of Mr. Miller, Mr. Miller remains continuously employed with the Company for three months following the Change in Control.\nUnder the terms of the Executive Severance Agreement, if either (a) the Executive is involuntarily terminated by the Company for any reason other than Cause\u201d (as defined therein), Disability\u201d (as defined therein) or death, or (b) the Executive resigns for Good Reason\u201d (as defined therein), and, in each case, the termination is not a Termination Related to a Change in Control\u201d (as defined below), the Executive will receive the following severance payments: (i) an amount equal to 1.5 times the sum of (a) the\nExecutive's annual base salary as in effect immediately prior to the termination date (before taking into account any reduction that constitutes Good Reason) ( Annual Base Salary\u201d) and (b) the highest annual bonus paid to the Executive in any of the three fiscal years immediately preceding his termination date ( Bonus\u201d), to be paid in installments over the twelve month period following the Executive's termination date; and (ii) for a period of eighteen months following the Executive's termination date, a monthly payment equal to the monthly COBRA premium that the Executive is required to pay to continue medical, vision, and dental coverage, for himself and, where applicable, his spouse and eligible dependents.\n ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) \nLiquidity and Capital Resources (Continued)\nFuture Contingent Payments (Continued)\nExecutive Severance Agreements (Continued)\nNotwithstanding the above, if the Executive has a termination as described above and can reasonably demonstrate that such termination would constitute a Termination Related to a Change in Control, and a Change in Control occurs within 120 days following the Executive's termination date, the Executive will be entitled to receive the payments set forth below for a Termination Related to a Change in Control, less any amounts already paid to the Executive, upon consummation of the Change in Control.\nUnder the terms of the Executive Severance Agreement, if a Change in Control occurs and (a) the Executive experiences a Termination Related to a Change in Control on account of (i) an involuntary termination by the Company for any reason other than Cause, death, or Disability, (ii) an involuntary termination by the Company within twelve months (for Mr. Vizi) or three months (for Mr. Miller) following a Change in Control on account of Disability or death, or (iii) a resignation by the Executive with Good Reason; or (b) in the case of Mr. Miller, a resignation by Mr. Miller, with or without Good Reason, which results in a termination date that is the last day of the three month period following a Change in Control, then the Executive will receive the following severance payments: (1) a lump sum payment equal to two times the sum of the Executive's (a) Annual Base Salary and (b) Bonus; and (2) a lump sum payment equal to twenty-four multiplied by the monthly COBRA premium cost, as in effect immediately prior to the Executive's termination date, for the Executive to continue medical, dental and vision coverage, as applicable, in such Company plans for himself and, if applicable, his spouse and eligible dependents. Upon the occurrence of a Change in Control, the Company shall establish an irrevocable rabbi trust and contribute to the rabbi trust the applicable amounts due under the Executive Severance Agreements.\nMr. Miller's Executive Severance Agreement provides that if Mr. Miller remains continuously employed for three months following a Change in Control and is employed by the Company on the last day of such specified period, Mr. Miller will receive a lump sum payment equal to two times the sum of his (a) Annual Base Salary and (b) Bonus (the Change in Control Payment\u201d). If Mr. Miller receives the Change in Control Payment, he will not be eligible to receive any severance payments under his Executive Severance Agreement.\nMr. Petraglia and Mr. Saks, along with several other members of the Company's senior management (not including Mr. Vizi), are covered by our Change in Control Plan for Selected Executive Management (the CIC Plan\u201d).\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nNone.\nImpact of Inflation\nConsulting, staffing, and project services are generally priced based on mark-ups on prevailing rates of pay, and as a result are able to generally maintain their relationship to direct labor costs. Permanent placement services are priced as a function of salary levels of the job candidates.\nThe Company's business is labor intensive; therefore, the Company has a high exposure to increasing health care benefit costs. The Company attempts to compensate for these escalating costs in its business cost models and customer pricing by passing along some of these increased health care benefit costs to its customers and employees, however, the Company has not been able to pass on all increases. The Company is continuing to review its options to further control these costs, which the Company does not believe are representative of general inflationary trends. Otherwise, inflation has not been a meaningful factor in the Company's operations.\n ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) \nNew Accounting Standards\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326). The new standard amends guidance on reporting credit losses for assets held at amortized cost basis and available-for-sale debt securities. In February 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-02, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326) and Leases (Topic 842) - Amendments to SEC Paragraphs Pursuant to SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 119 and Update to SEC Section on Effective Date Related to Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), which amends the effective date of the original pronouncement for smaller reporting companies. ASU 2016-13 and its amendments will be effective for the Company for interim and annual periods in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022. The Company believes the adoption will modify the way the Company analyzes financial instruments, but it does not anticipate a material impact on results of operations. The Company is in the process of determining the effects the adoption will have on its consolidated financial statements.\nIn December 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-12, Income Taxes (Topic 740), which enhances and simplifies various aspects of the income tax accounting guidance, including requirements such as tax basis step-up in goodwill obtained in a transaction that is not a business combination, ownership changes in investments, and interim-period accounting for enacted changes in tax law. The amendment will be effective for public companies with fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020; early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently assessing the impact of this pronouncement to its consolidated financial statements.\nTable 71: <table> <tr> <td>",

As a result, the impact of economic changes on revenue and operations can be substantial, resulting in significant volatility in the Company's financial performance.\nThe Company believes it has developed and assembled an attractive portfolio of capabilities, established a proven record of performance and credibility and built an efficient pricing structure. The Company is committed to optimizing its business model as a single-source premier provider of business and technology solutions with a strong vertical focus offering an integrated suite of services through a global delivery platform.\nThe Company believes that most companies recognize the importance of advanced technologies and business processes to compete in today's business climate. However, the process of designing, developing and implementing business and technology solutions is becoming increasingly complex. The Company believes that many businesses today are focused on return on investment analysis in prioritizing their initiatives. This has had an adverse impact on spending by current and prospective clients for many emerging new solutions.\nNonetheless, the Company continues to believe that businesses must implement more advanced information technology and engineering solutions to upgrade their systems, applications and processes so that they can maximize their productivity and optimize their performance in order to maintain a competitive advantage. Although working under budgetary, personnel and expertise constraints, companies are driven to support increasingly complex systems, applications and processes of significant strategic value. This has given rise to a demand for outsourcing. The Company believes that its current and prospective clients are continuing to evaluate the potential for outsourcing business critical systems, applications and processes.\nThe Company provides project management and consulting services, which are billed based on either agreed-upon fixed fees or hourly rates, or a combination of both. The billing rates and profit margins for project management and solutions services are generally higher than those for professional consulting services. The Company generally endeavors to expand its sales of higher margin solutions and project management services. The Company also realizes revenue from client engagements that range from the placement of contract and temporary technical consultants to project assignments that entail the delivery of end-to-end solutions. These services are primarily provided to the client at hourly rates that are established for each of the Company's consultants based upon their skill level, experience and the type of work performed.\nThe majority of the Company's services are provided under purchase orders. Contracts are utilized on certain of the more complex assignments where the engagements are for longer terms or where precise documentation on the nature and scope of the assignment is necessary. Although contracts normally relate to longer-term and more complex engagements, they do not obligate the customer to purchase a minimum level of services and are generally terminable by the customer on 60 to 90 days' notice. The Company, from time to time, enters into contracts requiring the completion of specific deliverables. Typically, these contracts are for less than one year. In certain instances, the Company recognizes revenue when invoiced at the time certain milestones are reached, as defined in the contract. The Company may also recognize revenue between milestones when costs are incurred using the percentage of completion method.\nCosts of services consist primarily of salaries and compensation-related expenses for billable consultants and employees, including payroll taxes, employee benefits and insurance. Selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and benefits of personnel responsible for business development, recruiting, operating activities, and training, and include corporate overhead expenses. Corporate overhead expenses relate to salaries and benefits of personnel responsible for corporate activities, including the Company's corporate marketing, administrative and financial reporting responsibilities and acquisition program. The Company records these expenses when incurred. Corporate overhead expenses are allocated to the segments based on revenue for the purpose of segment financial reporting.\n ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) \nCritical Accounting Policies\nThis Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( U.S. GAAP\u201d). The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. In our condensed consolidated financial statements, estimates are used for, but not limited to, accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts, goodwill, long-lived intangible assets, accounting for stock options and restricted stock units, insurance liabilities, accounting for income taxes and accrued bonuses.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company records revenue under Accounting Standards Codification (\"ASC\") Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. Revenue is recognized when we satisfy a performance obligation by transferring services promised in a contract to a customer, in an amount that reflects the consideration that we expect to receive in exchange for those services. Performance obligations in our contracts represent distinct or separate service streams that we provide to our customers.\nWe evaluate our revenue contracts with customers based on the five-step model under ASC 606: (1) Identify the contract with the customer; (2) Identify the performance obligations in the contract; (3) Determine the transaction price; (4) Allocate the transaction price to separate performance obligations; and (5) Recognize revenue when (or as) each performance obligation is satisfied.\nThe Company derives its revenue from several sources. The Company's Engineering Services and Information Technology Services segments perform consulting and project solution services. All of the Company's segments perform staff augmentation services and derive revenue from permanent placement fees. The majority of the Company's revenue is invoiced on a time and materials basis.\nThe following table presents our revenues disaggregated by revenue source for the fifty-two week periods ended December 28, 2019 and December 29, 2018:\nTable 49: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> December 28,\n</td> <td> </td> <td> December 29,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Engineering:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Time and Material\n</td> <td> $55,195\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $71,639\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Fixed Fee\n</td> <td> 12,678\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 14,424\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Permanent Placement Services\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total Engineering\n</td> <td> $67,873\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $86,078\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Specialty Health Care:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Time and Material\n</td> <td> $88,057\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $82,153\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Permanent Placement Services\n</td> <td> 1,291\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 1,510\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total Specialty Health Care\n</td> <td> $89,348\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $83,663\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Information Technology:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Time and Material\n</td> <td> $33,384\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $30,361\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Permanent Placement Services\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total Information Technology\n</td> <td> $33,879\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $30,611\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> $191,100\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $200,352\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) \nRevenue Recognition (Continued)\nTime and Material\nThe Company's IT and Healthcare segments predominantly recognize revenue through time and material work while its Engineering segment recognizes revenue through both time and material and fixed fee work. The Company's time and material contracts are typically based on the number of hours worked at contractually agreed upon rates, therefore revenue associated with these time and materials contracts are recognized based on hours worked at contracted rates.\nFixed fee\nFrom time to time and predominantly in our Engineering segment, the Company will enter into contracts requiring the completion of specific deliverables. The Company has master services agreements with many of its customers that broadly define terms and conditions. Actual services performed under fixed fee arrangements are typically delivered under purchase orders that more specifically define terms and conditions related to that fixed fee project. While these master services agreements can often span several years, the Company's fixed fee purchase orders are typically performed over six to nine-month periods. In instances where project services are provided on a fixed-price basis, revenue is recorded in accordance with the terms of each contract. In certain instances, revenue is invoiced at the time certain milestones are reached, as defined in the contract. Revenue under these arrangements are recognized as the costs on these contracts are incurred. On an infrequent basis, amounts paid in excess of revenue earned and recognized are recorded as deferred revenue, included in accounts payable and accrued expenses on the accompanying balance sheets. In other instances, revenue is billed and recorded based upon contractual rates per hour. Additionally, some contracts contain Performance Fees\u201d (bonuses) for completing a contract under budget. Performance Fees, if any, are recorded when earned. Some contracts also limit revenue and billings to specified maximum amounts. Provisions for contract losses, if any, are made in the period such losses are determined. For contracts where there is a specific deliverable, the work is not complete and the revenue is not recognized, the costs incurred are deferred as a prepaid asset. The associated costs are expensed when the related revenue is recognized.\nPermanent Placement Services\nThe Company earns permanent placement fees from providing permanent placement services. These fees are typically based on a percentage of the compensation paid to the person placed with the Company's client.\nDeferred revenue was $0.4 million and $0.2 million at December 28, 2019 and December 29, 2018, respectively and is included in accounts payable and accrued expenses in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet at those dates. Revenue is recognized when the service has been performed. Deferred revenue may be recognized over a period exceeding one year from the time it was recorded on the balance sheet. For the fifty-two week period ended December 28, 2019, the Company recognized revenue of $0.2 million that was included in deferred revenue at the beginning of the reporting period.\nAccounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts\nThe Company's accounts receivable are primarily due from trade customers. Credit is extended based on evaluation of customers' financial condition and, generally, collateral is not required. Accounts receivable payment terms vary and are stated in the financial statements at amounts due from customers net of an allowance for doubtful accounts. Accounts outstanding longer than the payment terms are considered past due. The Company determines its allowance by considering a number of factors, including the length of time trade accounts receivable are past due, the Company's previous loss history, the customer's current ability to pay its obligation to the Company, and the condition of the general economy and the industry as a whole. The Company writes off accounts receivable when they become uncollectible, and payments subsequently received on such receivables previously written off are credited to bad debt expense.\n ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) \nGoodwill\nGoodwill is not amortized but is subject to periodic testing for impairment in accordance with ASC Topic 350 Intangibles - Goodwill and Other - Testing Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets for Impairment\u201d ( ASC Topic 350\u201d). The Company tests goodwill for impairment on an annual basis as of the last day of the Company's fiscal December each year or more frequently if events occur or circumstances change indicating that the fair value of the goodwill may be below its carrying amount. The Company has three reporting units. The Company uses a market-based approach to determine the fair value of the reporting units. This approach uses earnings/revenue multiples of similar companies recently completing acquisitions and the ability of our reporting units to generate cash flows as measures of fair value of our reporting units. The Company adopted Accounting Standards Update ( ASU\u201d) 2017-04, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment\u201d effective December 29, 2018 which has eliminated Step 2 from the goodwill impairment test. Under this update, an entity should perform its goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount.\nThere was no goodwill impairment in fiscal 2019 or 2018. During all periods presented, the Company determined that the existing qualitative factors did not suggest that an impairment of goodwill exists. There can be no assurance that future indicators of impairment and tests of goodwill impairment will not result in impairment charges for both its Engineering and Specialty Healthcare segments.\nLong-Lived and Intangible Assets\nThe Company evaluates long-lived assets and intangible assets with definite lives for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. When the Company determines that it is probable that undiscounted future cash flows will not be sufficient to recover an asset's carrying amount, the asset is written down to its fair value. Assets to be disposed of by sale, if any, are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell.\nAccounting for Restricted Stock Units\nThe Company uses restricted stock units to attract, retain and reward employees for long-term service. The Company follows Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB), Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 718 Compensation - Stock Compensation\u201d which requires that the compensation cost relating to stock-based payment transactions be recognized in the financial statements. This compensation cost is measured based on the fair value of the equity or liability instruments issued. The Company measures stock-based compensation cost using the Black-Scholes option pricing model for stock options and the fair value of the underlying common stock at the date of grant for restricted stock units.\nInsurance Liabilities\nThe Company has risk participation arrangements with respect to workers compensation and health care insurance. The Company establishes loss provisions based on historical experience and in the case of expected losses from workers compensation, considers input from third parties. The amounts included in the Company's costs related to this risk participation are estimated and can vary based on changes in assumptions, the Company's claims experience or the providers included in the associated insurance programs.\n ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) \nAccounting for Income Taxes\nIn establishing the provision for income taxes and deferred income tax assets and liabilities and valuation allowances against deferred tax assets, the Company makes judgments and interpretations based on enacted tax laws, published tax guidance and estimates of future earnings. As of December 28, 2019, the Company had both domestic and foreign net deferred tax net liabilities of $0.4 million. The domestic long term deferred tax net liability includes $1.2 million in deferred assets offset by $1.6 million in deferred tax liabilities. The domestic deferred tax assets consist of a net operating loss carryforward of $0.3 million and various deferred expense accruals and reserves of $0.9 million. The deferred tax liabilities consist of prepaid expenses of $0.7 million, acquisition amortization of $0.6 million and advance depreciation deductions of $0.3 million. The realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the likelihood that future taxable income will be sufficient to realize these benefits over time, and the effectiveness of tax planning strategies in the relevant tax jurisdictions. If actual results differ from these estimates and assessments, valuation allowances may be required.\nThe Company conducts its operations in multiple tax jurisdictions in the United States, Canada, Puerto Rico and Serbia. The Company and its subsidiaries file a consolidated United States Federal income tax return and file in various states. The Company's federal income tax returns have been examined through 2012. The Internal Revenue Service is currently examining fiscal tax years 2013, 2015, 2016 and 2017. The State of New Jersey is currently examining fiscal tax years 2009 through 2012. Except for New Jersey and other limited exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to audits by state and local tax authorities for tax years prior to 2015. The Company is no longer subject to audit in Canada for the tax years prior to tax year 2015. The Company is no longer subject to audit in Puerto Rico for the tax years prior to tax year 2009.\nThe Company's future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by changes in the valuation of its deferred tax assets or liabilities or changes in tax laws or interpretations thereof. In addition, the Company is subject to the examination of its income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities. The Company regularly assesses the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of its provision for income taxes.\nAccrued Bonuses\nThe Company pays bonuses to certain executive management, field management and corporate employees based on, or after giving consideration to, a variety of financial performance measures. Bonuses for executive management, field management and certain corporate employees are accrued throughout the year for payment during the first quarter of the following year, based in part upon anticipated annual results compared to annual budgets. In addition, the Company pays discretionary bonuses to certain employees, which are not related to budget performance. Variances in actual results versus budgeted amounts can have a significant impact on the calculations and therefore on the estimates of the required accruals. Accordingly, the actual earned bonuses may be materially different from the estimates used to determine the quarterly accruals.\n ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) \nPerformance-Based Restricted Stock Units\nFrom time-to-time the Company issues performance-based restricted stock units to its executives. Performance-based restricted stock units are typically vested based on certain multi-year performance metrics as determined by the Board of Directors Compensation Committee. The Company will reassess at each reporting date whether achievement of any performance condition is probable and would begin recognizing additional compensation cost if and when achievement of the performance condition becomes probable. The Company will then recognize the appropriate expense cumulatively in the year performance becomes probable and recognize the remaining compensation cost over the remaining requisite service period. If at a later measurement date the Company determines that performance-based restricted stock units deemed as likely to vest are deemed as unlikely to vest, the expense recognized will be reversed. These performance-based restricted stock units typically include dividend accrual equivalents, which means that any dividends paid by the Company during the vesting period become due and payable after the vesting period on any stock units that actually vest, if any. Dividends for these grants are accrued on the dividend payment dates and included in accounts payable and accrued expenses on the accompanying consolidated balance sheet. Dividends for performance-based restricted stock units that ultimately do not vest are forfeited.\nForward-looking Information\nThe Company's growth prospects are influenced by broad economic trends. The pace of customer capital spending programs, new product launches and similar activities have a direct impact on the need for engineering and information technology services. When the U.S., Canadian or global economies decline, the Company's operating performance could be adversely impacted. The Company believes that its fiscal discipline, strategic focus on targeted vertical markets and diversification of service offerings provides some insulation from adverse trends. However, declines in the economy could result in the need for future cost reductions or changes in strategy.\nAdditionally, changes in government regulations could result in prohibition or restriction of certain types of employment services or the imposition of new or additional employee benefits, licensing or tax requirements with respect to the provision of employment services that may reduce the Company's future earnings. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to increase the fees charged to its clients in a timely manner and in a sufficient amount to cover increased costs as a result of any of the foregoing.\nThe consulting and employment services market is highly competitive with limited barriers to entry. The Company competes in global, national, regional and local markets with numerous competitors in all of the Company's service lines. Price competition in the industries the Company serves is significant, and pricing pressures from competitors and customers are increasing. The Company expects that the level of competition will remain high in the future, which could limit the Company's ability to maintain or increase its market share or profitability.\n ITEM 7.

The fiscal years ended December 28, 2019 (fiscal 2019) and December 29, 2018 (fiscal 2018) consisted of fifty-two weeks each.\nRevenue. Revenue decreased 4.6%, or $9.3 million, for the fifty-two week period ended December 28, 2019 as compared to the fifty-two week period ended December 29, 2018 (the comparable prior year period\u201d). Revenue decreased $18.2 million in the Engineering segment, increased $5.7 million in the Specialty Health Care segment and increased $3.3 million in the Information Technology segment. See Segment Discussion for further information on revenue changes.\nThe Company has material operations in Canada, primarily from the Company's Engineering segment; this business is conducted primarily in Canadian dollars. Since the Company reports its consolidated results in U.S. dollars the consolidated results are subject to potentially material fluctuations as a result of changes in the Canadian dollar to U.S. dollar exchange rate (the Exchange Rate\u201d). For the fifty-two week period ended December 28, 2019, the Company generated total revenue from its Canadian clients of $16.8 million in U.S. dollars at an Exchange Rate of 75.3% as compared to $27.9 million in U.S. dollars at an Exchange Rate of 77.3% for the comparable prior year period.\n ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) \nFiscal Year Ended December 28, 2019 Compared to Fiscal Year Ended December 29, 2018\nCost of Services and Gross Profit. Cost of services decreased 5.7%, or $8.5 million, for the fifty-two week period ended December 28, 2019 as compared to the comparable prior year period. Cost of services decreased due to the decrease in revenue. Cost of services as a percentage of revenue for the fifty-two week periods ended December 28, 2019 and December 29, 2018 were 74.6% and 75.4%, respectively. See Segment Discussion for further information regarding changes in cost of services and gross profit.\nSelling, General and Administrative. Selling, general and administrative ( SGA\u201d) expenses were $40.4 million for both the fifty-two week periods ended December 28, 2019 and December 29, 2018. As a percentage of revenue, SGA expenses were 21.1% for the fifty-two week period ended December 28, 2019 and 20.2% for the comparable prior year period. See Segment Discussion for further information on SGA expense changes.\nSeverance, Professional Fees and Other Charges. The Company did not incur any comparative severance, professional fees and other charges for the fifty-two week period ended December 28, 2019 as compared to $1.6 million for the fifty-two week period ended December 29, 2018. The fiscal 2018 charges include severance accrued for the Company's former chief executive officer and related payroll taxes, continuation of certain benefits and professional fees, totaling approximately $0.9 million. The additional charges of $0.7 million incurred related to transactional financial advisory fees, legal fees associated with defending a frivolous lawsuit by a competitor of the Company, professional fees associated with the acquisition of Thermal Kinetics and search fees associated with hiring a senior executive.\nTax Credit Professional Fees. The Company incurred de minimis tax credit professional fees in the fifty-two week period ended December 28, 2019 as compared to $0.4 million in the comparable prior year period.\nOther Expense. Other expense consists of interest expense, unused line fees and amortized loan costs on the Company's line of credit, net of interest income imputed interest on contingent consideration and gains and losses on foreign currency transactions. Other expense, net increased to $1.7 million as compared to $1.5 million for the comparable prior year period. The primary component of the increase was interest expense which increased due to increased borrowings under the Company's line of credit. The primary reason for the increased borrowing was to fund the Company's increase in accounts receivable during the fifty-two week period ended December 28, 2019, as compared to the comparable prior year period.\nIncome Tax Expense. The Company recognized $0.8 million of income tax expense for the fifty-two week period ended December 28, 2019, as compared to $1.2 million for the comparable prior year period. The Company recognized a tax benefit of $0.7 million in fiscal 2019 due to settlements with the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and state New Jersey regarding research and development tax credits generated in prior years. Otherwise, the consolidated effective income tax rate for the current period was 29.6% as compared to 30.5% for the comparable prior year period. Not including the research and development tax credits and other discrete tax adjustments in fiscal 2018, the Company has income tax rates as of December 28, 2019 of approximately 28.0%, 26.5% and 15.0% in the United States, Canada and Serbia, respectively. The relative income or loss generated in each jurisdiction can materially impact the overall effective income tax rate of the Company, particularly the ratio of Canadian and Serbian pretax income versus U.S. pretax income.\n ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) \nFiscal Year Ended December 28, 2019 Compared to Fiscal Year Ended December 29, 2018 (Continued)\nSegment Discussion\nEngineering\nEngineering revenues of $67.9 million for the fifty-two week period ended December 28, 2019 decreased 21.1%, or $18.2 million, as compared to the comparable prior year period. The decrease was principally due to a decrease of $7.7 million from the Company's Energy Services Group, a decrease of $7.7 million from the Company's Canadian Power Systems Group, and a decrease of $2.8 million from the Company's Aerospace Group, partially offset by an increase of $1.9 million from the TKE acquisition. The Company attributes these revenue declines to decreased spending on the part of its Canadian Power Systems and Aerospace clients, increased competition from other vendors to its Canadian Power Systems clients, and timing of large projects from the Company's Energy Services clients. Gross profit decreased by 18.2%, or $4.1 million, as compared to the comparable prior year period. Gross profit decreased primarily because of the decrease in revenue. Gross margin of 27.2% for the current period increased from 26.2% for the comparable prior year period. The increase in gross margin was primarily due to a concerted effort to improve utilization of the Engineering segment's billable consultants. The Engineering segment operating income decreased by $1.7 million to $3.7 million for the fifty-two week period ended December 28, 2019, as compared to $5.4 million for the comparable prior year period. The decrease in operating income was primarily due to the decreases in revenue and gross profit and offset by a decrease of $2.4 million to SGA expense. The decrease in SGA expense was primarily due to a concerted effort to reduce expenses to an efficient level commensurate with current revenue and gross profit and a lower allocation of corporate-generated SGA expense relative to the Company's other two segments.\nSpecialty Health Care\nSpecialty Health Care revenue of $89.3 million for the fifty-two week period ended December 28, 2019 increased 6.8%, or $5.7 million, as compared to the comparable prior year period. The increase was primarily driven by increases of $7.2 million from the New York City office, and $3.2 million from the Honolulu office, offset by decreases of $2.2 million from the travel nursing staffing group, $0.7 million from the Chicago office, $0.6 million from the HIM practice, $0.5 million from the Locum Tenens Group and $0.2 million from the Permanent Placement Group. The primary reason for revenue increases in New York City and Hawaii was the incremental addition of paraprofessionals billed on school contracts. The Company primarily attributes the decline in revenue from its travel nursing staffing group to increased competition from large national competitors. The Specialty Health Care segment's gross profit increased by 11.1%, or $2.1 million, to $20.9 million for the fifty-two week period ended December 28, 2019, as compared to $18.8 million for the prior year period. The increase in gross profit was primarily driven by the increase in revenue. Gross profit margin for the fifty-two week period ended December 28, 2019 increased to 23.4% as compared to 22.5% for the comparable prior year period. The Company primarily attributes the increase in gross profit margin to bill rate increases on certain major school contracts. Specialty Health Care experienced operating income of $2.9 million for the fifty-two week period ended December 28, 2019, as compared to $1.9 million for the comparable prior year period. The primary reason for the increase in operating income was the increase to revenue and gross profit. SGA expense increased by $1.1 million to $17.6 million, as compared to $16.5 million in the comparable prior year period. The increase in SGA expense was primarily due to the need to increase SGA infrastructure expense to support the increased activity levels associated with higher revenue and a higher allocation of corporate-generated SGA expense.\n ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) \nFiscal Year Ended December 28, 2019 Compared to Fiscal Year Ended December 29, 2018 (Continued)\nSegment Discussion (Continued)\nInformation Technology\nInformation Technology revenue of $33.9 million for the fifty-two week period ended December 28, 2019 increased 10.7%, or $3.3 million, as compared to $30.6 million for the comparable prior year period. The Company experienced increases to revenue from most of its Information Technology business lines. The Company attributes these increases to investments in management and sales personnel. Gross profit of $9.2 million for the fifty-two week period ended December 28, 2019 increased 16.6%, or $1.3 million, as compared to $7.9 million for the comparable prior year period. The increase in gross profit was primarily due to the increase in revenue. The Information Technology gross profit margin for the fifty-two week period ended December 28, 2019 was 27.2% as compared to 25.9% for the comparable prior year period. The Company attributes the gross margin increase to higher utilization of the Information Technology's fixed labor consultants. SGA expense increased by $1.3 million to $9.1 million. The increase in SGA expense was primarily due to increased investments in management and sales personnel and a higher allocation of corporate-generated SGA expense. The Information Technology segment experienced a negligible increase to operating income as the increase in gross profit approximately offset the increase in SGA expense.\n ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) \nFiscal Year Ended December 28, 2019 Compared to Fiscal Year Ended December 29, 2018 (Continued)\nSupplemental Operating Results on a Non-GAAP Basis\nThe following non-GAAP measures, which adjust for the categories of expenses described below, primarily changes in contingent consideration as a result of re-measurement in the amount of contingent consideration we expect to pay with respect to past acquisitions, are non-GAAP financial measures. Our management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures ( EBITDA\u201d and Adjusted EBITDA\u201d) are useful information for investors, shareholders and other stakeholders of our company in gauging our results of operations on an ongoing basis and to enhance investors' overall understanding of our current financial performance and period-to-period comparisons. We believe that both EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA are performance measures and not liquidity measures, and therefore a reconciliation between net income and EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA has been provided. Neither EBITDA nor Adjusted EBITDA should be considered as an alternative to net income as an indicator of performance. In addition, neither EBITDA nor Adjusted EBITDA takes into account changes in certain assets and liabilities as well as interest and income taxes that can affect cash flows. We do not intend the presentation of these non-GAAP measures to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for results prepared in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP measures should be read only in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP.\nThe following unaudited table presents the Company's GAAP Net Income measure and the corresponding adjustments used to calculate EBITDA\u201d and Adjusted EBITDA\u201d for the fifty-two week periods ended December 28, 2019 and December 29, 2018.\nTable 60: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> Fifty-Two Week Periods Ended\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> December 28, 2019\n</td> <td> </td> <td> December 29,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> GAAP net income\n</td> <td> $4,058\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $2,715\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income tax expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 1,193\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest expense\n</td> <td> 1,695\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 1,367\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Imputed interest on contingent consideration\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Depreciation of property and equipment\n</td> <td> 1,261\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 1,442\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Amortization of acquired intangible assets\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> EBITDA (non-GAAP)\n</td> <td> $8,166\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $6,946\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Adjustments\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Severance, professional fees, office closures\nand other charges\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> <td> 1,571\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Tax credit professional fees\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loss on foreign currency transactions\n</td> <td> (11\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Adjusted EBITDA (non-GAAP)\n</td> <td> $8,202\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $8,924\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) \nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nThe following table summarizes the major captions from the Company's Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows\n($ in thousands):\nTable 62: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> Fiscal Years Ended\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> December 28,\n</td> <td> </td> <td> December 29,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash (used in) provided by:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> Operating activities\n</td> <td> ($4,778\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> ($64\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> Investing activities\n</td> <td> ($363\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> ($2,583\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> Financing activities\n</td> <td> $6,627\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $346\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating Activities\nOperating activities used $4.8 million of cash for the fifty-two week period ended December 28, 2019 as compared to $0.1 million in the comparable prior year period. The major components of cash used in or provided by operating activities in the fifty-two week period ended December 28, 2019 and the comparable prior year period are as follows: net income and changes in accounts receivable, the net of transit accounts payable and transit accounts receivable, prepaid expenses and other current assets, accounts payable and accrued expenses and accrued payroll and related costs.\nNet income for the fifty-two week period ended December 28, 2019 was $4.1 million as compared to $2.7 million for the comparable prior year period. An increase in accounts receivables in the fifty-two week period ended December 28, 2019 used $7.6 million of cash as compared to $7.7 million in the comparable prior year period. The Company attributes the increase in accounts receivables for the fifty-two week period ended December 28, 2019 to several different clients in both its Engineering and Specialty Health Care segments that experienced temporary delays in its approval and payment processes. The Company anticipates that its accounts receivable balance relative to revenue will improve during the first quarter of fiscal 2020.\nThe Company's transit accounts payable usually exceeds the Company's transit accounts receivable, but absolute amounts and differences fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter in the normal course of business. The net of transit accounts payable and transit accounts receivable was a net receivable of $0.3 million as of December 28, 2019 and negligible as of December 29, 2018, using $0.3 million of cash during the fifty-two week period ended December 28, 2019. The net of transit accounts payable and transit accounts receivable was a net receivable of $0.1 million and a net payable of $1.7 million as of December 29, 2018 and December 30, 2017, respectively, the cash impact during the fifty-two week period ended December 29, 2018 used $1.8 million in cash.\nPrepaid expenses and other current assets used $0.6 million of cash for the fifty-two week period ended December 28, 2019 as compared to using $0.2 million of cash for the comparable prior year period. The Company attributes changes to prepaid expenses and other current assets, if any, to general timing of payments in the normal course of business.\nA decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses used $3.1 million for the fifty-two week period ended December 28, 2019 as compared to providing $1.0 million of cash for the comparable prior year period. The Company attributes these changes to general timing of payments to vendors in the normal course of business.\n ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) \nLiquidity and Capital Resources (Continued)\nOperating Activities (Continued)\nChanges in accrued payroll and related costs used $1.3 million for the fifty-two week period ended December 28, 2019 as compared to providing $1.3 million for the fifty-two week period December 29, 2018. There are three primary factors that generally impact accrued payroll and related costs: 1) there is a general correlation to operating expenses as payroll and related costs is the Company's largest expense group, so as operating costs increase or decrease, absent all other factors, so will the accrued payroll and related costs; 2) the Company pays the majority of its payroll every two weeks and normally has thirteen weeks in a fiscal quarter, which means that the Company normally has a major payroll on the last business day of every other quarter; and 3) most of the Company's senior management participate in annual incentive plans and while progress advances are sometimes made during the fiscal year, these accrued bonus balances, to the extent they are projected to be achieved, generally accumulate throughout the year. A significant portion of these incentive plan accruals are typically paid at the beginning of one fiscal year, pertaining to the prior fiscal year. The Company's last major payroll for the fifty-two week period ended December 28, 2019 was paid on December 20, 2019. Additionally, the Company accrued $0.8 million as of December 29, 2018 for severance and other benefits for its former CEO that terminated in fiscal 2018. The entire balance was paid in fiscal 2019.\nInvesting Activities\nInvesting activities used cash of $0.4 million and $2.6 million for the fifty-two week periods ended December 28, 2019 and December 29, 2018, respectively. Investing activities included expenditures for property and equipment of $0.4 million and $1.5 million for the current and comparable prior year period, respectively. The decrease was due to an abnormally high outlay for software in fiscal 2018. The Company spent $1.1 million on the TKE acquisition in fiscal 2018 and did not make any acquisitions in fiscal 2019.\nFinancing Activities\nFinancing activities provided $6.7 million of cash for the fifty-two week period ended December 28, 2019 as compared to $0.3 million in the comparable prior year period. The Company made net borrowings under its line of credit of $7.2 million during the fifty-two week period ended December 28, 2019 as compared to net borrowings of $0.3 million in the comparable prior year period. The primary reason for net borrowings during the fifty-two week period ended December 28, 2019 was to fund the $7.6 million increase in accounts receivable. The Company generated cash of $0.3 million from sales of shares from its equity plans for the current period and $0.4 million for the comparable prior year period. The Company paid $0.6 million in contingent consideration during the fifty-two week period ended December 28, 2019, as compared to $0.3 million in the comparable prior year period.\nThe Company and its subsidiaries amended and restated its Revolving Credit Facility with Citizens Bank of Pennsylvania on October 18, 2019. As amended and restated, the Revolving Credit Facility provides for a $45.0 million revolving credit facility, has no sub-limit for letters of credit, and expires on August 8, 2023.\nBorrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility bear interest at one of two alternative rates, as selected by the Company at each incremental borrowing. These alternatives are: (i) LIBOR (London Interbank Offered Rate), plus applicable margin, typically borrowed in fixed 30-day increments or (ii) the agent bank's prime rate generally borrowed over shorter durations. The Company also pays unused line fees based on the amount of the Revolving Credit Facility that is not drawn. Unused line fees are recorded as interest expense. The effective weighted average interest rate, including unused line fees, for the fifty-two week period ended December 28, 2019 was 4.4%.\n ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) \nLiquidity and Capital Resources (Continued)\nFinancing Activities (Continued)\nAll borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility are collateralized by all of the assets of the Company and its subsidiaries and a pledge of the stock of its subsidiaries. The Revolving Credit Facility contains various financial and non-financial covenants, such as a covenant that restricts on the Company's ability to borrow in order to pay dividends. As of December 28, 2019, the Company was in compliance with all covenants contained in the Revolving Credit Facility.\nBorrowings under the line of credit as of December 28, 2019 and December 29, 2018 were $34.8 million and $27.5 million, respectively. At December 28, 2019 and December 29, 2018 there were letters of credit outstanding for $1.6 million. At December 28, 2019, the Company had availability for additional borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility of $8.6 million.\nDividends\nAll restricted share units contain a dividend equivalent provision entitling holders to dividends paid between the restricted stock unit grant date and ultimate share distribution date. Total accrued dividends as of December 28, 2019 were $40,000 and are eligible to be paid in fiscal 2020. Dividends on any forfeited restricted share units will be forfeited.\nWhile the Company, at this time, has no plans to issue any future dividends, any future payment of dividends will depend upon, among other things, the Company's earnings, financial condition, capital requirements, level of indebtedness, contractual restrictions, and other factors that the Board of Directors deems relevant. The Revolving Credit Facility (as discussed above) prohibits the payment of any dividends or distributions on account of the Company's capital stock without the prior consent of the majority of the Company's lenders.\nCommitments and Contingencies\nThe Company anticipates that its primary uses of capital in future periods will be for working capital purposes. Funding for any long-term and short-term capital requirements as well as future acquisitions will be derived from one or more of the Revolving Credit Facility (or a replacement thereof), funds generated through operations or future financing transactions. The Company is subject to legal proceedings and claims that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of its business, which may or may not be covered by insurance. Were an unfavorable final outcome to occur, there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact on our financial position, liquidity, and the results of operations.\nThe Company's business strategy is to achieve growth both internally through operations and externally through strategic acquisitions. The Company from time to time engages in discussions with potential acquisition candidates. The Company has acquired numerous companies throughout its history and those acquisitions have generally included significant future contingent consideration. As the size of the Company and its financial resources increase however, acquisition opportunities requiring significant commitments of capital may arise. In order to pursue such opportunities, the Company may be required to incur debt or issue potentially dilutive securities in the future. No assurance can be given as to the Company's future acquisition and expansion opportunities or how such opportunities will be financed.\n ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) \nLiquidity and Capital Resources (Continued)\nCommitments and Contingencies (Continued)\nThe Company has a dispute with a customer that is a major utility in the United States. Both parties agreed in fiscal 2017 to resolve this dispute through binding arbitration. Arbitration hearings with this customer started in fiscal 2018. Essentially, the customer has not paid the balance of accounts receivable the Company believes are owed for certain disputed projects. As of December 28, 2019 and December 29, 2018, the total amount of outstanding receivables from this customer on these disputed projects was $14.1 million and $8.9 million, respectively, subject to potential upward adjustment in damages claimed in arbitration. Additionally, as part of the arbitration process, the customer has asserted counter-claims. While the total amount of asserted counter-claims is unknown as of December 28, 2019, the total amount of such counter-claims is anticipated to be at least $10.3 million. The Company believes these counter-claims are retaliatory in nature. Prior to the Company asserting its claims, the customer had not asserted any counter-claims. The Company believes these counter-claims asserted by its customer have no merit and were merely asserted as a strategy to reduce the Company's own claims in any arbitration award or potential settlement agreement. The Company believes that its accounts receivable balance, subject to reserves, is fully collectible. Furthermore, the Company believes that this arbitration will conclude prior to reporting its first quarter of fiscal 2020 financial results. While the Company believes the customer's counter-claims to be frivolous and without merit, it can give no assurances that it will ultimately not have to pay all or a portion of such counter-claims. The Company is continuing work on one of the engagements that have given rise to this dispute and also on several engagements from the same client that are not currently part of the arbitration.\nThe Company utilizes SAP software for its financial reporting and accounting system which was implemented in 1999 and has not undergone significant upgrades since its initial implementation. The Company believes that it will become necessary to upgrade or replace its SAP financial reporting and accounting system at some point in the future and anticipates a comprehensive review of the system may take place during fiscal 2020. The Company has not determined when this contemplated replacement may be necessary. The Company estimates this upgrade or replacement of their financial reporting and accounting system will cost between $0.5 million and $1.0 million. These estimates are subject to material change.\nThe Company's current commitments consist primarily of lease obligations for office space. The Company believes that its capital resources are sufficient to meet its present obligations and those to be incurred in the normal course of business for at least the next 12 months.\nThe Company leases office facilities and various equipment under non-cancelable leases expiring at various dates through May 2024. Certain leases are subject to escalation clauses based upon changes in various factors.\nMaturities of lease liabilities are as follows:\nTable 66: <table> <tr> <td>\nFiscal Year Ending\n</td> <td> Operating Leases\n</td> <td> </td> <td> Finance\nLeases\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> $2,334\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $322\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,760\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,301\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Thereafter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> -\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total lease payments\n</td> <td> 6,467\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Less: imputed interest\n</td> <td> (412\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> (10\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td> $6,055\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $504\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) \nLiquidity and Capital Resources (Continued)\nFuture Contingent Payments\nAs of December 28, 2019, the Company had two active acquisition agreements whereby additional contingent consideration may be earned by the former shareholders: 1) effective October 1, 2017, the Company acquired all of the stock of PSR Engineering Solutions d.o.o. Beograd (Vo\u017edovac) ( PSR\u201d) and 2) effective September 30, 2018 the Company acquired certain assets of Thermal Kinetics Engineering, PLLC and Thermal Kinetics Systems, LLC (together, TKE\u201d). The Company estimates future contingent payments at December 28, 2019 as follows:\nTable 68: <table> <tr> <td> Fiscal Year Ending\n</td> <td> Total\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> January 2, 2021\n</td> <td> $344\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> January 1, 2022\n</td> <td> 1,438\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> December 31, 2022\n</td> <td> 1,276\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Estimated future contingent consideration payments\n</td> <td> $3,058\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nEstimates of future contingent payments are subject to significant judgment and actual payments may materially differ from estimates. Potential future contingent payments to be made to all active acquisitions after December 28, 2019 are capped at a cumulative maximum of $6.3 million. The Company estimates future contingent consideration payments based on forecasted performance and recorded the fair value of those expected payments as of December 28, 2019. During the fifty-two week period ended December 28, 2019, the Company measured the intangibles acquired at fair value on a non-recurring basis. Contingent consideration related to acquisitions are recorded at fair value (level 3) with changes in fair value recorded in other (expense) income, net.\nSignificant employment agreements are as follows:\nExecutive Severance Agreements\nThe Company is a party to an Executive Severance Agreement (the Executive Severance Agreement\u201d) with each of Bradley S. Vizi, the Company's Executive Chairman and President (dated as of June 1, 2018), and Kevin Miller, the Company's Chief Financial Officer (dated as of February 28, 2014, as amended) which sets forth the terms and conditions of certain payments to be made by the Company to executive in the event that, while employed by the Company, (a) the Executive experiences a termination of employment unrelated to a Change in Control\u201d (as defined therein) or (b) there occurs a Change in Control and either (i) the Executive's employment is terminated for a reason related to the Change in Control or (ii) in the case of Mr. Miller, Mr. Miller remains continuously employed with the Company for three months following the Change in Control.\nUnder the terms of the Executive Severance Agreement, if either (a) the Executive is involuntarily terminated by the Company for any reason other than Cause\u201d (as defined therein), Disability\u201d (as defined therein) or death, or (b) the Executive resigns for Good Reason\u201d (as defined therein), and, in each case, the termination is not a Termination Related to a Change in Control\u201d (as defined below), the Executive will receive the following severance payments: (i) an amount equal to 1.5 times the sum of (a) the\nExecutive's annual base salary as in effect immediately prior to the termination date (before taking into account any reduction that constitutes Good Reason) ( Annual Base Salary\u201d) and (b) the highest annual bonus paid to the Executive in any of the three fiscal years immediately preceding his termination date ( Bonus\u201d), to be paid in installments over the twelve month period following the Executive's termination date; and (ii) for a period of eighteen months following the Executive's termination date, a monthly payment equal to the monthly COBRA premium that the Executive is required to pay to continue medical, vision, and dental coverage, for himself and, where applicable, his spouse and eligible dependents.\n ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) \nLiquidity and Capital Resources (Continued)\nFuture Contingent Payments (Continued)\nExecutive Severance Agreements (Continued)\nNotwithstanding the above, if the Executive has a termination as described above and can reasonably demonstrate that such termination would constitute a Termination Related to a Change in Control, and a Change in Control occurs within 120 days following the Executive's termination date, the Executive will be entitled to receive the payments set forth below for a Termination Related to a Change in Control, less any amounts already paid to the Executive, upon consummation of the Change in Control.\nUnder the terms of the Executive Severance Agreement, if a Change in Control occurs and (a) the Executive experiences a Termination Related to a Change in Control on account of (i) an involuntary termination by the Company for any reason other than Cause, death, or Disability, (ii) an involuntary termination by the Company within twelve months (for Mr. Vizi) or three months (for Mr. Miller) following a Change in Control on account of Disability or death, or (iii) a resignation by the Executive with Good Reason; or (b) in the case of Mr. Miller, a resignation by Mr. Miller, with or without Good Reason, which results in a termination date that is the last day of the three month period following a Change in Control, then the Executive will receive the following severance payments: (1) a lump sum payment equal to two times the sum of the Executive's (a) Annual Base Salary and (b) Bonus; and (2) a lump sum payment equal to twenty-four multiplied by the monthly COBRA premium cost, as in effect immediately prior to the Executive's termination date, for the Executive to continue medical, dental and vision coverage, as applicable, in such Company plans for himself and, if applicable, his spouse and eligible dependents. Upon the occurrence of a Change in Control, the Company shall establish an irrevocable rabbi trust and contribute to the rabbi trust the applicable amounts due under the Executive Severance Agreements.\nMr. Miller's Executive Severance Agreement provides that if Mr. Miller remains continuously employed for three months following a Change in Control and is employed by the Company on the last day of such specified period, Mr. Miller will receive a lump sum payment equal to two times the sum of his (a) Annual Base Salary and (b) Bonus (the Change in Control Payment\u201d). If Mr. Miller receives the Change in Control Payment, he will not be eligible to receive any severance payments under his Executive Severance Agreement.\nMr. Petraglia and Mr. Saks, along with several other members of the Company's senior management (not including Mr. Vizi), are covered by our Change in Control Plan for Selected Executive Management (the CIC Plan\u201d).\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nNone.\nImpact of Inflation\nConsulting, staffing, and project services are generally priced based on mark-ups on prevailing rates of pay, and as a result are able to generally maintain their relationship to direct labor costs. Permanent placement services are priced as a function of salary levels of the job candidates.\nThe Company's business is labor intensive; therefore, the Company has a high exposure to increasing health care benefit costs. The Company attempts to compensate for these escalating costs in its business cost models and customer pricing by passing along some of these increased health care benefit costs to its customers and employees, however, the Company has not been able to pass on all increases. The Company is continuing to review its options to further control these costs, which the Company does not believe are representative of general inflationary trends. Otherwise, inflation has not been a meaningful factor in the Company's operations.\n ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED) \nNew Accounting Standards\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326). The new standard amends guidance on reporting credit losses for assets held at amortized cost basis and available-for-sale debt securities. In February 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-02, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326) and Leases (Topic 842) - Amendments to SEC Paragraphs Pursuant to SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 119 and Update to SEC Section on Effective Date Related to Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), which amends the effective date of the original pronouncement for smaller reporting companies. ASU 2016-13 and its amendments will be effective for the Company for interim and annual periods in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022. The Company believes the adoption will modify the way the Company analyzes financial instruments, but it does not anticipate a material impact on results of operations. The Company is in the process of determining the effects the adoption will have on its consolidated financial statements.\nIn December 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-12, Income Taxes (Topic 740), which enhances and simplifies various aspects of the income tax accounting guidance, including requirements such as tax basis step-up in goodwill obtained in a transaction that is not a business combination, ownership changes in investments, and interim-period accounting for enacted changes in tax law. The amendment will be effective for public companies with fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020; early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently assessing the impact of this pronouncement to its consolidated financial statements.\nTable 71: <table> <tr> <td>"
