Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations should be read in conjunction with Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\nForward Looking Statements\nSome of the statements and information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Statements regarding the Company's financial position, business strategy and plans and objectives of the Company's management for future operations and other statements that are not historical facts, are forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are often characterized by the use of words such as \"outlook,\" \"may,\" \"will,\" \"should,\" \"could,\" \"expects,\" \"plans,\" \"anticipates,\" \"contemplates,\" \"proposes,\" \"believes,\" \"estimates,\" \"predicts,\" \"projects,\" \"potential,\" \"continue,\" \"intend,\" or the negative of such terms and other comparable terminology, or by discussions of strategy, plans or intentions.\nForward-looking statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements. Such risks, uncertainties and factors include, but are not limited to: general economic conditions domestically and internationally; insufficient cash flows from operating activities; difficulties in obtaining financing; outstanding debt and other financial and legal obligations; lawsuits; competition; industry cycles; feedstock, product and mineral prices; feedstock availability; technological developments; regulatory changes; environmental matters; foreign government instability; foreign legal and political concepts; foreign currency fluctuations; and other risks detailed in this report under the headings Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors and Part II, Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, and in our other filings with the SEC.\nThere may be other factors of which we are currently unaware or deem immaterial that may cause our actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements. In addition, to the extent any inconsistency or conflict exists between the information included in this report and the information included in our prior reports and other filings with the SEC, the information contained in this report updates and supersedes such information.\nForward-looking statements are based on current plans, estimates, assumptions and projections, and, therefore, you should not place undue reliance on them. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and we undertake no obligation to update them in light of new information or future events.\nOverview\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial results, as well as the accompanying consolidated financial statements and related notes to consolidated financial statements to which they refer, are the responsibility of the management of the Company. Our accounting and financial reporting fairly reflect our business model involving the manufacturing and marketing of specialty petrochemical products and specialty waxes. Our business model involves the manufacture and sale of tangible products and providing custom processing services. Our consistent approach to providing high purity products and quality services to our customers has helped to sustain our current position as a preferred supplier of various specialty petrochemical products.\nBusiness Environment and Risk Assessment\nWe believe we are well-positioned to participate in the US chemical industry growth driven by new investments and overall economic growth. While petrochemical prices are volatile on a short-term basis and depend on the demand of our customers' products, our investment decisions are based on our long-term business outlook using a disciplined approach in selecting and pursuing the most attractive investment opportunities.\nSpecialty Petrochemical Operations\nSHR's worldwide specialty petrochemical demand increased during 2018 compared to 2017. Product sales revenue increased 19.3% driven primarily by volume growth of 7.6%. Overall product prices also increased compared to 2017 primarily due to higher feedstock costs in 2018 compared to 2017. We continued to emphasize our competitive advantages achieved through our high quality products and outstanding customer service and responsiveness. We are also focused on improving operations and plant reliability.\nDuring 2018 feedstock prices were about 24%, or $0.28 per gallon, higher than 2017 reflecting higher crude oil prices. After steadily increasing for most of 2018 feedstock prices declined sharply in the fourth quarter of 2018. About 60% of our prime products are sold under formula pricing whereby feedstock costs are passed along to the customer typically with a one month lag. Thus, when feedstock prices start rising, we experience lower margins as formula pricing lags feedstock costs. During most of 2018 prime products margins were pressured due to rising feedstock costs and as a result of greater competitive pricing pressure on prime products sales that are based on non-formula pricing. Our byproduct margins were under pressure in the fourth quarter due to the Advanced Reformer outage as we sold byproducts at prices below the cost of feedstock.\nSpecialty Wax Operations\nMost wax markets are mature. Key applications for our polyethylene waxes are in hot melt adhesives (\"HMA\"), plastic processing, PVC lubricants and inks, paints and coatings, where they act as surface or rheology modifiers. The HMA market is expected to grow at a higher rate than GDP growth due to growth in the developing markets and increases in packaging requirements due to changes in consumer purchasing (shift to home deliveries via the internet) in developed economies. Road marking paints are also expected to grow at rates exceeding GDP growth based upon an expectation that there will be infrastructure investment in the U.S. The PVC market is expected to grow at GDP rates; however, we expect to get more traction of our products within this market with acceptance of our new PVC grade waxes. The global wax market is benefiting from the reduction of paraffin wax availability from large refiners as they move toward more hydrocracking and hydroisomerization to produce group III lube oils and distillate. Our wax sales volume increased approximately 5% in 2018 from 2017 while revenues increased approximately 13%.\nRestructuring and Severance Impact\nDuring 2018, the Company incurred restructuring and severance expenses of $2.3 million which are included in General and Administrative Expenses. These expenses are primarily attributable to the termination of certain executives during 2018 as part of the restructuring of executive management and to the reduction in the workforce at our Silsbee, Texas facility in December 2018. These expenses relate to severance, stock compensation for continued vesting of time-vested shares issued under the Company's long-term incentive plan, and certain employee benefits including medical insurance and vacation. As of December 31, 2018, approximately $1.1 million had been incurred, and an additional liability of $1.2 million was accrued related to future benefits.\nHurricane Harvey Impact\nThe financial impact of Hurricane Harvey to our company was significant. Harvey made landfall on the Texas Gulf Coast on August 25, 2017, and affected operations at both SHR and TC. We estimated the total negative impact to 2017 EBITDA ranged from approximately $1.5 million to $1.8 million. This included expenses related to generator rentals, overtime labor, and maintenance and repairs of approximately $0.7 million. This estimate also included lost sales due to outages at customer and supplier facilities. Neither of our facilities suffered any significant damage.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWorking Capital\nOur approximate working capital days are summarized as follows:\nTable 53: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Days sales outstanding in accounts receivable\n</td> <td>34.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>38.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>38.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Days sales outstanding in inventory\n</td> <td>21.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>27.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>30.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Days sales outstanding in accounts payable\n</td> <td>24.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>27.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Days of working capital\n</td> <td>31.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>38.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>45.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur days sales outstanding in accounts receivable remained steady from 2016 to 2017 but decreased from 2017 to 2018 due to greater increase in sales revenue relative to the increase in receivables.\nOur days sales outstanding in inventory decreased from 2017 to 2018 due to a planned reduction in inventory at TC.\nOur days sales outstanding in accounts payable decreased due to a decrease in payables because of the completion of certain capital construction projects at SHR.\nSources and Uses of Cash\nCash and cash equivalents increased by $3.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2018.

The majority of the decrease was due to the completion of construction projects for the Advanced Reformer unit. During 2018, major capital expenditures included $14.9 million to complete the Advanced Reformer unit, which includes $1 million insurance deductible related to the February 2018 fire and $3 million for the catalyst replacement in December 2018, $1.3 million for a rail spur addition at SHR and 0.5 million for a loading rack at SHR.\nCash used by investing activities during fiscal 2017 was approximately $51.7 million, representing an increase of approximately $11.2 million over the corresponding period of 2016. The majority of the increase was due to the construction projects for the hydrogenation/distillation unit and the Advanced Reformer unit. During 2017, we expended $10.8 million on the hydrogenation/distillation project, $0.9 million to upgrade B Plant, $32.5 million to construct the Advanced Reformer unit, $1.9 million for railspur addition, $1.0 million for additional tankage and upgrades to existing tankage, $0.9 million for transport trucks, and $3.7 million on various plant improvements and equipment.\nFinancing Activities\nCash provided by financing activities during fiscal 2018 was approximately $3.7 million versus cash provided of $15.5 million during fiscal 2017. During 2018, we increased our line of credit and consolidated our acquisition and term loans. We made principal payments of $15.4 million on our term debt. We drew $18.2 million on our revolving line of credit, primarily to fund our capital projects. See Note 12 for additional discussion on long-term debt.\nCash provided by financing activities during fiscal 2017 was approximately $15.5 million versus cash provided of $1.8 million during the corresponding period of 2016. During 2017 we made principal payments of $8.7 million on our acquisition loan and $1.7 million on our term debt. We drew $26.0 million on our line of credit primarily to fund our capital projects.\nCredit Agreement\nIn October 2014, TOCCO, SHR, GSPL and TC (SHR, GSPL and TC collectively the Guarantors\u201d) entered into an amended and restated credit agreement (as amended to the date hereof, the ARC Agreement\u201d), which originally provided (i) a revolving credit facility (which we refer to herein as the Revolving Facility\u201d) with revolving commitments of $40.0 million and (ii) term loan borrowings consisting of (A) a $70.0 million single advance term loan incurred to partially finance the acquisition of TC (which we refer to as the acquisition loan\u201d) and (B) a $25.0 multiple advance term loan facility for which borrowing availability ended on December 31, 2015 (which we collectively refer to herein as the Term Loan Facility\u201d and, together with the Revolving Facility, the Credit Facilities\u201d).\nOnly July 31, 2018, TOCCO and the Guarantors entered into a Fourth Amendment to the ARC Agreement (the Fourth Amendment\u201d) pursuant to which the revolving commitments under the Revolving Facility were increased to $75.0 million. Pursuant to the Fourth Amendment, total borrowings under the Term Loan Facility were increased to $87.5 million under a single combined term loan, which comprised new term loan borrowings together with approximately $60.4 million of previously outstanding term loans under the Term Loan Facility. The $60.4 million of previously outstanding term loans included the remaining outstanding balances on the Acquisition loan and the multiple advance term loan facility described above. Proceeds of the new borrowings under the Term Loan Facility were used to repay a portion of the outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Facility and pay fees and expenses of the transaction. As of December 31, 2018, we had $18 million in borrowings outstanding under the Revolving Facility and $84.5 million in borrowings outstanding under the Term Loan Facility. In addition, we had the ability to borrow an additional approximately $18 million under our Revolving Facility at December 31, 2018. TOCCO's ability to make additional borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility at December 31, 2018 was limited by, and in the future may continue to be limited by, our obligation to maintain compliance with the covenants contained in the ARC Agreement (including maintenance of a maximum Consolidated Leverage Ratio and minimum Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio (each as defined in the ARC Agreement)).\nThe maturity date for the ARC Agreement is July 31, 2023. Subject to the lenders acceptance of any increased commitment and other conditions, we have the option, at any time, to request an increase to the commitment under the Revolving Facility and/or the Term Loan Facility by an additional amount of up to $50.0 million in the aggregate.\nBorrowings under each of the Credit Facilities bear interest on the outstanding principal amount at a rate equal to LIBOR plus an applicable margin of 1.25% to 2.50% or, at our option, the Base Rate plus an applicable margin of 0.25% to 1.50%, in each case, with the applicable margin being determined based on the Consolidated Leverage Ratio of TOCCO. A commitment fee between 0.20% and 0.375% is also payable quarterly on the unused portion of the Revolving Facility. For 2018, the effective interest rate for the Credit Facilities was 4.19%. Borrowings under the Term Loan Facility are subject to quarterly amortization payments based on a commercial style amortization method over a twenty year period; provided, that the final principal installment will be paid on the maturity date and will be in an amount equal to the outstanding borrowings under the Term Loan Facility on such date.\nPursuant to the terms of the ARC Agreement, TOCCO must maintain a maximum Consolidated Leverage Ratio of 4.75 to 1.00 for the four fiscal quarters ended December 31, 2018, 4.25 to 1.00 for the four fiscal quarters ended March 31, 2019, 4.00 to 1.00 for the four fiscal quarters ended June 30, 2019 and 3.75 to 1.00 for the four fiscal quarters ended September 30, 2019. For the four fiscal quarters ended December 31, 2019 and each fiscal quarter thereafter, TOCCO must maintain a Consolidated Leverage Ratio of 3.50 to 1.00 (subject to temporary increase following certain acquisitions). Additionally, TOCCO must maintain a minimum Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio as of the end of any fiscal quarter of 1.15 to 1.00.\nThe ARC Agreement contains, among other things, other customary covenants, including restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness, the granting of additional liens, the making of investments, the disposition of assets and other fundamental changes, transactions with affiliates and the declaration of dividends and other restricted payments. The ARC Agreement further includes customary representations and warranties and events of default, and upon occurrence of such events of default the outstanding obligations under the ARC Agreement may be accelerated and become immediately due and payable and the commitment of the\nlenders to make loans under the ARC Agreement may be terminated. We were in compliance with all covenants at December 31, 2018.\nAnticipated Cash Needs\nWe believe that the Company is capable of supporting its operating requirements and capital expenditures through internally generated funds supplemented with borrowings under our Credit Facilities.\nResults of Operations\nComparison of Years 2018, 2017, 2016\nThe tables containing financial and operating

2017 to 2018 by approximately 18.7% due to an increase in specialty petrochemical sales volume and an increase in average selling prices.\n2016-2017\nRevenues increased from 2016 to 2017 by approximately 15.6% due to an increase in sales volume of 9.1% and an increase in average selling price of 7.7% partially offset by a decrease in processing fees of 21.7%.\nSpecialty Petrochemical Product Sales\n2017-2018\nSpecialty petrochemical product sales increased 19.3% from 2017 to 2018 due to an increase in total sales volume of 7.6% and an increase in average selling price of 10.9%. Our average selling price increased partly because of higher feedstock costs. A large portion of our prime products sales are contracted with pricing formulas which are tied to prior month Natural Gasoline prices which is our primary feedstock. Average delivered feedstock price for 2018 was 21.1% higher than 2017 as Natural Gasoline prices rose with crude oil prices for most of the year but then declined sharply in the fourth quarter. The increase in average selling prices was also due to higher non-formula pricing for our prime products. Additionally, prices for byproducts in 2018 were about 24% higher than in 2017 due to higher prices for the components in our byproducts stream. This also contributed to higher overall selling prices. Byproduct prices fell significantly during the fourth quarter due to the Advanced Reformer outage and inability to upgrade byproducts. Additionally, in the fourth quarter byproduct prices fell faster than feedstock prices resulting in negative margins.\nPrime product sales volume (total specialty petrochemical product sales volume less byproduct sales volume) increased 8.5% from 2017 to 2018 as demand was greater in all of our end-use markets and especially in the Canadian oil sands market. Sales to the Canadian oil sands market continues to be volatile. We believe the volatility in demand is primarily based on continued manufacturing efficiencies at customer sites and by the crude oil pricing environment. Margins on our specialty petrochemical products continued to be negatively impacted by shortfall fees that we incurred due to feedstock purchases below minimum amounts as prescribed by our agreement with suppliers. However the amount of the penalties in 2018 were significantly less than 2017.\nForeign sales volume accounted for approximately 25.5% of volume and 27.6% of revenue for specialty petrochemical product sales during 2018 as compared to 20.4% of volume and 23.3% of revenue during 2017. The increase in foreign sales volume was\ndue to higher demand in the Canadian oils sands market. Excluding oil sands, foreign sales volumes in 2018 grew by 22% from 2017.\n2016-2017\nSpecialty petrochemical product sales increased 17.5% from 2016 to 2017 due to an increase in total sales volume of 9.1% and an increase in average selling price of 7.7%. Our average selling price increased partly because a large portion of our sales are contracted with pricing formulas which are tied to prior month Natural Gasoline prices which is our primary feedstock. Average delivered feedstock price for 2017 was 17.8% higher than 2016. Additionally, prices for byproducts were about 17% higher than in 2016 which also contributed to higher overall selling prices. Prime product sales volume (total specialty petrochemical product sales volume less byproduct sales volume) increased 9.5% from 2016 to 2017 primarily due to higher demand across many of our end-use markets. Sales to the Canadian oil sands market were down from 2016 due to the continued downturn in that market. Margins on our specialty petrochemical products continued to be negatively impacted by shortfall fees that we incurred due to feedstock purchases below minimum amounts as prescribed by our agreement with suppliers. The amount of the penalties in 2017 was approximately the same as in 2016.\nForeign sales volume accounted for approximately 20.4% of volume and 23.3% of revenue for specialty petrochemical product sales during 2017 as compared to 22.7% of volume and 26.3% of revenue during 2016. The decline in foreign sales volume was due to lower demand in the Canadian oils sands market. Excluding oil sands, foreign sales volumes in 2017 grew by 8.1% from 2016.\nProcessing Fees\n2017-2018\nProcessing fee were approximately flat from 2017 to 2018.\n2016-2017\nProcessing fees decreased 21.7% from 2016 to 2017 primarily due to a reduction in fees associated with a customer who reimbursed us for installation expenses plus a markup. We were successful in negotiating a contract extension with one of our processing customers whose contract was set to expire at the end of 2017.\nCost of Sales (includes but is not limited to raw materials, total operating expense, natural gas, operating labor and transportation)\n2017-2018\nCost of Sales increased 32.3% from 2017 to 2018 due to higher raw material costs, higher operating expense and the increase in sales volume. Our average delivered feedstock cost per gallon increased approximately 21% over 2017 and volume processed increased about 8%. We use natural gasoline as our feedstock which is the heavier liquid remaining after ethane, propane and butanes are removed from liquids produced by natural gas wells. The material is a commodity product in the oil/petrochemical markets and generally is readily available. The price of natural gasoline is well correlated with the price of crude oil. With the start up and stable operation of our Advanced Reformer unit we continue to convert the lower value components in our feed into higher value products, thereby allowing us to sell our byproducts at higher prices than would be realized without the Advanced Reformer unit.\n2016-2017\nCost of Sales increased 15.8% from 2016 to 2017 primarily due to the increase in sales volume and higher raw material costs. Our average delivered feedstock cost per gallon increased 17.8% over 2016 and volume processed increased 10.0%. We use natural gasoline as feedstock which is the heavier liquid remaining after ethane, propane and butanes are removed from liquids produced by natural gas wells. The material is a commodity product in the oil/petrochemical markets and generally is readily available.\nTotal Operating Expense (includes but is not limited to natural gas, operating labor, depreciation, and transportation)\n2017-2018\nTotal Operating Expense increased 24.4% from 2017 to 2018 resulting in a $14.4 million increase 2017. The key drivers for the increase were transportation costs, operating labor and depreciation. Transportation costs increased due to higher sales volume, higher rail freight rates and other logistics costs. Operating labor costs were higher due to higher maintenance and contract labor costs primarily associated with the start-up of the Advanced Reformer unit, maintenance and repair costs associated with a toll processing unit and other maintenance activities. Approximately 12.8% of our labor costs were capitalized in 2018 primarily due to the construction of the Advanced Reformer unit; whereas, in 2017 approximately 28% was capitalized.\nWe implemented a reorganization and workforce reduction at our Silsbee, Texas facility which reduced the workforce by about 20% at the end of 2018. We expect to realize approximately $2.5 million in annual cost savings as a result of this action. We took a charge of approximately $0.4 million for severance related to this action.\nNatural gas expense increased 14.9% from 2017 to 2018 due to an increase in the average per unit cost and volume consumed. Consumption was greater than in 2017 both due to higher sales volume and inefficiencies related to the start-up and operation issues with the Advanced Reformer unit. The average price per MMBTU for 2018 was up about 3.8% from 2017 while volume consumed increased to approximately 1,684,000 MMBTU from about 1,509,000 MMBTU.\n2016-2017\nTotal Operating Expense increased 0.3% from 2016 to 2017. Natural gas, labor, and transportation are the largest individual expenses in this category; however, not all of these increased.\nNatural gas expense increased 48.8% from 2016 to 2017 due to an increase in the average per unit cost and volume consumed. The average price per MMBTU for 2017 was $3.24 whereas, for 2016 the average per unit cost was $2.61. Volume consumed increased to approximately 1,509,000 MMBTU from about 1,294,000 MMBTU.\nLabor costs declined 3.0% from 2016 to 2017 despite a 3.8% increase in headcount from year end 2016 to year end 2017. Approximately 19.9% of our labor costs were capitalized in 2017 due to the construction of the Advanced Reformer unit; whereas, in 2016 approximately 12.0% was capitalized.\nTransportation costs were higher by 4.7% primarily due to the increase in sales volume.\nGeneral and Administrative Expense\n2017-2018\nGeneral and Administrative costs increased 11.4% from 2017 to 2018 primarily due to restructuring and severance costs in 2018. There were no restructuring and severance expenses in 2017.\n2016-2017\nGeneral and Administrative costs increased 11.7% from 2016 to 2017 primarily due to an increase in property taxes because of the expiration of abatements. Group insurance and administrative labor costs also increased.\nDepreciation\n2017-2018\nDepreciation expense increased 41.6% or approximately $2.6 million from 2017 to 2018 primarily due to the start-up of the Advanced Reformer unit and the resulting increase of our depreciable base.\n2016-2017\nDepreciation expense increased 8.3% from 2016 to 2017 primarily due to 2016 capital expenditures increasing our depreciable base.\nCapital Expenditures\n2017-2018\nCapital expenditures in 2018 declined $15.1 million from 2017 mostly due to the completion of the Advanced Reformer unit. See discussion under \"Capital Resources and Requirements\" below for more detail.\n2016-2017\nCapital expenditures increased 63.7% from 2016 to 2017. See discussion under \"Capital Resources and Requirements\" below for more detail.\nSpecialty Wax Segment\nTable 73: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

Sales\n2017-2018\nProduct sales revenue increased 13.4% and product sales volume increased 5.3% from 2017 to 2018 primarily due to higher on-purpose PE wax sales which benefited from continued growth in growth in our high value waxes. Polyethylene wax sales saw volume increases of 3.5% and revenue from polyethylene wax increased approximately 15.4% both as a result of greater sales volume and a higher value sales mix. Average wax sales price was approximately 9% higher in 2018 compared to 2017.\n2016-2017\nProduct sales revenue increased 17.2% and product sales volume increased 4.4% from 2016 to 2017 primarily due to on-purpose PE wax sales which we were distributing in Latin America for a third party as well as, significant growth in our high value waxes. Polyethylene wax sales saw volume increases of 1.3% and revenue increases of 12.8%.\nProcessing Fees\n2017-2018\nProcessing fees increased 2.7% from 2017 to 2018 primarily due to greater revenues from hydrogenation/distillation unit. Growth in custom processing revenue in 2018 continued to be hampered by operational and reliability issues especially related to the hydrogenation/distillation unit which started up in the second half of 2017.\n2016-2017\nProcessing fees increased 8.9% from 2016 to 2017 primarily due to the addition of new customers and an increase in existing customer volumes. Growth was limited by significant operational issues in existing equipment and in the new hydrogenation/distillation unit.\nCost of Sales\n2017-2018\nCost of Sales increased 5.7% from 2017 to 2018 due to increases in labor, maintenance, utilities and depreciation which were partially offset by lower wax material costs. Labor increased approximately due to increased overtime and the addition of personnel to support the new hydrogenation/distillation unit which came on line in 2017 as well as to support other custom processing projects. Maintenance costs increased primarily as a result of the start-up of hydrogenation/distillation and the related operating issues in 2018. Utility costs increased mainly due to greater consumption.\n2016-2017\nCost of Sales increased 30.5% from 2016 to 2017 due to increases in material cost, labor, freight, equipment maintenance, and natural gas utilities. Material cost increased primarily due to material costs associated with the on-purpose PE wax sales we distributed into Latin America for a third party. Labor increased due to increased overtime and the addition of personnel to operate the new hydrogenation/distillation unit when it came online in 2017. Freight increased due to the increase in shipments and a change in our shipping terms. We now ship most products with destination terms. Equipment maintenance increased primarily due to the addition of B Plant and the introduction of new custom processing projects. Natural gas utilities increased due to an increase in the per unit cost and in volume consumed because of B Plant and the new hydrogenation/distillation unit.\nGeneral and Administrative Expense\n2017-2018\nGeneral and Administrative costs increased 2.5% from 2017 to 2018.\n2016-2017\nGeneral and Administrative costs increased 2.3% from 2016 to 2017 primarily due to an increase in sales personnel, property taxes, and property insurance due to the addition of B Plant.\nDepreciation and Amortization\n2017-2018\nDepreciation and amortization increased 17.1% from 2017 to 2018 primarily due to start up of the hydrogenation/distillation project in the second half of 2017.\n2016-2017\nDepreciation and amortization increased 17.4% from 2016 to 2017 primarily due to the addition of B Plant and the hydrogenation/distillation project coming online in 2017.\nCapital Expenditures\n2017-2018\nCapital expenditures decreased from approximately $14.0 million to $2.9 million or 79.6% from 2017 to 2018 primarily due to the completion and of the hydrogenation/distillation project in 2017.\n2016-2017\nCapital expenditures decreased 20.1% from 2016 to 2017 primarily due to the completion of the hydrogenation/distillation project in 2017.\nCorporate Segment\nTable 75: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General & Administrative Expense\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8,275\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,413\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>862\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation\n</td> <td>50\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>62\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(12\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(19.4\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Equity in losses of AMAK\n</td> <td>901\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,261\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(3,360\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(78.9\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 76: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General & Administrative Expense\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,413\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,445\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>968\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation\n</td> <td>62\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>43\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>19\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>44.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Equity in losses of AMAK\n</td> <td>4,261\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,479\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,782\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>188.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain from additional equity issuance by AMAK\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3,168\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,168\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(100.0\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\n2017-2018\nGeneral corporate expenses increased from 2017 to 2018 primarily due to restructuring and severance expenses, offset by the cancellation and reversal of stock compensation expense and other post retirement benefits awarded to Mr. Hatem El Khalidi. See Note 14 for further discussion.\n2016-2017\nGeneral corporate expenses increased from 2016 to 2017 primarily due to an increase in officer compensation, accounting fees, and legal fees. Officer compensation increased in 2017 due to the addition of an officer in late 2016 and and an accrual for executive bonuses. Accounting and legal fees increased due to additional time required for restatements issues and other matters.\nEquity in Losses of AMAK/Gain on Equity Issuance of AMAK\n2017-2018\nEquity in Losses of AMAK decreased 78.9% from 2017 to 2018 due to a number of reasons as discussed below.\nThe mine was fully operational in 2018 as compared to operating on an improving basis throughout 2017. In 2017 costs were increased as the mine was not operating at full capacity. Metal prices remained strong in 2018.\nShipments increased 105% from 2017 to 2018 as indicated in the table below. AMAK volumes in dry metric tons (dmt) for 2018 and 2017 were as follows:\nTable 77: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Variance\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Ore tons processed\n</td> <td>699,885\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>385,495\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>314,390\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Concentrate to the port\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Copper\n</td> <td>26,070\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15,326\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,744\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Zinc\n</td> <td>31,989\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16,606\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15,383\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>58,059\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>31,932\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26,127\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Shipments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Copper\n</td> <td>26,286\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13,940\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12,346\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Zinc\n</td> <td>31,272\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14,080\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17,192\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>57,558\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28,020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>29,538\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n2016-2017\nEquity in Losses of AMAK increased 188.1% from 2016 to 2017 due to a number of reasons as discussed below.\nThe mine operated on an improving basis throughout 2017 while operations were closed for almost all of 2016. However, in 2017 because the mine was not operating at full capacity but was working toward that goal, costs increased. Also, 2016 was positively affected by the settlement from certain liabilities. Metal prices were strong in 2017 with zinc prices hitting a ten year high during the year. There were no unusual items in 2017.\nCapital Resources and Requirements\n2017-2018\nCapital expenditures decreased 58% from 2017 to 2018. The majority of the decrease was due to completion of the Advanced Reformer unit. During 2018 we expended approximately $14.9 million to complete the Advanced Reformer unit which includes $1 million insurance deductible related to the February 2018 fire and $3 million for the catalyst replacement in December 2018, $1.3 million for a rail spur addition and $0.5 million for a truck loading rack.\n2016-2017\nCapital expenditures increased 27.4% from 2016 to 2017. The majority of the increase was due to the construction projects for the hydrogenation/distillation unit and the Advanced Reformer unit. During 2017 we expended $10.8 million on the hydrogenation/distillation project, $0.9 million to upgrade B Plant, $32.5 million to construct the Advanced Reformer unit, $1.9 million for railspur addition, $1.0 million for additional tankage and upgrades to existing tankage, $0.9 million for transport trucks, and $3.7 million on various plant improvements and equipment.\nAt December 31, 2018, there was approximately $18 million available on the Company's line of credit. We believe that operating cash flows along with credit availability will be sufficient to finance our 2019 operations and capital expenditures.\nThe table below summarizes the following contractual obligations of the Company:\nTable 78: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Payments due by period\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Contractual Obligations\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Less than\n1 year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1-3 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3-5 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>More than 5 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(thousands of dollars)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating Lease Obligations\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>18,131\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,670\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,001\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,395\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,065\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchase Obligations\n</td> <td>124\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>124\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-Term Debt Obligations\n</td> <td>103,312\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,375\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>98,937\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>121,567\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8,169\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>105,938\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,395\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,065\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe majority of our operating lease obligations are for railcars as discussed in Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Purchase obligations are primarily related to commitments for our capital construction projects. The anticipated source of funds for payments due within three years that relate to contractual obligations is from a combination of continuing operations supplemented with borrowings under our credit facility.\nImpact of Inflation\nOur results of operations and financial condition are presented based on historical cost. While it is difficult to accurately measure the impact of inflation, we do not believe the overall effects of inflation, if any, on our results of operations and financial condition have been material.\nInvestment in AMAK\nInformation concerning our investment in AMAK is set forth in Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nNew Accounting Standards\nIn May 2014 the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") issued Accounting Standards Update (\"ASU\") 2014-9, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (\"ASU 2014-9\"). ASU 2014-9 supersedes the revenue recognition requirements of FASB Accounting Standards Codification (\"ASC\") Topic 605, Revenue Recognition and most industry-specific guidance throughout the Accounting Standards Codification, resulting in the creation of FASB ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. ASU 2014-9 requires entities to recognize revenue in a way that depicts the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. This ASU provides alternative methods of retrospective adoption and is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2017. The Company completed its assessment of the impact of the adoption of ASU 2014-9 across all revenue streams. This included reviewing current accounting policies and practices to identify potential differences that would result from applying the requirements under the new standard. We completed contract reviews and validated results of applying the new revenue guidance (Note 2). See Revenue Recognition policy note.\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842). This update will increase transparency and comparability among organizations by recognizing lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements. This update is effective for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. In July 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-11, Targeted Improvements to ASC 842, Leases. ASU 2018-11 provided entities with an alternative modified transition method to elect not to recast the comparative periods presented when adopting ASC 842. The new standard provides a number of optional practical expedients in transition. The Company expects to elect: (1) the \u2018package of practical expedients', which permits it not to reassess under the new standard its prior conclusions about lease identification, lease classification, and initial direct costs and (2) the use-of-hindsight. In addition, the new standard provides practical expedients for an entity's ongoing accounting that the Company anticipates making, such as the (1) the election for certain classes of underlying asset to not separate non-lease components from lease components and (2) the election for short-term lease recognition\nexemption for all leases that qualify. The Company will adopt ASU 842 as of January 1, 2019, using the alternative modified transition method. In preparation of adopting ASC 842, the Company is implementing additional internal controls to enable future preparation of financial information in accordance with ASC 842. The Company has also substantially completed its evaluation of the impact on the Company's lease portfolio. The Company believes the largest impact will be on the consolidated balance sheets for the accounting of facilities-related leases, which represents a majority of its operating leases it has entered into as a lessee. These leases will be recognized under the new standard as right of use assets ( ROU\u201d) operating lease liabilities. The Company will also be required to provide expanded disclosures for its leasing arrangements. As of December 31, 2018, the Company had approximately $18.1 million of undiscounted future minimum operating lease commitments that are not recognized on its consolidated balance sheets as determined under the current standard. For a lessee, the results of operations are not expected to significantly change after adoption of the new standard. While substantially complete, the Company is still in the process of finalizing its evaluation of the effect of ASU 842 on the Company's financial statements and disclosures, including the determination of the Company's incremental borrowing rate for each of the operating leases to estimate the interest rate we would have to pay to borrow on a collateralized basis over a similar term for an amount equal to the lease payments. The Company will finalize its accounting assessment and quantitative impact of the adoption during the first quarter of fiscal year 2019.\nIn January 2017 the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-4, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (Topic 350). The amendments in ASU 2017-4 simplify the measurement of goodwill by eliminating Step 2 from the goodwill impairment test. Instead, under these amendments, an entity should perform its annual, or interim, goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. An entity should recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit's fair value; however, the loss should not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. The amendments are effective for public business entities for the first interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019. Early adoption is permitted for interim or annual goodwill impairment tests performed on testing dates after January 1, 2017.The amendments also eliminate the requirements for any reporting unit with a zero or negative carrying amount to perform a qualitative assessment and, if it fails that qualitative test, to perform Step 2 of the goodwill impairment test. An entity still has the option to perform the qualitative assessment for a reporting unit to determine if the quantitative impairment test is necessary. The Company has goodwill from prior business combination and performs an annual impairment test or more frequently if changes or circumstances occur that would more-likely-than-not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying value. During the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company performed its impairment assessment and determined the fair value of the aggregated reporting units exceed the carrying value, such that the Company's goodwill was not considered impaired. Although the Company cannot anticipate future goodwill impairment assessments, based on the most recent assessment, it is unlikely that an impairment amount would need to be calculated and, therefore, the Company does not anticipate a material impact from these amendments to the Company's financial position and results of operations. The current accounting policies and processes are not anticipated to change, except for the elimination of the Step 2 analysis.\nIn February 2018 the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-2, Income Statement - Reporting Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income. ASU 2018-2 was issued to address the income tax accounting treatment of the stranded tax effects within other comprehensive income due to the prohibition of backward tracing due to an income tax rate change that was initially recorded in other comprehensive income due to the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) on December 22, 2017, which changed the Company's income tax rate from 35% to 21%. The amendments to the ASU changed US GAAP whereby an entity may elect to reclassify the stranded tax effect from accumulated other comprehensive income to retained earnings. The amendments of the ASU may be adopted in total or in part using a full retrospective or modified retrospective method. The amendments of the ASU are effective for periods beginning after December 15, 2018. The Company believes there will be no material impact to the consolidated financial statements as a result of this update.\nIn June 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-07, Improvements to Nonemployee Share-Based Payment Accounting. ASU 2018-07 simplifies the accounting for share-based payments to nonemployees by aligning it with the accounting for share-based payments to employees, with certain exceptions. The amendments in this ASU are effective for public companies for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within that fiscal year. The Company is assessing the effect of ASU 2018-02 on its consolidated financial statements.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nOur consolidated financial statements are based on the selection and application of significant accounting policies. The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of net sales, expenses and allocated charges during the reported period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. However, we are not currently aware of any reasonably likely events or circumstances that would result in materially different results.\nWe believe the following accounting policies and estimates are critical to understanding the financial reporting risks present currently. These matters, and the judgments and uncertainties affecting them, are essential to understanding our reported results. See Note 2 to the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.\nInventories\nFinished products and feedstock are recorded at the lower of cost, determined on the first-in, first-out method (\"FIFO\"); or market for SHR. For TC, inventory is recorded at the lower of cost or market as follows: (1) raw material cost is calculated using the weighted-average cost method and (2) product inventory cost is calculated using the specific cost method. See Note 7 to the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.\nBeginning January 1, 2017, due to expansion of our plant assets at SHR and TC, we began inventorying spare parts for the repair and maintenance of our plant, pipeline and equipment.\nRevenue recognition\nThe Company adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") Accounting Standards Codification (\"ASC\") Topic 606 (\"ASC 606\"), Revenue from Contracts with Customers, and its amendments with a date of the initial application of January 1, 2018. As a result, the Company has changed its accounting policy for revenue recognition as detailed below. ASC 606 outlines a single comprehensive model for an entity to use in accounting for revenue arising from all contracts with customers, except where revenues are in scope of another accounting standard. ASC 606 superseded the revenue recognition requirements in ASC Topic 605, \"Revenue Recognition\", and most industry specific guidance. ASC Topic 606 sets forth a five-step model for determining when and how revenue is recognized. Under the model, an entity is required to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to a customer at an amount reflecting the consideration it expects to receive in exchange for those goods and services. ASC 606 also requires certain additional revenue-related disclosures.\nThe Company applied the modified retrospective approach under ASC 606 which allows for the cumulative effect of adopting the new guidance on the date of initial application. Use of the modified retrospective approach means the Company's comparative periods prior to initial application are not restated. The initial application was applied to all contracts at the date of the initial application. The Company has determined that the adjustments using the modified retrospective approach did not have a material impact on the date of the initial application along with the disclosure of the effect on prior periods.\nAccounting Policy\nBeginning on January 1, 2018, revenue is measured based on a consideration specified in a contract with a customer. The Company recognizes revenue when it satisfies a performance obligation by transferring control over a product or service to a customer. In evaluating when a customer has control of the asset we primarily consider whether the transfer of legal title and physical delivery has occurred, whether the customer has significant risks and rewards of ownership, and whether the customer has accepted delivery and a right to payment exists. Taxes assessed by a governmental authority that are both imposed on and concurrent with a specific revenue-producing transaction, that are collected by the Company from a customer, are excluded from revenue. Shipping and handling costs associated with outbound freight after control over a product has transferred to a customer are accounted for as a fulfillment cost and are included in cost of product sales and processing. The Company does not offer material rights of return or service-type warranties.\nFor 2017 the Company recognized revenue according to FASB ASC Topic 605 (\"ASC 605\"), \"Revenue Recognition\", when: (1) the customer accepted delivery of the product and title had been transferred or when the service was performed and the Company had no significant obligations remaining to be performed; (2) a final understanding as to specific nature and terms of the agreed upon transaction had occurred; (3) price was fixed and determinable; and (4) collection was assured. Product sales generally met these criteria, and revenue was recognized, when the product was delivered or title was transferred to the customer. Sales revenue was presented net of discounts, allowances, and sales taxes. Freight costs billed to customers were recorded as a component of revenue. Revenues received in advance of future sales of products or prior to the performance of services were presented as deferred revenues. Shipping and handling costs were classified as cost of product sales and processing and were expensed as incurred.\nNature of goods and services\nThe following is a description of principal activities - separated by reportable segments - from which the Company generates its revenue. For more detailed information about reportable segments, disaggregation of revenues, and contract balance disclosures, see Note 17.\nSpecialty petrochemical segment\nThe specialty petrochemical segment of the Company produces eight high purity hydrocarbons and other petroleum based products including isopentane, normal pentane, isohexane and hexane. These products are used in the production of polyethylene, packaging,\npolypropylene, expandable polystyrene, poly-iso/urethane foams, crude oil from the Canadian tar sands, and in the catalyst support industry. SHR's specialty petrochemical products are typically transported to customers by rail car, tank truck, iso-container and ship.\nProduct Sales - The Company sells individual (distinct) products to its customers on a stand-alone basis (point-of-sale) without any further integration. There is no significant modification of any one or more products sold to fulfill another promised product or service within any of the Company's product sale transactions. The amount of consideration received for product sales is stated within the executed invoice with the customer. Payment is typically due and collected 30 to 60 days subsequent to point of sale.\nProcessing Fees - The Company's services consist of processing customer supplied feedstocks into custom products including, if requested, services for forming, packaging, and arranging shipping. Pursuant to Tolling Agreements the customer retains title to the feedstocks and processed products. The performance obligation in each Tolling Agreement transaction is the processing of customer provided feedstocks into custom products and is satisfied over time. The amount of consideration received for product sales is stated within the executed invoice with the customer. Payment is typically due and collected within 30 days subsequent to point of sale.\nSpecialty Wax segment\nThe specialty wax segment of the Company manufactures and sells specialty polyethylene and poly alpha olefin waxes and also provides custom processing services for customers.\nProduct Sales - The Company sells individual (distinct) products to its customers on a stand-alone basis (point-of-sale) without any further integration. There is no significant modification of any one or more products sold to fulfill another promised product or service within any of the Company's product sale transactions. The amount of consideration received for product sales is stated within the executed invoice with the customer. Payment is typically due and collected within 30 days subsequent to point of sale.\nProcessing Fees - The Company's promised services consist of processing customer supplied feedstocks into custom products including, if requested, services for forming, packaging, and arranging shipping. Pursuant to Tolling Agreements and Purchase Order Arrangements, the customer typically retains title to the feedstocks and processed products. The performance obligation in each Tolling Agreement transaction and Purchase Order Arrangement is the processing of customer provided feedstocks into custom products and is satisfied over time. The amount of consideration received for product sales is stated within the executed invoice with the customer. Payment is typically due and collected within 30 days subsequent to point of sale.\nLong-lived Assets\nLong-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable from estimated future undiscounted cash flows. If the estimated future undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying value of the assets, we calculate the amount of impairment if the carrying value of the long-lived assets exceeds the fair value of the assets. Our long-lived assets include our specialty petrochemical facility and our specialty synthetic wax facility.\nOur specialty petrochemical facility and specialty synthetic wax facility are currently our revenue generating assets. The facilities were in full operation at December 31, 2018.\nGoodwill and other intangible assets\nGoodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment at least annually; however, these tests are performed more frequently when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset may be impaired. Impairment exists when carrying value exceeds fair value.\nDefinite-lived intangible assets are being amortized using discounted estimated future cash flows over the term of the related agreements. We continually evaluate the reasonableness of the useful lives of these assets. Once these assets are fully amortized, they will be removed from the consolidated balance sheets.\nSee Note 9 to the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nInvestment in AMAK\nWe account for our investment in AMAK using the equity method of accounting under which we record in income our share of AMAK's income or loss for each period. The amount recorded is also adjusted to reflect the amortization of certain differences between the basis in our investment in AMAK and our share of the net assets of AMAK as reflected in AMAK's financial statements. Any proceeds received from or payments made to AMAK are recorded as decreases or increases in the balance of our investment. See Note 10 to the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nWe assess our investment in AMAK for impairment when events are identified, or there are changes in circumstances that may have an adverse effect on the fair value of the investment. We consider recoverable ore reserves and the amount and timing of the cash flows to be generated by the production of those reserves, as well as, recent equity transactions within AMAK. Factors which\nmay affect carrying value include, but are not limited to, mineral prices, capital cost estimates, equity transactions, the estimated operating costs of any mines and related processing, ore grade and related metallurgical characteristics, the design of any mines and the timing of any mineral production. There are no assurances that we will not be required to take a material write-down of any of our mineral properties.\nEnvironmental Liabilities\nOur operations are subject to the rules and regulations of the TCEQ which inspects the facilities at various times for possible violations relating to air, water and industrial solid waste requirements. As noted in Item 1. Business, evidence of groundwater contamination was discovered at SHR in 1993. The recovery process, initiated in 1998, is proceeding as planned and is expected to continue for many years. See Note 14 to the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nShare-Based Compensation\nWe expense the cost of director and employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of such instruments. For options we use the Black-Sholes model to calculate the fair value of the equity instrument on the grant date. See Note 15 to the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nOff Balance Sheet Arrangements\nOff balance sheet arrangements as defined by the SEC means any transaction, agreement or other contractual arrangement to which an entity unconsolidated with the registrant is a party, under which the registrant has (i) obligations under certain guarantees or contracts, (ii) retained or contingent interest in assets transferred to an unconsolidated entity or similar arrangements, (iii) obligations under certain derivative arrangements, and (iv) obligations arising out of a material variable interest in an unconsolidated entity. Our guarantee for AMAK's debt is considered an off balance sheet arrangement. Please see further discussion under \"Investment in AMAK\" in Item 1. Business.\nIncome Taxes\nIn determining our income tax provision, we assess the likelihood our deferred tax assets will be recovered through future taxable income. Based on this assessment, a valuation allowance against all or a portion of our deferred tax asset that will, more likely than not, be realized. If these estimates, assumptions, or actual results of operations change in the future, we may reverse the valuation allowance against deferred tax assets. Income tax liabilities are determined based on judgment and estimates assuming it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination by a taxing authority. See Note 16 to the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nOn December 22, 2017, Public Law No. 115-97, also known as, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (\"TCJA\") was enacted. The TCJA included a number of changes to existing U.S. tax laws that impacted the Company, most notably a reduction of the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from a maximum of 35% to a flat 21% for tax years effective January 1, 2018. The TCJA also implemented a territorial tax system, provided for a one-time deemed repatriation tax on unrepatriated foreign earnings, eliminated the alternative minimum tax (\"AMT\"), making AMT credit carryforwards refundable, and permits the acceleration of depreciation for certain assets placed into service after September 27, 2017. In addition the TJCA created prospective changes beginning in 2018, including repeal of the domestic manufacturing deduction, acceleration of tax revenue recognition, capitalization of research and development expenditures, additional limitations on executive compensation and limitations on the deductibility of interest.\nThe Company elected to recognize the income tax effects of the TCJA in its financial statements in accordance with Staff Accounting Bulletin 118 (SAB 118), which provides guidance for the application of ASC Topic 740 Income Taxes, in the reporting period in which the TCJA was signed into law. Under SAB 118 when a Company does not have the necessary information available, prepared, or analyzed (including computations) in reasonable detail to complete the accounting for certain income tax effects of the TCJA it will recognize provisional amounts if a reasonable estimate can be made. After the analysis, the Company did not identify any items for which the income tax effects of the TCJA have not been completed and a reasonable estimate could not be determined as of December 31, 2018.\nThe changes to existing U.S. tax laws as a result of the TCJA, which will have the most significant impact on the Company's federal income taxes are as follows:\nReduction of the U.S. Corporate Income Tax Rate - The Company uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to reverse. As a result of the reduction in the U.S. corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% under the TCJA, the Company revalued its ending net deferred tax liabilities at December 31, 2017. The reduction in the corporate income tax rate resulted in the Company recording $10.3 million benefit from deferred taxes in the year ending December 31, 2017.\nAcceleration of Depreciation - The Company recognized a reduction to net deferred tax assets attributable to the accelerated depreciation for certain assets placed into service after September 27, 2017. This adjustment resulted in an increase in income tax receivable of approximately $961,000 in the year ending December 31, 2017.", "summary": "- Some of the statements and information contained in

Our accounting and financial reporting fairly reflect our business model involving the manufacturing and marketing of specialty petrochemical products and specialty waxes. Our business model involves the manufacture and sale of tangible products and providing custom processing services. Our consistent approach to providing high purity products and quality services to our customers has helped to sustain our current position as a preferred supplier of various specialty petrochemical products.\nBusiness Environment and Risk Assessment\nWe believe we are well-positioned to participate in the US chemical industry growth driven by new investments and overall economic growth. While petrochemical prices are volatile on a short-term basis and depend on the demand of our customers' products, our investment decisions are based on our long-term business outlook using a disciplined approach in selecting and pursuing the most attractive investment opportunities.\nSpecialty Petrochemical Operations\nSHR's worldwide specialty petrochemical demand increased during 2018 compared to 2017. Product sales revenue increased 19.3% driven primarily by volume growth of 7.6%. Overall product prices also increased compared to 2017 primarily due to higher feedstock costs in 2018 compared to 2017. We continued to emphasize our competitive advantages achieved through our high quality products and outstanding customer service and responsiveness. We are also focused on improving operations and plant reliability.\nDuring 2018 feedstock prices were about 24%, or $0.28 per gallon, higher than 2017 reflecting higher crude oil prices. After steadily increasing for most of 2018 feedstock prices declined sharply in the fourth quarter of 2018. About 60% of our prime products are sold under formula pricing whereby feedstock costs are passed along to the customer typically with a one month lag. Thus, when feedstock prices start rising, we experience lower margins as formula pricing lags feedstock costs. During most of 2018 prime products margins were pressured due to rising feedstock costs and as a result of greater competitive pricing pressure on prime products sales that are based on non-formula pricing. Our byproduct margins were under pressure in the fourth quarter due to the Advanced Reformer outage as we sold byproducts at prices below the cost of feedstock.\nSpecialty Wax Operations\nMost wax markets are mature. Key applications for our polyethylene waxes are in hot melt adhesives (\"HMA\"), plastic processing, PVC lubricants and inks, paints and coatings, where they act as surface or rheology modifiers. The HMA market is expected to grow at a higher rate than GDP growth due to growth in the developing markets and increases in packaging requirements due to changes in consumer purchasing (shift to home deliveries via the internet) in developed economies. Road marking paints are also expected to grow at rates exceeding GDP growth based upon an expectation that there will be infrastructure investment in the U.S. The PVC market is expected to grow at GDP rates; however, we expect to get more traction of our products within this market with acceptance of our new PVC grade waxes. The global wax market is benefiting from the reduction of paraffin wax availability from large refiners as they move toward more hydrocracking and hydroisomerization to produce group III lube oils and distillate. Our wax sales volume increased approximately 5% in 2018 from 2017 while revenues increased approximately 13%.\nRestructuring and Severance Impact\nDuring 2018, the Company incurred restructuring and severance expenses of $2.3 million which are included in General and Administrative Expenses. These expenses are primarily attributable to the termination of certain executives during 2018 as part of the restructuring of executive management and to the reduction in the workforce at our Silsbee, Texas facility in December 2018. These expenses relate to severance, stock compensation for continued vesting of time-vested shares issued under the Company's long-term incentive plan, and certain employee benefits including medical insurance and vacation. As of December 31, 2018, approximately $1.1 million had been incurred, and an additional liability of $1.2 million was accrued related to future benefits.\nHurricane Harvey Impact\nThe financial impact of Hurricane Harvey to our company was significant. Harvey made landfall on the Texas Gulf Coast on August 25, 2017, and affected operations at both SHR and TC. We estimated the total negative impact to 2017 EBITDA ranged from approximately $1.5 million to $1.8 million. This included expenses related to generator rentals, overtime labor, and maintenance and repairs of approximately $0.7 million. This estimate also included lost sales due to outages at customer and supplier facilities. Neither of our facilities suffered any significant damage.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWorking Capital\nOur approximate working capital days are summarized as follows:\n\nOur days sales outstanding in accounts receivable remained steady from 2016 to 2017 but decreased from 2017 to 2018 due to greater increase in sales revenue relative to the increase in receivables.\nOur days sales outstanding in inventory decreased from 2017 to 2018 due to a planned reduction in inventory at TC.\nOur days sales outstanding in accounts payable decreased due to a decrease in payables because of the completion of certain capital construction projects at SHR.\nSources and Uses of Cash\nCash and cash equivalents increased by $3.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2018. The change in cash and cash equivalents is summarized as follows:\n\nOperating Activities\nOperating activities generated cash of $19.9 million during fiscal 2018 as compared with $30.8 million of cash provided during fiscal 2017. Net income decreased by $20.3 million and cash provided by operations decreased by $10.9 million from 2017 to 2018 due primarily to the following factors:\n \u2022 Net income for 2018 included a non-cash depreciation and amortization charge of $14.4 million as compared to 2017 which included a non-cash depreciation and amortization charge of $11.0 million; \n \u2022 Net income for 2018 included non-cash deferred income tax liability of $1.6 million as compared to non-cash deferred income tax liability of $5.8 million in 2017; \n \u2022 Trade receivables decreased $1.5 million in 2018 as compared to an decrease of $3.6 million in 2017; \n \u2022 Income taxes receivable decreased $5.4 million in 2018 (primarily due to collection of federal and state research and development credits, carryback claims, and refunds of tax payments on deposit) as compared to an increase of $1.6 million in 2017 (primarily due to federal and state research and development credits and carryback claims); and \n \u2022 Inventory decreased $1.9 million in 2018 as compared to an increase of $0.6 million in 2017.  These significant sources of cash were partially offset by the following decreases in cash provided by operations:\n \u2022 Net income for 2018 included a non-cash equity in loss from AMAK of $0.9 million as compared to a non-cash equity in loss from AMAK of $4.3 million in 2017; and \n \u2022 Accounts payable and accrued liabilities decreased $2.2 million in 2018 as compared to a decrease of $7.0 million in 2017 due to the release of post-retirement obligations to a former director as well as the completion of certain capital projects.  Operating activities generated cash of $30.8 million during fiscal 2017 as compared with $28.5 million of cash provided during fiscal 2016. Net income decreased by $1.4 million from 2016 to 2017; however, cash provided by operations increased by $2.3 million due primarily to the following factors:\n \u2022 Net income for 2017 included a non-cash equity in loss from AMAK of $4.3 million as compared to a non-cash equity in loss from AMAK of $1.5 million and a $3.2 million gain from additional equity issuance by AMAK in 2016; \n \u2022 Net income for 2016 included a non-cash bargain purchase gain from the B Plant acquisition of $11.5 million as compared to 2017 which had no gain; \n \u2022 Net income for 2017 included a non-cash depreciation and amortization charge of $11.0 million as compared to 2016 which included a non-cash depreciation and amortization charge of $9.8 million; \n \u2022 Accounts payable and accrued liabilities increased $7.0 million in 2017 (primarily due to increased construction expenditures) as compared to an increase of $3.2 million in 2016 (also primarily due to construction projects); \n \u2022 Prepaid expenses and other assets increased $0.8 million in 2017 (primarily due to the inventorying of spares parts) as compared to an increase of $1.0 million in 2016 (primarily due to license fees for the Advanced Reformer unit being constructed); and \n \u2022 Inventory increased $0.6 million in 2017 (primarily due to an increase in deferred sales which increases inventory in transit) as compared to an increase of $2.1 million in 2016 (due to lower sales volume).  These significant sources of cash were partially offset by the following decreases in cash provided by operations:\n \u2022 Net income for 2017 included non-cash deferred income tax liability of $5.8 million as compared to non-cash deferred income tax benefit of $8.7 million in 2016; \n \u2022 Income taxes receivable increased $1.6 million in 2017 (primarily due to federal and state claims filed for research and development credits and carryback claims) as compared to an decrease of $3.7 million in 2016 (primarily due to overpayments being applied to 2016 estimated taxes); and \n \u2022 Trade receivables increased $3.6 million in 2017 (primarily due to an increase in the average selling price) as compared to an increase of $2.8 million in 2016 (due to an increase in wax sales in December and longer payment terms for some foreign customers because of increased shipping times);  Investing Activities\nCash used by investing activities during fiscal 2018 was approximately $19.9 million, representing a decrease of approximately $31.8 million compared to fiscal 2017. The majority of the decrease was due to the completion of construction projects for the Advanced Reformer unit. During 2018, major capital expenditures included $14.9 million to complete the Advanced Reformer unit, which includes $1 million insurance deductible related to the February 2018 fire and $3 million for the catalyst replacement in December 2018, $1.3 million for a rail spur addition at SHR and 0.5 million for a loading rack at SHR.\nCash used by investing activities during fiscal 2017 was approximately $51.7 million, representing an increase of approximately $11.2 million over the corresponding period of 2016. The majority of the increase was due to the construction projects for the hydrogenation/distillation unit and the Advanced Reformer unit. During 2017, we expended $10.8 million on the hydrogenation/distillation project, $0.9 million to upgrade B Plant, $32.5 million to construct the Advanced Reformer unit, $1.9 million for railspur addition, $1.0 million for additional tankage and upgrades to existing tankage, $0.9 million for transport trucks, and $3.7 million on various plant improvements and equipment.\nFinancing Activities\nCash provided by financing activities during fiscal 2018 was approximately $3.7 million versus cash provided of $15.5 million during fiscal 2017. During 2018, we increased our line of credit and consolidated our acquisition and term loans. We made principal payments of $15.4 million on our term debt. We drew $18.2 million on our revolving line of credit, primarily to fund our capital projects. See Note 12 for additional discussion on long-term debt.\nCash provided by financing activities during fiscal 2017 was approximately $15.5 million versus cash provided of $1.8 million during the corresponding period of 2016. During 2017 we made principal payments of $8.7 million on our acquisition loan and $1.7 million on our term debt. We drew $26.0 million on our line of credit primarily to fund our capital projects.\nCredit Agreement\nIn October 2014, TOCCO, SHR, GSPL and TC (SHR, GSPL and TC collectively the Guarantors\u201d) entered into an amended and restated credit agreement (as amended to the date hereof, the ARC Agreement\u201d), which originally provided (i) a revolving credit facility (which we refer to herein as the Revolving Facility\u201d) with revolving commitments of $40.0 million and (ii) term loan borrowings consisting of (A) a $70.0 million single advance term loan incurred to partially finance the acquisition of TC (which we refer to as the acquisition loan\u201d) and (B) a $25.0 multiple advance term loan facility for which borrowing availability ended on December 31, 2015 (which we collectively refer to herein as the Term Loan Facility\u201d and, together with the Revolving Facility, the Credit Facilities\u201d).\nOnly July 31, 2018, TOCCO and the Guarantors entered into a Fourth Amendment to the ARC Agreement (the Fourth Amendment\u201d) pursuant to which the revolving commitments under the Revolving Facility were increased to $75.0 million. Pursuant to the Fourth Amendment, total borrowings under the Term Loan Facility were increased to $87.5 million under a single combined term loan, which comprised new term loan borrowings together with approximately $60.4 million of previously outstanding term loans under the Term Loan Facility. The $60.4 million of previously outstanding term loans included the remaining outstanding balances on the Acquisition loan and the multiple advance term loan facility described above. Proceeds of the new borrowings under the Term Loan Facility were used to repay a portion of the outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Facility and pay fees and expenses of the transaction. As of December 31, 2018, we had $18 million in borrowings outstanding under the Revolving Facility and $84.5 million in borrowings outstanding under the Term Loan Facility. In addition, we had the ability to borrow an additional approximately $18 million under our Revolving Facility at December 31, 2018. TOCCO's ability to make additional borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility at December 31, 2018 was limited by, and in the future may continue to be limited by, our obligation to maintain compliance with the covenants contained in the ARC Agreement (including maintenance of a maximum Consolidated Leverage Ratio and minimum Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio (each as defined in the ARC Agreement)).\nThe maturity date for the ARC Agreement is July 31, 2023. Subject to the lenders acceptance of any increased commitment and other conditions, we have the option, at any time, to request an increase to the commitment under the Revolving Facility and/or the Term Loan Facility by an additional amount of up to $50.0 million in the aggregate.\nBorrowings under each of the Credit Facilities bear interest on the outstanding principal amount at a rate equal to LIBOR plus an applicable margin of 1.25% to 2.50% or, at our option, the Base Rate plus an applicable margin of 0.25% to 1.50%, in each case, with the applicable margin being determined based on the Consolidated Leverage Ratio of TOCCO. A commitment fee between 0.20% and 0.375% is also payable quarterly on the unused portion of the Revolving Facility. For 2018, the effective interest rate for the Credit Facilities was 4.19%. Borrowings under the Term Loan Facility are subject to quarterly amortization payments based on a commercial style amortization method over a twenty year period; provided, that the final principal installment will be paid on the maturity date and will be in an amount equal to the outstanding borrowings under the Term Loan Facility on such date.\nPursuant to the terms of the ARC Agreement, TOCCO must maintain a maximum Consolidated Leverage Ratio of 4.75 to 1.00 for the four fiscal quarters ended December 31, 2018, 4.25 to 1.00 for the four fiscal quarters ended March 31, 2019, 4.00 to 1.00 for the four fiscal quarters ended June 30, 2019 and 3.75 to 1.00 for the four fiscal quarters ended September 30, 2019. For the four fiscal quarters ended December 31, 2019 and each fiscal quarter thereafter, TOCCO must maintain a Consolidated Leverage Ratio of 3.50 to 1.00 (subject to temporary increase following certain acquisitions). Additionally, TOCCO must maintain a minimum Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio as of the end of any fiscal quarter of 1.15 to 1.00.\nThe ARC Agreement contains, among other things, other customary covenants, including restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness, the granting of additional liens, the making of investments, the disposition of assets and other fundamental changes, transactions with affiliates and the declaration of dividends and other restricted payments. The ARC Agreement further includes customary representations and warranties and events of default, and upon occurrence of such events of default the outstanding obligations under the ARC Agreement may be accelerated and become immediately due and payable and the commitment of the\nlenders to make loans under the ARC Agreement may be terminated. We were in compliance with all covenants at December 31, 2018.\nAnticipated Cash Needs\nWe believe that the Company is capable of supporting its operating requirements and capital expenditures through internally generated funds supplemented with borrowings under our Credit Facilities.\nResults of Operations\nComparison of Years 2018, 2017, 2016\nThe tables containing financial and operating information set forth below are presented to facilitate the discussion of the results of operations, and should not be considered a substitute for, and should be read in conjunction with, the audited consolidated financial statements.\nSpecialty Petrochemical Segment\n\n*Included in cost of sales\n**Includes $8,333 and $5,586 for 2018 and 2017 which is included in cost of sales and operating expenses\n\n*Included in cost of sales\n**Includes $5,586 and $5,187 for 2017 and 2016 which is included in cost of sales and operating expenses\nGross Revenue\n2017-2018\nRevenues increased from 2017 to 2018 by approximately 18.7% due to an increase in specialty petrochemical sales volume and an increase in average selling prices.\n2016-2017\nRevenues increased from 2016 to 2017 by approximately 15.6% due to an increase in sales volume of 9.1% and an increase in average selling price of 7.7% partially offset by a decrease in processing fees of 21.7%.\nSpecialty Petrochemical Product Sales\n2017-2018\nSpecialty petrochemical product sales increased 19.3% from 2017 to 2018 due to an increase in total sales volume of 7.6% and an increase in average selling price of 10.9%. Our average selling price increased partly because of higher feedstock costs. A large portion of our prime products sales are contracted with pricing formulas which are tied to prior month Natural Gasoline prices which is our primary feedstock. Average delivered feedstock price for 2018 was 21.1% higher than 2017 as Natural Gasoline prices rose with crude oil prices for most of the year but then declined sharply in the fourth quarter. The increase in average selling prices was also due to higher non-formula pricing for our prime products. Additionally, prices for byproducts in 2018 were about 24% higher than in 2017 due to higher prices for the components in our byproducts stream. This also contributed to higher overall selling prices. Byproduct prices fell significantly during the fourth quarter due to the Advanced Reformer outage and inability to upgrade byproducts. Additionally, in the fourth quarter byproduct prices fell faster than feedstock prices resulting in negative margins.\nPrime product sales volume (total specialty petrochemical product sales volume less byproduct sales volume) increased 8.5% from 2017 to 2018 as demand was greater in all of our end-use markets and especially in the Canadian oil sands market. Sales to the Canadian oil sands market continues to be volatile. We believe the volatility in demand is primarily based on continued manufacturing efficiencies at customer sites and by the crude oil pricing environment. Margins on our specialty petrochemical products continued to be negatively impacted by shortfall fees that we incurred due to feedstock purchases below minimum amounts as prescribed by our agreement with suppliers. However the amount of the penalties in 2018 were significantly less than 2017.\nForeign sales volume accounted for approximately 25.5% of volume and 27.6% of revenue for specialty petrochemical product sales during 2018 as compared to 20.4% of volume and 23.3% of revenue during 2017. The increase in foreign sales volume was\ndue to higher demand in the Canadian oils sands market. Excluding oil sands, foreign sales volumes in 2018 grew by 22% from 2017.\n2016-2017\nSpecialty petrochemical product sales increased 17.5% from 2016 to 2017 due to an increase in total sales volume of 9.1% and an increase in average selling price of 7.7%. Our average selling price increased partly because a large portion of our sales are contracted with pricing formulas which are tied to prior month Natural Gasoline prices which is our primary feedstock. Average delivered feedstock price for 2017 was 17.8% higher than 2016. Additionally, prices for byproducts were about 17% higher than in 2016 which also contributed to higher overall selling prices. Prime product sales volume (total specialty petrochemical product sales volume less byproduct sales volume) increased 9.5% from 2016 to 2017 primarily due to higher demand across many of our end-use markets. Sales to the Canadian oil sands market were down from 2016 due to the continued downturn in that market. Margins on our specialty petrochemical products continued to be negatively impacted by shortfall fees that we incurred due to feedstock purchases below minimum amounts as prescribed by our agreement with suppliers. The amount of the penalties in 2017 was approximately the same as in 2016.\nForeign sales volume accounted for approximately 20.4% of volume and 23.3% of revenue for specialty petrochemical product sales during 2017 as compared to 22.7% of volume and 26.3% of revenue during 2016. The decline in foreign sales volume was due to lower demand in the Canadian oils sands market. Excluding oil sands, foreign sales volumes in 2017 grew by 8.1% from 2016.\nProcessing Fees\n2017-2018\nProcessing fee were approximately flat from 2017 to 2018.\n2016-2017\nProcessing fees decreased 21.7% from 2016 to 2017 primarily due to a reduction in fees associated with a customer who reimbursed us for installation expenses plus a markup. We were successful in negotiating a contract extension with one of our processing customers whose contract was set to expire at the end of 2017.\nCost of Sales (includes but is not limited to raw materials, total operating expense, natural gas, operating labor and transportation)\n2017-2018\nCost of Sales increased 32.3% from 2017 to 2018 due to higher raw material costs, higher operating expense and the increase in sales volume. Our average delivered feedstock cost per gallon increased approximately 21% over 2017 and volume processed increased about 8%. We use natural gasoline as our feedstock which is the heavier liquid remaining after ethane, propane and butanes are removed from liquids produced by natural gas wells. The material is a commodity product in the oil/petrochemical markets and generally is readily available. The price of natural gasoline is well correlated with the price of crude oil. With the start up and stable operation of our Advanced Reformer unit we continue to convert the lower value components in our feed into higher value products, thereby allowing us to sell our byproducts at higher prices than would be realized without the Advanced Reformer unit.\n2016-2017\nCost of Sales increased 15.8% from 2016 to 2017 primarily due to the increase in sales volume and higher raw material costs. Our average delivered feedstock cost per gallon increased 17.8% over 2016 and volume processed increased 10.0%. We use natural gasoline as feedstock which is the heavier liquid remaining after ethane, propane and butanes are removed from liquids produced by natural gas wells. The material is a commodity product in the oil/petrochemical markets and generally is readily available.\nTotal Operating Expense (includes but is not limited to natural gas, operating labor, depreciation, and transportation)\n2017-2018\nTotal Operating Expense increased 24.4% from 2017 to 2018 resulting in a $14.4 million increase 2017. The key drivers for the increase were transportation costs, operating labor and depreciation. Transportation costs increased due to higher sales volume, higher rail freight rates and other logistics costs. Operating labor costs were higher due to higher maintenance and contract labor costs primarily associated with the start-up of the Advanced Reformer unit, maintenance and repair costs associated with a toll processing unit and other maintenance activities. Approximately 12.8% of our labor costs were capitalized in 2018 primarily due to the construction of the Advanced Reformer unit; whereas, in 2017 approximately 28% was capitalized.\nWe implemented a reorganization and workforce reduction at our Silsbee, Texas facility which reduced the workforce by about 20% at the end of 2018. We expect to realize approximately $2.5 million in annual cost savings as a result of this action. We took a charge of approximately $0.4 million for severance related to this action.\nNatural gas expense increased 14.9% from 2017 to 2018 due to an increase in the average per unit cost and volume consumed. Consumption was greater than in 2017 both due to higher sales volume and inefficiencies related to the start-up and operation issues with the Advanced Reformer unit. The average price per MMBTU for 2018 was up about 3.8% from 2017 while volume consumed increased to approximately 1,684,000 MMBTU from about 1,509,000 MMBTU.\n2016-2017\nTotal Operating Expense increased 0.3% from 2016 to 2017. Natural gas, labor, and transportation are the largest individual expenses in this category; however, not all of these increased.\nNatural gas expense increased 48.8% from 2016 to 2017 due to an increase in the average per unit cost and volume consumed. The average price per MMBTU for 2017 was $3.24 whereas, for 2016 the average per unit cost was $2.61. Volume consumed increased to approximately 1,509,000 MMBTU from about 1,294,000 MMBTU.\nLabor costs declined 3.0% from 2016 to 2017 despite a 3.8% increase in headcount from year end 2016 to year end 2017. Approximately 19.9% of our labor costs were capitalized in 2017 due to the construction of the Advanced Reformer unit; whereas, in 2016 approximately 12.0% was capitalized.\nTransportation costs were higher by 4.7% primarily due to the increase in sales volume.\nGeneral and Administrative Expense\n2017-2018\nGeneral and Administrative costs increased 11.4% from 2017 to 2018 primarily due to restructuring and severance costs in 2018. There were no restructuring and severance expenses in 2017.\n2016-2017\nGeneral and Administrative costs increased 11.7% from 2016 to 2017 primarily due to an increase in property taxes because of the expiration of abatements. Group insurance and administrative labor costs also increased.\nDepreciation\n2017-2018\nDepreciation expense increased 41.6% or approximately $2.6 million from 2017 to 2018 primarily due to the start-up of the Advanced Reformer unit and the resulting increase of our depreciable base.\n2016-2017\nDepreciation expense increased 8.3% from 2016 to 2017 primarily due to 2016 capital expenditures increasing our depreciable base.\nCapital Expenditures\n2017-2018\nCapital expenditures in 2018 declined $15.1 million from 2017 mostly due to the completion of the Advanced Reformer unit. See discussion under \"Capital Resources and Requirements\" below for more detail.\n2016-2017\nCapital expenditures increased 63.7% from 2016 to 2017. See discussion under \"Capital Resources and Requirements\" below for more detail.\nSpecialty Wax Segment\n\n*Includes $5,285 and $4,503 for 2017 and 2016, respectively, which is included in cost of sales\n\n*Includes $4,503 and $3,828 for 2017 and 2016, respectively, which is included in cost of sales\nProduct Sales\n2017-2018\nProduct sales revenue increased 13.4% and product sales volume increased 5.3% from 2017 to 2018 primarily due to higher on-purpose PE wax sales which benefited from continued growth in growth in our high value waxes. Polyethylene wax sales saw volume increases of 3.5% and revenue from polyethylene wax increased approximately 15.4% both as a result of greater sales volume and a higher value sales mix. Average wax sales price was approximately 9% higher in 2018 compared to 2017.\n2016-2017\nProduct sales revenue increased 17.2% and product sales volume increased 4.4% from 2016 to 2017 primarily due to on-purpose PE wax sales which we were distributing in Latin America for a third party as well as, significant growth in our high value waxes. Polyethylene wax sales saw volume increases of 1.3% and revenue increases of 12.8%.\nProcessing Fees\n2017-2018\nProcessing fees increased 2.7% from 2017 to 2018 primarily due to greater revenues from hydrogenation/distillation unit. Growth in custom processing revenue in 2018 continued to be hampered by operational and reliability issues especially related to the hydrogenation/distillation unit which started up in the second half of 2017.\n2016-2017\nProcessing fees increased 8.9% from 2016 to 2017 primarily due to the addition of new customers and an increase in existing customer volumes. Growth was limited by significant operational issues in existing equipment and in the new hydrogenation/distillation unit.\nCost of Sales\n2017-2018\nCost of Sales increased 5.7% from 2017 to 2018 due to increases in labor, maintenance, utilities and depreciation which were partially offset by lower wax material costs. Labor increased approximately due to increased overtime and the addition of personnel to support the new hydrogenation/distillation unit which came on line in 2017 as well as to support other custom processing projects. Maintenance costs increased primarily as a result of the start-up of hydrogenation/distillation and the related operating issues in 2018. Utility costs increased mainly due to greater consumption.\n2016-2017\nCost of Sales increased 30.5% from 2016 to 2017 due to increases in material cost, labor, freight, equipment maintenance, and natural gas utilities. Material cost increased primarily due to material costs associated with the on-purpose PE wax sales we distributed into Latin America for a third party. Labor increased due to increased overtime and the addition of personnel to operate the new hydrogenation/distillation unit when it came online in 2017. Freight increased due to the increase in shipments and a change in our shipping terms. We now ship most products with destination terms. Equipment maintenance increased primarily due to the addition of B Plant and the introduction of new custom processing projects. Natural gas utilities increased due to an increase in the per unit cost and in volume consumed because of B Plant and the new hydrogenation/distillation unit.\nGeneral and Administrative Expense\n2017-2018\nGeneral and Administrative costs increased 2.5% from 2017 to 2018.\n2016-2017\nGeneral and Administrative costs increased 2.3% from 2016 to 2017 primarily due to an increase in sales personnel, property taxes, and property insurance due to the addition of B Plant.\nDepreciation and Amortization\n2017-2018\nDepreciation and amortization increased 17.1% from 2017 to 2018 primarily due to start up of the hydrogenation/distillation project in the second half of 2017.\n2016-2017\nDepreciation and amortization increased 17.4% from 2016 to 2017 primarily due to the addition of B Plant and the hydrogenation/distillation project coming online in 2017.\nCapital Expenditures\n2017-2018\nCapital expenditures decreased from approximately $14.0 million to $2.9 million or 79.6% from 2017 to 2018 primarily due to the completion and of the hydrogenation/distillation project in 2017.\n2016-2017\nCapital expenditures decreased 20.1% from 2016 to 2017 primarily due to the completion of the hydrogenation/distillation project in 2017.\nCorporate Segment\n\n\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\n2017-2018\nGeneral corporate expenses increased from 2017 to 2018 primarily due to restructuring and severance expenses, offset by the cancellation and reversal of stock compensation expense and other post retirement benefits awarded to Mr. Hatem El Khalidi. See Note 14 for further discussion.\n2016-2017\nGeneral corporate expenses increased from 2016 to 2017 primarily due to an increase in officer compensation, accounting fees, and legal fees. Officer compensation increased in 2017 due to the addition of an officer in late 2016 and and an accrual for executive bonuses. Accounting and legal fees increased due to additional time required for restatements issues and other matters.\nEquity in Losses of AMAK/Gain on Equity Issuance of AMAK\n2017-2018\nEquity in Losses of AMAK decreased 78.9% from 2017 to 2018 due to a number of reasons as discussed below.\nThe mine was fully operational in 2018 as compared to operating on an improving basis throughout 2017. In 2017 costs were increased as the mine was not operating at full capacity. Metal prices remained strong in 2018.\nShipments increased 105% from 2017 to 2018 as indicated in the table below. AMAK volumes in dry metric tons (dmt) for 2018 and 2017 were as follows:\n\n2016-2017\nEquity in Losses of AMAK increased 188.1% from 2016 to 2017 due to a number of reasons as discussed below.\nThe mine operated on an improving basis throughout 2017 while operations were closed for almost all of 2016. However, in 2017 because the mine was not operating at full capacity but was working toward that goal, costs increased. Also, 2016 was positively affected by the settlement from certain liabilities. Metal prices were strong in 2017 with zinc prices hitting a ten year high during the year. There were no unusual items in 2017.\nCapital Resources and Requirements\n2017-2018\nCapital expenditures decreased 58% from 2017 to 2018. The majority of the decrease was due to completion of the Advanced Reformer unit. During 2018 we expended approximately $14.9 million to complete the Advanced Reformer unit which includes $1 million insurance deductible related to the February 2018 fire and $3 million for the catalyst replacement in December 2018, $1.3 million for a rail spur addition and $0.5 million for a truck loading rack.\n2016-2017\nCapital expenditures increased 27.4% from 2016 to 2017. The majority of the increase was due to the construction projects for the hydrogenation/distillation unit and the Advanced Reformer unit. During 2017 we expended $10.8 million on the hydrogenation/distillation project, $0.9 million to upgrade B Plant, $32.5 million to construct the Advanced Reformer unit, $1.9 million for railspur addition, $1.0 million for additional tankage and upgrades to existing tankage, $0.9 million for transport trucks, and $3.7 million on various plant improvements and equipment.\nAt December 31, 2018, there was approximately $18 million available on the Company's line of credit. We believe that operating cash flows along with credit availability will be sufficient to finance our 2019 operations and capital expenditures.\nThe table below summarizes the following contractual obligations of the Company:\n\nThe majority of our operating lease obligations are for railcars as discussed in Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Purchase obligations are primarily related to commitments for our capital construction projects. The anticipated source of funds for payments due within three years that relate to contractual obligations is from a combination of continuing operations supplemented with borrowings under our credit facility.\nImpact of Inflation\nOur results of operations and financial condition are presented based on historical cost. While it is difficult to accurately measure the impact of inflation, we do not believe the overall effects of inflation, if any, on our results of operations and financial condition have been material.\nInvestment in AMAK\nInformation concerning our investment in AMAK is set forth in Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nNew Accounting Standards\nIn May 2014 the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") issued Accounting Standards Update (\"ASU\") 2014-9, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (\"ASU 2014-9\"). ASU 2014-9 supersedes the revenue recognition requirements of FASB Accounting Standards Codification (\"ASC\") Topic 605, Revenue Recognition and most industry-specific guidance throughout the Accounting Standards Codification, resulting in the creation of FASB ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. ASU 2014-9 requires entities to recognize revenue in a way that depicts the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. This ASU provides alternative methods of retrospective adoption and is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2017. The Company completed its assessment of the impact of the adoption of ASU 2014-9 across all revenue streams. This included reviewing current accounting policies and practices to identify potential differences that would result from applying the requirements under the new standard. We completed contract reviews and validated results of applying the new revenue guidance (Note 2). See Revenue Recognition policy note.\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842). This update will increase transparency and comparability among organizations by recognizing lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements. This update is effective for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. In July 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-11, Targeted Improvements to ASC 842, Leases. ASU 2018-11 provided entities with an alternative modified transition method to elect not to recast the comparative periods presented when adopting ASC 842. The new standard provides a number of optional practical expedients in transition. The Company expects to elect: (1) the \u2018package of practical expedients', which permits it not to reassess under the new standard its prior conclusions about lease identification, lease classification, and initial direct costs and (2) the use-of-hindsight. In addition, the new standard provides practical expedients for an entity's ongoing accounting that the Company anticipates making, such as the (1) the election for certain classes of underlying asset to not separate non-lease components from lease components and (2) the election for short-term lease recognition\nexemption for all leases that qualify. The Company will adopt ASU 842 as of January 1, 2019, using the alternative modified transition method. In preparation of adopting ASC 842, the Company is implementing additional internal controls to enable future preparation of financial information in accordance with ASC 842. The Company has also substantially completed its evaluation of the impact on the Company's lease portfolio. The Company believes the largest impact will be on the consolidated balance sheets for the accounting of facilities-related leases, which represents a majority of its operating leases it has entered into as a lessee. These leases will be recognized under the new standard as right of use assets ( ROU\u201d) operating lease liabilities. The Company will also be required to provide expanded disclosures for its leasing arrangements. As of December 31, 2018, the Company had approximately $18.1 million of undiscounted future minimum operating lease commitments that are not recognized on its consolidated balance sheets as determined under the current standard. For a lessee, the results of operations are not expected to significantly change after adoption of the new standard. While substantially complete, the Company is still in the process of finalizing its evaluation of the effect of ASU 842 on the Company's financial statements and disclosures, including the determination of the Company's incremental borrowing rate for each of the operating leases to estimate the interest rate we would have to pay to borrow on a collateralized basis over a similar term for an amount equal to the lease payments. The Company will finalize its accounting assessment and quantitative impact of the adoption during the first quarter of fiscal year 2019.\nIn January 2017 the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-4, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (Topic 350). The amendments in ASU 2017-4 simplify the measurement of goodwill by eliminating Step 2 from the goodwill impairment test. Instead, under these amendments, an entity should perform its annual, or interim, goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. An entity should recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit's fair value; however, the loss should not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. The amendments are effective for public business entities for the first interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019. Early adoption is permitted for interim or annual goodwill impairment tests performed on testing dates after January 1, 2017.The amendments also eliminate the requirements for any reporting unit with a zero or negative carrying amount to perform a qualitative assessment and, if it fails that qualitative test, to perform Step 2 of the goodwill impairment test. An entity still has the option to perform the qualitative assessment for a reporting unit to determine if the quantitative impairment test is necessary. The Company has goodwill from prior business combination and performs an annual impairment test or more frequently if changes or circumstances occur that would more-likely-than-not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying value. During the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company performed its impairment assessment and determined the fair value of the aggregated reporting units exceed the carrying value, such that the Company's goodwill was not considered impaired. Although the Company cannot anticipate future goodwill impairment assessments, based on the most recent assessment, it is unlikely that an impairment amount would need to be calculated and, therefore, the Company does not anticipate a material impact from these amendments to the Company's financial position and results of operations. The current accounting policies and processes are not anticipated to change, except for the elimination of the Step 2 analysis.\nIn February 2018 the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-2, Income Statement - Reporting Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income. ASU 2018-2 was issued to address the income tax accounting treatment of the stranded tax effects within other comprehensive income due to the prohibition of backward tracing due to an income tax rate change that was initially recorded in other comprehensive income due to the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) on December 22, 2017, which changed the Company's income tax rate from 35% to 21%. The amendments to the ASU changed US GAAP whereby an entity may elect to reclassify the stranded tax effect from accumulated other comprehensive income to retained earnings. The amendments of the ASU may be adopted in total or in part using a full retrospective or modified retrospective method. The amendments of the ASU are effective for periods beginning after December 15, 2018. The Company believes there will be no material impact to the consolidated financial statements as a result of this update.\nIn June 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-07, Improvements to Nonemployee Share-Based Payment Accounting. ASU 2018-07 simplifies the accounting for share-based payments to nonemployees by aligning it with the accounting for share-based payments to employees, with certain exceptions. The amendments in this ASU are effective for public companies for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within that fiscal year. The Company is assessing the effect of ASU 2018-02 on its consolidated financial statements.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nOur consolidated financial statements are based on the selection and application of significant accounting policies. The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of net sales, expenses and allocated charges during the reported period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. However, we are not currently aware of any reasonably likely events or circumstances that would result in materially different results.\nWe believe the following accounting policies and estimates are critical to understanding the financial reporting risks present currently. These matters, and the judgments and uncertainties affecting them, are essential to understanding our reported results. See Note 2 to the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.\nInventories\nFinished products and feedstock are recorded at the lower of cost, determined on the first-in, first-out method (\"FIFO\"); or market for SHR. For TC, inventory is recorded at the lower of cost or market as follows: (1) raw material cost is calculated using the weighted-average cost method and (2) product inventory cost is calculated using the specific cost method. See Note 7 to the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.\nBeginning January 1, 2017, due to expansion of our plant assets at SHR and TC, we began inventorying spare parts for the repair and maintenance of our plant, pipeline and equipment.\nRevenue recognition\nThe Company adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") Accounting Standards Codification (\"ASC\") Topic 606 (\"ASC 606\"), Revenue from Contracts with Customers, and its amendments with a date of the initial application of January 1, 2018. As a result, the Company has changed its accounting policy for revenue recognition as detailed below. ASC 606 outlines a single comprehensive model for an entity to use in accounting for revenue arising from all contracts with customers, except where revenues are in scope of another accounting standard. ASC 606 superseded the revenue recognition requirements in ASC Topic 605, \"Revenue Recognition\", and most industry specific guidance. ASC Topic 606 sets forth a five-step model for determining when and how revenue is recognized. Under the model, an entity is required to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to a customer at an amount reflecting the consideration it expects to receive in exchange for those goods and services. ASC 606 also requires certain additional revenue-related disclosures.\nThe Company applied the modified retrospective approach under ASC 606 which allows for the cumulative effect of adopting the new guidance on the date of initial application. Use of the modified retrospective approach means the Company's comparative periods prior to initial application are not restated. The initial application was applied to all contracts at the date of the initial application. The Company has determined that the adjustments using the modified retrospective approach did not have a material impact on the date of the initial application along with the disclosure of the effect on prior periods.\nAccounting Policy\nBeginning on January 1, 2018, revenue is measured based on a consideration specified in a contract with a customer. The Company recognizes revenue when it satisfies a performance obligation by transferring control over a product or service to a customer. In evaluating when a customer has control of the asset we primarily consider whether the transfer of legal title and physical delivery has occurred, whether the customer has significant risks and rewards of ownership, and whether the customer has accepted delivery and a right to payment exists. Taxes assessed by a governmental authority that are both imposed on and concurrent with a specific revenue-producing transaction, that are collected by the Company from a customer, are excluded from revenue. Shipping and handling costs associated with outbound freight after control over a product has transferred to a customer are accounted for as a fulfillment cost and are included in cost of product sales and processing. The Company does not offer material rights of return or service-type warranties.\nFor 2017 the Company recognized revenue according to FASB ASC Topic 605 (\"ASC 605\"), \"Revenue Recognition\", when: (1) the customer accepted delivery of the product and title had been transferred or when the service was performed and the Company had no significant obligations remaining to be performed; (2) a final understanding as to specific nature and terms of the agreed upon transaction had occurred; (3) price was fixed and determinable; and (4) collection was assured. Product sales generally met these criteria, and revenue was recognized, when the product was delivered or title was transferred to the customer. Sales revenue was presented net of discounts, allowances, and sales taxes. Freight costs billed to customers were recorded as a component of revenue. Revenues received in advance of future sales of products or prior to the performance of services were presented as deferred revenues. Shipping and handling costs were classified as cost of product sales and processing and were expensed as incurred.\nNature of goods and services\nThe following is a description of principal activities - separated by reportable segments - from which the Company generates its revenue. For more detailed information about reportable segments, disaggregation of revenues, and contract balance disclosures, see Note 17.\nSpecialty petrochemical segment\nThe specialty petrochemical segment of the Company produces eight high purity hydrocarbons and other petroleum based products including isopentane, normal pentane, isohexane and hexane. These products are used in the production of polyethylene, packaging,\npolypropylene, expandable polystyrene, poly-iso/urethane foams, crude oil from the Canadian tar sands, and in the catalyst support industry. SHR's specialty petrochemical products are typically transported to customers by rail car, tank truck, iso-container and ship.\nProduct Sales - The Company sells individual (distinct) products to its customers on a stand-alone basis (point-of-sale) without any further integration. There is no significant modification of any one or more products sold to fulfill another promised product or service within any of the Company's product sale transactions. The amount of consideration received for product sales is stated within the executed invoice with the customer. Payment is typically due and collected 30 to 60 days subsequent to point of sale.\nProcessing Fees - The Company's services consist of processing customer supplied feedstocks into custom products including, if requested, services for forming, packaging, and arranging shipping.

Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and we undertake no obligation to update them in light of new information or future events.\nOverview\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial results, as well as the accompanying consolidated financial statements and related notes to consolidated financial statements to which they refer, are the responsibility of the management of the Company. Our accounting and financial reporting fairly reflect our business model involving the manufacturing and marketing of specialty petrochemical products and specialty waxes. Our business model involves the manufacture and sale of tangible products and providing custom processing services. Our consistent approach to providing high purity products and quality services to our customers has helped to sustain our current position as a preferred supplier of various specialty petrochemical products.\nBusiness Environment and Risk Assessment\nWe believe we are well-positioned to participate in the US chemical industry growth driven by new investments and overall economic growth. While petrochemical prices are volatile on a short-term basis and depend on the demand of our customers' products, our investment decisions are based on our long-term business outlook using a disciplined approach in selecting and pursuing the most attractive investment opportunities.\nSpecialty Petrochemical Operations\nSHR's worldwide specialty petrochemical demand increased during 2018 compared to 2017. Product sales revenue increased 19.3% driven primarily by volume growth of 7.6%. Overall product prices also increased compared to 2017 primarily due to higher feedstock costs in 2018 compared to 2017. We continued to emphasize our competitive advantages achieved through our high quality products and outstanding customer service and responsiveness. We are also focused on improving operations and plant reliability.\nDuring 2018 feedstock prices were about 24%, or $0.28 per gallon, higher than 2017 reflecting higher crude oil prices. After steadily increasing for most of 2018 feedstock prices declined sharply in the fourth quarter of 2018. About 60% of our prime products are sold under formula pricing whereby feedstock costs are passed along to the customer typically with a one month lag. Thus, when feedstock prices start rising, we experience lower margins as formula pricing lags feedstock costs. During most of 2018 prime products margins were pressured due to rising feedstock costs and as a result of greater competitive pricing pressure on prime products sales that are based on non-formula pricing. Our byproduct margins were under pressure in the fourth quarter due to the Advanced Reformer outage as we sold byproducts at prices below the cost of feedstock.\nSpecialty Wax Operations\nMost wax markets are mature. Key applications for our polyethylene waxes are in hot melt adhesives (\"HMA\"), plastic processing, PVC lubricants and inks, paints and coatings, where they act as surface or rheology modifiers. The HMA market is expected to grow at a higher rate than GDP growth due to growth in the developing markets and increases in packaging requirements due to changes in consumer purchasing (shift to home deliveries via the internet) in developed economies. Road marking paints are also expected to grow at rates exceeding GDP growth based upon an expectation that there will be infrastructure investment in the U.S. The PVC market is expected to grow at GDP rates; however, we expect to get more traction of our products within this market with acceptance of our new PVC grade waxes. The global wax market is benefiting from the reduction of paraffin wax availability from large refiners as they move toward more hydrocracking and hydroisomerization to produce group III lube oils and distillate. Our wax sales volume increased approximately 5% in 2018 from 2017 while revenues increased approximately 13%.\nRestructuring and Severance Impact\nDuring 2018, the Company incurred restructuring and severance expenses of $2.3 million which are included in General and Administrative Expenses. These expenses are primarily attributable to the termination of certain executives during 2018 as part of the restructuring of executive management and to the reduction in the workforce at our Silsbee, Texas facility in December 2018. These expenses relate to severance, stock compensation for continued vesting of time-vested shares issued under the Company's long-term incentive plan, and certain employee benefits including medical insurance and vacation. As of December 31, 2018, approximately $1.1 million had been incurred, and an additional liability of $1.2 million was accrued related to future benefits.\nHurricane Harvey Impact\nThe financial impact of Hurricane Harvey to our company was significant. Harvey made landfall on the Texas Gulf Coast on August 25, 2017, and affected operations at both SHR and TC. We estimated the total negative impact to 2017 EBITDA ranged from approximately $1.5 million to $1.8 million. This included expenses related to generator rentals, overtime labor, and maintenance and repairs of approximately $0.7 million. This estimate also included lost sales due to outages at customer and supplier facilities. Neither of our facilities suffered any significant damage.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWorking Capital\nOur approximate working capital days are summarized as follows:\nTable 53: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>December 31, 2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Days sales outstanding in accounts receivable\n</td> <td>34.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>38.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>38.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Days sales outstanding in inventory\n</td> <td>21.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>27.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>30.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Days sales outstanding in accounts payable\n</td> <td>24.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>27.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>22.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Days of working capital\n</td> <td>31.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>38.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>45.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur days sales outstanding in accounts receivable remained steady from 2016 to 2017 but decreased from 2017 to 2018 due to greater increase in sales revenue relative to the increase in receivables.\nOur days sales outstanding in inventory decreased from 2017 to 2018 due to a planned reduction in inventory at TC.\nOur days sales outstanding in accounts payable decreased due to a decrease in payables because of the completion of certain capital construction projects at SHR.\nSources and Uses of Cash\nCash and cash equivalents increased by $3.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2018. The change in cash and cash equivalents is summarized as follows:\nTable 54: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by (used in)\n</td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating activities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>19,895\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>30,828\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>28,514\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investing activities\n</td> <td>(19,871\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(51,691\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(40,509\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Financing activities\n</td> <td>3,683\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15,502\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,761\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Increase (decrease) in cash and equivalents\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,707\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(5,361\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(10,234\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,735\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,028\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8,389\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating Activities\nOperating activities generated cash of $19.9 million during fiscal 2018 as compared with $30.8 million of cash provided during fiscal 2017. Net income decreased by $20.3 million and cash provided by operations decreased by $10.9 million from 2017 to 2018 due primarily to the following factors:\n \u2022 Net income for 2018 included a non-cash depreciation and amortization charge of $14.4 million as compared to 2017 which included a non-cash depreciation and amortization charge of $11.0 million; \n \u2022 Net income for 2018 included non-cash deferred income tax liability of $1.6 million as compared to non-cash deferred income tax liability of $5.8 million in 2017; \n \u2022 Trade receivables decreased $1.5 million in 2018 as compared to an decrease of $3.6 million in 2017; \n \u2022 Income taxes receivable decreased $5.4 million in 2018 (primarily due to collection of federal and state research and development credits, carryback claims, and refunds of tax payments on deposit) as compared to an increase of $1.6 million in 2017 (primarily due to federal and state research and development credits and carryback claims); and \n \u2022 Inventory decreased $1.9 million in 2018 as compared to an increase of $0.6 million in 2017.  These significant sources of cash were partially offset by the following decreases in cash provided by operations:\n \u2022 Net income for 2018 included a non-cash equity in loss from AMAK of $0.9 million as compared to a non-cash equity in loss from AMAK of $4.3 million in 2017; and \n \u2022 Accounts payable and accrued liabilities decreased $2.2 million in 2018 as compared to a decrease of $7.0 million in 2017 due to the release of post-retirement obligations to a former director as well as the completion of certain capital projects.  Operating activities generated cash of $30.8 million during fiscal 2017 as compared with $28.5 million of cash provided during fiscal 2016. Net income decreased by $1.4 million from 2016 to 2017; however, cash provided by operations increased by $2.3 million due primarily to the following factors:\n \u2022 Net income for 2017 included a non-cash equity in loss from AMAK of $4.3 million as compared to a non-cash equity in loss from AMAK of $1.5 million and a $3.2 million gain from additional equity issuance by AMAK in 2016; \n \u2022 Net income for 2016 included a non-cash bargain purchase gain from the B Plant acquisition of $11.5 million as compared to 2017 which had no gain; \n \u2022 Net income for 2017 included a non-cash depreciation and amortization charge of $11.0 million as compared to 2016 which included a non-cash depreciation and amortization charge of $9.8 million; \n \u2022 Accounts payable and accrued liabilities increased $7.0 million in 2017 (primarily due to increased construction expenditures) as compared to an increase of $3.2 million in 2016 (also primarily due to construction projects); \n \u2022 Prepaid expenses and other assets increased $0.8 million in 2017 (primarily due to the inventorying of spares parts) as compared to an increase of $1.0 million in 2016 (primarily due to license fees for the Advanced Reformer unit being constructed); and \n \u2022 Inventory increased $0.6 million in 2017 (primarily due to an increase in deferred sales which increases inventory in transit) as compared to an increase of $2.1 million in 2016 (due to lower sales volume).  These significant sources of cash were partially offset by the following decreases in cash provided by operations:\n \u2022 Net income for 2017 included non-cash deferred income tax liability of $5.8 million as compared to non-cash deferred income tax benefit of $8.7 million in 2016; \n \u2022 Income taxes receivable increased $1.6 million in 2017 (primarily due to federal and state claims filed for research and development credits and carryback claims) as compared to an decrease of $3.7 million in 2016 (primarily due to overpayments being applied to 2016 estimated taxes); and \n \u2022 Trade receivables increased $3.6 million in 2017 (primarily due to an increase in the average selling price) as compared to an increase of $2.8 million in 2016 (due to an increase in wax sales in December and longer payment terms for some foreign customers because of increased shipping times);  Investing Activities\nCash used by investing activities during fiscal 2018 was approximately $19.9 million, representing a decrease of approximately $31.8 million compared to fiscal 2017. The majority of the decrease was due to the completion of construction projects for the Advanced Reformer unit. During 2018, major capital expenditures included $14.9 million to complete the Advanced Reformer unit, which includes $1 million insurance deductible related to the February 2018 fire and $3 million for the catalyst replacement in December 2018, $1.3 million for a rail spur addition at SHR and 0.5 million for a loading rack at SHR.\nCash used by investing activities during fiscal 2017 was approximately $51.7 million, representing an increase of approximately $11.2 million over the corresponding period of 2016. The majority of the increase was due to the construction projects for the hydrogenation/distillation unit and the Advanced Reformer unit. During 2017, we expended $10.8 million on the hydrogenation/distillation project, $0.9 million to upgrade B Plant, $32.5 million to construct the Advanced Reformer unit, $1.9 million for railspur addition, $1.0 million for additional tankage and upgrades to existing tankage, $0.9 million for transport trucks, and $3.7 million on various plant improvements and equipment.\nFinancing Activities\nCash provided by financing activities during fiscal 2018 was approximately $3.7 million versus cash provided of $15.5 million during fiscal 2017. During 2018, we increased our line of credit and consolidated our acquisition and term loans. We made principal payments of $15.4 million on our term debt. We drew $18.2 million on our revolving line of credit, primarily to fund our capital projects. See Note 12 for additional discussion on long-term debt.\nCash provided by financing activities during fiscal 2017 was approximately $15.5 million versus cash provided of $1.8 million during the corresponding period of 2016. During 2017 we made principal payments of $8.7 million on our acquisition loan and $1.7 million on our term debt. We drew $26.0 million on our line of credit primarily to fund our capital projects.\nCredit Agreement\nIn October 2014, TOCCO, SHR, GSPL and TC (SHR, GSPL and TC collectively the Guarantors\u201d) entered into an amended and restated credit agreement (as amended to the date hereof, the ARC Agreement\u201d), which originally provided (i) a revolving credit facility (which we refer to herein as the Revolving Facility\u201d) with revolving commitments of $40.0 million and (ii) term loan borrowings consisting of (A) a $70.0 million single advance term loan incurred to partially finance the acquisition of TC (which we refer to as the acquisition loan\u201d) and (B) a $25.0 multiple advance term loan facility for which borrowing availability ended on December 31, 2015 (which we collectively refer to herein as the Term Loan Facility\u201d and, together with the Revolving Facility, the Credit Facilities\u201d).\nOnly July 31, 2018, TOCCO and the Guarantors entered into a Fourth Amendment to the ARC Agreement (the Fourth Amendment\u201d) pursuant to which the revolving commitments under the Revolving Facility were increased to $75.0 million. Pursuant to the Fourth Amendment, total borrowings under the Term Loan Facility were increased to $87.5 million under a single combined term loan, which comprised new term loan borrowings together with approximately $60.4 million of previously outstanding term loans under the Term Loan Facility. The $60.4 million of previously outstanding term loans included the remaining outstanding balances on the Acquisition loan and the multiple advance term loan facility described above. Proceeds of the new borrowings under the Term Loan Facility were used to repay a portion of the outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Facility and pay fees and expenses of the transaction. As of December 31, 2018, we had $18 million in borrowings outstanding under the Revolving Facility and $84.5 million in borrowings outstanding under the Term Loan Facility. In addition, we had the ability to borrow an additional approximately $18 million under our Revolving Facility at December 31, 2018. TOCCO's ability to make additional borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility at December 31, 2018 was limited by, and in the future may continue to be limited by, our obligation to maintain compliance with the covenants contained in the ARC Agreement (including maintenance of a maximum Consolidated Leverage Ratio and minimum Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio (each as defined in the ARC Agreement)).\nThe maturity date for the ARC Agreement is July 31, 2023. Subject to the lenders acceptance of any increased commitment and other conditions, we have the option, at any time, to request an increase to the commitment under the Revolving Facility and/or the Term Loan Facility by an additional amount of up to $50.0 million in the aggregate.\nBorrowings under each of the Credit Facilities bear interest on the outstanding principal amount at a rate equal to LIBOR plus an applicable margin of 1.25% to 2.50% or, at our option, the Base Rate plus an applicable margin of 0.25% to 1.50%, in each case, with the applicable margin being determined based on the Consolidated Leverage Ratio of TOCCO. A commitment fee between 0.20% and 0.375% is also payable quarterly on the unused portion of the Revolving Facility. For 2018, the effective interest rate for the Credit Facilities was 4.19%. Borrowings under the Term Loan Facility are subject to quarterly amortization payments based on a commercial style amortization method over a twenty year period; provided, that the final principal installment will be paid on the maturity date and will be in an amount equal to the outstanding borrowings under the Term Loan Facility on such date.\nPursuant to the terms of the ARC Agreement, TOCCO must maintain a maximum Consolidated Leverage Ratio of 4.75 to 1.00 for the four fiscal quarters ended December 31, 2018, 4.25 to 1.00 for the four fiscal quarters ended March 31, 2019, 4.00 to 1.00 for the four fiscal quarters ended June 30, 2019 and 3.75 to 1.00 for the four fiscal quarters ended September 30, 2019. For the four fiscal quarters ended December 31, 2019 and each fiscal quarter thereafter, TOCCO must maintain a Consolidated Leverage Ratio of 3.50 to 1.00 (subject to temporary increase following certain acquisitions). Additionally, TOCCO must maintain a minimum Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio as of the end of any fiscal quarter of 1.15 to 1.00.\nThe ARC Agreement contains, among other things, other customary covenants, including restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness, the granting of additional liens, the making of investments, the disposition of assets and other fundamental changes, transactions with affiliates and the declaration of dividends and other restricted payments. The ARC Agreement further includes customary representations and warranties and events of default, and upon occurrence of such events of default the outstanding obligations under the ARC Agreement may be accelerated and become immediately due and payable and the commitment of the\nlenders to make loans under the ARC Agreement may be terminated. We were in compliance with all covenants at December 31, 2018.\nAnticipated Cash Needs\nWe believe that the Company is capable of supporting its operating requirements and capital expenditures through internally generated funds supplemented with borrowings under our Credit Facilities.\nResults of Operations\nComparison of Years 2018, 2017, 2016\nThe tables containing financial and operating

2017 to 2018 by approximately 18.7% due to an increase in specialty petrochemical sales volume and an increase in average selling prices.\n2016-2017\nRevenues increased from 2016 to 2017 by approximately 15.6% due to an increase in sales volume of 9.1% and an increase in average selling price of 7.7% partially offset by a decrease in processing fees of 21.7%.\nSpecialty Petrochemical Product Sales\n2017-2018\nSpecialty petrochemical product sales increased 19.3% from 2017 to 2018 due to an increase in total sales volume of 7.6% and an increase in average selling price of 10.9%. Our average selling price increased partly because of higher feedstock costs. A large portion of our prime products sales are contracted with pricing formulas which are tied to prior month Natural Gasoline prices which is our primary feedstock. Average delivered feedstock price for 2018 was 21.1% higher than 2017 as Natural Gasoline prices rose with crude oil prices for most of the year but then declined sharply in the fourth quarter. The increase in average selling prices was also due to higher non-formula pricing for our prime products. Additionally, prices for byproducts in 2018 were about 24% higher than in 2017 due to higher prices for the components in our byproducts stream. This also contributed to higher overall selling prices. Byproduct prices fell significantly during the fourth quarter due to the Advanced Reformer outage and inability to upgrade byproducts. Additionally, in the fourth quarter byproduct prices fell faster than feedstock prices resulting in negative margins.\nPrime product sales volume (total specialty petrochemical product sales volume less byproduct sales volume) increased 8.5% from 2017 to 2018 as demand was greater in all of our end-use markets and especially in the Canadian oil sands market. Sales to the Canadian oil sands market continues to be volatile. We believe the volatility in demand is primarily based on continued manufacturing efficiencies at customer sites and by the crude oil pricing environment. Margins on our specialty petrochemical products continued to be negatively impacted by shortfall fees that we incurred due to feedstock purchases below minimum amounts as prescribed by our agreement with suppliers. However the amount of the penalties in 2018 were significantly less than 2017.\nForeign sales volume accounted for approximately 25.5% of volume and 27.6% of revenue for specialty petrochemical product sales during 2018 as compared to 20.4% of volume and 23.3% of revenue during 2017. The increase in foreign sales volume was\ndue to higher demand in the Canadian oils sands market. Excluding oil sands, foreign sales volumes in 2018 grew by 22% from 2017.\n2016-2017\nSpecialty petrochemical product sales increased 17.5% from 2016 to 2017 due to an increase in total sales volume of 9.1% and an increase in average selling price of 7.7%. Our average selling price increased partly because a large portion of our sales are contracted with pricing formulas which are tied to prior month Natural Gasoline prices which is our primary feedstock. Average delivered feedstock price for 2017 was 17.8% higher than 2016. Additionally, prices for byproducts were about 17% higher than in 2016 which also contributed to higher overall selling prices. Prime product sales volume (total specialty petrochemical product sales volume less byproduct sales volume) increased 9.5% from 2016 to 2017 primarily due to higher demand across many of our end-use markets. Sales to the Canadian oil sands market were down from 2016 due to the continued downturn in that market. Margins on our specialty petrochemical products continued to be negatively impacted by shortfall fees that we incurred due to feedstock purchases below minimum amounts as prescribed by our agreement with suppliers. The amount of the penalties in 2017 was approximately the same as in 2016.\nForeign sales volume accounted for approximately 20.4% of volume and 23.3% of revenue for specialty petrochemical product sales during 2017 as compared to 22.7% of volume and 26.3% of revenue during 2016. The decline in foreign sales volume was due to lower demand in the Canadian oils sands market. Excluding oil sands, foreign sales volumes in 2017 grew by 8.1% from 2016.\nProcessing Fees\n2017-2018\nProcessing fee were approximately flat from 2017 to 2018.\n2016-2017\nProcessing fees decreased 21.7% from 2016 to 2017 primarily due to a reduction in fees associated with a customer who reimbursed us for installation expenses plus a markup. We were successful in negotiating a contract extension with one of our processing customers whose contract was set to expire at the end of 2017.\nCost of Sales (includes but is not limited to raw materials, total operating expense, natural gas, operating labor and transportation)\n2017-2018\nCost of Sales increased 32.3% from 2017 to 2018 due to higher raw material costs, higher operating expense and the increase in sales volume. Our average delivered feedstock cost per gallon increased approximately 21% over 2017 and volume processed increased about 8%. We use natural gasoline as our feedstock which is the heavier liquid remaining after ethane, propane and butanes are removed from liquids produced by natural gas wells. The material is a commodity product in the oil/petrochemical markets and generally is readily available. The price of natural gasoline is well correlated with the price of crude oil. With the start up and stable operation of our Advanced Reformer unit we continue to convert the lower value components in our feed into higher value products, thereby allowing us to sell our byproducts at higher prices than would be realized without the Advanced Reformer unit.\n2016-2017\nCost of Sales increased 15.8% from 2016 to 2017 primarily due to the increase in sales volume and higher raw material costs. Our average delivered feedstock cost per gallon increased 17.8% over 2016 and volume processed increased 10.0%. We use natural gasoline as feedstock which is the heavier liquid remaining after ethane, propane and butanes are removed from liquids produced by natural gas wells. The material is a commodity product in the oil/petrochemical markets and generally is readily available.\nTotal Operating Expense (includes but is not limited to natural gas, operating labor, depreciation, and transportation)\n2017-2018\nTotal Operating Expense increased 24.4% from 2017 to 2018 resulting in a $14.4 million increase 2017. The key drivers for the increase were transportation costs, operating labor and depreciation. Transportation costs increased due to higher sales volume, higher rail freight rates and other logistics costs. Operating labor costs were higher due to higher maintenance and contract labor costs primarily associated with the start-up of the Advanced Reformer unit, maintenance and repair costs associated with a toll processing unit and other maintenance activities. Approximately 12.8% of our labor costs were capitalized in 2018 primarily due to the construction of the Advanced Reformer unit; whereas, in 2017 approximately 28% was capitalized.\nWe implemented a reorganization and workforce reduction at our Silsbee, Texas facility which reduced the workforce by about 20% at the end of 2018. We expect to realize approximately $2.5 million in annual cost savings as a result of this action. We took a charge of approximately $0.4 million for severance related to this action.\nNatural gas expense increased 14.9% from 2017 to 2018 due to an increase in the average per unit cost and volume consumed. Consumption was greater than in 2017 both due to higher sales volume and inefficiencies related to the start-up and operation issues with the Advanced Reformer unit. The average price per MMBTU for 2018 was up about 3.8% from 2017 while volume consumed increased to approximately 1,684,000 MMBTU from about 1,509,000 MMBTU.\n2016-2017\nTotal Operating Expense increased 0.3% from 2016 to 2017. Natural gas, labor, and transportation are the largest individual expenses in this category; however, not all of these increased.\nNatural gas expense increased 48.8% from 2016 to 2017 due to an increase in the average per unit cost and volume consumed. The average price per MMBTU for 2017 was $3.24 whereas, for 2016 the average per unit cost was $2.61. Volume consumed increased to approximately 1,509,000 MMBTU from about 1,294,000 MMBTU.\nLabor costs declined 3.0% from 2016 to 2017 despite a 3.8% increase in headcount from year end 2016 to year end 2017. Approximately 19.9% of our labor costs were capitalized in 2017 due to the construction of the Advanced Reformer unit; whereas, in 2016 approximately 12.0% was capitalized.\nTransportation costs were higher by 4.7% primarily due to the increase in sales volume.\nGeneral and Administrative Expense\n2017-2018\nGeneral and Administrative costs increased 11.4% from 2017 to 2018 primarily due to restructuring and severance costs in 2018. There were no restructuring and severance expenses in 2017.\n2016-2017\nGeneral and Administrative costs increased 11.7% from 2016 to 2017 primarily due to an increase in property taxes because of the expiration of abatements. Group insurance and administrative labor costs also increased.\nDepreciation\n2017-2018\nDepreciation expense increased 41.6% or approximately $2.6 million from 2017 to 2018 primarily due to the start-up of the Advanced Reformer unit and the resulting increase of our depreciable base.\n2016-2017\nDepreciation expense increased 8.3% from 2016 to 2017 primarily due to 2016 capital expenditures increasing our depreciable base.\nCapital Expenditures\n2017-2018\nCapital expenditures in 2018 declined $15.1 million from 2017 mostly due to the completion of the Advanced Reformer unit. See discussion under \"Capital Resources and Requirements\" below for more detail.\n2016-2017\nCapital expenditures increased 63.7% from 2016 to 2017. See discussion under \"Capital Resources and Requirements\" below for more detail.\nSpecialty Wax Segment\nTable 73: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

Sales\n2017-2018\nProduct sales revenue increased 13.4% and product sales volume increased 5.3% from 2017 to 2018 primarily due to higher on-purpose PE wax sales which benefited from continued growth in growth in our high value waxes. Polyethylene wax sales saw volume increases of 3.5% and revenue from polyethylene wax increased approximately 15.4% both as a result of greater sales volume and a higher value sales mix. Average wax sales price was approximately 9% higher in 2018 compared to 2017.\n2016-2017\nProduct sales revenue increased 17.2% and product sales volume increased 4.4% from 2016 to 2017 primarily due to on-purpose PE wax sales which we were distributing in Latin America for a third party as well as, significant growth in our high value waxes. Polyethylene wax sales saw volume increases of 1.3% and revenue increases of 12.8%.\nProcessing Fees\n2017-2018\nProcessing fees increased 2.7% from 2017 to 2018 primarily due to greater revenues from hydrogenation/distillation unit. Growth in custom processing revenue in 2018 continued to be hampered by operational and reliability issues especially related to the hydrogenation/distillation unit which started up in the second half of 2017.\n2016-2017\nProcessing fees increased 8.9% from 2016 to 2017 primarily due to the addition of new customers and an increase in existing customer volumes. Growth was limited by significant operational issues in existing equipment and in the new hydrogenation/distillation unit.\nCost of Sales\n2017-2018\nCost of Sales increased 5.7% from 2017 to 2018 due to increases in labor, maintenance, utilities and depreciation which were partially offset by lower wax material costs. Labor increased approximately due to increased overtime and the addition of personnel to support the new hydrogenation/distillation unit which came on line in 2017 as well as to support other custom processing projects. Maintenance costs increased primarily as a result of the start-up of hydrogenation/distillation and the related operating issues in 2018. Utility costs increased mainly due to greater consumption.\n2016-2017\nCost of Sales increased 30.5% from 2016 to 2017 due to increases in material cost, labor, freight, equipment maintenance, and natural gas utilities. Material cost increased primarily due to material costs associated with the on-purpose PE wax sales we distributed into Latin America for a third party. Labor increased due to increased overtime and the addition of personnel to operate the new hydrogenation/distillation unit when it came online in 2017. Freight increased due to the increase in shipments and a change in our shipping terms. We now ship most products with destination terms. Equipment maintenance increased primarily due to the addition of B Plant and the introduction of new custom processing projects. Natural gas utilities increased due to an increase in the per unit cost and in volume consumed because of B Plant and the new hydrogenation/distillation unit.\nGeneral and Administrative Expense\n2017-2018\nGeneral and Administrative costs increased 2.5% from 2017 to 2018.\n2016-2017\nGeneral and Administrative costs increased 2.3% from 2016 to 2017 primarily due to an increase in sales personnel, property taxes, and property insurance due to the addition of B Plant.\nDepreciation and Amortization\n2017-2018\nDepreciation and amortization increased 17.1% from 2017 to 2018 primarily due to start up of the hydrogenation/distillation project in the second half of 2017.\n2016-2017\nDepreciation and amortization increased 17.4% from 2016 to 2017 primarily due to the addition of B Plant and the hydrogenation/distillation project coming online in 2017.\nCapital Expenditures\n2017-2018\nCapital expenditures decreased from approximately $14.0 million to $2.9 million or 79.6% from 2017 to 2018 primarily due to the completion and of the hydrogenation/distillation project in 2017.\n2016-2017\nCapital expenditures decreased 20.1% from 2016 to 2017 primarily due to the completion of the hydrogenation/distillation project in 2017.\nCorporate Segment\nTable 75: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General & Administrative Expense\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8,275\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,413\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>862\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation\n</td> <td>50\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>62\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(12\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(19.4\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Equity in losses of AMAK\n</td> <td>901\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,261\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(3,360\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(78.9\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 76: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2016\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General & Administrative Expense\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,413\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,445\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>968\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation\n</td> <td>62\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>43\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>19\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>44.2\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Equity in losses of AMAK\n</td> <td>4,261\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,479\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,782\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>188.1\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain from additional equity issuance by AMAK\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(3,168\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,168\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(100.0\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\n2017-2018\nGeneral corporate expenses increased from 2017 to 2018 primarily due to restructuring and severance expenses, offset by the cancellation and reversal of stock compensation expense and other post retirement benefits awarded to Mr. Hatem El Khalidi. See Note 14 for further discussion.\n2016-2017\nGeneral corporate expenses increased from 2016 to 2017 primarily due to an increase in officer compensation, accounting fees, and legal fees. Officer compensation increased in 2017 due to the addition of an officer in late 2016 and and an accrual for executive bonuses. Accounting and legal fees increased due to additional time required for restatements issues and other matters.\nEquity in Losses of AMAK/Gain on Equity Issuance of AMAK\n2017-2018\nEquity in Losses of AMAK decreased 78.9% from 2017 to 2018 due to a number of reasons as discussed below.\nThe mine was fully operational in 2018 as compared to operating on an improving basis throughout 2017. In 2017 costs were increased as the mine was not operating at full capacity. Metal prices remained strong in 2018.\nShipments increased 105% from 2017 to 2018 as indicated in the table below. AMAK volumes in dry metric tons (dmt) for 2018 and 2017 were as follows:\nTable 77: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Variance\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Ore tons processed\n</td> <td>699,885\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>385,495\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>314,390\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Concentrate to the port\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Copper\n</td> <td>26,070\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15,326\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,744\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Zinc\n</td> <td>31,989\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16,606\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15,383\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>58,059\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>31,932\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>26,127\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Shipments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Copper\n</td> <td>26,286\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13,940\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12,346\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Zinc\n</td> <td>31,272\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14,080\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17,192\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>57,558\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28,020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>29,538\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n2016-2017\nEquity in Losses of AMAK increased 188.1% from 2016 to 2017 due to a number of reasons as discussed below.\nThe mine operated on an improving basis throughout 2017 while operations were closed for almost all of 2016. However, in 2017 because the mine was not operating at full capacity but was working toward that goal, costs increased. Also, 2016 was positively affected by the settlement from certain liabilities. Metal prices were strong in 2017 with zinc prices hitting a ten year high during the year. There were no unusual items in 2017.\nCapital Resources and Requirements\n2017-2018\nCapital expenditures decreased 58% from 2017 to 2018. The majority of the decrease was due to completion of the Advanced Reformer unit. During 2018 we expended approximately $14.9 million to complete the Advanced Reformer unit which includes $1 million insurance deductible related to the February 2018 fire and $3 million for the catalyst replacement in December 2018, $1.3 million for a rail spur addition and $0.5 million for a truck loading rack.\n2016-2017\nCapital expenditures increased 27.4% from 2016 to 2017. The majority of the increase was due to the construction projects for the hydrogenation/distillation unit and the Advanced Reformer unit. During 2017 we expended $10.8 million on the hydrogenation/distillation project, $0.9 million to upgrade B Plant, $32.5 million to construct the Advanced Reformer unit, $1.9 million for railspur addition, $1.0 million for additional tankage and upgrades to existing tankage, $0.9 million for transport trucks, and $3.7 million on various plant improvements and equipment.\nAt December 31, 2018, there was approximately $18 million available on the Company's line of credit. We believe that operating cash flows along with credit availability will be sufficient to finance our 2019 operations and capital expenditures.\nThe table below summarizes the following contractual obligations of the Company:\nTable 78: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Payments due by period\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Contractual Obligations\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Less than\n1 year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1-3 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3-5 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>More than 5 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(thousands of dollars)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating Lease Obligations\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>18,131\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,670\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,001\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,395\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,065\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchase Obligations\n</td> <td>124\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>124\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-Term Debt Obligations\n</td> <td>103,312\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,375\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>98,937\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>121,567\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8,169\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>105,938\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,395\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,065\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe majority of our operating lease obligations are for railcars as discussed in Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Purchase obligations are primarily related to commitments for our capital construction projects. The anticipated source of funds for payments due within three years that relate to contractual obligations is from a combination of continuing operations supplemented with borrowings under our credit facility.\nImpact of Inflation\nOur results of operations and financial condition are presented based on historical cost. While it is difficult to accurately measure the impact of inflation, we do not believe the overall effects of inflation, if any, on our results of operations and financial condition have been material.\nInvestment in AMAK\nInformation concerning our investment in AMAK is set forth in Note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nNew Accounting Standards\nIn May 2014 the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") issued Accounting Standards Update (\"ASU\") 2014-9, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (\"ASU 2014-9\"). ASU 2014-9 supersedes the revenue recognition requirements of FASB Accounting Standards Codification (\"ASC\") Topic 605, Revenue Recognition and most industry-specific guidance throughout the Accounting Standards Codification, resulting in the creation of FASB ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. ASU 2014-9 requires entities to recognize revenue in a way that depicts the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. This ASU provides alternative methods of retrospective adoption and is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2017. The Company completed its assessment of the impact of the adoption of ASU 2014-9 across all revenue streams. This included reviewing current accounting policies and practices to identify potential differences that would result from applying the requirements under the new standard. We completed contract reviews and validated results of applying the new revenue guidance (Note 2). See Revenue Recognition policy note.\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842). This update will increase transparency and comparability among organizations by recognizing lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements. This update is effective for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. In July 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-11, Targeted Improvements to ASC 842, Leases. ASU 2018-11 provided entities with an alternative modified transition method to elect not to recast the comparative periods presented when adopting ASC 842. The new standard provides a number of optional practical expedients in transition. The Company expects to elect: (1) the \u2018package of practical expedients', which permits it not to reassess under the new standard its prior conclusions about lease identification, lease classification, and initial direct costs and (2) the use-of-hindsight. In addition, the new standard provides practical expedients for an entity's ongoing accounting that the Company anticipates making, such as the (1) the election for certain classes of underlying asset to not separate non-lease components from lease components and (2) the election for short-term lease recognition\nexemption for all leases that qualify. The Company will adopt ASU 842 as of January 1, 2019, using the alternative modified transition method. In preparation of adopting ASC 842, the Company is implementing additional internal controls to enable future preparation of financial information in accordance with ASC 842. The Company has also substantially completed its evaluation of the impact on the Company's lease portfolio. The Company believes the largest impact will be on the consolidated balance sheets for the accounting of facilities-related leases, which represents a majority of its operating leases it has entered into as a lessee. These leases will be recognized under the new standard as right of use assets ( ROU\u201d) operating lease liabilities. The Company will also be required to provide expanded disclosures for its leasing arrangements. As of December 31, 2018, the Company had approximately $18.1 million of undiscounted future minimum operating lease commitments that are not recognized on its consolidated balance sheets as determined under the current standard. For a lessee, the results of operations are not expected to significantly change after adoption of the new standard. While substantially complete, the Company is still in the process of finalizing its evaluation of the effect of ASU 842 on the Company's financial statements and disclosures, including the determination of the Company's incremental borrowing rate for each of the operating leases to estimate the interest rate we would have to pay to borrow on a collateralized basis over a similar term for an amount equal to the lease payments. The Company will finalize its accounting assessment and quantitative impact of the adoption during the first quarter of fiscal year 2019.\nIn January 2017 the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-4, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (Topic 350). The amendments in ASU 2017-4 simplify the measurement of goodwill by eliminating Step 2 from the goodwill impairment test. Instead, under these amendments, an entity should perform its annual, or interim, goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. An entity should recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit's fair value; however, the loss should not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. The amendments are effective for public business entities for the first interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019. Early adoption is permitted for interim or annual goodwill impairment tests performed on testing dates after January 1, 2017.The amendments also eliminate the requirements for any reporting unit with a zero or negative carrying amount to perform a qualitative assessment and, if it fails that qualitative test, to perform Step 2 of the goodwill impairment test. An entity still has the option to perform the qualitative assessment for a reporting unit to determine if the quantitative impairment test is necessary. The Company has goodwill from prior business combination and performs an annual impairment test or more frequently if changes or circumstances occur that would more-likely-than-not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying value. During the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company performed its impairment assessment and determined the fair value of the aggregated reporting units exceed the carrying value, such that the Company's goodwill was not considered impaired. Although the Company cannot anticipate future goodwill impairment assessments, based on the most recent assessment, it is unlikely that an impairment amount would need to be calculated and, therefore, the Company does not anticipate a material impact from these amendments to the Company's financial position and results of operations. The current accounting policies and processes are not anticipated to change, except for the elimination of the Step 2 analysis.\nIn February 2018 the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-2, Income Statement - Reporting Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income. ASU 2018-2 was issued to address the income tax accounting treatment of the stranded tax effects within other comprehensive income due to the prohibition of backward tracing due to an income tax rate change that was initially recorded in other comprehensive income due to the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) on December 22, 2017, which changed the Company's income tax rate from 35% to 21%. The amendments to the ASU changed US GAAP whereby an entity may elect to reclassify the stranded tax effect from accumulated other comprehensive income to retained earnings. The amendments of the ASU may be adopted in total or in part using a full retrospective or modified retrospective method. The amendments of the ASU are effective for periods beginning after December 15, 2018. The Company believes there will be no material impact to the consolidated financial statements as a result of this update.\nIn June 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-07, Improvements to Nonemployee Share-Based Payment Accounting. ASU 2018-07 simplifies the accounting for share-based payments to nonemployees by aligning it with the accounting for share-based payments to employees, with certain exceptions. The amendments in this ASU are effective for public companies for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within that fiscal year. The Company is assessing the effect of ASU 2018-02 on its consolidated financial statements.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nOur consolidated financial statements are based on the selection and application of significant accounting policies. The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of net sales, expenses and allocated charges during the reported period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. However, we are not currently aware of any reasonably likely events or circumstances that would result in materially different results.\nWe believe the following accounting policies and estimates are critical to understanding the financial reporting risks present currently. These matters, and the judgments and uncertainties affecting them, are essential to understanding our reported results. See Note 2 to the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.\nInventories\nFinished products and feedstock are recorded at the lower of cost, determined on the first-in, first-out method (\"FIFO\"); or market for SHR. For TC, inventory is recorded at the lower of cost or market as follows: (1) raw material cost is calculated using the weighted-average cost method and (2) product inventory cost is calculated using the specific cost method. See Note 7 to the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.\nBeginning January 1, 2017, due to expansion of our plant assets at SHR and TC, we began inventorying spare parts for the repair and maintenance of our plant, pipeline and equipment.\nRevenue recognition\nThe Company adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") Accounting Standards Codification (\"ASC\") Topic 606 (\"ASC 606\"), Revenue from Contracts with Customers, and its amendments with a date of the initial application of January 1, 2018. As a result, the Company has changed its accounting policy for revenue recognition as detailed below. ASC 606 outlines a single comprehensive model for an entity to use in accounting for revenue arising from all contracts with customers, except where revenues are in scope of another accounting standard. ASC 606 superseded the revenue recognition requirements in ASC Topic 605, \"Revenue Recognition\", and most industry specific guidance. ASC Topic 606 sets forth a five-step model for determining when and how revenue is recognized. Under the model, an entity is required to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to a customer at an amount reflecting the consideration it expects to receive in exchange for those goods and services. ASC 606 also requires certain additional revenue-related disclosures.\nThe Company applied the modified retrospective approach under ASC 606 which allows for the cumulative effect of adopting the new guidance on the date of initial application. Use of the modified retrospective approach means the Company's comparative periods prior to initial application are not restated. The initial application was applied to all contracts at the date of the initial application. The Company has determined that the adjustments using the modified retrospective approach did not have a material impact on the date of the initial application along with the disclosure of the effect on prior periods.\nAccounting Policy\nBeginning on January 1, 2018, revenue is measured based on a consideration specified in a contract with a customer. The Company recognizes revenue when it satisfies a performance obligation by transferring control over a product or service to a customer. In evaluating when a customer has control of the asset we primarily consider whether the transfer of legal title and physical delivery has occurred, whether the customer has significant risks and rewards of ownership, and whether the customer has accepted delivery and a right to payment exists. Taxes assessed by a governmental authority that are both imposed on and concurrent with a specific revenue-producing transaction, that are collected by the Company from a customer, are excluded from revenue. Shipping and handling costs associated with outbound freight after control over a product has transferred to a customer are accounted for as a fulfillment cost and are included in cost of product sales and processing. The Company does not offer material rights of return or service-type warranties.\nFor 2017 the Company recognized revenue according to FASB ASC Topic 605 (\"ASC 605\"), \"Revenue Recognition\", when: (1) the customer accepted delivery of the product and title had been transferred or when the service was performed and the Company had no significant obligations remaining to be performed; (2) a final understanding as to specific nature and terms of the agreed upon transaction had occurred; (3) price was fixed and determinable; and (4) collection was assured. Product sales generally met these criteria, and revenue was recognized, when the product was delivered or title was transferred to the customer. Sales revenue was presented net of discounts, allowances, and sales taxes. Freight costs billed to customers were recorded as a component of revenue. Revenues received in advance of future sales of products or prior to the performance of services were presented as deferred revenues. Shipping and handling costs were classified as cost of product sales and processing and were expensed as incurred.\nNature of goods and services\nThe following is a description of principal activities - separated by reportable segments - from which the Company generates its revenue. For more detailed information about reportable segments, disaggregation of revenues, and contract balance disclosures, see Note 17.\nSpecialty petrochemical segment\nThe specialty petrochemical segment of the Company produces eight high purity hydrocarbons and other petroleum based products including isopentane, normal pentane, isohexane and hexane. These products are used in the production of polyethylene, packaging,\npolypropylene, expandable polystyrene, poly-iso/urethane foams, crude oil from the Canadian tar sands, and in the catalyst support industry. SHR's specialty petrochemical products are typically transported to customers by rail car, tank truck, iso-container and ship.\nProduct Sales - The Company sells individual (distinct) products to its customers on a stand-alone basis (point-of-sale) without any further integration. There is no significant modification of any one or more products sold to fulfill another promised product or service within any of the Company's product sale transactions. The amount of consideration received for product sales is stated within the executed invoice with the customer. Payment is typically due and collected 30 to 60 days subsequent to point of sale.\nProcessing Fees - The Company's services consist of processing customer supplied feedstocks into custom products including, if requested, services for forming, packaging, and arranging shipping.
