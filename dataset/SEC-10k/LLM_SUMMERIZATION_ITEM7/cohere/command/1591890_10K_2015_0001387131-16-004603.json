MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nYou should read the following discussion in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes and information included elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K. You should review the Risk Factors\u201d section of this annual report for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis and set forth elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.\nUnless context denotes otherwise, the terms Company,\u201d we,\u201d us,\u201d and our,\u201d refer to 1347 Property Insurance Holdings, Inc., and its subsidiaries. Except where noted otherwise, all dollar amount have been rounded to the nearest thousand.\nOverview\nMaison Insurance Holdings, Inc. was incorporated on October 2, 2012 in the State of Delaware. On November 19, 2013, the Company changed its legal name from Maison Insurance Holdings, Inc. to 1347 Property Insurance Holdings, Inc ( PIH\u201d). PIH is a holding company and is engaged, through its subsidiaries, in the property and casualty insurance business.\nUntil March 31, 2014, we operated as a wholly owned subsidiary of Kingsway America, Inc. ( KAI\u201d). KAI in turn is a wholly owned subsidiary of Kingsway Financial Services, Inc. ( KFSI\u201d), a publicly owned holding company based in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. On March 31, 2014, the Company completed an initial public offering of its common stock and then on June 13, 2014, the Company completed a follow-on offering. Through the combination of the Company's IPO and follow-on offering, we issued approximately five million shares of our common stock. As of December 31, 2015 KAI and companies affiliated with KAI held approximately 1.1 million shares of our common stock, equivalent to 17.5% of our outstanding shares.\nPIH has three wholly-owned subsidiaries; Maison Insurance Company ( Maison\u201d), a Louisiana-domiciled property and casualty insurance company, Maison Managers, Inc. ( MMI\u201d), a managing general agent, incorporated in the State of Delaware on October 2, 2012, and ClaimCor, LLC ( ClaimCor\u201d), a Florida based claims adjusting company.\nMaison writes personal property and casualty insurance in Louisiana and both personal and commercial property and casualty insurance in Texas. Maison provides dwelling policies for wind and hail only, and dwelling, homeowner and mobile home/manufactured home policies for multi-peril property risks.\nMaison distributes its insurance policies through a network of more than 170 producing independent agents in Louisiana and approximately 40 producing independent agents in Texas. These agents typically represent several insurance companies in order to provide various insurance product lines to their clients. The Company refers to these policies as voluntary policies.\nIn addition to the voluntary policies Maison writes, we have participated in the last four rounds of take-outs from Louisiana Citizens Property Insurance Company ( Citizens\u201d), occurring on December 1st of each year. As the State of Louisiana has not historically been in the business of serving as an insurer, an insurance take-out\u201d program was implemented to reduce the number of properties insured by Citizens. Under this take-out program, state-approved insurance companies, such as Maison, have the opportunity to assume insurance policies written by Citizens.\nMaison began writing commercial business in Texas in June 2015, through an alliance with Brotherhood Mutual Insurance Company ( Brotherhood\u201d). Through this alliance, we have assumed wind/hail only exposures on certain churches and related structures Brotherhood insures throughout the State of Texas.\nMMI serves as the Company's management services subsidiary as a general agency providing underwriting, policy administration, claims administration, marketing, accounting and financial and other management services to Maison. MMI contracts with independent agents for policy sales and services, and contracts with an independent third-party for policy administration services. As a managing general agency, MMI is licensed by and subject to the regulatory oversight of both the Louisiana and Texas Departments of Insurance ( LDI\u201d and TDI\u201d, respectively).\nTable 102: <table> <tr> <td>24 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 103: <table> <tr> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n1347 PROPERTY INSURANCE HOLDINGS, INC.\nWe process claims made by our policyholders both internally, through our wholly-owned subsidiary, ClaimCor, as well as through various third-party claims adjusting companies. MMI has ultimate authority over the claims handling process, while the agents we appoint have no authority to settle our claims or otherwise exercise control over the claims process.\nOur Products\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had approximately 28,400 policies in-force. Of these policies in-force, approximately 32% of our policies are comprised of policies obtained from the Citizens take-out program (most of which are wind/hail only dwelling policies) while the remaining 68% are obtained through our independent agents. In total, 51% of our policies are home-owner multi-peril, approximately 15% are manufactured home policies and approximately 2% are dwelling fire policies.\nHomeowners' Insurance\nOur homeowners' insurance policy is written on an owner occupied dwelling which protects from all perils, except for those specifically excluded from coverage by the policy. It also provides replacement cost coverage on the home and other structures and will provide optional coverage for replacement cost on personal property in the home. It may also offer the option of specifically scheduling individual personal property items for coverage. Additionally, coverage for loss of use of the home until it can be repaired is provided. Personal liability and medical payment coverage to others is included, as well.\nWind/Hail Insurance\nOur wind/hail insurance policy is written on an owner or non-owner occupied dwelling which protects from the perils of wind and/or hail-only weather events. This policy type may also provide coverage for personal property, but only for specific types of coverage. It provides replacement cost or actual cash value coverage on the home and other structures depending on the form under which the policy is written. Personal property in the home is written at actual cash value. Additionally, coverage for loss of use of the home is provided.\nManufactured Home Insurance\nOur manufactured home insurance policy is written on a manufactured or mobile home and is similar to both the homeowners' insurance policy and the dwelling fire policy. The policy can provide for coverage on the manufactured home, the insured's personal property in the home and liability and medical payments can be included. Furthermore, our manufactured home policies can be endorsed to include coverage for flood and earthquake (coverage for these perils is not available under our other policy types; as of December 31, 2015 approximately 3,500 of our manufactured home policies include this endorsement). The policy can also be written on either owner occupied or non-owner occupied units. Property coverage can be written on an actual cash value or stated amount basis with an optional replacement cost coverage available for partial loss. There are several other optional coverages that can be included and residential and commercial-use rental units can be written along with seasonal use mobile homes or homes that are used for part of the year.\nDwelling Fire Insurance\nOur dwelling fire policy can be issued on an owner occupied or non-owner (tenant) occupied dwelling property. It will also provide coverage against all types of loss unless the peril causing the loss is specifically excluded in the policy. Losses from vandalism and malicious mischief are also included in the coverage. All claims and losses on a dwelling are covered on a replacement cost basis and additional coverage for personal property (contents) can also be added. Personal liability and medical payments to others may be included on an optional basis.\nOur policy counts by type as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 are as follows:\nTable 104: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Direct Policies in-force as of </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Source of Policies </td> <td> </td> <td>Dec 31, 2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Dec 31, 2014 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total Takeout Policies in Force </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,957 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,589 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Homeowners </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14,283 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9,286 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Manufactured Homes </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,343 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,096 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Other Dwellings </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>806 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>426 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total Voluntary Policies in Force </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>19,432 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13,808 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total Direct Policies in Force </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>28,389 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>21,397 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 105: <table> <tr> <td>25 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 106: <table> <tr> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n1347 PROPERTY INSURANCE HOLDINGS, INC.\nWe do not consider the commercial wind/hail only book of business we have written in Texas in our policies-in-force count as of December 31, 2015 since we have assumed this business through our alliance with Brotherhood. As of December 31, 2015, we have assumed wind/hail coverage on 495 policies in Texas through this agreement.\nMaison insures personal property located in 63 of the 64 parishes in Louisiana. As of December 31, 2015, these policies are concentrated within these parishes as follows: Jefferson Parish 17.7%, Saint Tammany Parish 15.9%, East Baton Rouge Parish 7.3%, Orleans Parish 6.8%, Terrebonne Parish 6.2%, Livingston Parish 5.2%, and Tangipahoa Parish 5.1%. No other parish individually has over 5.0% of the policies in force as of December 31, 2015. The remaining 56 parishes combine to equal 35.1% of the total Louisiana policies in force as of December 31, 2015. On a direct basis, Maison writes in 44 of the 254 counties that comprise the State of Texas, however no single county represents over 5.0% of our policies in force as of December 31, 2015.\nNon-U.S. GAAP Financial Measures\nThe Company assesses its results of operations using certain non-U.S. GAAP financial measures, in addition to U.S. GAAP financial measures. These non-U.S. GAAP financial measures consist of underwriting ratios and are defined below. The Company believes these non-U.S. GAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating performance in the same manner as management does.\nThe non-U.S. GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for or superior to, any financial measures prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The Company's non-U.S. GAAP financial measures may be defined differently from time to time and may be defined differently than similar terms used by other companies, and accordingly, care should be exercised in understanding how we define our non-U.S. GAAP financial measures.\nUnderwriting Ratios\nThe Company, like many insurance companies, analyzes performance based on underwriting ratios such as loss ratio, expense ratio and combined ratio. The loss ratio is derived by dividing the amount of net losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred by net premiums earned. The expense ratio is derived by dividing the sum of amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs and general and administrative expenses incurred by net premiums earned. All items included in the loss and expense ratios are presented in the Company's U.S. GAAP financial statements. The combined ratio is the sum of the loss ratio and the expense ratio. A combined ratio below 100% demonstrates an underwriting profit whereas a combined ratio over 100% demonstrates an underwriting loss.\nCritical Accounting Estimates and Assumptions\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses for the reporting period. Actual results could differ from these estimates. Estimates and their underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Changes in estimates are recorded in the accounting period in which they are determined. The critical accounting estimates and assumptions in the accompanying consolidated financial statements include the provision for loss and loss adjustment expense reserves, the valuation of fixed income securities, the valuation of net deferred income taxes, the valuation of various securities we have issued in conjunction with the termination of the management services agreement with 1347 Advisors, LLC, the valuation of deferred policy acquisition costs and stock-based compensation expense.\nProvision for Loss and Loss Adjustment Expense Reserves\nA significant degree of judgment is required to determine amounts recorded in the consolidated financial statements for the provision for loss and loss adjustment expense reserves. The process for establishing the provision for loss and loss adjustment expense reserves reflects the uncertainties and significant judgmental factors inherent in predicting future results of both known and unknown loss events. As such, the process is inherently complex and imprecise and estimates are constantly refined. The process of establishing the provision for loss and loss adjustment expense reserves relies on the judgment and opinions of a large number of individuals, including the opinions of the Company's independent actuaries.\nFactors affecting the provision for loss and loss adjustment expense reserves include the continually evolving and changing regulatory and legal environment, actuarial studies, professional experience and expertise of the Company's claims departments' personnel and independent adjusters retained to handle individual claims, the quality of the data used for projection purposes, existing claims management practices including claims handling and settlement practices, the effect of inflationary trends on future loss settlement costs, court decisions, economic conditions and public attitudes.\nTable 107: <table> <tr> <td>26 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 108: <table> <tr> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n1347 PROPERTY INSURANCE HOLDINGS, INC.\nIn the actuarial review process, an analysis of the provision for loss and loss adjustment expense reserves is completed for the Company's insurance subsidiary. Unpaid losses, allocated loss adjustment expenses and unallocated loss adjustment expenses are separately analyzed by line of business or coverage by accident year. A wide range of actuarial methods are utilized in order to appropriately measure ultimate loss and loss adjustment expense costs. These methods include paid loss development, incurred loss development and frequency-severity method. Reasonability tests such as ultimate loss ratio trends and ultimate allocated loss adjustment expense to ultimate loss are also performed prior to selection of the final provision. The provision is indicated by line of business or coverage and is separated into case reserves, reserves for losses incurred but not reported ( IBNR\u201d) and a provision for loss adjustment expenses ( LAE\u201d).\nBecause the establishment of the provision for loss and loss adjustment expense reserves is an inherently uncertain process involving estimates, current provisions may need to be updated. Adjustments to the provision, both favorable and unfavorable, are reflected in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss) for the periods in which such estimates are updated. Management determines the loss and loss adjustment expense reserves as recorded on the Company's financial statements, while the Company's independent actuaries develop a range of reasonable estimates and a point estimate of loss and loss adjustment expense reserves. The actuarial point estimate is intended to represent the actuaries' best estimate and will not necessarily be at the mid-point of the high and low estimates of the range.\nValuation of Fixed Income Securities\nThe Company's fixed income securities are recorded at fair value using observable inputs such as quoted prices in inactive markets, quoted prices in active markets for similar instruments, benchmark interest rates, broker quotes and other relevant inputs. The Company does not have any fixed income investments in our portfolio which require the Company to use unobservable inputs. Any change in the estimated fair value of its investments could impact the amount of unrealized gain or loss the Company has recorded, which could change the amount the Company has recorded for its investments and other comprehensive loss on its consolidated balance sheets and statements of comprehensive income (loss).\nGains and losses realized on the disposition of investments are determined on the first-in first-out basis and credited or charged to the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss). Premium and discount on investments are amortized and accreted using the interest method and charged or credited to net investment income.\nThe Company performs a quarterly analysis of its investment portfolio to determine if declines in market value are other-than-temporary. Further information regarding its detailed analysis and factors considered in establishing an other-than-temporary impairment on an investment is discussed within Note 4 - Investments, to the consolidated financial statements.\nValuation of Net Deferred Income Taxes\nThe provision for income taxes is calculated based on the expected tax treatment of transactions recorded in the Company's consolidated financial statements. In determining its provision for income taxes, the Company interprets tax legislation in a variety of jurisdictions and makes assumptions about the expected timing of the reversal of deferred income tax assets and liabilities and the valuation of net deferred income taxes.\nThe ultimate realization of the deferred income tax asset balance is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which the Company's temporary differences reverse and become deductible. A valuation allowance is established when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred income tax asset balance will not be realized. In determining whether a valuation allowance is needed, management considers all available positive and negative evidence affecting specific deferred income tax asset balances, including the Company's past and anticipated future performance, the reversal of deferred income tax liabilities, and the availability of tax planning strategies. To the extent a valuation allowance is established in a period, an expense must be recorded within the income tax provision in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss).\nTable 109: <table> <tr> <td>27 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 110: <table> <tr> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n1347 PROPERTY INSURANCE HOLDINGS, INC.\nThe Company carries a net deferred income tax asset of $506 and $263 at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, all of which the Company believes is more likely than not to be fully realized based upon management's assessment of future taxable income.\nSecurities issued to 1347 Advisors, LLC\nPursuant to the termination of the Management Services Agreement with 1347 Advisors LLC ( Advisors,\u201d a wholly-owned subsidiary of KFSI), the Company issued Preferred Shares, Warrants, and entered into a Performance Share Grant Agreement with Advisors on February 24, 2015. Additional information regarding the termination of the Management Services Agreement with Advisors can be found under Related Party Transactions\u201d in Item 7 of this Report.\nBecause the Preferred Shares have a mandatory redemption provision requiring redemption on February 24, 2020, the Company was required to classify the Preferred Shares as a liability on its balance sheet as opposed to recording the value of the shares in equity. The resulting liability was recorded at a discount to the $4,200 ultimate redemption amount which includes all dividends to be paid on the Preferred Shares based upon an analysis of the timing and amounts of the cash payments expected to occur under the terms of the Preferred Shares discounted for the Company's estimated cost of equity (13.9%). As a result, amortization in amount of $1,889 will be charged to operations through February 24, 2020 using the effective interest method.\nThe Company estimated the fair value of the Warrants on grant date based upon the Black-Scholes option pricing model while it utilized a Monte Carlo model to determine the fair value of the Performance Share Grant Agreement due to the fact that the underlying shares are only issuable based upon the achievement of certain market conditions.\nDeferred Policy Acquisition Costs\nDeferred policy acquisition costs represent the deferral of expenses that the Company incurs related to successful efforts to acquire new business or renew existing business. Acquisition costs, primarily commissions, premium taxes and underwriting and agency expenses related to issuing insurance policies are deferred and charged against income ratably over the terms of the related insurance policies. Management regularly reviews the categories of acquisition costs that are deferred and assesses the recoverability of this asset. Costs associated with unsuccessful efforts or costs that cannot be tied directly to a successful policy acquisition are expensed as incurred, as opposed to being deferred and amortized as the premium is earned.\nStock-Based Compensation Expense\nThe Company uses the fair-value method of accounting for stock-based compensation awards granted. The Company determines the fair value of the stock options on their grant date using the Black-Scholes option pricing model and determines the fair value of restricted stock units on their grant date using multiple Monte Carlo simulations. The fair value of these awards is recorded as compensation expense over the requisite service period, which is generally the expected period over which the awards will vest, with a corresponding increase to additional paid-in capital. When the stock options are exercised, or correspondingly, when the restricted stock units vest, the amount of proceeds together with the amount recorded in additional paid-in capital is recorded in shareholders' equity.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 3 - Recently Issued Accounting Standards in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements and their effect, if any, on the Company.\nTable 111: <table> <tr> <td>28 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 112: <table> <tr> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n1347 PROPERTY INSURANCE HOLDINGS, INC.\nAnalysis of Financial Condition\nAs of December 31, 2015 compared to December 31, 2014\nInvestments\nThe Company's investments in fixed income securities are classified as available-for-sale and are reported at estimated fair value. The Company holds an investment portfolio comprised primarily of fixed income securities issued by the U.S. Government, government agencies and high quality corporate issuers. The portfolio is managed by a third-party investment management firm in accordance with the investment policies and guidelines approved by Maison's Board of Directors. These guidelines stress the preservation of capital, market liquidity and the diversification of risk. Investments held by the Company's insurance subsidiary must also comply with applicable domiciliary state regulations that prescribe the type, quality and concentration of investments. Furthermore, pursuant to the certificate of authority we received from the TDI, we are required to deposit securities with the State of Texas. These securities consist of the fixed income securities listed in the tables below and have both an amortized cost basis and estimated fair value of $2,002 as of December 31, 2015.\nThe table below summarizes, by type, the Company's investments as of December 31, 2015 and 2014.\nTable 113: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, 2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, 2014 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Type of Investment </td> <td> </td> <td>Carrying\nAmount </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Percent of\nTotal </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Carrying\nAmount </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Percent of\nTotal </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Fixed income securities: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> U.S. government, government agencies and authorities </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,919 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8.8 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>141 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.1 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> State municipalities and political subdivisions </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,651 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7.6 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>295 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.3 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Asset-backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,810 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>36.1 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,178 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>32.9 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Corporate </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,858 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>41.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,900 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>46.4 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total fixed income securities </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>20,238 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>93.5 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10,514 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>82.7 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Short-term investments </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,149 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.3 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,198 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17.3 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Other Investments </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>248 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.2 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total investments </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>21,635 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>12,712 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Company's other investments are comprised of investments in two limited partnerships which seek to provide equity and asset-backed debt investment in a variety of privately-owned companies. The Company has committed to a total investment of $1,000, of which the limited partnerships have drawn down approximately $248 through December 31, 2015. The Company has accounted for its investments under the cost method as the instruments do not have readily determinable fair values and the Company does not exercise significant influence over the operations of the limited partnerships or the underlying privately-owned companies.\nLiquidity and Cash Flow Risk\nThe table below summarizes the fair value of the Company's fixed income securities by contractual maturity as of December 31, 2015 and 2014.

The Company holds cash and high-grade short-term assets which, along with fixed income securities, management believes are sufficient in amount for the payment of loss and loss adjustment expense reserves and other operating subsidiary obligations on a timely basis. The Company may not be able to liquidate its investments in the event that additional cash is required to meet obligations to its policyholders, however, the Company believes that the high-quality, liquid investments in the portfolios provide it with sufficient liquidity.\nTable 115: <table> <tr> <td>29 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 116: <table> <tr> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n1347 PROPERTY INSURANCE HOLDINGS, INC.\nMarket Risk\nMarket risk is the risk that the Company will incur losses due to adverse changes in interest or currency exchange rates and equity prices. Given the Company's operations only invest in U.S. dollar denominated instruments and maintain a relatively insignificant investment in equity instruments, its primary market risk exposures in the investments portfolio are to changes in interest rates.\nBecause the investments portfolio is comprised of primarily fixed maturity instruments that are usually held to maturity, periodic changes in interest rate levels generally impact the Company's financial results to the extent that the investments are recorded at market value and reinvestment yields are different than the original yields on maturing instruments. During periods of rising interest rates, the market values of the existing fixed income securities will generally decrease. The reverse is true during periods of declining interest rates.\nCredit Risk\nCredit risk is defined as the risk of financial loss due to failure of the other party to a financial instrument to discharge an obligation. Credit risk arises from the Company's positions in short-term investments, corporate debt instruments and government bonds.\nAt December 31, 2015 and 2014, the Company's debt securities had the following quality ratings as assigned by Standard and Poor's ( S&P\u201d) or Moody's Investors Service ( Moody's\u201d).\nTable 117: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, 2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, 2014 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Rating (S&P/Moody's) </td> <td> </td> <td>Carrying\nAmount </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Percent of\nTotal </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Carrying\nAmount </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Percent of\nTotal </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>AAA/Aaa </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>10,741 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>53.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,713 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>44.8 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Aa/Aa </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,520 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12.5 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>802 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7.6 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>A/A </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,745 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>23.4 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,414 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>42.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>BBB </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,232 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11.1 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>585 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.6 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total fixed income securities </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>20,238 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>10,514 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOther-Than-Temporary Impairment\nThe length of time an individual investment may be held in an unrealized loss position may vary based on the opinion of the investment manager and their respective analyses related to valuation and to the various credit risks that may prevent the Company from recapturing the principal investment. In the case of an individual investment with a maturity date where the investment manager determines that there is little or no risk of default prior to the maturity of a holding, the Company would elect to hold the investment in an unrealized loss position until the price recovers or the investment matures. In situations where facts emerge that might increase the risk associated with recapture of principal, the Company may elect to sell investments at a loss.\nThe Company performs a quarterly analysis of its investment portfolio to determine if declines in market value are other-than-temporary. Further information regarding the Company's detailed analysis and factors considered in establishing an other-than-temporary impairment on an investment is discussed within Note 4 - Investments,\u201d to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this report.\nAs a result of the analysis performed by the Company, there were no write-downs for other-than-temporary impairments related to investments for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014.\nAt December 31, 2015, the gross unrealized losses for fixed income securities amounted to $95, and there were no unrealized losses attributable to non-investment grade fixed income securities. At both December 31, 2015 and 2014, all unrealized losses on individual investments were considered temporary. Fixed income securities in unrealized loss positions continued to pay interest and were not subject to material changes in their respective debt ratings. The Company concluded the declines in value were considered temporary. As the Company has the capacity to hold these investments to maturity, no impairment provision was considered necessary.\nDeferred Policy Acquisition Costs\nThe Company's deferred policy acquisition costs ( DPAC\u201d) include commissions, premium taxes, assessments and other policy processing fees and represent those costs related to acquiring the premiums the Company has yet to earn (the unearned premium reserve). DPAC increased $939, to $4,030 as of December 31, 2015 compared to $3,091 as of December 31, 2014, corresponding to an increase in our unearned premium reserves over the same period.\nTable 118: <table> <tr> <td>30 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 119: <table> <tr> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n1347 PROPERTY INSURANCE HOLDINGS, INC.\nPremiums Receivable, Net of Allowance for Doubtful Accounts\nPremiums receivable, net of allowance for credit losses, increased by $309 to $2,395 as of December 31, 2015 from $2,086 as of December 31, 2014. This increase was primarily attributable to the timing of payments received on premium written in December of each year. Premiums written for the month of December 2015 increased by approximately $483 when compared to premiums written in December 2014, leading to a corresponding increase in the amount of premium receivable from our agents and policyholders.\nCeded Unearned Premiums\nCeded unearned premiums represents the unexpired portion of premiums which have been paid to the Company's reinsurers. Ceded unearned premiums are charged to income over the terms of the respective reinsurance treaties. Ceded unearned premiums increased $1,244 to $2,805 as of December 31, 2015 from $1,561 as of December 31, 2014. Our reinsurance treaties generally run from June 1st to May 31st of each year, thus our current treaties in place were negotiated as of June 1, 2015 requiring an upfront deposit of unearned premium each quarter. We also enhanced our catastrophe program so that our aggregate limit of coverage increased from $92,000 in place as of December 31, 2014 to $140,000 in place as of December 31, 2015. Furthermore, the premium we pay for reinsurance is based upon the total insured value ( TIV\u201d) of our book of business as of September 30th of each year. As our TIV has increased year over year, so has the amount of premium we cede to our reinsurers, accounting for the increase in ceded unearned premiums between periods.\nReinsurance Recoverable on Reserves\nReinsurance recoverable on reserves represents amounts due to the Company, or expected to be due to the Company from our reinsurers, based upon claims and claim reserves which have exceeded the retention amount under our reinsurance treaties. As of December 31, 2015 we have recorded an expected recovery of $120 from our reinsurers, compared to $363 as of December 31, 2014. See Loss and Loss Adjustment Expense Reserves\u201d in Item 7 of this report for the expected recovery by policy type.\nFunds Deposited with Reinsured Companies\nFunds deposited with reinsured companies represents collateral we have placed on deposit with Brotherhood based upon our quota-share agreement to reinsure a portion of Brotherhood's business for wind/hail coverage only. Pursuant to the agreement, we are required to fund our pro-rata portion of reserves Brotherhood has established for unearned premium, losses and loss adjustments expenses, and any other amounts for which Brotherhood may not be able to take credit for on its annual statutory financial statements filed with the appropriate insurance regulatory authority. We may fund this obligation via cash advance, trust agreement, or letter of credit. Accordingly, we have placed $725 on deposit under a trust agreement as of December 31, 2015. As our quota-share agreement with Brotherhood commenced in June 2015, there was no associated collateral in place as of December 31, 2014.\nCurrent Income Taxes Recoverable/Payable\nCurrent income taxes recoverable were $965 as of December 31, 2015, compared to a current payable of $262 as of December 31, 2014, representing the estimate of both the Company's state and federal income taxes to be recovered/due for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, less estimated payments made during each year.\nNet Deferred Tax Asset\nThe Company's net deferred tax asset increased $243, to $506 as of December 31, 2015 from $263 as of December 31, 2014. The net deferred tax asset is comprised of approximately $2,310 and $1,595 of deferred tax assets, net of approximately $1,804 and $1,332 of deferred tax liabilities as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The change in the net deferred tax asset is primarily due to the increase in the deferred tax assets associated with our unearned premium reserve.\nProperty and Equipment\nProperty and equipment was $234 and $237 as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, and consists of computers, office equipment, and improvements at our leased facilities in Tampa, Florida and Baton Rouge, Louisiana, shown net of accumulated depreciation. Also included in the balance as of December 31, 2015 are vehicles we have purchased for the use of our sales representatives in the state of Texas. Our policy for the capitalization and depreciation of these assets can be found in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements found in Item 8 of this report.\nTable 120: <table> <tr> <td>31 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 121: <table> <tr> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n1347 PROPERTY INSURANCE HOLDINGS, INC.\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets\nOn January 2, 2015, we acquired a 100% interest in ClaimCor, a Florida domiciled company in the business of adjusting property and casualty insurance claims. Under the terms of the agreement to purchase ClaimCor, the purchase price equaled $323, which we paid in cash, at closing. Pursuant to the purchase agreement, the prior managing members of ClaimCor entered into a non-compete agreement with us, whereby the members cannot engage in, continue in, or carry on any business that competes with ClaimCor for a period of three years from the date in which the transaction closed.\nAs a result of the purchase, we recorded goodwill in the amount of $211 on our consolidated balance sheet as of January 2, 2015. The goodwill was not amortized, but rather subject to impairment testing on, at minimum, an annual basis. We also recognized the estimated fair value of the non-compete agreement as well as a customer base asset as part of the ClaimCor acquisition at a combined total of $52 as of January 2, 2015. The non-compete agreement will be amortized over its 3-year contractual life, while the customer base asset was to be amortized over an estimated useful-life of 5 years.\nIn December 2015, after analyzing ClaimCor's performance in comparison to management's expectations and forecasts at the time of acquisition, we noted that an impairment to the value of the goodwill and other intangibles we recorded was likely. Accordingly, our analysis resulted in a charge of $246 in the quarter ending December 31, 2015 associated with the impairment of goodwill and the customer base asset. As of December 31, 2015, the carrying value of the Company's intangible assets was $6 representing the unamortized balance of the non-compete agreement recorded as part of the acquisition.\nOther Assets\nOther assets increased $423, to $705 as of December 31, 2015 from $282 as of December 31, 2014. The major components of other assets, as well as the change therein, are shown below.\nTable 122: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2014 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Accrued interest on investments </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>77 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>37 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>40 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Security deposits for facility leases </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>38 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>22 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Prepaid expenses </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>590 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>229 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>361 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>705 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>282 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>423 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nLoss and Loss Adjustment Expense Reserves\nLoss and loss adjustment expense reserves represent the estimated liabilities for reported loss events, incurred but not reported ( IBNR\u201d) loss events and the related estimated loss adjustment expenses gross of amounts expected to be recovered from reinsurance.

Any such development could have a material effect on the Company's consolidated financial results for a given period.\nUnearned Premium Reserves\nUnearned premium reserves increased $5,739 to $23,442 as of December 31, 2015 compared to $17,703 as of December 31, 2014. The following table outlines the change in unearned premium reserves by line of business.\nTable 126: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2014 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Homeowners </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>15,688 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>12,120 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,568 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Special Property </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,754 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,583 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,171 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>23,442 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>17,703 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,739 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Company's increase to its unearned premium reserve is directly related to the increase in written premiums year over year.\nCeded Reinsurance Premiums Payable\nCeded reinsurance premiums payable increased $724 to $3,283 as of December 31, 2015 compared to $2,559 as of December 31, 2014 primarily as a result of the timing of payments due under our reinsurance programs. The bulk of the balance payable as of December 31, 2015 represents the quarterly payment due under our catastrophe reinsurance program, which was paid in January 2016.\nAgent Commissions Payable\nAgent commissions payable increased $80 to $403 as of December 31, 2015 compared to $323 as of December 31, 2014. As agent commissions are paid in arrears, this balance represents commissions owed to the Company's independent agents on policies written in December of each year, and corresponds directly with the increase in premiums written by our agents when comparing December 2015 to December 2014.\nPremiums Collected in Advance\nPremium deposits were $870 and $560 and represent cash the Company has received for policies which were not yet in-force as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 respectively. Upon the effective date of coverage, advance premiums are reclassified to the unearned premium reserve account.\nRelated Party Transactions\nDue to Related Party\nAmounts due to related parties decreased $145 as all amounts due as of December 31, 2014 had been paid prior to December 31, 2015. The December 31, 2014 payable represented amounts due to the Company's former parent, KFSI, or subsidiaries of KFSI. Prior to the Company's IPO on March 31, 2014, the Company operated as a wholly owned subsidiary of KFSI. As a result of this relationship, KFSI had advanced the Company funds consisting of payments made directly to third parties on the Company's behalf as well as allocated inter-company expenses for various shared-services and support. As of January 1, 2015, we were no longer reliant on KFSI for support and other shared services and as such, charges for these services ceased.\nTermination of Management Services Agreement\nOn February 11, 2014, the Company entered into a Management Services Agreement ( MSA\u201d) with 1347 Advisors LLC ( Advisors\u201d), a wholly owned subsidiary of KFSI, under which Advisors provided certain services to the Company, including forecasting, analysis of capital structure and reinsurance programs, consultation in potential future restructuring or capital raising transactions, and consultation in corporate development initiatives. Under the MSA, we paid Advisors a monthly fee equal to 1% of our direct written premiums. For the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company incurred an expense of $22 under the terms of the MSA prior to its termination.\nTable 127: <table> <tr> <td>33 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 128: <table> <tr> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n1347 PROPERTY INSURANCE HOLDINGS, INC.\nThe Company entered into an Agreement to Buyout and Release (the Buyout\u201d) with Advisors which terminated the MSA on February 24, 2015. In consideration for Advisors voluntary termination of the MSA, the Company (i) made a cash payment in the amount of $2,000 to Advisors; (ii) executed and delivered the Performance Shares Grant Agreement to Advisors; (iii) issued to Advisors 120,000 shares of Series B Preferred Stock of the Company (the Preferred Shares\u201d); and (iv) executed and delivered to Advisors a warrant (the Warrant\u201d) to purchase up to 1,500,000 shares of the Company's common stock at an exercise price of fifteen dollars per share. The Warrant expires on February 24, 2022.\nThe Preferred Shares have a par value of twenty five dollars per share and pay annual cumulative dividends at a rate of eight percent per annum. Cumulative dividends accrue, whether or not declared by the Board and irrespective of the legal availability of funds for the payment of dividends. Accrued dividends are to be paid in cash only when, as, and if declared by the Board out of funds legally available therefor or upon a liquidation or redemption of the Preferred Shares. In the event of any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution, or winding up of the Company, the holders of the Preferred Shares then outstanding will be entitled to be paid out of the assets of the Company available for distributions to its shareholders. The Preferred Shares rank senior to the Company's common stock, and the Company is not permitted to issue any other series of preferred stock that ranks equal or senior to the Preferred Shares while the Preferred Shares are outstanding. On February 22, 2016 the Board authorized a dividend payment on the Preferred Shares for shareholders of record as of February 23, 2016. Accordingly, on February 24, 2016, the Company issued a cash payment of $240 to Advisors representing the first annual dividend payment the Company has made on the Preferred Shares.\nUnless redeemed earlier by the Company, as defined below, the Company will be required to redeem the Preferred Shares then outstanding on February 24, 2020 (the Mandatory Redemption Date\u201d), for an amount equal to twenty five dollars per share then outstanding plus all accrued and unpaid dividends. The Company has the option to redeem the Preferred Shares prior to the Mandatory Redemption Date, also at twenty five dollars per share, immediately prior to the consummation of any change in control of the Company that may occur.\nBoth the Preferred Shares and Warrants were issued in a private placement exempt from registration pursuant to Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.\nThe Performance Shares Grant Agreement grants Advisors 100,000 shares of the Company's common stock issuable upon the date that the last sales price of the Company's common stock equals or exceeds ten dollars per share for any twenty trading days within any thirty-day trading period (the Milestone Event\u201d). Advisors will not be entitled to any dividends declared or paid on the Company's stock prior to the Milestone Event having been achieved.\nEffect of Buyout on Financial Condition and Statement of Operations\nUnder the original MSA, we were required to pay Advisors a fee of 1% of written premiums on a monthly basis. The Company replaced this ongoing annuity through the Buyout by providing Advisors with an up-front cash payment and other consideration which lead to a one-time charge of $5,421 to the Company's operations for the year ended December 31, 2015 as follows:\nTable 129: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year ended\nDecember 31, 2015 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Cash paid </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,000 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Issuance of Series B Preferred Shares </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,311 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Issuance of Warrants and Performance Shares </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,010 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Professional fees incurred in connection with the Buyout </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Loss on termination of MSA </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,421 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe issuance of the Warrants and Performance Shares had no effect on the Company's total shareholders' equity as they both resulted in equal and offsetting charges to the Company's retained earnings and additional paid-in capital. We estimated the fair value of the Warrant on grant date based upon the Black-Scholes option pricing model while we utilized a Monte Carlo model to determine the fair value of the Performance Shares due to the fact that these shares are only issuable based upon the achievement of certain market conditions.\nBecause the Preferred Shares have a mandatory redemption provision requiring redemption on February 24, 2020, we were required to classify the Preferred Shares as a liability on our balance sheet instead of recording the value of these shares in equity. The resulting liability was recorded at a discount to the $3,000 ultimate redemption amount of the Preferred Shares based upon an analysis of the cash payments expected to occur under the terms of the Preferred Shares discounted for the Company's estimated cost of equity (13.9%).

Pratt, is a Managing Member and controlling equity holder, invested $2,000 in the Company in exchange for 80,000 Series A Convertible Preferred Shares ( Series A Shares\u201d) of the Company. At the time of their issuance, the value of the common stock into which the Series A Shares was convertible had a fair value greater than the $2,000 proceeds for the issuance. Accordingly, the Company recorded a beneficial conversion feature on the Series A Shares of $500 for the year ended December 31, 2014, which was equivalent to the amount by which the estimated fair value of the common stock issuable upon the conversion of the Series A Shares exceeded the proceeds received upon issuance of the Series A Shares. On March 31, 2014 the Preferred Shares were converted into 312,500 shares of the Company's common stock.\nOn December 1, 2014 our Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program for up to 500,000 shares of our common stock. Through December 31, 2015, we had repurchased an aggregate 223,851 shares under this program at an average cost of $7.73 per share. In November 2015, our Board of Directors approved the continuation of the repurchase program such that we anticipate repurchases to continue to be made periodically through the period ending December 31, 2016.\nTable 134: <table> <tr> <td>35 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 135: <table> <tr> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n1347 PROPERTY INSURANCE HOLDINGS, INC.\nResults of Operations\nYear Ended December 31, 2015 Compared with Year Ended December 31, 2014\nPremiums Written\nThe following table shows our gross premiums written by line of business for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014.\nTable 136: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Line of Business </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2014 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Homeowners </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>29,987 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>22,349 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>7,638 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Special Property </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13,864 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10,314 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,550 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Gross Written Premium </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>43,851 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>32,663 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>11,188 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe increase in direct written premiums can be attributed to the organic growth in voluntary production from our independent agents as well as the addition of assumed business in Texas through our agreement with Brotherhood. Our independent agents wrote approximately $30,174 of premium for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to approximately $22,223 for 2014. Special Property premium written for the year ended December 31, 2015 also includes the benefit of approximately $1,174 in premium assumed through our agreement with Brotherhood. There were no assumed premiums under this arrangement in 2014 as we entered into the Brotherhood agreement in June 2015.\nCeded Premiums Written\nCeded premiums written increased to $13,422 in 2015, compared to $7,934 in 2014. The increase is primarily due to an increase in limits purchased in our excess of loss reinsurance program which increased from $9,500 for the treaty year ended May 31, 2014 to $69,000 for the treaty year ending May 31, 2015. We also purchased reinsurance for aggregate losses. The aggregate treaty increased in coverage from $13,000 to $20,000 for the treaty years ended May 31, 2014 and 2015, respectively.\nEffective June 1, 2015 we entered into a new catastrophe reinsurance program through May 31, 2016. Under the program, for each event occurring within a 144-hour period, we receive reinsurance recoveries of up to $121,000 in excess of $4,000 per event. We have also procured another layer of reinsurance protection that may be used for any event above $121,000, up to a maximum recovery of $15,000. This $15,000 second layer of coverage applies in total for all events occurring during the treaty year. The aggregate loss we would retain for two catastrophes occurring during the treaty year is $5,000. The total cost of our catastrophe coverage is estimated to be approximately $13,000 for the treaty year.\nNet Premium Earned\nThe following table shows our net premiums earned by line of business.\nTable 137: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Line of Business </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2014 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Homeowners </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>19,064 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>12,151 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>6,913 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Special Property </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,870 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,312 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>558 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net premium earned </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>25,934 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>18,463 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>7,471 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe increase in net premiums earned is due primarily to the increase in gross written premiums less premiums ceded as previously discussed.

The increase is primarily due to the acquisition of ClaimCor. ClaimCor generated $270 in claims adjusting revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015. As we acquired ClaimCor on January 2, 2015, there was no comparable revenue for 2014.\nNet losses and loss adjustment expenses\nNet losses and LAE represent both actual payments made and changes in estimated future payments to be made to our policyholders.

We experienced a significant increase in weather-related losses in 2015 due to a wind and hail event which occurred during the last week of April and affected properties we insure Louisiana. The impact of this event alone has accounted for $2,302 of net losses and LAE for the year ending December 31, 2015. Accordingly we have defined this as a catastrophic event as our incurred losses resulting from this storm have exceeded $1,500 and Property Claims Services has assigned this event as CAT 76. Our classification of the event does not have bearing on any reinsurance recovery we may receive, and to date we have not received any recovery related to these storms. As our reinsurance program was structured so that our retention was set at $3,000 for any single event at the time these storms occurred, there will be no recovery on this storm. Other weather-related events accounted for $3,349 in incurred losses for the year, while non-weather events accounted for approximately $4,075 in incurred losses for the year, most of which were the result of fire losses and non-weather related water damage.\nOn February 23, 2016, Louisiana experienced severe storms which produced multiple tornadoes throughout the state. While the ultimate cost and impact on our financial results cannot be determined at this time, we expect to incur significant losses with respect to claims related to wind and other damage resulting from these storms. Our catastrophe reinsurance program is structured so that our retention is set at $4,000 for a single event such as these storms, thus the pre-tax losses incurred by us, net of reinsurance, are not expected to exceed $4,000. We also believe that we may have recoveries available under our per-risk reinsurance program. As of March 14, 2016 our policyholders have reported a total of 210 claims to us as a result of these storms.\nTable 145: <table> <tr> <td>37 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 146: <table> <tr> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n1347 PROPERTY INSURANCE HOLDINGS, INC.\nAmortization of Deferred Policy Acquisition Costs\nAmortization of deferred acquisition costs in 2015 was $6,571, compared to $4,529 for the year ended December 31, 2014. This increase correlates with the increase in earned premiums year over year shown by calculating deferred acquisition cost amortization as a percentage of earned premiums, which was 25.3% for 2015, compared to 24.5% for 2014. The increase in amortization of deferred acquisition costs as a percentage of earned premiums can be attributed to the fact that we began writing business in Texas in 2015, where commission rates tend to be slightly higher than that of Louisiana.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses were $7,253 for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to $5,095 for 2014. General and administrative expenses expressed as a percentage of net premium earned remained relatively constant at 28.0% for 2015 compared to 27.6% for 2014. The year-to-date increase in expense is primarily due to various costs associated with being a publicly held company (for example, legal fees related to our quarterly SEC filings and first annual shareholders meeting held in May 2015 for which there were no comparable charges for the same period 2014, where, during the first quarter of 2014, we operated as a subsidiary of KAI, as well as the fact that we increased our staff from fifteen employees as of December 31, 2014 to twenty-two employees as of December 31, 2015. Furthermore, due to the inclusion of ClaimCor in our consolidated financial statements for 2015, we have incurred $228 in general and administrative expenses associated with the operation of this subsidiary. We also recorded charge of $251 associated with the impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets recorded upon the purchase of ClaimCor to general and administrative expense for the year ended December 31, 2015. Excluding these expenses relating to ClaimCor, our general and administrative expense expressed as a percentage of net premium earned has decreased year over year.\nLoss on Termination of Management Services Agreement\nUpon the termination of the MSA with 1347 Advisors, we recorded a loss of $5,421, representing the estimated fair value of the cash, warrants, preferred shares and performance shares paid to Advisors. For the year ended December 31, 2015, we also recorded a charge in the amount of $282 associated with the amortization of the discount recorded on the preferred shares issued in the transaction. See Related Party Transactions\u201d in the Analysis of Financial Condition above for further information on the termination of the MSA.\nIncome Tax (Benefit) Expense\nIncome tax benefit for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $663 compared to an expense of $2,083 for 2014. The effective rate for income taxes is 28.4% for 2015 compared to 36.4% for 2014. The primary cause of the change in effective rate was due to a non-recurring tax benefit for net operating loss adjustments in 2014 related to the Company's departure from KFSI's consolidated tax group.\nNet Income (Loss)\nAs a result of the foregoing, the Company's net loss for 2015 was $1,673 compared to net income of $3,646 for 2014.\nBeneficial Conversion Feature\nOn January 23, 2014, Fund Management Group LLC, an entity of which the Company's Chairman of the Board, Gordon G. Pratt, is a Managing Member and controlling equity holder, invested $2,000 in the Company in exchange for 80,000 Series A Convertible Preferred Shares ( Series A Shares\u201d) of the Company. At the time of the issuance, the value of the common stock into which the Series A Shares was convertible had a fair value greater than the $2,000 proceeds received for the issuance. Accordingly, the Company recorded a beneficial conversion feature on the Series A Shares of $500 for the year ended December 31, 2014, which was equivalent to the amount by which the estimated fair value of the common stock issuable upon the conversion of the Series A Shares exceeded the proceeds received upon issuance of the shares. On March 31, 2014 the Preferred Shares were converted into 312,500 shares of the Company's common stock.\nTable 147: <table> <tr> <td>38 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 148: <table> <tr> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n1347 PROPERTY INSURANCE HOLDINGS, INC.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nThe purpose of liquidity management is to ensure that there is sufficient cash to meet all financial commitments and obligations as they fall due. The liquidity requirements of the Company and its subsidiaries have been met primarily by funds generated from operations, and from the proceeds from the sales of our common and preferred stock. Cash provided from these sources is used primarily for loss and loss adjustment expense payments and other operating expenses. The timing and amount of payments for net losses and loss adjustment expenses may differ materially from the Company's provisions for loss and loss adjustment expense reserves, which may create increased liquidity requirements.\nCash Flows\nThe following table summarizes the Company's consolidated cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014.\nTable 149: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Summary of Cash Flows </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2014 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net cash provided by operating activities </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,417 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>12,905 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net cash used by investing activities </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(9,368 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(12,534 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net cash (used) provided by financing activities </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,731 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>38,261 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net (decrease) increase in cash and cash equivalents </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(5,682 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>38,632 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nYear ended December 31, 2015\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, net cash provided by operating activities as reported on our consolidated statement of cash flows was $5,417.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nYou should read the following discussion in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes and information included elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K. You should review the Risk Factors\u201d section of this annual report for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis and set forth elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.\nUnless context denotes otherwise, the terms Company,\u201d we,\u201d us,\u201d and our,\u201d refer to 1347 Property Insurance Holdings, Inc., and its subsidiaries. Except where noted otherwise, all dollar amount have been rounded to the nearest thousand.\nOverview\nMaison Insurance Holdings, Inc. was incorporated on October 2, 2012 in the State of Delaware. On November 19, 2013, the Company changed its legal name from Maison Insurance Holdings, Inc. to 1347 Property Insurance Holdings, Inc ( PIH\u201d). PIH is a holding company and is engaged, through its subsidiaries, in the property and casualty insurance business.\nUntil March 31, 2014, we operated as a wholly owned subsidiary of Kingsway America, Inc. ( KAI\u201d). KAI in turn is a wholly owned subsidiary of Kingsway Financial Services, Inc. ( KFSI\u201d), a publicly owned holding company based in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. On March 31, 2014, the Company completed an initial public offering of its common stock and then on June 13, 2014, the Company completed a follow-on offering. Through the combination of the Company's IPO and follow-on offering, we issued approximately five million shares of our common stock. As of December 31, 2015 KAI and companies affiliated with KAI held approximately 1.1 million shares of our common stock, equivalent to 17.5% of our outstanding shares.\nPIH has three wholly-owned subsidiaries; Maison Insurance Company ( Maison\u201d), a Louisiana-domiciled property and casualty insurance company, Maison Managers, Inc. ( MMI\u201d), a managing general agent, incorporated in the State of Delaware on October 2, 2012, and ClaimCor, LLC ( ClaimCor\u201d), a Florida based claims adjusting company.\nMaison writes personal property and casualty insurance in Louisiana and both personal and commercial property and casualty insurance in Texas. Maison provides dwelling policies for wind and hail only, and dwelling, homeowner and mobile home/manufactured home policies for multi-peril property risks.\nMaison distributes its insurance policies through a network of more than 170 producing independent agents in Louisiana and approximately 40 producing independent agents in Texas. These agents typically represent several insurance companies in order to provide various insurance product lines to their clients. The Company refers to these policies as voluntary policies.\nIn addition to the voluntary policies Maison writes, we have participated in the last four rounds of take-outs from Louisiana Citizens Property Insurance Company ( Citizens\u201d), occurring on December 1st of each year. As the State of Louisiana has not historically been in the business of serving as an insurer, an insurance take-out\u201d program was implemented to reduce the number of properties insured by Citizens. Under this take-out program, state-approved insurance companies, such as Maison, have the opportunity to assume insurance policies written by Citizens.\nMaison began writing commercial business in Texas in June 2015, through an alliance with Brotherhood Mutual Insurance Company ( Brotherhood\u201d). Through this alliance, we have assumed wind/hail only exposures on certain churches and related structures Brotherhood insures throughout the State of Texas.\nMMI serves as the Company's management services subsidiary as a general agency providing underwriting, policy administration, claims administration, marketing, accounting and financial and other management services to Maison. MMI contracts with independent agents for policy sales and services, and contracts with an independent third-party for policy administration services. As a managing general agency, MMI is licensed by and subject to the regulatory oversight of both the Louisiana and Texas Departments of Insurance ( LDI\u201d and TDI\u201d, respectively).\n 24 \n \n1347 PROPERTY INSURANCE HOLDINGS, INC.\nWe process claims made by our policyholders both internally, through our wholly-owned subsidiary, ClaimCor, as well as through various third-party claims adjusting companies. MMI has ultimate authority over the claims handling process, while the agents we appoint have no authority to settle our claims or otherwise exercise control over the claims process.\nOur Products\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had approximately 28,400 policies in-force. Of these policies in-force, approximately 32% of our policies are comprised of policies obtained from the Citizens take-out program (most of which are wind/hail only dwelling policies) while the remaining 68% are obtained through our independent agents. In total, 51% of our policies are home-owner multi-peril, approximately 15% are manufactured home policies and approximately 2% are dwelling fire policies.\nHomeowners' Insurance\nOur homeowners' insurance policy is written on an owner occupied dwelling which protects from all perils, except for those specifically excluded from coverage by the policy. It also provides replacement cost coverage on the home and other structures and will provide optional coverage for replacement cost on personal property in the home. It may also offer the option of specifically scheduling individual personal property items for coverage. Additionally, coverage for loss of use of the home until it can be repaired is provided. Personal liability and medical payment coverage to others is included, as well.\nWind/Hail Insurance\nOur wind/hail insurance policy is written on an owner or non-owner occupied dwelling which protects from the perils of wind and/or hail-only weather events. This policy type may also provide coverage for personal property, but only for specific types of coverage. It provides replacement cost or actual cash value coverage on the home and other structures depending on the form under which the policy is written. Personal property in the home is written at actual cash value. Additionally, coverage for loss of use of the home is provided.\nManufactured Home Insurance\nOur manufactured home insurance policy is written on a manufactured or mobile home and is similar to both the homeowners' insurance policy and the dwelling fire policy. The policy can provide for coverage on the manufactured home, the insured's personal property in the home and liability and medical payments can be included. Furthermore, our manufactured home policies can be endorsed to include coverage for flood and earthquake (coverage for these perils is not available under our other policy types; as of December 31, 2015 approximately 3,500 of our manufactured home policies include this endorsement). The policy can also be written on either owner occupied or non-owner occupied units. Property coverage can be written on an actual cash value or stated amount basis with an optional replacement cost coverage available for partial loss. There are several other optional coverages that can be included and residential and commercial-use rental units can be written along with seasonal use mobile homes or homes that are used for part of the year.\nDwelling Fire Insurance\nOur dwelling fire policy can be issued on an owner occupied or non-owner (tenant) occupied dwelling property. It will also provide coverage against all types of loss unless the peril causing the loss is specifically excluded in the policy. Losses from vandalism and malicious mischief are also included in the coverage. All claims and losses on a dwelling are covered on a replacement cost basis and additional coverage for personal property (contents) can also be added. Personal liability and medical payments to others may be included on an optional basis.\nOur policy counts by type as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 are as follows:\n\n 25 \n \n1347 PROPERTY INSURANCE HOLDINGS, INC.\nWe do not consider the commercial wind/hail only book of business we have written in Texas in our policies-in-force count as of December 31, 2015 since we have assumed this business through our alliance with Brotherhood. As of December 31, 2015, we have assumed wind/hail coverage on 495 policies in Texas through this agreement.\nMaison insures personal property located in 63 of the 64 parishes in Louisiana. As of December 31, 2015, these policies are concentrated within these parishes as follows: Jefferson Parish 17.7%, Saint Tammany Parish 15.9%, East Baton Rouge Parish 7.3%, Orleans Parish 6.8%, Terrebonne Parish 6.2%, Livingston Parish 5.2%, and Tangipahoa Parish 5.1%. No other parish individually has over 5.0% of the policies in force as of December 31, 2015. The remaining 56 parishes combine to equal 35.1% of the total Louisiana policies in force as of December 31, 2015. On a direct basis, Maison writes in 44 of the 254 counties that comprise the State of Texas, however no single county represents over 5.0% of our policies in force as of December 31, 2015.\nNon-U.S. GAAP Financial Measures\nThe Company assesses its results of operations using certain non-U.S. GAAP financial measures, in addition to U.S. GAAP financial measures. These non-U.S. GAAP financial measures consist of underwriting ratios and are defined below. The Company believes these non-U.S. GAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating performance in the same manner as management does.\nThe non-U.S. GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for or superior to, any financial measures prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The Company's non-U.S. GAAP financial measures may be defined differently from time to time and may be defined differently than similar terms used by other companies, and accordingly, care should be exercised in understanding how we define our non-U.S. GAAP financial measures.\nUnderwriting Ratios\nThe Company, like many insurance companies, analyzes performance based on underwriting ratios such as loss ratio, expense ratio and combined ratio. The loss ratio is derived by dividing the amount of net losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred by net premiums earned. The expense ratio is derived by dividing the sum of amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs and general and administrative expenses incurred by net premiums earned. All items included in the loss and expense ratios are presented in the Company's U.S. GAAP financial statements. The combined ratio is the sum of the loss ratio and the expense ratio. A combined ratio below 100% demonstrates an underwriting profit whereas a combined ratio over 100% demonstrates an underwriting loss.\nCritical Accounting Estimates and Assumptions\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses for the reporting period. Actual results could differ from these estimates. Estimates and their underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Changes in estimates are recorded in the accounting period in which they are determined. The critical accounting estimates and assumptions in the accompanying consolidated financial statements include the provision for loss and loss adjustment expense reserves, the valuation of fixed income securities, the valuation of net deferred income taxes, the valuation of various securities we have issued in conjunction with the termination of the management services agreement with 1347 Advisors, LLC, the valuation of deferred policy acquisition costs and stock-based compensation expense.\nProvision for Loss and Loss Adjustment Expense Reserves\nA significant degree of judgment is required to determine amounts recorded in the consolidated financial statements for the provision for loss and loss adjustment expense reserves. The process for establishing the provision for loss and loss adjustment expense reserves reflects the uncertainties and significant judgmental factors inherent in predicting future results of both known and unknown loss events. As such, the process is inherently complex and imprecise and estimates are constantly refined. The process of establishing the provision for loss and loss adjustment expense reserves relies on the judgment and opinions of a large number of individuals, including the opinions of the Company's independent actuaries.\nFactors affecting the provision for loss and loss adjustment expense reserves include the continually evolving and changing regulatory and legal environment, actuarial studies, professional experience and expertise of the Company's claims departments' personnel and independent adjusters retained to handle individual claims, the quality of the data used for projection purposes, existing claims management practices including claims handling and settlement practices, the effect of inflationary trends on future loss settlement costs, court decisions, economic conditions and public attitudes.\n 26 \n \n1347 PROPERTY INSURANCE HOLDINGS, INC.\nIn the actuarial review process, an analysis of the provision for loss and loss adjustment expense reserves is completed for the Company's insurance subsidiary. Unpaid losses, allocated loss adjustment expenses and unallocated loss adjustment expenses are separately analyzed by line of business or coverage by accident year. A wide range of actuarial methods are utilized in order to appropriately measure ultimate loss and loss adjustment expense costs. These methods include paid loss development, incurred loss development and frequency-severity method. Reasonability tests such as ultimate loss ratio trends and ultimate allocated loss adjustment expense to ultimate loss are also performed prior to selection of the final provision. The provision is indicated by line of business or coverage and is separated into case reserves, reserves for losses incurred but not reported ( IBNR\u201d) and a provision for loss adjustment expenses ( LAE\u201d).\nBecause the establishment of the provision for loss and loss adjustment expense reserves is an inherently uncertain process involving estimates, current provisions may need to be updated. Adjustments to the provision, both favorable and unfavorable, are reflected in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss) for the periods in which such estimates are updated. Management determines the loss and loss adjustment expense reserves as recorded on the Company's financial statements, while the Company's independent actuaries develop a range of reasonable estimates and a point estimate of loss and loss adjustment expense reserves. The actuarial point estimate is intended to represent the actuaries' best estimate and will not necessarily be at the mid-point of the high and low estimates of the range.\nValuation of Fixed Income Securities\nThe Company's fixed income securities are recorded at fair value using observable inputs such as quoted prices in inactive markets, quoted prices in active markets for similar instruments, benchmark interest rates, broker quotes and other relevant inputs. The Company does not have any fixed income investments in our portfolio which require the Company to use unobservable inputs. Any change in the estimated fair value of its investments could impact the amount of unrealized gain or loss the Company has recorded, which could change the amount the Company has recorded for its investments and other comprehensive loss on its consolidated balance sheets and statements of comprehensive income (loss).\nGains and losses realized on the disposition of investments are determined on the first-in first-out basis and credited or charged to the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss). Premium and discount on investments are amortized and accreted using the interest method and charged or credited to net investment income.\nThe Company performs a quarterly analysis of its investment portfolio to determine if declines in market value are other-than-temporary. Further information regarding its detailed analysis and factors considered in establishing an other-than-temporary impairment on an investment is discussed within Note 4 - Investments, to the consolidated financial statements.\nValuation of Net Deferred Income Taxes\nThe provision for income taxes is calculated based on the expected tax treatment of transactions recorded in the Company's consolidated financial statements. In determining its provision for income taxes, the Company interprets tax legislation in a variety of jurisdictions and makes assumptions about the expected timing of the reversal of deferred income tax assets and liabilities and the valuation of net deferred income taxes.\nThe ultimate realization of the deferred income tax asset balance is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which the Company's temporary differences reverse and become deductible. A valuation allowance is established when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred income tax asset balance will not be realized. In determining whether a valuation allowance is needed, management considers all available positive and negative evidence affecting specific deferred income tax asset balances, including the Company's past and anticipated future performance, the reversal of deferred income tax liabilities, and the availability of tax planning strategies. To the extent a valuation allowance is established in a period, an expense must be recorded within the income tax provision in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss).\n 27 \n \n1347 PROPERTY INSURANCE HOLDINGS, INC.\nThe Company carries a net deferred income tax asset of $506 and $263 at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, all of which the Company believes is more likely than not to be fully realized based upon management's assessment of future taxable income.\nSecurities issued to 1347 Advisors, LLC\nPursuant to the termination of the Management Services Agreement with 1347 Advisors LLC ( Advisors,\u201d a wholly-owned subsidiary of KFSI), the Company issued Preferred Shares, Warrants, and entered into a Performance Share Grant Agreement with Advisors on February 24, 2015. Additional information regarding the termination of the Management Services Agreement with Advisors can be found under Related Party Transactions\u201d in Item 7 of this Report.\nBecause the Preferred Shares have a mandatory redemption provision requiring redemption on February 24, 2020, the Company was required to classify the Preferred Shares as a liability on its balance sheet as opposed to recording the value of the shares in equity. The resulting liability was recorded at a discount to the $4,200 ultimate redemption amount which includes all dividends to be paid on the Preferred Shares based upon an analysis of the timing and amounts of the cash payments expected to occur under the terms of the Preferred Shares discounted for the Company's estimated cost of equity (13.9%). As a result, amortization in amount of $1,889 will be charged to operations through February 24, 2020 using the effective interest method.\nThe Company estimated the fair value of the Warrants on grant date based upon the Black-Scholes option pricing model while it utilized a Monte Carlo model to determine the fair value of the Performance Share Grant Agreement due to the fact that the underlying shares are only issuable based upon the achievement of certain market conditions.\nDeferred Policy Acquisition Costs\nDeferred policy acquisition costs represent the deferral of expenses that the Company incurs related to successful efforts to acquire new business or renew existing business. Acquisition costs, primarily commissions, premium taxes and underwriting and agency expenses related to issuing insurance policies are deferred and charged against income ratably over the terms of the related insurance policies. Management regularly reviews the categories of acquisition costs that are deferred and assesses the recoverability of this asset. Costs associated with unsuccessful efforts or costs that cannot be tied directly to a successful policy acquisition are expensed as incurred, as opposed to being deferred and amortized as the premium is earned.\nStock-Based Compensation Expense\nThe Company uses the fair-value method of accounting for stock-based compensation awards granted. The Company determines the fair value of the stock options on their grant date using the Black-Scholes option pricing model and determines the fair value of restricted stock units on their grant date using multiple Monte Carlo simulations. The fair value of these awards is recorded as compensation expense over the requisite service period, which is generally the expected period over which the awards will vest, with a corresponding increase to additional paid-in capital. When the stock options are exercised, or correspondingly, when the restricted stock units vest, the amount of proceeds together with the amount recorded in additional paid-in capital is recorded in shareholders' equity.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 3 - Recently Issued Accounting Standards in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements and their effect, if any, on the Company.\n 28 \n \n1347 PROPERTY INSURANCE HOLDINGS, INC.\nAnalysis of Financial Condition\nAs of December 31, 2015 compared to December 31, 2014\nInvestments\nThe Company's investments in fixed income securities are classified as available-for-sale and are reported at estimated fair value. The Company holds an investment portfolio comprised primarily of fixed income securities issued by the U.S. Government, government agencies and high quality corporate issuers. The portfolio is managed by a third-party investment management firm in accordance with the investment policies and guidelines approved by Maison's Board of Directors. These guidelines stress the preservation of capital, market liquidity and the diversification of risk. Investments held by the Company's insurance subsidiary must also comply with applicable domiciliary state regulations that prescribe the type, quality and concentration of investments. Furthermore, pursuant to the certificate of authority we received from the TDI, we are required to deposit securities with the State of Texas. These securities consist of the fixed income securities listed in the tables below and have both an amortized cost basis and estimated fair value of $2,002 as of December 31, 2015.\nThe table below summarizes, by type, the Company's investments as of December 31, 2015 and 2014.\n\nThe Company's other investments are comprised of investments in two limited partnerships which seek to provide equity and asset-backed debt investment in a variety of privately-owned companies. The Company has committed to a total investment of $1,000, of which the limited partnerships have drawn down approximately $248 through December 31, 2015. The Company has accounted for its investments under the cost method as the instruments do not have readily determinable fair values and the Company does not exercise significant influence over the operations of the limited partnerships or the underlying privately-owned companies.\nLiquidity and Cash Flow Risk\nThe table below summarizes the fair value of the Company's fixed income securities by contractual maturity as of December 31, 2015 and 2014. Actual results may differ as issuers may have the right to call or prepay obligations, with or without penalties, prior to the contractual maturity of these obligations.\n\nAt December 31, 2015, approximately 56.5% of the Company's fixed income securities had contractual maturities of five years or less. The Company holds cash and high-grade short-term assets which, along with fixed income securities, management believes are sufficient in amount for the payment of loss and loss adjustment expense reserves and other operating subsidiary obligations on a timely basis. The Company may not be able to liquidate its investments in the event that additional cash is required to meet obligations to its policyholders, however, the Company believes that the high-quality, liquid investments in the portfolios provide it with sufficient liquidity.\n 29 \n \n1347 PROPERTY INSURANCE HOLDINGS, INC.\nMarket Risk\nMarket risk is the risk that the Company will incur losses due to adverse changes in interest or currency exchange rates and equity prices. Given the Company's operations only invest in U.S. dollar denominated instruments and maintain a relatively insignificant investment in equity instruments, its primary market risk exposures in the investments portfolio are to changes in interest rates.\nBecause the investments portfolio is comprised of primarily fixed maturity instruments that are usually held to maturity, periodic changes in interest rate levels generally impact the Company's financial results to the extent that the investments are recorded at market value and reinvestment yields are different than the original yields on maturing instruments. During periods of rising interest rates, the market values of the existing fixed income securities will generally decrease. The reverse is true during periods of declining interest rates.\nCredit Risk\nCredit risk is defined as the risk of financial loss due to failure of the other party to a financial instrument to discharge an obligation. Credit risk arises from the Company's positions in short-term investments, corporate debt instruments and government bonds.\nAt December 31, 2015 and 2014, the Company's debt securities had the following quality ratings as assigned by Standard and Poor's ( S&P\u201d) or Moody's Investors Service ( Moody's\u201d).\n\nOther-Than-Temporary Impairment\nThe length of time an individual investment may be held in an unrealized loss position may vary based on the opinion of the investment manager and their respective analyses related to valuation and to the various credit risks that may prevent the Company from recapturing the principal investment. In the case of an individual investment with a maturity date where the investment manager determines that there is little or no risk of default prior to the maturity of a holding, the Company would elect to hold the investment in an unrealized loss position until the price recovers or the investment matures. In situations where facts emerge that might increase the risk associated with recapture of principal, the Company may elect to sell investments at a loss.\nThe Company performs a quarterly analysis of its investment portfolio to determine if declines in market value are other-than-temporary. Further information regarding the Company's detailed analysis and factors considered in establishing an other-than-temporary impairment on an investment is discussed within Note 4 - Investments,\u201d to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this report.\nAs a result of the analysis performed by the Company, there were no write-downs for other-than-temporary impairments related to investments for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014.\nAt December 31, 2015, the gross unrealized losses for fixed income securities amounted to $95, and there were no unrealized losses attributable to non-investment grade fixed income securities. At both December 31, 2015 and 2014, all unrealized losses on individual investments were considered temporary. Fixed income securities in unrealized loss positions continued to pay interest and were not subject to material changes in their respective debt ratings. The Company concluded the declines in value were considered temporary. As the Company has the capacity to hold these investments to maturity, no impairment provision was considered necessary.\nDeferred Policy Acquisition Costs\nThe Company's deferred policy acquisition costs ( DPAC\u201d) include commissions, premium taxes, assessments and other policy processing fees and represent those costs related to acquiring the premiums the Company has yet to earn (the unearned premium reserve). DPAC increased $939, to $4,030 as of December 31, 2015 compared to $3,091 as of December 31, 2014, corresponding to an increase in our unearned premium reserves over the same period.\n 30 \n \n1347 PROPERTY INSURANCE HOLDINGS, INC.\nPremiums Receivable, Net of Allowance for Doubtful Accounts\nPremiums receivable, net of allowance for credit losses, increased by $309 to $2,395 as of December 31, 2015 from $2,086 as of December 31, 2014. This increase was primarily attributable to the timing of payments received on premium written in December of each year. Premiums written for the month of December 2015 increased by approximately $483 when compared to premiums written in December 2014, leading to a corresponding increase in the amount of premium receivable from our agents and policyholders.\nCeded Unearned Premiums\nCeded unearned premiums represents the unexpired portion of premiums which have been paid to the Company's reinsurers. Ceded unearned premiums are charged to income over the terms of the respective reinsurance treaties. Ceded unearned premiums increased $1,244 to $2,805 as of December 31, 2015 from $1,561 as of December 31, 2014. Our reinsurance treaties generally run from June 1st to May 31st of each year, thus our current treaties in place were negotiated as of June 1, 2015 requiring an upfront deposit of unearned premium each quarter. We also enhanced our catastrophe program so that our aggregate limit of coverage increased from $92,000 in place as of December 31, 2014 to $140,000 in place as of December 31, 2015. Furthermore, the premium we pay for reinsurance is based upon the total insured value ( TIV\u201d) of our book of business as of September 30th of each year. As our TIV has increased year over year, so has the amount of premium we cede to our reinsurers, accounting for the increase in ceded unearned premiums between periods.\nReinsurance Recoverable on Reserves\nReinsurance recoverable on reserves represents amounts due to the Company, or expected to be due to the Company from our reinsurers, based upon claims and claim reserves which have exceeded the retention amount under our reinsurance treaties. As of December 31, 2015 we have recorded an expected recovery of $120 from our reinsurers, compared to $363 as of December 31, 2014. See Loss and Loss Adjustment Expense Reserves\u201d in Item 7 of this report for the expected recovery by policy type.\nFunds Deposited with Reinsured Companies\nFunds deposited with reinsured companies represents collateral we have placed on deposit with Brotherhood based upon our quota-share agreement to reinsure a portion of Brotherhood's business for wind/hail coverage only. Pursuant to the agreement, we are required to fund our pro-rata portion of reserves Brotherhood has established for unearned premium, losses and loss adjustments expenses, and any other amounts for which Brotherhood may not be able to take credit for on its annual statutory financial statements filed with the appropriate insurance regulatory authority. We may fund this obligation via cash advance, trust agreement, or letter of credit. Accordingly, we have placed $725 on deposit under a trust agreement as of December 31, 2015. As our quota-share agreement with Brotherhood commenced in June 2015, there was no associated collateral in place as of December 31, 2014.\nCurrent Income Taxes Recoverable/Payable\nCurrent income taxes recoverable were $965 as of December 31, 2015, compared to a current payable of $262 as of December 31, 2014, representing the estimate of both the Company's state and federal income taxes to be recovered/due for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, less estimated payments made during each year.\nNet Deferred Tax Asset\nThe Company's net deferred tax asset increased $243, to $506 as of December 31, 2015 from $263 as of December 31, 2014. The net deferred tax asset is comprised of approximately $2,310 and $1,595 of deferred tax assets, net of approximately $1,804 and $1,332 of deferred tax liabilities as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The change in the net deferred tax asset is primarily due to the increase in the deferred tax assets associated with our unearned premium reserve.\nProperty and Equipment\nProperty and equipment was $234 and $237 as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, and consists of computers, office equipment, and improvements at our leased facilities in Tampa, Florida and Baton Rouge, Louisiana, shown net of accumulated depreciation. Also included in the balance as of December 31, 2015 are vehicles we have purchased for the use of our sales representatives in the state of Texas. Our policy for the capitalization and depreciation of these assets can be found in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements found in Item 8 of this report.\n 31 \n \n1347 PROPERTY INSURANCE HOLDINGS, INC.\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets\nOn January 2, 2015, we acquired a 100% interest in ClaimCor, a Florida domiciled company in the business of adjusting property and casualty insurance claims. Under the terms of the agreement to purchase ClaimCor, the purchase price equaled $323, which we paid in cash, at closing. Pursuant to the purchase agreement, the prior managing members of ClaimCor entered into a non-compete agreement with us, whereby the members cannot engage in, continue in, or carry on any business that competes with ClaimCor for a period of three years from the date in which the transaction closed.\nAs a result of the purchase, we recorded goodwill in the amount of $211 on our consolidated balance sheet as of January 2, 2015. The goodwill was not amortized, but rather subject to impairment testing on, at minimum, an annual basis. We also recognized the estimated fair value of the non-compete agreement as well as a customer base asset as part of the ClaimCor acquisition at a combined total of $52 as of January 2, 2015. The non-compete agreement will be amortized over its 3-year contractual life, while the customer base asset was to be amortized over an estimated useful-life of 5 years.\nIn December 2015, after analyzing ClaimCor's performance in comparison to management's expectations and forecasts at the time of acquisition, we noted that an impairment to the value of the goodwill and other intangibles we recorded was likely. Accordingly, our analysis resulted in a charge of $246 in the quarter ending December 31, 2015 associated with the impairment of goodwill and the customer base asset. As of December 31, 2015, the carrying value of the Company's intangible assets was $6 representing the unamortized balance of the non-compete agreement recorded as part of the acquisition.\nOther Assets\nOther assets increased $423, to $705 as of December 31, 2015 from $282 as of December 31, 2014. The major components of other assets, as well as the change therein, are shown below.\n\nLoss and Loss Adjustment Expense Reserves\nLoss and loss adjustment expense reserves represent the estimated liabilities for reported loss events, incurred but not reported ( IBNR\u201d) loss events and the related estimated loss adjustment expenses gross of amounts expected to be recovered from reinsurance. The table below separates our loss reserves and LAE between IBNR and case specific estimates as of December 31, 2015 and 2014.\n\n(1) Homeowners refers to our multi-peril policies for traditional dwellings as well as mobile and manufactures homes.\n(2) Special Property includes both our Fire and Allied lines of business, which are primarily wind/hail only products and also includes the commercial wind/hail only business we have assumed through our agreement with Brotherhood.\n 32 \n \n1347 PROPERTY INSURANCE HOLDINGS, INC.\nUnfavorable development for loss and LAE reserves from prior accident years was $205 for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2014, the Company reported $182 of favorable development for loss and LAE reserves from prior accident years.\nThe Company cannot predict whether loss and loss adjustment expense reserves will develop favorably or unfavorably from the amounts reported in the Company's consolidated financial statements. Any such development could have a material effect on the Company's consolidated financial results for a given period.\nUnearned Premium Reserves\nUnearned premium reserves increased $5,739 to $23,442 as of December 31, 2015 compared to $17,703 as of December 31, 2014. The following table outlines the change in unearned premium reserves by line of business.\n\nThe Company's increase to its unearned premium reserve is directly related to the increase in written premiums year over year.\nCeded Reinsurance Premiums Payable\nCeded reinsurance premiums payable increased $724 to $3,283 as of December 31, 2015 compared to $2,559 as of December 31, 2014 primarily as a result of the timing of payments due under our reinsurance programs. The bulk of the balance payable as of December 31, 2015 represents the quarterly payment due under our catastrophe reinsurance program, which was paid in January 2016.\nAgent Commissions Payable\nAgent commissions payable increased $80 to $403 as of December 31, 2015 compared to $323 as of December 31, 2014. As agent commissions are paid in arrears, this balance represents commissions owed to the Company's independent agents on policies written in December of each year, and corresponds directly with the increase in premiums written by our agents when comparing December 2015 to December 2014.\nPremiums Collected in Advance\nPremium deposits were $870 and $560 and represent cash the Company has received for policies which were not yet in-force as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 respectively. Upon the effective date of coverage, advance premiums are reclassified to the unearned premium reserve account.\nRelated Party Transactions\nDue to Related Party\nAmounts due to related parties decreased $145 as all amounts due as of December 31, 2014 had been paid prior to December 31, 2015. The December 31, 2014 payable represented amounts due to the Company's former parent, KFSI, or subsidiaries of KFSI. Prior to the Company's IPO on March 31, 2014, the Company operated as a wholly owned subsidiary of KFSI. As a result of this relationship, KFSI had advanced the Company funds consisting of payments made directly to third parties on the Company's behalf as well as allocated inter-company expenses for various shared-services and support. As of January 1, 2015, we were no longer reliant on KFSI for support and other shared services and as such, charges for these services ceased.\nTermination of Management Services Agreement\nOn February 11, 2014, the Company entered into a Management Services Agreement ( MSA\u201d) with 1347 Advisors LLC ( Advisors\u201d), a wholly owned subsidiary of KFSI, under which Advisors provided certain services to the Company, including forecasting, analysis of capital structure and reinsurance programs, consultation in potential future restructuring or capital raising transactions, and consultation in corporate development initiatives. Under the MSA, we paid Advisors a monthly fee equal to 1% of our direct written premiums. For the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company incurred an expense of $22 under the terms of the MSA prior to its termination.\n 33 \n \n1347 PROPERTY INSURANCE HOLDINGS, INC.\nThe Company entered into an Agreement to Buyout and Release (the Buyout\u201d) with Advisors which terminated the MSA on February 24, 2015. In consideration for Advisors voluntary termination of the MSA, the Company (i) made a cash payment in the amount of $2,000 to Advisors; (ii) executed and delivered the Performance Shares Grant Agreement to Advisors; (iii) issued to Advisors 120,000 shares of Series B Preferred Stock of the Company (the Preferred Shares\u201d); and (iv) executed and delivered to Advisors a warrant (the Warrant\u201d) to purchase up to 1,500,000 shares of the Company's common stock at an exercise price of fifteen dollars per share. The Warrant expires on February 24, 2022.\nThe Preferred Shares have a par value of twenty five dollars per share and pay annual cumulative dividends at a rate of eight percent per annum. Cumulative dividends accrue, whether or not declared by the Board and irrespective of the legal availability of funds for the payment of dividends. Accrued dividends are to be paid in cash only when, as, and if declared by the Board out of funds legally available therefor or upon a liquidation or redemption of the Preferred Shares. In the event of any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution, or winding up of the Company, the holders of the Preferred Shares then outstanding will be entitled to be paid out of the assets of the Company available for distributions to its shareholders. The Preferred Shares rank senior to the Company's common stock, and the Company is not permitted to issue any other series of preferred stock that ranks equal or senior to the Preferred Shares while the Preferred Shares are outstanding. On February 22, 2016 the Board authorized a dividend payment on the Preferred Shares for shareholders of record as of February 23, 2016. Accordingly, on February 24, 2016, the Company issued a cash payment of $240 to Advisors representing the first annual dividend payment the Company has made on the Preferred Shares.\nUnless redeemed earlier by the Company, as defined below, the Company will be required to redeem the Preferred Shares then outstanding on February 24, 2020 (the Mandatory Redemption Date\u201d), for an amount equal to twenty five dollars per share then outstanding plus all accrued and unpaid dividends. The Company has the option to redeem the Preferred Shares prior to the Mandatory Redemption Date, also at twenty five dollars per share, immediately prior to the consummation of any change in control of the Company that may occur.\nBoth the Preferred Shares and Warrants were issued in a private placement exempt from registration pursuant to Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.\nThe Performance Shares Grant Agreement grants Advisors 100,000 shares of the Company's common stock issuable upon the date that the last sales price of the Company's common stock equals or exceeds ten dollars per share for any twenty trading days within any thirty-day trading period (the Milestone Event\u201d). Advisors will not be entitled to any dividends declared or paid on the Company's stock prior to the Milestone Event having been achieved.\nEffect of Buyout on Financial Condition and Statement of Operations\nUnder the original MSA, we were required to pay Advisors a fee of 1% of written premiums on a monthly basis. The Company replaced this ongoing annuity through the Buyout by providing Advisors with an up-front cash payment and other consideration which lead to a one-time charge of $5,421 to the Company's operations for the year ended December 31, 2015 as follows:\n\nThe issuance of the Warrants and Performance Shares had no effect on the Company's total shareholders' equity as they both resulted in equal and offsetting charges to the Company's retained earnings and additional paid-in capital. We estimated the fair value of the Warrant on grant date based upon the Black-Scholes option pricing model while we utilized a Monte Carlo model to determine the fair value of the Performance Shares due to the fact that these shares are only issuable based upon the achievement of certain market conditions.\nBecause the Preferred Shares have a mandatory redemption provision requiring redemption on February 24, 2020, we were required to classify the Preferred Shares as a liability on our balance sheet instead of recording the value of these shares in equity. The resulting liability was recorded at a discount to the $3,000 ultimate redemption amount of the Preferred Shares based upon an analysis of the cash payments expected to occur under the terms of the Preferred Shares discounted for the Company's estimated cost of equity (13.9%). As a result, amortization in the amount of $1,889 will be charged to operations through February 24, 2020 using the effective interest method. For the year ended December 31, 2015, amortization of the discount on the Preferred Shares totaled $282.\n 34 \n \n1347 PROPERTY INSURANCE HOLDINGS, INC.\nAccounts Payable and Other Accrued Expenses\nAccounts payable and other accrued expenses increased $306, to $1,863 as of December 31, 2015 compared to $1,557 as of December 31, 2014. The major components of accounts payable and other accrued expenses, as well as the change therein, are shown below.\n\nOff Balance Sheet Arrangements\nNone.\nContractual Obligations\nAs of December 31, 2015, the Company had the following amounts due under its operating leases for facilities in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, and Tampa, Florida.\n\nShareholders' Equity\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2014 we issued approximately five million shares of our common stock through the combination of our IPO on March 31, 2014, as well as our follow on offering on June 13, 2014 which resulted in approximately $36,261 in net proceeds to the Company.\nOn January 23, 2014, Fund Management Group LLC, an entity of which the Company's Chairman of the Board, Gordon G. Pratt, is a Managing Member and controlling equity holder, invested $2,000 in the Company in exchange for 80,000 Series A Convertible Preferred Shares ( Series A Shares\u201d) of the Company. At the time of their issuance, the value of the common stock into which the Series A Shares was convertible had a fair value greater than the $2,000 proceeds for the issuance. Accordingly, the Company recorded a beneficial conversion feature on the Series A Shares of $500 for the year ended December 31, 2014, which was equivalent to the amount by which the estimated fair value of the common stock issuable upon the conversion of the Series A Shares exceeded the proceeds received upon issuance of the Series A Shares. On March 31, 2014 the Preferred Shares were converted into 312,500 shares of the Company's common stock.\nOn December 1, 2014 our Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program for up to 500,000 shares of our common stock. Through December 31, 2015, we had repurchased an aggregate 223,851 shares under this program at an average cost of $7.73 per share. In November 2015, our Board of Directors approved the continuation of the repurchase program such that we anticipate repurchases to continue to be made periodically through the period ending December 31, 2016.\n 35 \n \n1347 PROPERTY INSURANCE HOLDINGS, INC.\nResults of Operations\nYear Ended December 31, 2015 Compared with Year Ended December 31, 2014\nPremiums Written\nThe following table shows our gross premiums written by line of business for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014.\n\nThe increase in direct written premiums can be attributed to the organic growth in voluntary production from our independent agents as well as the addition of assumed business in Texas through our agreement with Brotherhood. Our independent agents wrote approximately $30,174 of premium for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to approximately $22,223 for 2014. Special Property premium written for the year ended December 31, 2015 also includes the benefit of approximately $1,174 in premium assumed through our agreement with Brotherhood. There were no assumed premiums under this arrangement in 2014 as we entered into the Brotherhood agreement in June 2015.\nCeded Premiums Written\nCeded premiums written increased to $13,422 in 2015, compared to $7,934 in 2014. The increase is primarily due to an increase in limits purchased in our excess of loss reinsurance program which increased from $9,500 for the treaty year ended May 31, 2014 to $69,000 for the treaty year ending May 31, 2015. We also purchased reinsurance for aggregate losses. The aggregate treaty increased in coverage from $13,000 to $20,000 for the treaty years ended May 31, 2014 and 2015, respectively.\nEffective June 1, 2015 we entered into a new catastrophe reinsurance program through May 31, 2016. Under the program, for each event occurring within a 144-hour period, we receive reinsurance recoveries of up to $121,000 in excess of", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nYou should read the following discussion in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes and information included elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K. You should review the Risk Factors\u201d section of this annual report for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis and set forth elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.\nUnless context denotes otherwise, the terms Company,\u201d we,\u201d us,\u201d and our,\u201d refer to 1347 Property Insurance Holdings, Inc., and its subsidiaries. Except where noted otherwise, all dollar amount have been rounded to the nearest thousand.\nOverview\nMaison Insurance Holdings, Inc. was incorporated on October 2, 2012 in the State of Delaware. On November 19, 2013, the Company changed its legal name from Maison Insurance Holdings, Inc. to 1347 Property Insurance Holdings, Inc ( PIH\u201d). PIH is a holding company and is engaged, through its subsidiaries, in the property and casualty insurance business.\nUntil March 31, 2014, we operated as a wholly owned subsidiary of Kingsway America, Inc. ( KAI\u201d). KAI in turn is a wholly owned subsidiary of Kingsway Financial Services, Inc. ( KFSI\u201d), a publicly owned holding company based in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. On March 31, 2014, the Company completed an initial public offering of its common stock and then on June 13, 2014, the Company completed a follow-on offering. Through the combination of the Company's IPO and follow-on offering, we issued approximately five million shares of our common stock. As of December 31, 2015 KAI and companies affiliated with KAI held approximately 1.1 million shares of our common stock, equivalent to 17.5% of our outstanding shares.\nPIH has three wholly-owned subsidiaries; Maison Insurance Company ( Maison\u201d), a Louisiana-domiciled property and casualty insurance company, Maison Managers, Inc. ( MMI\u201d), a managing general agent, incorporated in the State of Delaware on October 2, 2012, and ClaimCor, LLC ( ClaimCor\u201d), a Florida based claims adjusting company.\nMaison writes personal property and casualty insurance in Louisiana and both personal and commercial property and casualty insurance in Texas. Maison provides dwelling policies for wind and hail only, and dwelling, homeowner and mobile home/manufactured home policies for multi-peril property risks.\nMaison distributes its insurance policies through a network of more than 170 producing independent agents in Louisiana and approximately 40 producing independent agents in Texas. These agents typically represent several insurance companies in order to provide various insurance product lines to their clients. The Company refers to these policies as voluntary policies.\nIn addition to the voluntary policies Maison writes, we have participated in the last four rounds of take-outs from Louisiana Citizens Property Insurance Company ( Citizens\u201d), occurring on December 1st of each year. As the State of Louisiana has not historically been in the business of serving as an insurer, an insurance take-out\u201d program was implemented to reduce the number of properties insured by Citizens. Under this take-out program, state-approved insurance companies, such as Maison, have the opportunity to assume insurance policies written by Citizens.\nMaison began writing commercial business in Texas in June 2015, through an alliance with Brotherhood Mutual Insurance Company ( Brotherhood\u201d). Through this alliance, we have assumed wind/hail only exposures on certain churches and related structures Brotherhood insures throughout the State of Texas.\nMMI serves as the Company's management services subsidiary as a general agency providing underwriting, policy administration, claims administration, marketing, accounting and financial and other management services to Maison. MMI contracts with independent agents for policy sales and services, and contracts with an independent third-party for policy administration services. As a managing general agency, MMI is licensed by and subject to the regulatory oversight of both the Louisiana and Texas Departments of Insurance ( LDI\u201d and TDI\u201d, respectively).\n 24 \n \n1347 PROPERTY INSURANCE HOLDINGS, INC.\nWe process claims made by our policyholders both internally, through our wholly-owned subsidiary, ClaimCor, as well as through various third-party claims adjusting companies. MMI has ultimate authority over the claims handling process, while the agents we appoint have no authority to settle our claims or otherwise exercise control over the claims process.\nOur Products\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had approximately 28,400 policies in-force. Of these policies in-force, approximately 32% of our policies are comprised of policies obtained from the Citizens take-out program (most of which are wind/hail only dwelling policies) while the remaining 68% are obtained through our independent agents. In total, 51% of our policies are home-owner multi-peril, approximately 15% are manufactured home policies and approximately 2% are dwelling fire policies.\nHomeowners' Insurance\nOur homeowners' insurance policy is written on an owner occupied dwelling which protects from all perils, except for those specifically excluded from coverage by the policy. It also provides replacement cost coverage on the home and other structures and will provide optional coverage for replacement cost on personal property in the home. It may also offer the option of specifically scheduling individual personal property items for coverage. Additionally, coverage for loss of use of the home until it can be repaired is provided. Personal liability and medical payment coverage to others is included, as well.\nWind/Hail Insurance\nOur wind/hail insurance policy is written on an owner or non-owner occupied dwelling which protects from the perils of wind and/or hail-only weather events. This policy type may also provide coverage for personal property, but only for specific types of coverage. It provides replacement cost or actual cash value coverage on the home and other structures depending on the form under which the policy is written. Personal property in the home is written at actual cash value. Additionally, coverage for loss of use of the home is provided.\nManufactured Home Insurance\nOur manufactured home insurance policy is written on a manufactured or mobile home and is similar to both the homeowners' insurance policy and the dwelling fire policy. The policy can provide for coverage on the manufactured home, the insured's personal property in the home and liability and medical payments can be included. Furthermore, our manufactured home policies can be endorsed to include coverage for flood and earthquake (coverage for these perils is not available under our other policy types; as of December 31, 2015 approximately 3,500 of our manufactured home policies include this endorsement). The policy can also be written on either owner occupied or non-owner occupied units. Property coverage can be written on an actual cash value or stated amount basis with an optional replacement cost coverage available for partial loss. There are several other optional coverages that can be included and residential and commercial-use rental units can be written along with seasonal use mobile homes or homes that are used for part of the year.\nDwelling Fire Insurance\nOur dwelling fire policy can be issued on an owner occupied or non-owner (tenant) occupied dwelling property. It will also provide coverage against all types of loss unless the peril causing the loss is specifically excluded in the policy. Losses from vandalism and malicious mischief are also included in the coverage. All claims and losses on a dwelling are covered on a replacement cost basis and additional coverage for personal property (contents) can also be added. Personal liability and medical payments to others may be included on an optional basis.\nOur policy counts by type as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 are as follows:\nTable 104: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Direct Policies in-force as of </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Source of Policies </td> <td> </td> <td>Dec 31, 2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Dec 31, 2014 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total Takeout Policies in Force </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,957 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,589 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Homeowners </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14,283 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9,286 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Manufactured Homes </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,343 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,096 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Other Dwellings </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>806 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>426 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total Voluntary Policies in Force </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>19,432 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13,808 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total Direct Policies in Force </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>28,389 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>21,397 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n 25 \n \n1347 PROPERTY INSURANCE HOLDINGS, INC.\nWe do not consider the commercial wind/hail only book of business we have written in Texas in our policies-in-force count as of December 31, 2015 since we have assumed this business through our alliance with Brotherhood. As of December 31, 2015, we have assumed wind/hail coverage on 495 policies in Texas through this agreement.\nMaison insures personal property located in 63 of the 64 parishes in Louisiana. As of December 31, 2015, these policies are concentrated within these parishes as follows: Jefferson Parish 17.7%, Saint Tammany Parish 15.9%, East Baton Rouge Parish 7.3%, Orleans Parish 6.8%, Terrebonne Parish 6.2%, Livingston Parish 5.2%, and Tangipahoa Parish 5.1%. No other parish individually has over 5.0% of the policies in force as of December 31, 2015. The remaining 56 parishes combine to equal 35.1% of the total Louisiana policies in force as of December 31, 2015. On a direct basis, Maison writes in 44 of the 254 counties that comprise the State of Texas, however no single county represents over 5.0% of our policies in force as of December 31, 2015.\nNon-U.S. GAAP Financial Measures\nThe Company assesses its results of operations using certain non-U.S. GAAP financial measures, in addition to U.S. GAAP financial measures. These non-U.S. GAAP financial measures consist of underwriting ratios and are defined below. The Company believes these non-U.S. GAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating performance in the same manner as management does.\nThe non-U.S. GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for or superior to, any financial measures prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The Company's non-U.S. GAAP financial measures may be defined differently from time to time and may be defined differently than similar terms used by other companies, and accordingly, care should be exercised in understanding how we define our non-U.S. GAAP financial measures.\nUnderwriting Ratios\nThe Company, like many insurance companies, analyzes performance based on underwriting ratios such as loss ratio, expense ratio and combined ratio. The loss ratio is derived by dividing the amount of net losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred by net premiums earned. The expense ratio is derived by dividing the sum of amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs and general and administrative expenses incurred by net premiums earned. All items included in the loss and expense ratios are presented in the Company's U.S. GAAP financial statements. The combined ratio is the sum of the loss ratio and the expense ratio. A combined ratio below 100% demonstrates an underwriting profit whereas a combined ratio over 100% demonstrates an underwriting loss.\nCritical Accounting Estimates and Assumptions\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses for the reporting period. Actual results could differ from these estimates. Estimates and their underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Changes in estimates are recorded in the accounting period in which they are determined. The critical accounting estimates and assumptions in the accompanying consolidated financial statements include the provision for loss and loss adjustment expense reserves, the valuation of fixed income securities, the valuation of net deferred income taxes, the valuation of various securities we have issued in conjunction with the termination of the management services agreement with 1347 Advisors, LLC, the valuation of deferred policy acquisition costs and stock-based compensation expense.\nProvision for Loss and Loss Adjustment Expense Reserves\nA significant degree of judgment is required to determine amounts recorded in the consolidated financial statements for the provision for loss and loss adjustment expense reserves. The process for establishing the provision for loss and loss adjustment expense reserves reflects the uncertainties and significant judgmental factors inherent in predicting future results of both known and unknown loss events. As such, the process is inherently complex and imprecise and estimates are constantly refined. The process of establishing the provision for loss and loss adjustment expense reserves relies on the judgment and opinions of a large number of individuals, including the opinions of the Company's independent actuaries.\nFactors affecting the provision for loss and loss adjustment expense reserves include the continually evolving and changing regulatory and legal environment, actuarial studies, professional experience and expertise of the Company's claims departments' personnel and independent adjusters retained to handle individual claims, the quality of the data used for projection purposes, existing claims management practices including claims handling and settlement practices, the effect of inflationary trends on future loss settlement costs, court decisions, economic conditions and public attitudes.\n 26 \n \n1347 PROPERTY INSURANCE HOLDINGS, INC.\nIn the actuarial review process, an analysis of the provision for loss and loss adjustment expense reserves is completed for the Company's insurance subsidiary. Unpaid losses, allocated loss adjustment expenses and unallocated loss adjustment expenses are separately analyzed by line of business or coverage by accident year. A wide range of actuarial methods are utilized in order to appropriately measure ultimate loss and loss adjustment expense costs. These methods include paid loss development, incurred loss development and frequency-severity method. Reasonability tests such as ultimate loss ratio trends and ultimate allocated loss adjustment expense to ultimate loss are also performed prior to selection of the final provision. The provision is indicated by line of business or coverage and is separated into case reserves, reserves for losses incurred but not reported ( IBNR\u201d) and a provision for loss adjustment expenses ( LAE\u201d).\nBecause the establishment of the provision for loss and loss adjustment expense reserves is an inherently uncertain process involving estimates, current provisions may need to be updated. Adjustments to the provision, both favorable and unfavorable, are reflected in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss) for the periods in which such estimates are updated. Management determines the loss and loss adjustment expense reserves as recorded on the Company's financial statements, while the Company's independent actuaries develop a range of reasonable estimates and a point estimate of loss and loss adjustment expense reserves. The actuarial point estimate is intended to represent the actuaries' best estimate and will not necessarily be at the mid-point of the high and low estimates of the range.\nValuation of Fixed Income Securities\nThe Company's fixed income securities are recorded at fair value using observable inputs such as quoted prices in inactive markets, quoted prices in active markets for similar instruments, benchmark interest rates, broker quotes and other relevant inputs. The Company does not have any fixed income investments in our portfolio which require the Company to use unobservable inputs. Any change in the estimated fair value of its investments could impact the amount of unrealized gain or loss the Company has recorded, which could change the amount the Company has recorded for its investments and other comprehensive loss on its consolidated balance sheets and statements of comprehensive income (loss).\nGains and losses realized on the disposition of investments are determined on the first-in first-out basis and credited or charged to the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss). Premium and discount on investments are amortized and accreted using the interest method and charged or credited to net investment income.\nThe Company performs a quarterly analysis of its investment portfolio to determine if declines in market value are other-than-temporary. Further information regarding its detailed analysis and factors considered in establishing an other-than-temporary impairment on an investment is discussed within Note 4 - Investments, to the consolidated financial statements.\nValuation of Net Deferred Income Taxes\nThe provision for income taxes is calculated based on the expected tax treatment of transactions recorded in the Company's consolidated financial statements. In determining its provision for income taxes, the Company interprets tax legislation in a variety of jurisdictions and makes assumptions about the expected timing of the reversal of deferred income tax assets and liabilities and the valuation of net deferred income taxes.\nThe ultimate realization of the deferred income tax asset balance is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which the Company's temporary differences reverse and become deductible. A valuation allowance is established when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred income tax asset balance will not be realized. In determining whether a valuation allowance is needed, management considers all available positive and negative evidence affecting specific deferred income tax asset balances, including the Company's past and anticipated future performance, the reversal of deferred income tax liabilities, and the availability of tax planning strategies. To the extent a valuation allowance is established in a period, an expense must be recorded within the income tax provision in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss).\n 27 \n \n1347 PROPERTY INSURANCE HOLDINGS, INC.\nThe Company carries a net deferred income tax asset of $506 and $263 at December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, all of which the Company believes is more likely than not to be fully realized based upon management's assessment of future taxable income.\nSecurities issued to 1347 Advisors, LLC\nPursuant to the termination of the Management Services Agreement with 1347 Advisors LLC ( Advisors,\u201d a wholly-owned subsidiary of KFSI), the Company issued Preferred Shares, Warrants, and entered into a Performance Share Grant Agreement with Advisors on February 24, 2015. Additional information regarding the termination of the Management Services Agreement with Advisors can be found under Related Party Transactions\u201d in Item 7 of this Report.\nBecause the Preferred Shares have a mandatory redemption provision requiring redemption on February 24, 2020, the Company was required to classify the Preferred Shares as a liability on its balance sheet as opposed to recording the value of the shares in equity. The resulting liability was recorded at a discount to the $4,200 ultimate redemption amount which includes all dividends to be paid on the Preferred Shares based upon an analysis of the timing and amounts of the cash payments expected to occur under the terms of the Preferred Shares discounted for the Company's estimated cost of equity (13.9%). As a result, amortization in amount of $1,889 will be charged to operations through February 24, 2020 using the effective interest method.\nThe Company estimated the fair value of the Warrants on grant date based upon the Black-Scholes option pricing model while it utilized a Monte Carlo model to determine the fair value of the Performance Share Grant Agreement due to the fact that the underlying shares are only issuable based upon the achievement of certain market conditions.\nDeferred Policy Acquisition Costs\nDeferred policy acquisition costs represent the deferral of expenses that the Company incurs related to successful efforts to acquire new business or renew existing business. Acquisition costs, primarily commissions, premium taxes and underwriting and agency expenses related to issuing insurance policies are deferred and charged against income ratably over the terms of the related insurance policies. Management regularly reviews the categories of acquisition costs that are deferred and assesses the recoverability of this asset. Costs associated with unsuccessful efforts or costs that cannot be tied directly to a successful policy acquisition are expensed as incurred, as opposed to being deferred and amortized as the premium is earned.\nStock-Based Compensation Expense\nThe Company uses the fair-value method of accounting for stock-based compensation awards granted. The Company determines the fair value of the stock options on their grant date using the Black-Scholes option pricing model and determines the fair value of restricted stock units on their grant date using multiple Monte Carlo simulations. The fair value of these awards is recorded as compensation expense over the requisite service period, which is generally the expected period over which the awards will vest, with a corresponding increase to additional paid-in capital. When the stock options are exercised, or correspondingly, when the restricted stock units vest, the amount of proceeds together with the amount recorded in additional paid-in capital is recorded in shareholders' equity.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 3 - Recently Issued Accounting Standards in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements and their effect, if any, on the Company.\n 28 \n \n1347 PROPERTY INSURANCE HOLDINGS, INC.\nAnalysis of Financial Condition\nAs of December 31, 2015 compared to December 31, 2014\nInvestments\nThe Company's investments in fixed income securities are classified as available-for-sale and are reported at estimated fair value. The Company holds an investment portfolio comprised primarily of fixed income securities issued by the U.S. Government, government agencies and high quality corporate issuers. The portfolio is managed by a third-party investment management firm in accordance with the investment policies and guidelines approved by Maison's Board of Directors. These guidelines stress the preservation of capital, market liquidity and the diversification of risk. Investments held by the Company's insurance subsidiary must also comply with applicable domiciliary state regulations that prescribe the type, quality and concentration of investments. Furthermore, pursuant to the certificate of authority we received from the TDI, we are required to deposit securities with the State of Texas. These securities consist of the fixed income securities listed in the tables below and have both an amortized cost basis and estimated fair value of $2,002 as of December 31, 2015.\nThe table below summarizes, by type, the Company's investments as of December 31, 2015 and 2014.\nTable 113: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, 2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, 2014 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Type of Investment </td> <td> </td> <td>Carrying\nAmount </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Percent of\nTotal </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Carrying\nAmount </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Percent of\nTotal </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Fixed income securities: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> U.S. government, government agencies and authorities </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,919 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8.8 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>141 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.1 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> State municipalities and political subdivisions </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,651 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7.6 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>295 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.3 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Asset-backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,810 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>36.1 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,178 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>32.9 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Corporate </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,858 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>41.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,900 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>46.4 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total fixed income securities </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>20,238 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>93.5 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10,514 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>82.7 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Short-term investments </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,149 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.3 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,198 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17.3 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Other Investments </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>248 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.2 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total investments </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>21,635 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>12,712 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Company's other investments are comprised of investments in two limited partnerships which seek to provide equity and asset-backed debt investment in a variety of privately-owned companies. The Company has committed to a total investment of $1,000, of which the limited partnerships have drawn down approximately $248 through December 31, 2015. The Company has accounted for its investments under the cost method as the instruments do not have readily determinable fair values and the Company does not exercise significant influence over the operations of the limited partnerships or the underlying privately-owned companies.\nLiquidity and Cash Flow Risk\nThe table below summarizes the fair value of the Company's fixed income securities by contractual maturity as of December 31, 2015 and 2014. Actual results may differ as issuers may have the right to call or prepay obligations, with or without penalties, prior to the contractual maturity of these obligations.\nTable 114: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, 2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, 2014 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Matures in: </td> <td> </td> <td>Carrying\nAmount </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Percent of\nTotal </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Carrying\nAmount </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Percent of\nTotal </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>One year or less </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,012 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>179 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.7 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>One to five years </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10,414 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>51.5 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>66.7 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Five to ten years </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,259 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11.2 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>903 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8.6 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>More than ten years </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,553 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>32.3 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,415 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>23.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total fixed income securities </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>20,238 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>10,514 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nAt December 31, 2015, approximately 56.5% of the Company's fixed income securities had contractual maturities of five years or less. The Company holds cash and high-grade short-term assets which, along with fixed income securities, management believes are sufficient in amount for the payment of loss and loss adjustment expense reserves and other operating subsidiary obligations on a timely basis. The Company may not be able to liquidate its investments in the event that additional cash is required to meet obligations to its policyholders, however, the Company believes that the high-quality, liquid investments in the portfolios provide it with sufficient liquidity.\n 29 \n \n1347 PROPERTY INSURANCE HOLDINGS, INC.\nMarket Risk\nMarket risk is the risk that the Company will incur losses due to adverse changes in interest or currency exchange rates and equity prices. Given the Company's operations only invest in U.S. dollar denominated instruments and maintain a relatively insignificant investment in equity instruments, its primary market risk exposures in the investments portfolio are to changes in interest rates.\nBecause the investments portfolio is comprised of primarily fixed maturity instruments that are usually held to maturity, periodic changes in interest rate levels generally impact the Company's financial results to the extent that the investments are recorded at market value and reinvestment yields are different than the original yields on maturing instruments. During periods of rising interest rates, the market values of the existing fixed income securities will generally decrease. The reverse is true during periods of declining interest rates.\nCredit Risk\nCredit risk is defined as the risk of financial loss due to failure of the other party to a financial instrument to discharge an obligation. Credit risk arises from the Company's positions in short-term investments, corporate debt instruments and government bonds.\nAt December 31, 2015 and 2014, the Company's debt securities had the following quality ratings as assigned by Standard and Poor's ( S&P\u201d) or Moody's Investors Service ( Moody's\u201d).\nTable 117: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, 2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, 2014 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Rating (S&P/Moody's) </td> <td> </td> <td>Carrying\nAmount </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Percent of\nTotal </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Carrying\nAmount </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Percent of\nTotal </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>AAA/Aaa </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>10,741 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>53.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,713 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>44.8 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Aa/Aa </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,520 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12.5 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>802 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7.6 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>A/A </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,745 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>23.4 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,414 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>42.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>BBB </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,232 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11.1 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>585 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.6 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total fixed income securities </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>20,238 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>10,514 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOther-Than-Temporary Impairment\nThe length of time an individual investment may be held in an unrealized loss position may vary based on the opinion of the investment manager and their respective analyses related to valuation and to the various credit risks that may prevent the Company from recapturing the principal investment. In the case of an individual investment with a maturity date where the investment manager determines that there is little or no risk of default prior to the maturity of a holding, the Company would elect to hold the investment in an unrealized loss position until the price recovers or the investment matures. In situations where facts emerge that might increase the risk associated with recapture of principal, the Company may elect to sell investments at a loss.\nThe Company performs a quarterly analysis of its investment portfolio to determine if declines in market value are other-than-temporary. Further information regarding the Company's detailed analysis and factors considered in establishing an other-than-temporary impairment on an investment is discussed within Note 4 - Investments,\u201d to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this report.\nAs a result of the analysis performed by the Company, there were no write-downs for other-than-temporary impairments related to investments for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014.\nAt December 31, 2015, the gross unrealized losses for fixed income securities amounted to $95, and there were no unrealized losses attributable to non-investment grade fixed income securities. At both December 31, 2015 and 2014, all unrealized losses on individual investments were considered temporary. Fixed income securities in unrealized loss positions continued to pay interest and were not subject to material changes in their respective debt ratings. The Company concluded the declines in value were considered temporary. As the Company has the capacity to hold these investments to maturity, no impairment provision was considered necessary.\nDeferred Policy Acquisition Costs\nThe Company's deferred policy acquisition costs ( DPAC\u201d) include commissions, premium taxes, assessments and other policy processing fees and represent those costs related to acquiring the premiums the Company has yet to earn (the unearned premium reserve). DPAC increased $939, to $4,030 as of December 31, 2015 compared to $3,091 as of December 31, 2014, corresponding to an increase in our unearned premium reserves over the same period.\n 30 \n \n1347 PROPERTY INSURANCE HOLDINGS, INC.\nPremiums Receivable, Net of Allowance for Doubtful Accounts\nPremiums receivable, net of allowance for credit losses, increased by $309 to $2,395 as of December 31, 2015 from $2,086 as of December 31, 2014. This increase was primarily attributable to the timing of payments received on premium written in December of each year. Premiums written for the month of December 2015 increased by approximately $483 when compared to premiums written in December 2014, leading to a corresponding increase in the amount of premium receivable from our agents and policyholders.\nCeded Unearned Premiums\nCeded unearned premiums represents the unexpired portion of premiums which have been paid to the Company's reinsurers. Ceded unearned premiums are charged to income over the terms of the respective reinsurance treaties. Ceded unearned premiums increased $1,244 to $2,805 as of December 31, 2015 from $1,561 as of December 31, 2014. Our reinsurance treaties generally run from June 1st to May 31st of each year, thus our current treaties in place were negotiated as of June 1, 2015 requiring an upfront deposit of unearned premium each quarter. We also enhanced our catastrophe program so that our aggregate limit of coverage increased from $92,000 in place as of December 31, 2014 to $140,000 in place as of December 31, 2015. Furthermore, the premium we pay for reinsurance is based upon the total insured value ( TIV\u201d) of our book of business as of September 30th of each year. As our TIV has increased year over year, so has the amount of premium we cede to our reinsurers, accounting for the increase in ceded unearned premiums between periods.\nReinsurance Recoverable on Reserves\nReinsurance recoverable on reserves represents amounts due to the Company, or expected to be due to the Company from our reinsurers, based upon claims and claim reserves which have exceeded the retention amount under our reinsurance treaties. As of December 31, 2015 we have recorded an expected recovery of $120 from our reinsurers, compared to $363 as of December 31, 2014. See Loss and Loss Adjustment Expense Reserves\u201d in Item 7 of this report for the expected recovery by policy type.\nFunds Deposited with Reinsured Companies\nFunds deposited with reinsured companies represents collateral we have placed on deposit with Brotherhood based upon our quota-share agreement to reinsure a portion of Brotherhood's business for wind/hail coverage only. Pursuant to the agreement, we are required to fund our pro-rata portion of reserves Brotherhood has established for unearned premium, losses and loss adjustments expenses, and any other amounts for which Brotherhood may not be able to take credit for on its annual statutory financial statements filed with the appropriate insurance regulatory authority. We may fund this obligation via cash advance, trust agreement, or letter of credit. Accordingly, we have placed $725 on deposit under a trust agreement as of December 31, 2015. As our quota-share agreement with Brotherhood commenced in June 2015, there was no associated collateral in place as of December 31, 2014.\nCurrent Income Taxes Recoverable/Payable\nCurrent income taxes recoverable were $965 as of December 31, 2015, compared to a current payable of $262 as of December 31, 2014, representing the estimate of both the Company's state and federal income taxes to be recovered/due for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, less estimated payments made during each year.\nNet Deferred Tax Asset\nThe Company's net deferred tax asset increased $243, to $506 as of December 31, 2015 from $263 as of December 31, 2014. The net deferred tax asset is comprised of approximately $2,310 and $1,595 of deferred tax assets, net of approximately $1,804 and $1,332 of deferred tax liabilities as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The change in the net deferred tax asset is primarily due to the increase in the deferred tax assets associated with our unearned premium reserve.\nProperty and Equipment\nProperty and equipment was $234 and $237 as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, and consists of computers, office equipment, and improvements at our leased facilities in Tampa, Florida and Baton Rouge, Louisiana, shown net of accumulated depreciation. Also included in the balance as of December 31, 2015 are vehicles we have purchased for the use of our sales representatives in the state of Texas. Our policy for the capitalization and depreciation of these assets can be found in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements found in Item 8 of this report.\n 31 \n \n1347 PROPERTY INSURANCE HOLDINGS, INC.\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets\nOn January 2, 2015, we acquired a 100% interest in ClaimCor, a Florida domiciled company in the business of adjusting property and casualty insurance claims. Under the terms of the agreement to purchase ClaimCor, the purchase price equaled $323, which we paid in cash, at closing. Pursuant to the purchase agreement, the prior managing members of ClaimCor entered into a non-compete agreement with us, whereby the members cannot engage in, continue in, or carry on any business that competes with ClaimCor for a period of three years from the date in which the transaction closed.\nAs a result of the purchase, we recorded goodwill in the amount of $211 on our consolidated balance sheet as of January 2, 2015. The goodwill was not amortized, but rather subject to impairment testing on, at minimum, an annual basis. We also recognized the estimated fair value of the non-compete agreement as well as a customer base asset as part of the ClaimCor acquisition at a combined total of $52 as of January 2, 2015. The non-compete agreement will be amortized over its 3-year contractual life, while the customer base asset was to be amortized over an estimated useful-life of 5 years.\nIn December 2015, after analyzing ClaimCor's performance in comparison to management's expectations and forecasts at the time of acquisition, we noted that an impairment to the value of the goodwill and other intangibles we recorded was likely. Accordingly, our analysis resulted in a charge of $246 in the quarter ending December 31, 2015 associated with the impairment of goodwill and the customer base asset. As of December 31, 2015, the carrying value of the Company's intangible assets was $6 representing the unamortized balance of the non-compete agreement recorded as part of the acquisition.\nOther Assets\nOther assets increased $423, to $705 as of December 31, 2015 from $282 as of December 31, 2014. The major components of other assets, as well as the change therein, are shown below.\nTable 122: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2014 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Accrued interest on investments </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>77 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>37 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>40 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Security deposits for facility leases </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>38 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>22 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Prepaid expenses </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>590 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>229 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>361 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>705 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>282 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>423 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nLoss and Loss Adjustment Expense Reserves\nLoss and loss adjustment expense reserves represent the estimated liabilities for reported loss events, incurred but not reported ( IBNR\u201d) loss events and the related estimated loss adjustment expenses gross of amounts expected to be recovered from reinsurance.

Any such development could have a material effect on the Company's consolidated financial results for a given period.\nUnearned Premium Reserves\nUnearned premium reserves increased $5,739 to $23,442 as of December 31, 2015 compared to $17,703 as of December 31, 2014. The following table outlines the change in unearned premium reserves by line of business.\nTable 126: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2014 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Homeowners </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>15,688 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>12,120 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,568 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Special Property </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,754 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,583 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,171 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>23,442 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>17,703 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,739 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Company's increase to its unearned premium reserve is directly related to the increase in written premiums year over year.\nCeded Reinsurance Premiums Payable\nCeded reinsurance premiums payable increased $724 to $3,283 as of December 31, 2015 compared to $2,559 as of December 31, 2014 primarily as a result of the timing of payments due under our reinsurance programs. The bulk of the balance payable as of December 31, 2015 represents the quarterly payment due under our catastrophe reinsurance program, which was paid in January 2016.\nAgent Commissions Payable\nAgent commissions payable increased $80 to $403 as of December 31, 2015 compared to $323 as of December 31, 2014. As agent commissions are paid in arrears, this balance represents commissions owed to the Company's independent agents on policies written in December of each year, and corresponds directly with the increase in premiums written by our agents when comparing December 2015 to December 2014.\nPremiums Collected in Advance\nPremium deposits were $870 and $560 and represent cash the Company has received for policies which were not yet in-force as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 respectively. Upon the effective date of coverage, advance premiums are reclassified to the unearned premium reserve account.\nRelated Party Transactions\nDue to Related Party\nAmounts due to related parties decreased $145 as all amounts due as of December 31, 2014 had been paid prior to December 31, 2015. The December 31, 2014 payable represented amounts due to the Company's former parent, KFSI, or subsidiaries of KFSI. Prior to the Company's IPO on March 31, 2014, the Company operated as a wholly owned subsidiary of KFSI. As a result of this relationship, KFSI had advanced the Company funds consisting of payments made directly to third parties on the Company's behalf as well as allocated inter-company expenses for various shared-services and support. As of January 1, 2015, we were no longer reliant on KFSI for support and other shared services and as such, charges for these services ceased.\nTermination of Management Services Agreement\nOn February 11, 2014, the Company entered into a Management Services Agreement ( MSA\u201d) with 1347 Advisors LLC ( Advisors\u201d), a wholly owned subsidiary of KFSI, under which Advisors provided certain services to the Company, including forecasting, analysis of capital structure and reinsurance programs, consultation in potential future restructuring or capital raising transactions, and consultation in corporate development initiatives. Under the MSA, we paid Advisors a monthly fee equal to 1% of our direct written premiums. For the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company incurred an expense of $22 under the terms of the MSA prior to its termination.\n 33 \n \n1347 PROPERTY INSURANCE HOLDINGS, INC.\nThe Company entered into an Agreement to Buyout and Release (the Buyout\u201d) with Advisors which terminated the MSA on February 24, 2015. In consideration for Advisors voluntary termination of the MSA, the Company (i) made a cash payment in the amount of $2,000 to Advisors; (ii) executed and delivered the Performance Shares Grant Agreement to Advisors; (iii) issued to Advisors 120,000 shares of Series B Preferred Stock of the Company (the Preferred Shares\u201d); and (iv) executed and delivered to Advisors a warrant (the Warrant\u201d) to purchase up to 1,500,000 shares of the Company's common stock at an exercise price of fifteen dollars per share. The Warrant expires on February 24, 2022.\nThe Preferred Shares have a par value of twenty five dollars per share and pay annual cumulative dividends at a rate of eight percent per annum. Cumulative dividends accrue, whether or not declared by the Board and irrespective of the legal availability of funds for the payment of dividends. Accrued dividends are to be paid in cash only when, as, and if declared by the Board out of funds legally available therefor or upon a liquidation or redemption of the Preferred Shares. In the event of any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution, or winding up of the Company, the holders of the Preferred Shares then outstanding will be entitled to be paid out of the assets of the Company available for distributions to its shareholders. The Preferred Shares rank senior to the Company's common stock, and the Company is not permitted to issue any other series of preferred stock that ranks equal or senior to the Preferred Shares while the Preferred Shares are outstanding. On February 22, 2016 the Board authorized a dividend payment on the Preferred Shares for shareholders of record as of February 23, 2016. Accordingly, on February 24, 2016, the Company issued a cash payment of $240 to Advisors representing the first annual dividend payment the Company has made on the Preferred Shares.\nUnless redeemed earlier by the Company, as defined below, the Company will be required to redeem the Preferred Shares then outstanding on February 24, 2020 (the Mandatory Redemption Date\u201d), for an amount equal to twenty five dollars per share then outstanding plus all accrued and unpaid dividends. The Company has the option to redeem the Preferred Shares prior to the Mandatory Redemption Date, also at twenty five dollars per share, immediately prior to the consummation of any change in control of the Company that may occur.\nBoth the Preferred Shares and Warrants were issued in a private placement exempt from registration pursuant to Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.\nThe Performance Shares Grant Agreement grants Advisors 100,000 shares of the Company's common stock issuable upon the date that the last sales price of the Company's common stock equals or exceeds ten dollars per share for any twenty trading days within any thirty-day trading period (the Milestone Event\u201d). Advisors will not be entitled to any dividends declared or paid on the Company's stock prior to the Milestone Event having been achieved.\nEffect of Buyout on Financial Condition and Statement of Operations\nUnder the original MSA, we were required to pay Advisors a fee of 1% of written premiums on a monthly basis. The Company replaced this ongoing annuity through the Buyout by providing Advisors with an up-front cash payment and other consideration which lead to a one-time charge of $5,421 to the Company's operations for the year ended December 31, 2015 as follows:\nTable 129: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year ended\nDecember 31, 2015 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Cash paid </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,000 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Issuance of Series B Preferred Shares </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,311 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Issuance of Warrants and Performance Shares </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,010 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Professional fees incurred in connection with the Buyout </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Loss on termination of MSA </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,421 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe issuance of the Warrants and Performance Shares had no effect on the Company's total shareholders' equity as they both resulted in equal and offsetting charges to the Company's retained earnings and additional paid-in capital. We estimated the fair value of the Warrant on grant date based upon the Black-Scholes option pricing model while we utilized a Monte Carlo model to determine the fair value of the Performance Shares due to the fact that these shares are only issuable based upon the achievement of certain market conditions.\nBecause the Preferred Shares have a mandatory redemption provision requiring redemption on February 24, 2020, we were required to classify the Preferred Shares as a liability on our balance sheet instead of recording the value of these shares in equity. The resulting liability was recorded at a discount to the $3,000 ultimate redemption amount of the Preferred Shares based upon an analysis of the cash payments expected to occur under the terms of the Preferred Shares discounted for the Company's estimated cost of equity (13.9%). As a result, amortization in the amount of $1,889 will be charged to operations through February 24, 2020 using the effective interest method. For the year ended December 31, 2015, amortization of the discount on the Preferred Shares totaled $282.\n 34 \n \n1347 PROPERTY INSURANCE HOLDINGS, INC.\nAccounts Payable and Other Accrued Expenses\nAccounts payable and other accrued expenses increased $306, to $1,863 as of December 31, 2015 compared to $1,557 as of December 31, 2014. The major components of accounts payable and other accrued expenses, as well as the change therein, are shown below.\nTable 132: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2014 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Accrued employee compensation </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>352 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>285 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>67 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Accrued professional fees </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>267 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>158 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>109 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Unearned policy fees </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>168 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>150 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Accrued premium taxes and assessments </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,004 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>776 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>228 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Other accounts payable </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>72 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>188 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(116 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,863 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,557 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>306 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOff Balance Sheet Arrangements\nNone.\nContractual Obligations\nAs of December 31, 2015, the Company had the following amounts due under its operating leases for facilities in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, and Tampa, Florida.\nTable 133: <table> <tr> <td> Year ending December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td>Amounts due under\noperating leases </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>336 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>344 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>291 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>249 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>2020 and thereafter </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,220 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nShareholders' Equity\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2014 we issued approximately five million shares of our common stock through the combination of our IPO on March 31, 2014, as well as our follow on offering on June 13, 2014 which resulted in approximately $36,261 in net proceeds to the Company.\nOn January 23, 2014, Fund Management Group LLC, an entity of which the Company's Chairman of the Board, Gordon G. Pratt, is a Managing Member and controlling equity holder, invested $2,000 in the Company in exchange for 80,000 Series A Convertible Preferred Shares ( Series A Shares\u201d) of the Company. At the time of their issuance, the value of the common stock into which the Series A Shares was convertible had a fair value greater than the $2,000 proceeds for the issuance. Accordingly, the Company recorded a beneficial conversion feature on the Series A Shares of $500 for the year ended December 31, 2014, which was equivalent to the amount by which the estimated fair value of the common stock issuable upon the conversion of the Series A Shares exceeded the proceeds received upon issuance of the Series A Shares. On March 31, 2014 the Preferred Shares were converted into 312,500 shares of the Company's common stock.\nOn December 1, 2014 our Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program for up to 500,000 shares of our common stock. Through December 31, 2015, we had repurchased an aggregate 223,851 shares under this program at an average cost of $7.73 per share. In November 2015, our Board of Directors approved the continuation of the repurchase program such that we anticipate repurchases to continue to be made periodically through the period ending December 31, 2016.\n 35 \n \n1347 PROPERTY INSURANCE HOLDINGS, INC.\nResults of Operations\nYear Ended December 31, 2015 Compared with Year Ended December 31, 2014\nPremiums Written\nThe following table shows our gross premiums written by line of business for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014.\nTable 136: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Line of Business </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2014 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Homeowners </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>29,987 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>22,349 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>7,638 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Special Property </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13,864 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10,314 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,550 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Gross Written Premium </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>43,851 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>32,663 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>11,188 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe increase in direct written premiums can be attributed to the organic growth in voluntary production from our independent agents as well as the addition of assumed business in Texas through our agreement with Brotherhood. Our independent agents wrote approximately $30,174 of premium for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to approximately $22,223 for 2014. Special Property premium written for the year ended December 31, 2015 also includes the benefit of approximately $1,174 in premium assumed through our agreement with Brotherhood. There were no assumed premiums under this arrangement in 2014 as we entered into the Brotherhood agreement in June 2015.\nCeded Premiums Written\nCeded premiums written increased to $13,422 in 2015, compared to $7,934 in 2014. The increase is primarily due to an increase in limits purchased in our excess of loss reinsurance program which increased from $9,500 for the treaty year ended May 31, 2014 to $69,000 for the treaty year ending May 31, 2015. We also purchased reinsurance for aggregate losses. The aggregate treaty increased in coverage from $13,000 to $20,000 for the treaty years ended May 31, 2014 and 2015, respectively.\nEffective June 1, 2015 we entered into a new catastrophe reinsurance program through May 31, 2016. Under the program, for each event occurring within a 144-hour period, we receive reinsurance recoveries of up to $121,000 in excess of"}
