Consolidated results of operations and financial condition are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America ( U.S. GAAP\u201d). This discussion should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and related footnotes included elsewhere herein.\nResults of operations include the accounts of The Hanover Insurance Company ( Hanover Insurance\u201d) and Citizens Insurance Company of America ( Citizens\u201d), our principal property and casualty companies; and certain other insurance and non-insurance subsidiaries. Our results of operations also include the results of our discontinued operations, consisting primarily of our former Chaucer international business, Chaucer Holdings Limited ( Chaucer\u201d), a United Kingdom ( U.K.\u201d) domiciled specialist insurance underwriting group which operates through the Society and Corporation of Lloyd's ( Lloyd's\u201d), and the international insurance and non-insurance subsidiaries, which collectively constituted our former Chaucer segment. On December 28, 2018, we completed the sale of Chaucer Holdings Limited, the major portion of our Lloyd's international specialty business. As of December 31, 2018 and for all prior periods presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, operations from Chaucer and the related assets and liabilities are presented as discontinued operations. Results of operations also include the discontinued operations of our accident and health and former life insurance businesses.\nEXECUTIVE OVERVIEW\nBusiness operations consist of three operating segments: Commercial Lines, Personal Lines and Other.\nNet income was $391.0 million in 2018, compared to $186.2 million in 2017, an increase of $204.8 million, primarily due to the gain from the sale of our former Chaucer business and an increase in operating income.\nOperating income before interest expense and income taxes (a non-GAAP financial measure; see also Results of Operations - Consolidated - Non-GAAP Financial Measures\u201d) was $406.5 million in 2018 compared to $327.3 million in 2017, an increase of $79.2 million. This increase is primarily due to lower catastrophe losses, higher net investment income, a reduction in reinsurance reinstatement premiums, earned premium growth and lower expenses, partially offset by higher non-catastrophe current accident year losses. Pre-tax catastrophe losses were $219.2 million in 2018, compared to $251.5 million in 2017, a decrease of $32.3 million. Reinsurance reinstatement premium, net of ceding commissions, was a favorable change of $21.5 million. Net unfavorable development on prior years' loss and loss adjustment expense ( LAE\u201d) reserves ( prior years' loss reserves\u201d) was $0.4 million in 2018, compared to $1.2 million in 2017.\nAs discussed further in Discontinued Operations\u201d below, on December 28, 2018, we completed the sale of Chaucer to China Re. We subsequently completed the sale of our Chaucer-related Irish entity on February 14, 2019. The sale of the Australian entities is pending, subject only to local regulatory approval, and is expected to close in the first quarter of 2019. We received $28 million of additional consideration for the Irish entity, and we expect to receive $13 million of additional consideration related to the Australian entities.\nCommercial Lines\nOur account-focused approach to the small commercial market, distinctiveness in the middle market, and continued development of specialty lines provides us with a diversified portfolio of products and delivers significant value to agents and policyholders. Each of these businesses is expected to contribute to premium growth in Commercial Lines over the next several years as we continue to pursue our core strategy of developing strong partnerships with agents, enhanced franchise value through limited distribution, distinctive products and coverages, and continued investment in industry segmentation.\nThese efforts have driven, and we believe they will continue to drive, improvement in our overall mix of business and our underwriting profitability. Commercial Lines net premiums written grew by 6.0% in 2018, due to growth in small commercial, middle market, and the professional lines within our specialty business. Approximately 4.9% of this growth was due to rate and exposure increases, strong retention and targeted new business expansion, with the balance being attributable to improved reinsurance reinstatement activity.\nUnderwriting results improved in 2018, as compared to 2017, primarily due to lower catastrophe losses, higher favorable development on prior years' loss reserves, a reduction in reinsurance reinstatement premiums driven by prior year large loss activity, and lower expenses, partially offset by higher non-catastrophe current accident year losses. Catastrophe losses were $142.3 million in 2018, a decrease of $28.3 million when compared to 2017. Favorable development on prior years' loss reserve in 2018 was $34.1 million, compared to $9.4 million in 2017, an increase of $24.7 million. Reinsurance reinstatement premium, net of ceding commissions, had an unfavorable impact of $0.9 million in 2018, compared to $22.4 million in 2017, a favorable change of $21.5 million. The competitive nature of the Commercial Lines market requires us to be highly disciplined in our underwriting process to ensure that we write business at acceptable margins, and we continue to seek rate increases across our lines of business.\nPersonal Lines\nPersonal Lines focuses on partnering with high quality, value-oriented agencies that deliver consultative selling and stress the importance of account rounding (the conversion of single policy customers to accounts with multiple policies and additional coverages, to address customers' broader objectives). Approximately 84% of our policies in force are account business. We are focused on seeking profitable growth opportunities, building a distinctive position in the market, and diversifying geographically.\nNet premiums written grew by 7.7% in 2018, primarily due to higher renewal premium, driven by rate increases and strong retention, as well as new business growth. Underwriting results declined in 2018, as compared to 2017, primarily due to higher unfavorable development on prior years' loss reserves and higher non-catastrophe current accident year losses, partially offset by earned premium growth, lower catastrophe losses, and lower expenses. We continue to seek rate increases that meet or exceed underlying loss cost trends, subject to regulatory and competitive considerations.\nDESCRIPTION OF OPERATING SEGMENTS\nPrimary business operations include insurance products and services currently provided through three operating segments: Commercial Lines, Personal Lines, and Other. Commercial Lines includes commercial multiple peril, commercial automobile, workers' compensation, and other commercial coverages, such as inland marine, specialty program business, management and professional liability, surety, and specialty property. Personal Lines includes personal automobile, homeowners, and other personal coverages, such as umbrella. Included in the Other\u201d segment are Opus Investment Management, Inc., which markets investment management services to institutions, pension funds, and other organizations; earnings on holding company assets; holding company and other expenses, including certain costs associated with retirement benefits due to our former life insurance employees and agents; and a run-off voluntary pools business. Due to the sale of Chaucer on December 28, 2018, the operations of Chaucer have been classified as Discontinued Operations for the period ending December 31, 2018. Periods prior to 2018 have also been restated to present Chaucer as a discontinued operation. We present the separate financial information of each segment consistent with the manner in which our chief operating decision maker evaluates results in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance.\nWe report interest expense on debt separately from the earnings of our operating segments. This consists of interest on our senior debentures, subordinated debentures, and collateralized borrowings with the Federal Home Loan Bank ( FHLB\u201d).\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS - CONSOLIDATED\n2018 Compared to 2017\nConsolidated net income was $391.0 million in 2018, compared to $186.2 million in 2017, an increase of $204.8 million. The year over year comparison of consolidated net income reflects a $131.9 million gain, net of taxes, on the sale of our Chaucer business. Additionally, operating income before interest expense and income taxes increased $79.2 million, primarily due to lower catastrophe losses and higher net investment income. Income increased from our discontinued operations, primarily Chaucer and, to a lesser extent, our discontinued life business, which incurred a 2017 reserve charge related to our participation in a long-term care pool (See also Discontinued Operations\u201d section below). Also, income tax expense on operating income decreased $20.2 million, driven by a decrease in the U.S. statutory tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018. These increases in net income were partially offset by net realized and unrealized investment losses, net of taxes, of $30.9 million in 2018, compared to net realized investment gains, net of taxes, of $26.2 million in 2017, principally related to reductions in fair value of equity securities. Effective January 1, 2018, we implemented ASU 2016-01, which requires that the changes in fair value of equity securities be presented in net income. Prior to then, these changes were recognized through accumulated other comprehensive income (see also Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). Net income was also affected by $22.3 million in losses, net of taxes, associated with the repayment of debt in 2018.\n2017 Compared to 2016\nConsolidated net income was $186.2 million in 2017, compared to $155.1 million in 2016, an increase of $31.1 million. Operating income before interest expense and income taxes increased $134.4 million, primarily attributable to the year-over-year changes in development on prior years' loss reserves. Unfavorable development on prior years' loss reserves was $1.2 million in 2017 compared to $235.6 million in 2016. Additionally, our results in 2017 benefitted from improved non-catastrophe current accident year underwriting results and higher investment income. These increases were partially offset by a $134.4 million increase in current year catastrophe losses. The year over year comparison of consolidated net income was also affected by a $102.2 million decrease in earnings from the Chaucer business, now reclassified as discontinued operations, from income of $89.1 million in 2016 to losses of $13.1 million in 2017, primarily resulting from higher catastrophe losses. Also, consolidated net income in 2016 included a $57.4 million loss, after taxes, associated with the repayment of debt that did not recur in 2017. These increases in net income were partially offset by increases in 2017 of $15.8 million of after-tax losses from discontinued life operations, primarily due to an increase in our long-term care pool reserves.\nThe following table reflects operating income before interest expense and income taxes for each operating segment and a reconciliation to consolidated net income from operating income before interest expense and income taxes (a non-GAAP measure).\nTable 71: <table> <tr> <td> YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td>

income,\u201d and we assess the operating performance of each of our three operating segments based upon the pre-tax operating income (loss) generated by each segment. As reflected in the table above, operating income before taxes excludes interest expense on debt and certain other items which we believe are not indicative of our core operations, such as net realized investment gains and losses. Such gains and losses are excluded since they are determined by interest rates, financial markets and the timing of sales. Also, operating income before taxes excludes net gains and losses on disposals of businesses, gains and losses related to the repayment of debt, discontinued operations, costs to acquire businesses, restructuring costs, the cumulative effect of accounting changes and certain other items. Although the items excluded from operating income before taxes are important components in understanding and assessing our overall financial performance, we believe a discussion of operating income before taxes enhances an investor's understanding of our results of operations by highlighting net income attributable to the core operations of the business. However, operating income before taxes, which is a non-GAAP measure, should not be construed as a substitute for income before income taxes, and operating income should not be construed as a substitute for net income.\nCatastrophe losses and prior years' reserve development are significant components in understanding and assessing the financial performance of our business. Management reviews and evaluates catastrophes and prior years' reserve development separately from the other components of earnings. References to current accident year underwriting results\u201d exclude prior accident year reserve development, and may also be presented, excluding catastrophes\u201d. Prior years' reserve development and catastrophes are not predictable as to timing or the amount that will affect the results of our operations and have an effect on each year's operating and net income. Management believes that providing certain financial metrics and trends excluding the effects of catastrophes and prior years' reserve development helps investors to understand the variability in periodic earnings and to evaluate the underlying performance of our operations. Discussion of catastrophe losses in this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition includes development on prior years' catastrophe reserves and, unless otherwise indicated, such development is excluded from discussions of prior year loss and LAE reserve development.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS - SEGMENTS\nThe following is our discussion and analysis of the results of operations by business segment. The operating results are presented before interest expense, taxes and other items which management believes are not indicative of our core operations, including realized gains and losses and the results of discontinued operations.\nThe following table summarizes the results of operations for the periods indicated:\nTable 72: <table> <tr> <td> YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net premiums written\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,384.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,109.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,882.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net premiums earned\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,254.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,980.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,789.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net investment income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 267.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 243.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 231.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 23.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 22.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 22.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total operating revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,545.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,246.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,043.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Losses and operating expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Losses and LAE\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,724.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,574.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,546.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Amortization of deferred acquisition costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 891.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 840.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 803.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other operating expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 522.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 503.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 501.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total losses and operating expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,138.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,919.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,850.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating income before interest expense and income taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 406.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 327.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 192.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n2018 Compared to 2017\nOperating income before interest expense and income taxes was $406.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to $327.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of $79.2 million. This increase was primarily due to lower catastrophe losses, higher net investment income, a favorable change in reinsurance reinstatement premiums driven by prior year large loss activity, earned premium growth and lower expenses, partially offset by higher non-catastrophe current accident year losses.\nNet premiums written increased by $275.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, due to growth in both our Commercial and Personal Lines segments.\n2017 Compared to 2016\nOperating income before interest expense and income taxes was $327.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $192.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, an increase of $134.4 million. This increase was primarily due to a favorable change in development on prior years' loss reserves, partially offset by higher catastrophe losses. Unfavorable development on prior years' loss reserves was $1.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to unfavorable development of $235.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, a favorable change of $234.4 million. In 2016, we recognized a reserve charge of $174.1 million following the 2016 fourth quarter reserve review. Catastrophe-related activity for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $251.5 million, compared to $117.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, an increase of $134.4 million. This increase in catastrophe losses was primarily due to hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria that occurred in the third quarter of 2017, the California wildfires that occurred in the fourth quarter of 2017, and a Midwest wind event that occurred in the first quarter of 2017.\nNet premiums written increased by $226.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, due to growth in both our Personal and Commercial Lines segments.\nPRODUCTION AND UNDERWRITING RESULTS\nThe following table summarizes premiums written on a gross and net basis, net premiums earned and loss (including catastrophe losses), LAE, expense and combined ratios for the Commercial Lines and Personal Lines segments. Loss, LAE, catastrophe loss and combined ratios shown below include prior year reserve development.

December 31, 2018, compared to $2,462.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. This $148.7 million increase was primarily driven by pricing increases, strong retention, and targeted new business expansion, in addition to reductions in reinstatement premiums. Reinsurance reinstatements were $0.5 million unfavorable in 2018 compared to $27.8 million unfavorable in 2017. The year over year favorable change was $27.3 million due to several 2017 large losses above our retention level in our surety, inland marine and commercial multiple peril lines. The reinstatement premiums represent the pro-rata reinsurance premium charged for reinstating the amount of reinsurance coverage utilized as a result of the incurred losses that are reimbursable under our reinsurance treaties. See the Glossary of Selected Insurance Terms - Reinstatement premium\u201d.\nCommercial Lines underwriting profit for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $85.0 million, compared to $12.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, a change of $72.8 million. Catastrophe-related losses for the year ended December 31, 2018 were $142.3 million, compared to $170.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, a decrease of $28.3 million. Favorable development on prior years' loss reserves for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $34.1 million, compared to $9.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, a favorable change of $24.7 million.\nCommercial Lines current accident year underwriting profit, excluding catastrophes, was $193.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to $173.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. This $19.8 million improvement was primarily due to the reduction in large loss-related reinsurance reinstatement premiums, lower expenses and earned premium growth, partially offset by higher non-catastrophe current accident year losses. The reduction in reinsurance reinstatement premiums, net of ceding commissions, increased non-catastrophe current accident year underwriting profit by $21.5 million compared to the prior year. The higher non-catastrophe current accident year losses were driven by large property loss activity in our commercial multiple peril line and higher loss activity in our commercial automobile liability line, partially offset by lower loss activity in our other commercial lines.\nWe are continuing our efforts to improve underwriting results through increased rates, pricing segmentation, specific underwriting actions and targeted new business growth. Our ability to achieve overall rate increases is affected by the current competitive pricing\nenvironment, particularly within our workers' compensation line, as well as for larger middle market accounts, which may hamper our ability to grow in this portion of our business.\nPersonal Lines\nPersonal Lines net premiums written were $1,774.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to $1,647.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of $127.0 million. This was primarily due to higher renewal premium driven by rate increases and strong retention, as well as new business growth.\nNet premiums written in the personal automobile line of business for the year ended December 31, 2018 were $1,127.5 million, compared to $1,041.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of $85.9 million. This increase was primarily due to rate increases and an increase in policies in force of 2.5%. Net premiums written in the homeowners line of business for the year ended December 31, 2018 were $604.0 million, compared to $566.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of $37.1 million. This is attributable to rate increases and an increase in policies in force of 3.0%.\nPersonal Lines underwriting profit for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $66.6 million, compared to $83.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, a decline of $17.1 million. Catastrophe losses for the year ended December 31, 2018 were $76.9 million, compared to $80.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, a decrease of $4.0 million. Unfavorable development on prior years' loss reserves for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $33.3 million, compared to $9.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of $23.9 million.\nPersonal Lines current accident year underwriting profit, excluding catastrophes, was $176.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to $174.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. This $2.8 million increase was primarily a result of earned premium growth and lower expenses, partially offset by higher non-catastrophe current accident year losses. This increase in losses was driven by higher homeowners property losses, partly due to large losses and non-catastrophe weather activity, higher personal automobile bodily injury loss severity and, to a lesser extent, higher personal automobile property losses.\nWe have been able to obtain rate increases in our Personal Lines markets and believe that our ability to obtain these increases will continue. However, our ability to maintain Personal Lines net premiums written may be affected by price competition, and regulatory and legal developments. Additionally, these factors along with weather-related loss volatility may also affect our ability to maintain and improve underwriting results. We monitor these trends and consider them in our rate actions.\nOther\nOther operating losses were $5.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to $8.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, an improvement of $3.4 million, primarily due to higher net investment income.\n2017 Compared to 2016\nCommercial Lines\nCommercial Lines net premiums written were $2,462.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $2,361.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. This $100.5 million increase was due to growth of $117.4 million, primarily driven by pricing increases, strong retention, and targeted new business expansion, partially offset by a $16.9 million increase in reinsurance reinstatement premiums driven by large property losses in our inland marine and commercial multiple peril lines.\nCommercial Lines underwriting profit for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $12.2 million, compared to underwriting loss of $123.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, a change of $135.4 million. Favorable development on prior years' loss reserves for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $9.4 million, compared to unfavorable development of $223.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, a favorable change of $232.4 million, primarily due to the aforementioned reserve charge following our 2016 fourth quarter reserve review. Catastrophe-related losses for the year ended December 31, 2017 were $170.6 million, compared to $70.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, an increase of $100.5 million. This increase is primarily due to hurricanes Harvey and Irma that occurred in the third quarter, the California wildfires that occurred in the fourth quarter, and a large Midwest hail event that occurred in the second quarter.\nCommercial Lines current accident year underwriting profit, excluding catastrophes, was $173.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $169.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. This $3.5 million improvement was primarily due to lower losses in our workers' compensation line, lower expenses and premium growth, partially offset by higher large losses and the increase in reinstatement premiums. The impact of additional reinstatement premiums, net of ceding commissions, decreased 2017 current accident year underwriting profit by $12.0 million from 2016 levels.\nPersonal Lines\nPersonal Lines net premiums written were $1,647.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $1,521.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, an increase of $125.9 million. This was primarily due to higher renewal premium driven by rate increases and improved retention, as well as new business growth.\nNet premiums written in the personal automobile line of business for the year ended December 31, 2017 were $1,041.6 million, compared to $953.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, an increase of $88.0 million. This increase was primarily due to rate increases and an increase in policies in force of 3.8%. Net premiums written in the homeowners line of business for the year ended December 31, 2017 were $566.9 million, compared to $529.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, an increase of $37.2 million. This is attributable to rate increases and an increase in policies in force of 4.0%.\nPersonal Lines underwriting profit for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $83.7 million, compared to $103.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, a decline of $19.4 million. Catastrophe losses for the year ended December 31, 2017 were $80.9 million, compared to $47.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, an increase of $33.9 million. This increase is primarily due to a large Midwest wind event that occurred in the first quarter of 2017. Unfavorable development on prior years' loss reserves for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $9.4 million, compared to $4.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, an increase of $5.1 million.\nPersonal Lines current accident year underwriting profit, excluding catastrophes, was $174.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $154.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. This $19.6 million increase was primarily a result of earned premium growth and lower expenses. Also, higher current accident year losses in our homeowners line were substantially offset by lower losses in our personal automobile line.\nOther\nOther operating losses were $8.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $19.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, an improvement of $10.7 million, primarily due to 2016 unfavorable prior year reserve development in our run-off voluntary pools business (See 2016 Loss and LAE Development, excluding catastrophes\u201d section below for further discussion).\nRESERVE FOR LOSSES AND LOSS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES\nOverview of Loss Reserve Estimation Process\nWe maintain reserves for our property and casualty products to provide for our ultimate liability for losses and loss adjustment expenses (our loss reserves\u201d) with respect to reported and unreported claims incurred as of the end of each accounting period. These reserves are estimates, taking into account past loss experience, modified for current trends, as well as prevailing economic, legal and social conditions. Loss reserves represent our largest liability.\nManagement's process for establishing loss reserves is a comprehensive process that involves input from multiple functions throughout our organization, including actuarial, finance, claims, legal, underwriting, distribution and business operations management. The process incorporates facts currently known, as well as the current, and in some cases, the anticipated, state of the law and coverage litigation. Based on information currently available, we believe that the aggregate loss reserves at December 31, 2018 were adequate to cover claims for losses that had occurred as of that date, including both those known to us and those yet to be reported. However, as described below, there are significant uncertainties inherent in the loss reserving process. Our estimate of the ultimate liability for losses that had occurred as of December 31, 2018 is expected to change in future periods as we obtain further information, and such changes could have a material effect on our results of operations and financial position.\nOur loss reserves include case estimates for claims that have been reported and estimates for claims that have been incurred but not reported ( IBNR\u201d) at the balance sheet date. They also include estimates of the expenses associated with processing and settling all reported and unreported claims, less estimates of anticipated salvage and subrogation recoveries. Our property and casualty loss reserves are not discounted to present value.\nCase reserves are established by our claim personnel individually on a claim by claim basis and based on information specific to the occurrence and terms of the underlying policy. For some classes of business, average case reserves are used initially. Case reserves are periodically reviewed and modified based on new or additional information pertaining to the claim.\nOur ultimate IBNR reserves are estimated by management and our reserving actuaries on an aggregate basis for each line of business or coverage for loss and loss expense liabilities not reflected within the case reserves. The sum of the case reserves and the IBNR reserves represents our estimate of total unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses.\nWe regularly review our loss reserves using a variety of industry accepted analytical techniques. We update the loss reserves as historical loss experience develops, additional claims are reported and resolved and new information becomes available. Net changes in loss reserves are reflected in operating results in the period in which the reserves are changed.\nThe IBNR reserve includes a provision for claims that have occurred but have not yet been reported to us, some of which may not yet be known to the insured, as well as a provision for future development on reported claims. IBNR represents a significant proportion of our total net loss reserves, particularly for long-tail liability classes. In fact, approximately 48% of our aggregate net loss reserves at December 31, 2018 were for IBNR losses and loss expenses.\nCritical Judgments and Key Assumptions\nWe determine the amount of our loss reserves based on an estimation process that is complex and considers information from both company specific and industry data, as well as general economic and other information. The estimation process utilizes a combination of objective and subjective information, the blending of which requires significant professional judgment. There are various assumptions required, including future trends in frequency and severity of claims, operational changes in claim handling and case reserving practices, and trends related to general economic and social conditions. Informed judgments as to our ultimate exposure to losses are an integral component of our loss reserve estimation process.\nGiven the inherent complexity of our loss reserve estimation process and the potential variability of the assumptions used, the actual emergence of losses will vary, perhaps substantially, from the estimate of losses included in our financial statements, particularly in those instances where settlements or other claim resolutions do not occur until well into the future. Our net loss reserves at December 31, 2018 were $3.8 billion. Therefore, a relatively small percentage change in the estimate of net loss reserves would have a material effect on our results of operations.\nThere is greater inherent uncertainty in estimating insurance reserves for certain types of property and casualty insurance lines, particularly liability lines, where a longer period of time may elapse before a definitive determination of ultimate liability and losses may be made. In addition, the technological, judicial, regulatory and political climates involving these types of claims are continuously evolving. There is also greater uncertainty in establishing reserves with respect to business that is new to us, particularly new business which is generated with respect to newly introduced product lines, by newly appointed agents or in geographies in which we have less experience in conducting business. In such cases, there is less historical experience or knowledge and less data upon which we can rely. A combination of business that is both new to us and has longer development periods provides even greater uncertainty in estimating insurance reserves. In our management and professional liability lines, we are modestly increasing, and expect to continue to increase, our exposure to longer-tailed liability lines, including directors and officers liability, errors and omissions liability and product liability coverages. In addition, in recent periods we have experienced extensions of the tails\u201d in certain lines of business as the full value of claims are presented later than had been our historical experience.\nWe regularly update our reserve estimates as new information becomes available and additional events occur which may impact the resolution of unsettled claims. Reserve adjustments are reflected in the results of operations as adjustments to losses and LAE. Often, these adjustments are recognized in periods subsequent to the period in which the underlying policy was written and the loss event occurred. When these types of subsequent adjustments affect prior years, they are described separately as prior year reserve development\u201d. Such development can be either favorable or unfavorable to our financial results and may vary by line of business. As discussed below, estimated loss and LAE reserves for claims occurring in prior years, in the aggregate, developed unfavorably by $0.4 million, $1.2 million and $235.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively, although there was considerable variance by line of business. Additionally, our estimated loss and LAE reserves for catastrophe claims occurring in prior years developed favorably by $9.3 million, favorably by $1.4 million, and unfavorably by $2.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. There can be no assurance that current loss and LAE reserves will be sufficient.\nWe regularly review our reserving techniques, our overall reserving position and our reinsurance. Based on (i) our review of historical data, legislative enactments, judicial decisions, legal developments in impositions of damages and policy coverage, political attitudes and trends in general economic conditions, (ii) our review of per claim information, (iii) our historical loss experience and that of the industry, (iv) the nature of policies written by us, and (v) our internal estimates of required reserves, we believe that adequate provision has been made for loss reserves. However, establishment of appropriate reserves is an inherently uncertain process, and there can be no certainty that current established reserves will prove adequate in light of subsequent actual experience. A significant change to the estimated reserves could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position. An increase or decrease in reserve estimates would result in a corresponding decrease or increase in financial results. For example, each one percentage point change in the aggregate loss and LAE ratio resulting from a change in reserve estimation is currently projected to have an approximate $43 million impact on operating income, based on 2018 full year premiums.\nThe major causes of material uncertainty relating to ultimate losses and LAE ( risk factors\u201d) generally vary for each line of business, as well as for each separately analyzed component of the line of business. In some cases, such risk factors are explicit assumptions of the estimation method and in others, they are implicit. For example, a method may explicitly assume that a certain percentage of claims will close each year, but will implicitly assume that the legal interpretation of existing contract language will remain substantially unchanged. Actual results will likely vary from expectations for each of these assumptions, resulting in an ultimate claim liability that is different from that being estimated currently.\nSome risk factors affect multiple lines of business. Examples include changes in claim handling and claim reserving practices, changes in claim settlement patterns, regulatory and legislative actions, court actions, timeliness of claim reporting, state mix of claimants, and degree of claimant fraud. Additionally, there is also a higher degree of uncertainty due to growth in our newly acquired businesses, with respect to which we have less familiarity and, in some cases, limited historical claims experience. The extent of the impact of a risk factor will also vary by components within a line of business. Individual risk factors are subject to interactions with other risk factors within line of business components. Thus, risk factors can have offsetting or compounding effects on required reserves.\nInflation generally increases the cost of losses covered by insurance contracts. The effect of inflation varies by product. Our property and casualty insurance premiums are established before the amount of losses and LAE and the extent to which inflation may affect such expenses are known. Consequently, we attempt, in establishing rates and reserves, to anticipate the potential impact of inflation in the projection of ultimate costs. For example, we monitor and continue to experience increases in medical costs, wages and legal costs, which are key considerations in setting reserve assumptions for workers' compensation, bodily injury and other liability lines. We are also monitoring the continued advancements in technology and design found in automobiles and homes and the increased claims settlement costs that result from repairs or replacement of such equipment. Estimated increases are reflected in our current reserve estimates, but continued increases are expected to contribute to increased losses and LAE in the future.\nWe are also defendants in various litigation matters, including putative class actions, which may seek punitive damages, bad faith or extra-contractual damages, legal fees and interest, or claim a broader scope of policy coverage or settlement and payment obligations than our interpretation. Resolution of these cases are often highly unpredictable and could involve material unanticipated damage awards. We have experienced, and others in the industry have reported, increased attorney involvement in claims, delayed submissions of medical and other expense claims, and a trend toward higher valued settlements and litigation, all of which contribute to uncertainty regarding reserve estimates.\nLoss and LAE Reserves by Line of Business\nReserving Process Overview\nOur loss reserves include amounts related to short-tail and long-tail classes of business. Tail\u201d refers to the time period between the occurrence of a loss and the final settlement of the claim. The longer the time span between the incidence of a loss and the settlement of the claim (i.e., a longer tail), the more the ultimate settlement amount may likely vary from our original estimate.\nShort-tail classes consist principally of automobile physical damage, homeowners property, commercial property and marine business. For these property coverages, claims are generally reported and settled shortly after the loss occurs because the claims relate to tangible property and are more likely to be discovered shortly after the loss occurs. Consequently, the estimation of loss reserves for these classes is generally less complex.\nWhile we estimate that a majority of our written premium is in what we would characterize as shorter-tailed classes of business, most of our loss reserves relate to longer-tail liability classes of business. Long-tailed classes include commercial liability, automobile liability, workers' compensation and other types of third-party coverage. For many liability claims, significant periods of time, ranging up to several years or more, may elapse between the occurrence of the loss, the discovery and reporting of the loss to us and the settlement of the claim. As a result, loss experience in the more recent accident years for long-tailed liability coverage has limited statistical credibility because a relatively small proportion of losses in these accident years (the calendar years in which losses are incurred) are reported claims and an even smaller proportion are paid losses. Liability claims are also more susceptible to litigation and can be significantly affected by changing contract interpretations, the legal, political and social environment, the risk and expense of protracted litigation and inflation. Consequently, the estimation of loss reserves for these coverages is more complex and typically subject to a higher degree of variability and uncertainty compared to short-tailed coverages.\nMost of our indirect business from our run-off voluntary and ongoing involuntary pools is assumed long-tailed casualty reinsurance. Reserve estimates for this business are therefore subject to the variability caused by extended loss emergence periods. The estimation of loss reserves for this business is further complicated by delays between the time the claim is reported to the ceding insurer and when it is reported by the ceding insurer to the pool manager and then to us, and by our dependence on the quality and consistency of the loss reporting by the ceding company and actuarial estimates by the pool manager. These reserving factors also apply to our discontinued assumed accident and health reinsurance pools and arrangements that are included in our liabilities of discontinued life business (See Risk Factors\u201d in Part I - Item 1A for further discussion).\nA review of loss reserves for each of the classes of business which we write is conducted regularly, generally quarterly. This review process takes into consideration a variety of trends that impact the ultimate settlement of claims. Where appropriate, the review includes a review of overall payment patterns and the emergence of paid and reported losses relative to expectations.\nThe loss reserve estimation process relies on the basic assumption that past experience, adjusted for the effects of current developments and likely trends, is an appropriate basis for predicting future outcomes. As part of this process, we use a variety of analytical methods that consider experience, trends and other relevant factors. IBNR reserves are generally calculated by first projecting the ultimate cost of all claims that have been reported or expected to be reported in the future and then subtracting reported losses and loss expenses. Reported losses include cumulative paid losses and loss expenses plus case reserves. Within the loss reserving process, standard actuarial methods which include: (1) loss development factor methods; (2) expected loss methods (Bornheutter-Ferguson); and (3) adjusted loss methods (Berquist-Sherman), are given due consideration. These methods are described below:\nTable 82: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Loss development factor methods generally assume that the losses yet to emerge for an accident year are proportional to the paid or reported loss amount observed to date.

The expected losses, and corresponding loss ratios, are a critical component of Bornheutter-Ferguson methodologies and provide a general reasonability guide.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 85: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Berquist-Sherman methods are used for estimating reserves in business lines where historical development patterns may be deemed less reliable for more recent accident years' ultimate losses.

When the adequacy of case reserves change, the Berquist-Sherman incurred method may be deemed more reliable than the reported loss development factor method. Likewise, when the settlement patterns change, the Berquist-Sherman paid method may be deemed more reliable than the paid loss development factor method.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn addition to the methods described above, various tailored reserving methodologies are used for certain businesses. For example, for some low volume and high volatility classes of business, special reserving techniques are utilized that estimate IBNR by selecting the loss ratio that balances actual reported losses to expected reported losses as defined by the estimated underlying reporting pattern. Also, for some classes with long exposure periods (e.g., construction defect, engineering and surety), earnings patterns plus an estimated reporting lag applied to the Bornheutter-Ferguson initial expected loss ratio are used to estimate IBNR. This is done in order to reflect the changing average exposure periods by policy year (and consequently accident year).\nIn completing the loss reserve analysis, a variety of assumptions must be made for each line of business, coverage and accident year. Each estimation method has its own pattern, parameter and/or judgmental dependencies, with no estimation method being better than the others in all situations. The relative strengths and weaknesses of the various estimation methods, when applied to a particular class of business, can also change over time, depending on the underlying circumstances. In many cases, multiple estimation methods will be valid for the particular facts and circumstances of the relevant class of business. The manner of application and the degree of reliance on a given method will vary by line of business and coverage, and by accident year based on an evaluation of the above dependencies and the potential volatility of the loss frequency and severity patterns. The estimation methods selected or given weight at a particular valuation date are those that are believed to produce the most reliable indication for the loss reserves being evaluated. Selections incorporate input from claims personnel, pricing actuaries, and underwriting management on loss cost trends and other factors that could affect ultimate losses.\nFor most classes of shorter-tailed business in our Commercial and Personal Lines segments, the emergence of paid and incurred losses generally exhibits a relatively stable pattern of loss development from one accident year to the next. Thus, for these classes, the loss development factor method is generally appropriate. For many of the classes of shorter-tailed business, the emergence of paid and incurred losses may exhibit a relatively volatile pattern of loss development from one accident year to the next. In certain cases where there is a relatively low level of reliability placed on the available paid and incurred loss data, expected loss methods or adjusted loss methods are considered appropriate for the most recent accident year.\nFor longer-tailed lines of business, applying the loss development factor method often requires even more judgment in selecting development factors, as well as more significant extrapolation. For those long-tailed lines of business with high frequency and relatively low per-loss severity (e.g., personal automobile liability), volatility will often be sufficiently modest for the loss development factor method to be given significant weight, even in the most recent accident years, but expected loss methods and adjusted loss methods are always considered and frequently utilized in the selection process. For those long-tailed lines of business with low frequency and high loss potential (e.g., commercial general liability), anticipated loss experience is less predictable because of the small number of claims and erratic claim severity patterns. In these situations, the loss development factor methods may not produce a reliable estimate of ultimate losses in the most recent accident years since many claims either have not yet been reported or are only in the early stages of the settlement process. Therefore, the loss reserve estimates for these accident years may be based on methods less reliant on extrapolation, such as Bornheutter-Ferguson. Over time, as a greater number of claims are reported and the statistical credibility of loss experience increases, loss development factor methods or adjusted loss methods are given increasing weight.\nManagement endeavors to apply as much available data as practicable to estimate the loss reserve amount for each line of business, coverage and accident year, utilizing varying assumptions, projections and methods. The ultimate outcome is likely to fall within a range of potential outcomes around this loss reserve estimated amount.\nOur carried reserves for each line of business and coverage are determined based on the quarterly loss reserving process. In making the determination, we consider numerous quantitative and qualitative factors. Quantitative factors include changes in reserve estimates in the period, the maturity of the accident year, trends observed over the recent past, the level of volatility within a particular class of business, the estimated effects of reinsurance, including reinstatement premiums, general economic trends, and other factors. Qualitative factors may include legal and regulatory developments, changes in claim handling and case reserving practices, recent\nentry into new markets or products, changes in underwriting practices or business mix, concerns that we do not have sufficient or quality historical reported and paid loss and LAE information with respect to a particular line or segment of our business, effects of the economy and political outlook, perceived anomalies in the historical results, evolving trends or other factors. In doing so, we must evaluate whether a change in the data represents credible actionable information or an anomaly. Such an assessment requires considerable judgment. Even if a change is determined to be apparent, it is not always possible to determine the extent of the change. As a result, there can be a time lag between the emergence of a change and a determination that the change should be partially or fully reflected in the carried loss reserves. In general, changes are made more quickly to reserves for more mature accident years and less volatile classes of business.\nReserving Process Uncertainties\nAs stated above, numerous factors (both internal and external) contribute to the inherent uncertainty in the process of establishing loss reserves, including changes in the rate of inflation for goods and services related to insured damages (e.g., medical care, home repairs, etc.), changes in the judicial interpretation of policy provisions, and settlement obligations, changes in the general attitude of juries in determining damage awards, legislative actions, such as expanding liability, coverage mandates or expanding or suspending statutes of limitations which otherwise limit the times within which claims can be made, changes in the extent of insured injuries, changes in the trend of expected frequency and/or severity of claims, changes in our book of business (e.g., change in mix due to new product offerings, new geographic areas, etc.), changes in our underwriting practices, and changes in claim handling procedures and/or systems. Regarding our indirect business from voluntary and involuntary pools, we are provided loss estimates by managers of each pool. We adopt reserve estimates for the pools that consider this information and other facts.\nIn addition, we must consider the uncertain effects of emerging or potential claims and coverage issues that arise as legal, judicial, social conditions, political risks, and economic conditions change. For example, claims which we consider closed may be re-opened as additional damages surface or new liability or damage theories are presented. Also, historically we have observed more frequent and higher severity in workers' compensation, bodily injury and other liability claims, and more credit related losses (for example, in our surety business) during periods of economic uncertainty or high unemployment. These and other issues could have a negative effect on our loss reserves by either extending coverage beyond the original underwriting intent or by increasing the number or size of claims.\nAs part of our loss reserving analysis, we consider the various factors that contribute to the uncertainty in the loss reserving process. Those factors that could materially affect our loss reserve estimates include loss development patterns and loss cost trends, reporting lags, rate and exposure level changes, the effects of changes in coverage and policy limits, business mix shifts, the effects of regulatory and legislative developments, economic circumstances, the effects of changes in judicial interpretations, the effects of emerging claims and coverage issues and the effects of changes in claim handling and claim reserving practices. In making estimates of reserves, however, we do not necessarily make an explicit assumption for each of these factors. Moreover, all estimation methods do not utilize the same assumptions and typically no single method is determinative in the reserve analysis for a line of business and coverage. Consequently, changes in our loss reserve estimates generally are not the result of changes in any one assumption. Instead, the variability will be affected by the interplay of changes in numerous assumptions, many of which are implicit to the approaches used.\nFor each line of business and coverage, we regularly adjust the assumptions and methods used in the estimation of loss reserves in response to our actual loss experience, as well as our judgments regarding changes in trends and/or emerging patterns. In those instances where we primarily utilize analyses of historical patterns of the development of paid and reported losses, this may be reflected, for example, in the selection of revised loss development factors. In longer-tailed classes of business and for which loss experience is less predictable due to potential changes in judicial interpretations, potential legislative actions, the cost of litigation or determining liability and the ultimate loss, inflation, potential claims and other issues, this may be reflected in a judgmental change in our estimate of ultimate losses for particular accident years. Most of the insurance policies we have written over many years are written on an occurrence\u201d basis, which means we insure specified acts or events which occurred during the covered period, even if claims first arise from such events many years later. For example, the industry incurred significant losses as a result of claims arising from asbestos and environmental damage which occurred decades ago and was not known at such time, and in many cases policy limits were available for each year during which such occurrence policies were in place.\nThe future impact of the various factors that contribute to the uncertainty in the loss reserving process is impossible to predict. There is potential for significant variation in the development of loss reserves, particularly for long-tailed classes of business and classes of business that are more vulnerable to economic or political risks.\nReserving Process for Catastrophe Events\nThe estimation of claims and claims expense reserves for catastrophes also comprises estimates of losses from reported claims and IBNR, primarily for damage to property. In general, our estimates for catastrophe reserves are determined on an event basis by considering various sources of available information, including specific loss estimates reported to us based on claim adjuster inspections, overall industry loss estimates, and our internal data regarding exposures related to the geographical location of the event. However, depending on the nature of the catastrophe, the estimation process can be further complicated by other impediments. For\nexample, for hurricanes and other severe wind storms, complications often include the inability of insureds to promptly report losses, delays in the ability of claims adjusting staff to inspect losses, difficulties in determining whether losses are covered by our homeowners policy (generally for damage caused by wind or wind driven rain) or are specifically excluded from coverage caused by flood, and challenges in estimating additional living expenses, assessing the impact of demand surge, exposure to mold damage, and the effects of numerous other considerations. Another example is the complication of estimating the cost of business interruption coverage on commercial lines policies. Estimates for catastrophes which occur at or near the end of a financial reporting period may be even less reliable since we will have less claims data available and little time to complete our estimation process. In such situations, we may adapt our practices to accommodate the circumstances.\nFor events designated as catastrophes which affect our Commercial and Personal Lines business segments, we generally calculate IBNR reserves directly as a result of an estimated IBNR claim count and an estimated average claim amount for each event. Such an assessment involves a comprehensive analysis of the nature of the event, of policyholder exposures within the affected geographic area and of available claims intelligence. Depending on the nature of the event, available claims intelligence could include surveys of field claims associates within the affected geographic area, feedback from a catastrophe claims team sent into the area, as well as data on claims reported as of the financial statement date. In addition, loss emergence from similar historical events is compared to the estimated IBNR for our current catastrophe events to help assess the reasonableness of our estimates.\nReserving Sensitivity Analysis\nThe following discussion presents disclosure related to possible variation in net reserve estimates due to changes in key assumptions. This information is provided for illustrative purposes only. Many other assumptions may also lead to material reserve adjustments. If any such variations do occur, then they would likely occur over a period of several years and therefore their impact on our results of operations would be recognized during the same periods. It is important to note, however, that there is the potential for future variations greater than the amounts described below and for any such variations to be recognized in a single quarterly or annual period. No consideration has been given to potential correlation or lack of correlation among key assumptions or among lines of business and coverage as described below. As a result and because there are so many other factors which affect our net reserve estimate, it would be inappropriate to take the amounts described below and simply add them together in an attempt to estimate volatility in total. While we believe these are reasonably possible scenarios, the reader should not consider the following sensitivity analysis as illustrative of a net reserve range.\nTable 86: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Personal and Commercial Automobile Bodily Injury - loss reserves recorded for bodily injury on U.S. voluntary business were $635.7 million as of December 31, 2018.

As discussed under Reserving Process Overview\u201d in the preceding section, our historical loss experience and loss development patterns are important factors in estimating loss reserves, however, they are not the only factors we evaluate to establish reserves. Therefore, a mechanical application of standard actuarial methodologies in projecting ultimate claims could result in materially different reserves to those held. Accordingly, it is not appropriate to extrapolate future favorable or unfavorable development based on amounts experienced in prior periods.\nThe following table summarizes prior year (favorable) unfavorable development by segment for the periods indicated:\nTable 94: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Loss\n&\nLAE\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Catastrophe\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Loss\n&\nLAE\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Catastrophe\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Loss\n&\nLAE\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Catastrophe\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Commercial Lines\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (34.1\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (6.8\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (40.9\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (9.4\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (1.4\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (10.8\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 223.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (3.7\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 219.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Personal Lines\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 33.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2.5\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 30.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other Segment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total prior year (favorable)\nunfavorable development\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 0.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (9.3\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (8.9\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (1.4\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (0.2\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 235.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 238.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCatastrophe Loss Development\nIn 2018, favorable catastrophe development was $9.3 million, primarily due to lower than expected losses related to the 2017 hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria and California wildfires.

Commercial Lines favorable development of $34.1 million was primarily due to lower than expected losses of $31.0 million within the workers' compensation line in accident years 2015 through 2017; $25.1 million in other commercial lines, primarily in our professional and management liability and monoline general liability lines, related to the 2014 through 2016 accident years; and our surety line in accident years 2015 and 2017; partially offset by higher than expected losses in AIX programs and business classes which have since been terminated. Also partially offsetting the favorable Commercial Lines development was higher than expected losses of $23.2 million in the commercial automobile line, driven by higher bodily injury severity in the 2014, 2016, and 2017 accident years. Personal Lines unfavorable\ndevelopment of $33.3 million was primarily due to higher than expected losses of $15.8 million within the homeowners line in accident years 2015 through 2017, and $15.0 million in the personal automobile line, driven by bodily injury severity in the 2016 accident year and, to a lesser extent, the 2015 accident year. In addition, Other segment unfavorable development of $1.2 million was due to higher than expected losses in our runoff voluntary pools business.\n2017 Loss and LAE Development, excluding catastrophes\nIn 2017, net unfavorable loss and LAE development, excluding catastrophes, was $1.2 million. Commercial Lines favorable development of $9.4 million was primarily due to lower than expected losses within the workers' compensation line in accident years 2012 through 2016. Personal Lines unfavorable development of $9.4 million was primarily due to higher than expected losses in homeowners for accident year 2016. In addition, Other segment unfavorable development of $1.2 million was due to higher than expected losses in our runoff voluntary pools business.\n2016 Loss and LAE Development, excluding catastrophes\nIn 2016, net unfavorable loss and LAE development was $235.6 million, primarily as a result of net unfavorable development of $223.0 million for Commercial Lines. The net unfavorable Commercial Lines development primarily resulted from higher than expected losses in other commercial lines of $168.0 million, which includes the AIX program business. This was primarily driven by AIX programs, general liability coverages in accident years 2012 through 2015, and surety bonds in accident years 2012 through 2015. We also experienced higher than expected losses within the commercial multiple peril line of $74.2 million for accident years 2012 through 2015 and the commercial automobile line of $27.5 million in accident years 2012 through 2014, both primarily within liability coverages. Partially offsetting the unfavorable development was lower than expected losses of $46.7 million within the workers' compensation line, primarily related to accident years 2013 through 2015 and, to a lesser extent, our commercial umbrella line related to accident year 2015.\nAs a result of our 2016 fourth quarter reserve review, carried reserves for prior accident years, excluding catastrophes, were increased by $174.1 million in the fourth quarter, of which $161.5 million related to Commercial Lines. The majority of this adjustment was attributed to our long-tailed commercial liability coverages, including our AIX program business and was largely driven by worsening trends in the number and nature of high severity losses and higher than anticipated legal defense costs. We reacted to this adverse emergence by updating our assumptions about loss severity, loss development patterns, expected loss ratios and loss adjustment expenses for the most recent accident years, placing greater weight on the adverse severity trends experienced in the most recent calendar years. The adverse prior year development for our Other segment was due to our run-off voluntary assumed reinsurance pools business. The reserve increase was based on an updated third-party actuarial study received in the fourth quarter for the Excess and Casualty Reinsurance Association ( ECRA\u201d) pool that primarily consists of asbestos and environmental exposures.\nAsbestos and Environmental Reserves\nAs of December 31, 2018, we have $38.9 million of net asbestos and environmental reserves, comprised of $8.9 million of direct reserves and $30.0 million of assumed reinsurance pool reserves. This compares to net reserves of $39.8 million and $41.1 million as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Ending loss and LAE reserves for all direct business written by our property and casualty companies related to asbestos and environmental damage liability were $8.9 million, $9.5 million, and $9.9 million, net of reinsurance of $18.7 million, $20.2 million, and $19.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Activity for our direct asbestos and environmental reserves was not significant to our 2018, 2017 or 2016 financial results. As a result of our historical direct underwriting mix of Commercial Lines policies toward smaller and middle market risks, past asbestos and environmental damage liability loss experience has remained minimal in relation to our total loss and LAE incurred experience. Although we attempt to limit our exposures to asbestos and environmental damage liability through specific policy exclusions, we have been and may continue to be subject to claims related to these exposures.\nIn addition to reserves we carry to cover exposure in our direct business, we have established gross and net loss and LAE reserves for assumed reinsurance pool business with asbestos and environmental damage liability of $30.0 million, $30.3 million and $31.2 million at December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. These reserves relate to pools in which we have terminated our participation; however, we continue to be subject to claims related to years in which we were a participant. Results of operations from these pools are included in our Other segment. A significant part of our pool reserves relates to our participation in the ECRA voluntary pool from 1950 to 1982. In 1982, the pool was dissolved and since that time, the business has been in run-off. Our percentage of the total pool liabilities varied from 1% to 6% during these years. Our participation in this pool has resulted in average paid losses of approximately $2 million annually over the past ten years.\nWe estimate our ultimate liability for asbestos, environmental and toxic tort liability claims, whether resulting from direct business, assumed reinsurance or pool business, based upon currently known facts, reasonable assumptions where the facts are not known, current law and methodologies currently available. Although these outstanding claims are not significant, their existence gives rise to uncertainty and are discussed because of the possibility that they may become significant. We believe that, notwithstanding the evolution of case law expanding liability in asbestos and environmental claims, recorded reserves related to these claims are adequate.\nNevertheless, the asbestos, environmental and toxic tort liability reserves could be revised, and any such revisions could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations for a particular quarterly or annual period or on our financial position.\nReinsurance\nSee Reinsurance\u201d in Item 1 - Business for information on our reinsurance programs.\nINVESTMENTS\nThe investments discussion below excludes amounts relating to the operations of Chaucer.\nINVESTMENT RESULTS\nNet investment income before income taxes was as follows:\nTable 96: <table> <tr> <td> DECEMBER 31\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (dollars in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Fixed maturities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 217.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 205.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 202.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Limited partnerships\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 24.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 15.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Equity securities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 17.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 18.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 18.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Mortgage loans\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 14.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other investments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Investment expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (10.2\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (10.0\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (9.6\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net investment income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 267.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 243.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 231.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Earned yield, fixed maturities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3.62\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3.75\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3.99\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Earned yield, total portfolio\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3.74\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3.75\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3.85\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe increase in net investment income in both 2018 and 2017 was primarily due to the investment of higher operational cash flows, partially offset by the impact of lower fixed income new money yields that, while increasing from recent lower levels, were below that of average embedded investments.

Association of Insurance Commissioners ( NAIC\u201d), approximately 95% and 94% of the fixed maturity portfolio consisted of investment grade securities at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The quality of our fixed maturity portfolio remains strong based on ratings, capital structure position, support through guarantees, underlying security, issuer diversification and yield curve position.\nOur investment portfolio primarily consists of fixed maturity securities whose fair value is susceptible to market risk, including interest rate changes. See also Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk\u201d included in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition. Duration is a measurement used to quantify our inherent interest rate risk and analyze invested assets relative to our reserve liabilities.\nThe duration of our fixed maturity portfolio was as follows:\nTable 100: <table> <tr> <td> DECEMBER 31\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (dollars in millions)\nDuration\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Amortized\nCost\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fair Value\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % of Total\nFair Value\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Amortized\nCost\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fair Value\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % of Total\nFair Value\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 0-2 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,092.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,101.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 17.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 770.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 791.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 13.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 2-4 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,427.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,420.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 23.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,428.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,471.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 25.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 4-6 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,831.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,801.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 29.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,559.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,584.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 27.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 6-8 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,768.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,710.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 27.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,620.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,619.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 28.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 8-10 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 57.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 59.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 201.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 203.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 10+ years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 69.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 68.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 76.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 79.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total fixed maturities,\nexcluding Chaucer\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 6,245.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 6,161.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 100.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 5,657.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 5,749.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 100.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Weighted average duration,\nexcluding Chaucer\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur fixed maturity and equity securities are carried at fair value. Financial instruments whose value was determined using significant management judgment or estimation constituted less than 1% of the total assets we measured at fair value. See also Note 5 - Fair Value\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nEquity securities primarily consist of U.S. income-oriented large capitalization common stocks and developed market equity index exchange-traded funds.\nMortgage and other loans consist primarily of commercial mortgage loan participations, which represent our interest in commercial mortgage loans originated by a third-party. We share, on a pro-rata basis, in all related cash flows of the underlying mortgage loans, which are investment-grade quality and diversified by geographic area and property type.\nOther investments consist primarily of our interest in corporate middle market and real estate limited partnerships. Corporate middle market limited partnerships may invest in senior or subordinated debt, preferred or common equity or a combination thereof, of middle market businesses. Real estate limited partnerships invest in debt and/or equity of real properties.\nAlthough we expect to invest new funds primarily in investment grade fixed maturities, we have invested, and expect to continue to invest, a portion of funds in limited partnerships, common equity securities, below investment grade fixed maturities and other investment assets.\nWe deposit funds with various state and governmental authorities. See Note 3 - Investments\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nOTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENTS\nFor the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, we recognized in earnings $4.6 million, $5.6 million and $27.4 million, respectively, of other-than-temporary impairments ( OTTI\u201d). In 2018, OTTI consisted of $2.6 million on fixed maturities and $2.0 million on other invested assets. In 2017, OTTI consisted of $2.0 million on other invested assets, $1.8 million on fixed maturities and $1.8 million on equity securities. In 2016, OTTI consisted primarily of $16.1 million on fixed maturities we intended to sell, $8.3 million related to estimated credit losses on fixed maturities and $2.7 million on equity securities. OTTI in 2016 that related to the energy sector was $16.4 million.\nThe carrying values of fixed maturity securities on non-accrual status at December 31, 2018 and 2017 were not material. The effects of non-accruals compared with amounts that would have been recognized in accordance with the original terms of the fixed maturities for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 were also not material. Any defaults in the fixed maturities portfolio in future periods may negatively affect investment income.\nUNREALIZED LOSSES\nGross unrealized losses on fixed maturities as of December 31, 2018 were $134.2 million, an increase of $95.8 million compared to December 31, 2017, primarily attributable to higher prevailing interest rates and wider credit spreads. At December 31, 2018, gross unrealized losses consisted primarily of $92.0 million of corporate fixed maturities, $24.5 million of residential and commercial mortgage-backed securities and $9.8 million on municipal securities. See also Note 3 - Investments\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nWe view gross unrealized losses on fixed maturities as temporary since it is our assessment that these securities will recover in the near term, allowing us to realize their anticipated long-term economic value. Further, we do not intend to sell, nor is it more likely than not we will be required to sell, such debt securities before this expected recovery of amortized cost (see also Liquidity and\nCapital Resources\u201d). Inherent in our assessment are the risks that market factors may differ from our expectations; the global economy reverts to recessionary trends; we may decide to subsequently sell a security for unforeseen business needs; or changes in the credit assessment from our original assessment may lead us to determine that a sale at the current value would maximize recovery on such investments. To the extent that there are such adverse changes, an OTTI would be recognized as a realized loss. Although unrealized losses on fixed maturities are not reflected in the results of financial operations until they are realized or deemed other-than-temporary\u201d, the fair value of the underlying investment, which does reflect the unrealized loss, is reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nThe following table sets forth gross unrealized losses for fixed maturities by maturity period at December 31, 2018 and 2017. Actual maturities may differ from contractual maturities because borrowers may have the right to call or prepay obligations, with or without call or prepayment penalties, or we may have the right to put or sell the obligations back to the issuers.\nTable 101: <table> <tr> <td> DECEMBER 31\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Due in one year or less\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 0.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 0.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Due after one year through five years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 20.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Due after five years through ten years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 80.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 19.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Due after ten years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 109.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 30.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 25.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total fixed maturities, excluding Chaucer\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 134.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 38.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs of January 1, 2018, we adopted ASC Update No. 2016-01, (Subtopic 825-10) Financial Instruments - Overall: Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities ( ASU No. 2016-01\u201d), which resulted in a cumulative effect adjustment of $97.8 million, net of tax, recorded in retained earnings. See Item O. New Accounting Pronouncements\u201d in Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Beginning in 2018, our equity securities are carried at fair value with increases and decreases in fair value recorded in net income. Previously, changes in fair value on equity securities were recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income, a component of shareholders' equity.\nOur investment portfolio and shareholders' equity can be significantly impacted by changes in market values of our securities. Market volatility could increase and defaults on fixed income securities could occur. As a result, we could incur additional realized and unrealized losses in future periods, which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and/or financial position.\nMonetary policies in developed economies have become more divergent recently, but remain generally supportive of moderate economic growth. Major central banks continue to closely monitor developments in global financial markets and the outlook for growth, and reportedly are committed to adjust monetary policy as required to provide liquidity, support growth and achieve inflation targets. In the United States, the Federal Reserve (the Fed\u201d) increased its target for the federal funds rate by 1.00% in 2018, including 0.25% in December, raising its target range to 2.25% to 2.50%. The Fed continues to signal that economic activity will expand at a moderate pace, labor conditions will remain strong with inflation stabilized around its 2% objective over the medium term. The Fed has communicated that it will be patient as it determines the timing and size of future adjustments to the federal funds rate, which will depend on realized and expected economic conditions relative to its objectives of maximum employment and 2% inflation. While the Fed believes near-term risks to the economic outlook appear roughly balanced, it continues to closely monitor inflation indicators and global economic and financial developments. One such development being watched carefully is the trade/tariff negotiations between the United States and its various trade partners. Should these negotiations lead to a shift or break-down in global trade patterns, there could be negative implications for certain issuers, sectors, or the economy at large.\nMost developed economies' central banks have now ended their extraordinary measures and begun to tighten monetary policy or signal potential tightening, but inflation remains below target in several large economies. Fundamental conditions in the corporate sector generally remain sound. While we may experience defaults on fixed income securities, particularly with respect to non-investment grade debt securities, it is difficult to foresee which issuers, industries or markets will be affected. As a result, the value of our fixed maturity portfolio could change rapidly in ways we cannot currently anticipate, and we could incur additional realized and unrealized losses in future periods.\nQUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nINTEREST RATE SENSITIVITY\nOperations are subject to risk resulting from interest rate fluctuations, which may adversely impact the valuation of the investment portfolio. In a rising interest rate environment, the value of the fixed maturity sector, which comprises approximately 74% of our investment portfolio, may decline as a result of decreases in the fair value of the securities. Our intent is to hold securities to maturity and recover the decline in valuation as prices accrete to par. However, our intent may change prior to maturity due to changes in the financial markets, our analysis of an issuer's credit metrics and prospects, or as a result of changes in cash flow needs. Interest rate fluctuations may also reduce net investment income and as a result, profitability. The portfolio may realize lower yields and therefore lower net investment income on securities because securities with prepayment and call features may prepay at a different rate than originally projected. Also, funds may not be available to invest at higher interest rates.\nIn a declining interest rate environment, prepayments and calls may increase as issuers exercise their option to refinance at lower rates. The resulting funds would be reinvested at lower yields.\nThe following table, which excludes assets relating to Chaucer, illustrates the estimated impact on the fair value of our fixed maturity portfolio at December 31, 2018 and 2017 of hypothetical changes in prevailing interest rates, defined as changes in interest rates on U.S. Treasury debt. It does not reflect changes in credit spreads, liquidity spreads and other factors that also affect the value of securities. Since changes in prevailing interest rates are often accompanied by changes in these other factors, the reader should not assume that an actual change in interest rates would result in the values illustrated.\nTable 102: <table> <tr> <td> (dollars in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> INVESTMENT TYPE\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> +300bp\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> +200bp\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> +100bp\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -100bp\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -200bp\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -300bp\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Residential mortgage-backed securities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Municipal securities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> All other fixed maturity securities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,980\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,165\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,355\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,560\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,770\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,990\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,220\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total December 31, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 5,370\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 5,620\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 5,885\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 6,160\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 6,440\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 6,710\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 6,975\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total December 31, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,970\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 5,215\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 5,480\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 5,750\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 6,020\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 6,285\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 6,550\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur overall investment strategy is intended to balance investment income with credit and interest rate risk, while maintaining sufficient liquidity and the opportunity for capital growth. The asset allocation process takes into consideration the types of business written and the level of surplus required to support our different businesses and the risk return profiles of the underlying asset classes. We look to balance the goals of capital preservation, net investment income stability, liquidity and total return.\nThe majority of our assets are invested in the fixed income markets. Through fundamental research and credit analysis, with a focus on value investing, our investment professionals seek to identify a portfolio of stable income-producing higher quality U.S. government, foreign government, municipal, corporate, residential and commercial mortgage-backed securities and asset-backed securities. We have a general policy of diversifying investments both within and across major investment and industrial sectors to mitigate credit and interest rate risk. We monitor the credit quality of our investments and our exposure to individual markets, borrowers, industries, sectors and, in the case of commercial mortgage-backed securities and commercial mortgage loan participations, property types and geographic locations. In addition, we currently carry debt that is subject to interest rate risk, which was issued at fixed interest rates between 4.50% and 8.207%. Current market conditions, in light of our risk tolerance, restrict our ability to invest fixed income assets at similar rates of return; therefore, earnings on a similar level of assets are not sufficient to cover current debt interest costs.\nEQUITY PRICE RISK\nOur equity securities portfolio is exposed to equity price risk arising from potential volatility in equity market prices. Portfolio characteristics are analyzed regularly and price risk is actively managed through a variety of techniques. A hypothetical increase or decrease of 10% in the market price of our equity securities would have resulted in an increase or decrease in the fair value of the equity securities portfolio of approximately $46 million at December 31, 2018 and $58 million at December 31, 2017.\nOTHER ITEMS\nNet income also included the following items:\nTable 103: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Commercial\nLines\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Personal\nLines\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Other\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Discontinued\nOperations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net realized investment gains (losses)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (35.5\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (13.6\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (50.7\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net loss from repayment of debt\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (18.7\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (7.6\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1.9\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (28.2\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Discontinued operations -

We allocate the investment income, expenses, and realized gains and losses to our Commercial Lines, Personal Lines, and Other segments based on actuarial information related to the underlying businesses. We manage investment assets separately for our Chaucer business.\nNet realized losses on investments were $50.7 million for 2018, and $21.1 million and $10.2 million of net realized gains for 2017 and 2016, respectively. Net realized losses in 2018 were primarily due to $43.4 million of losses from the net change in fair value of equity securities that are now required to be reflected in net income, due to the implementation of ASU 2016-01 effective January 1, 2018. (See also Item O. New Accounting Pronouncements\u201d in Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.) This change in fair value of equity securities resulted from prevailing market conditions. Additionally, in 2018 we recognized $4.6 million of OTTI losses, and $2.7 million of losses recognized from the sale of securities, primarily fixed maturities. Net realized gains in 2017 were primarily due to $26.6 million of gains recognized from the sale of securities, primarily equities, and to a lesser extent, fixed maturities. These gains were partially offset by $5.6 million of OTTI losses. Net realized gains in 2016 were primarily due to $36.6 million of gains recognized from the sale of securities, primarily equities, and to a lesser extent, fixed maturities. These gains were partially offset by $27.4 million of OTTI losses.\nAt December 31, 2018, we had informed the FHLB of our intent to repay a $125 million FHLB note due 2029 with a coupon of 5.5%, with settlement to occur on January 2, 2019. In the fourth quarter of 2018, we recorded a non-operating charge of $20.8 million after-taxes related to the pre-payment provision. Additionally, in 2018 we repurchased subordinated debentures with a net carrying value of $9.6 million at a cost of $11.5 million, resulting in a loss of $1.9 million. In 2016, we redeemed senior debentures with a net carrying value of $375.2 million at a cost of $461.3 million, resulting in a loss of $86.1 million. Additionally, in 2016 we repurchased senior debentures with a net carrying value of $11.9 million at a cost of $14.1 million, resulting in a loss of $2.2 million.\nIncluded in other non-operating items\u201d above in 2017 were $10.2 million of employee termination costs associated with a company-wide expense savings initiative.\nDiscontinued operations primarily include our former Chaucer business and discontinued accident and health and former life insurance businesses. In 2018, discontinued operations, in total, generated a gain of $152.0 million, net of tax, primarily related to the sale of the Chaucer business. In 2017, discontinued operations, in total, generated a loss of $29.9 million, net of tax, primarily related to the long-term care pool in our discontinued accident and health business and, to a lesser extent, the Chaucer business. In 2016, discontinued operations contributed $88.1 million of income, primarily related to the Chaucer business. See also Discontinued Operations - Chaucer Business\u201d below and Note 2 - Dispositions of businesses\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nDISCONTINUED OPERATIONS - CHAUCER BUSINESS\nAs discussed above, the Chaucer business includes both the gain related to the sale and the income or loss from Chaucer's then current operations.\nGain on Sale of Chaucer Business\nOn December 28, 2018, we completed the sale of Chaucer Holdings Limited to China Re. Total consideration payable by China Re for this portion of the transaction is expected to total approximately $793.7 million(1) and is subject to adjustment based upon 2018 accident year catastrophe losses in excess of 10% of Chaucer's 2018 net earned premium. The pre-tax gain on the sale is estimated to be $174.4 million. THG paid customary transaction costs along with providing certain representations and warranties and agreeing to indemnify China Re for certain pre-sale contingent liabilities.\nThe following table summarizes the components of the estimated gain related to the sale of the Chaucer business as of December 28, 2018. This gain below excludes an expected gain on the Irish and Australian entities associated with the Chaucer business. We subsequently completed the sale of our Chaucer-related Irish entity on February 14, 2019. The sale of the Australian entities is pending, subject only to local regulatory approval. We received $28 million of additional consideration for the Irish entity, and we expect to receive $13 million of additional consideration related to the Australian entities.\nTable 104: <table> <tr> <td> FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Initial consideration received from sale (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 779.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Adjustment (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (17.0\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Contingent proceeds (1)(2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 31.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total cash proceeds expected from sale of Chaucer Holdings Limited (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 793.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Less:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Carrying value of Chaucer business (3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 530.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Transaction and other sale-related costs (4)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 30.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net realized losses on securities, pension and currency translation obligations related to Chaucer business (5)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 58.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total pre-tax reductions\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 619.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Pre-tax gain on sale\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 174.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income tax expense (6)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 42.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gain on sale\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 131.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 105: <table> <tr> <td> (1)\n</td> <td> Initial consideration for Chaucer Holdings Limited as determined in the sales and purchase agreement was $779 million.

2017, a decrease of $3.0 million, or 0.4%. This was primarily due to a planned increase in the use of ceded reinsurance, as a result of current market conditions, partially offset by new business growth in the casualty line.\nChaucer's income before income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $24.7 million, compared to $8.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, an improvement of $16.1 million. This increase is primarily due to lower catastrophe losses. Catastrophe losses for the year ended December 31, 2018 were $85.8 million, compared to $131.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, a decrease of $45.3 million. Chaucer's income before taxes, excluding catastrophes, was $110.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to $139.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. This $29.2 million decline was primarily due to higher non-catastrophe current accident year large losses and higher expenses, primarily driven by higher brokerage costs due to a change in business mix.\n2017 Compared to 2016\nChaucer's net premiums earned were $853.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $838.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, an increase of $14.4 million, or 1.7%. This was primarily due to new business growth in the treaty, property and casualty lines, partially offset by a planned increase in the use of ceded reinsurance, as a result of current market conditions.\nChaucer's income before income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $8.6 million, compared to $126.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, a decline of $117.7 million. This decrease is primarily due to higher catastrophe losses. Catastrophe losses for the year ended December 31, 2017 were $131.1 million, compared to $8.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, an increase of $123.1 million. Chaucer's income before taxes, excluding catastrophes, was $139.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $134.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. This $5.4 million increase was primarily due to lower non-catastrophe current accident year losses and higher net investment income, partially offset by lower favorable prior years' reserve development.\nCatastrophe Loss Development\nIn 2018, the favorable catastrophe development ratio was 2.0% primarily driven by lower than expected losses related to hurricane Harvey. In 2017, the favorable catastrophe development ratio was 2.8% primarily due to lower than expected property losses in the treaty line. In 2016, the favorable catastrophe development ratio was 4.5% primarily due to lower than expected property losses in the treaty line and, to a lesser extent, in the property line.\nLoss and LAE Development, excluding catastrophes\nIn 2018, the favorable loss and LAE development ratio was 4.3%, excluding catastrophes, primarily due to lower than expected losses in the political, energy, marine, and treaty lines, partially offset by higher than expected losses in the casualty lines. In 2017, the favorable loss and LAE development ratio was 4.0%, excluding catastrophes, primarily as a result of lower than expected losses in the energy and political lines, partially offset by higher than expected losses in the treaty line, primarily a result of higher than expected losses in Chaucer's U.S. casualty business. In 2016, the favorable loss and LAE development ratio was 11.4%, excluding catastrophes, primarily due to lower than expected losses in the energy, casualty, political, and treaty lines. Partially offsetting the 2016 favorable loss and LAE development was the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange rate movements on prior years' loss reserves.\nInvestment Portfolio\nChaucer held cash and investment assets diversified across several asset classes, as follows:\nTable 113: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (dollars in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Carrying\nValue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % of Total\nCarrying Value\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Carrying\nValue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> % of Total\nCarrying Value\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Fixed maturities, at fair value\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 24.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 88.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,030.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 91.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other investments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 123.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 78.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total cash and investments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 27.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 100.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,232.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 100.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCash and Investments\nTotal cash and investments decreased $2.2 billion, or 98.8%, for the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily due to the sale of the U.K. subsidiaries, which included cash and investments of approximately $2.0 billion. Also, prior to the sale, Chaucer's investment assets were reduced by a pre-signing dividend of $85.0 million from Chaucer to THG and an approximate $65 million repayment of intercompany debt. Assets remaining at December 31, 2018 relate to the Chaucer-related Irish and Australian subsidiaries which, as discussed elsewhere, have been or are expected to be sold in the first quarter of 2019.\nInvestment Results\nNet investment income increased $2.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 and $6.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the prior years. The increase in 2018 was primarily due to the impact of higher new money yields and higher income on certain reinsurance contracts subject to deposit accounting, partially offset by lower average invested assets. The increase in 2017 compared to 2016 also reflects higher income on certain reinsurance contracts subject to deposit accounting, as well as the impact of higher operational cashflows.\nEarned yields on the investment portfolio were 2.21%, 2.03% and 1.97% for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively.\nLetter of Credit\nPrior to the sale of Chaucer, we had a Standby Letter of Credit Facility Agreement (the Facility Agreement\u201d) which was not to exceed \u00a3220.0 million outstanding at any one time, and included an option to increase the amount available for issuances of letters of credit to \u00a3300.0 million. The Facility Agreement provided regulatory capital supporting Chaucer's underwriting activities for the 2018 and 2019 years of account and each prior open year of account. Supporting the Facility Agreement, we had entered into a Guaranty Agreement (the Guaranty Agreement\u201d) with Lloyds Bank plc, as Facility Agent and Security Agent, pursuant to which we unconditionally guaranteed the obligations of Chaucer under the Facility Agreement. On December 28, 2018, in connection with the completion of the Chaucer sale, this Facility Agreement and the related Guaranty Agreement were terminated.\nForeign Exchange\nMost of Chaucer's transactions are denominated in the currencies that we use to settle transactions with Lloyd's, specifically the U.S. Dollar, the U.K. Pound Sterling ( GBP\u201d) and the Canadian Dollar. These are Chaucer's functional currencies under U.S. GAAP. A portion of Chaucer's transactions and its assets and liabilities are denominated in other currencies, such as the Euro, the Swiss Franc, the Australian Dollar, and the Japanese Yen. Changes in the value of these currencies versus the functional currencies, particularly versus the GBP, cause transactional gains and losses during each reporting period. During 2018 and 2017, the GBP was relatively stable against most currencies. In contrast, the GPB weakened meaningfully against most currencies in 2016. We believe that this was due, in large part, to the effect of the U.K's referendum vote to discontinue its membership in the European Union ( Brexit Referendum\u201d). The following table summarizes the total effect of Chaucer's foreign exchange transactional gains and losses on comprehensive income:\nTable 114: <table> <tr> <td> YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> in millions\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Effect of revaluing loss and LAE reserves\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 0.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (2.7\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (36.9\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Effect of revaluing overseas deposits and cash\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2.1\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (0.8\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Effect of revaluing premium receivables\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total FX effect on operating income before interest expense\nand income taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (0.7\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (3.1\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (22.0\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> FX gains (losses) reflected in net realized investment gains (losses)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (0.7\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total FX effect on income before income taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (0.3\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1.4\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (22.7\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Unrealized FX gains from investment securities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total pre-tax effect of transactional FX gains (losses)\non comprehensive income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (0.8\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (14.4\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income tax benefit\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total effect of transactional FX gains (losses)\non comprehensive income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 0.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (0.5\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (9.4\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDuring 2018, foreign exchange losses, on a net basis, reduced pre-tax income by approximately $0.3 million, compared to approximately $1.4 million in 2017 and $22.7 million in 2016. For 2018, this impact primarily resulted from the revaluation of investments in overseas deposits. For 2017 and 2016, this impact primarily resulted from the revaluation of loss and LAE reserves. In addition, during 2018, pre-tax unrealized foreign exchange gains from investment securities were approximately $0.5 million, which was reflected as an increase to accumulated other comprehensive income, compared to $0.6 million in 2017 and $8.3 million in 2016.\nINCOME TAXES\nWe are subject to the tax laws and regulations of the U.S. and foreign countries in which we operate. We file a consolidated U.S. federal income tax return that includes our holding company and its U.S. subsidiaries. Generally, taxes are accrued at the U.S. statutory tax rate for income from the U.S. operations. In December 2017, the U.S. statutory rate decreased from 35% to 21%, effective January 1, 2018. Our primary non-U.S. jurisdiction was the U.K., until the sale of our U.K. subsidiaries, largely completed December 28, 2018. The U.K. statutory tax rate ranged between 20% and 19% during the period 2016 through 2018. We accrue taxes on certain non-U.S. income that is subject to U.S. tax at the enacted U.S. tax rate. Foreign tax credits, where available, are utilized to offset U.S. tax as permitted.\nThe provision for income taxes from continuing operations was an expense of $43.5 million, $76.8 million, and a benefit of $1.0 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. These amounts resulted in consolidated effective tax rates of 15.4% and 26.2% on pre-tax income for 2018 and 2017, respectively, and a benefit of 1.5% on pre-tax income for 2016. The provision for 2018 reflects a tax benefit related to prior years of $4.3 million, primarily due to a $40.0 million contribution to our U.S. pension plan made in September 2018 and reflected as a deduction in our 2017 U.S. income tax return at the then higher statutory tax rate. The provision for the 2017 tax year further reflects a tax benefit of $3.9 million related to the revaluation of our net deferred tax liabilities as a result of the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act ( TCJA\u201d,\u201dU.S. Tax Reform\u201d or the Act\u201d). See the discussion of the new tax law, U.S. Tax Reform\u201d, below. The provisions in 2018 and 2017 also included excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation of $2.3 million and $5.3 million, respectively. The adoption of ASC Update No. 2016-09 on January 1, 2017 required the inclusion of excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation in the income statement, whereas prior to the adoption, these excess tax benefits were recognized in additional paid-in capital. Lastly, the provisions in 2018, 2017, and 2016 reflect benefits related to tax planning strategies implemented in prior years of $9.2 million, $12.7 million, and $20.7 million, respectively. Absent these items, the provision for income taxes for 2018, 2017, and 2016 would have been expenses of $59.3 million, or 21.0%, $98.7 million, or 33.7%, and $19.7 million, or 29.8%, respectively. The lower effective tax rate in 2018 is primarily due to the aforementioned decrease in the U.S. statutory rate and the lower effective tax rate in 2016 is primarily due to lower underwriting income.\nThe income tax provision on operating income was an expense of $69.3 million, $89.5 million and $46.3 million for 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. These provisions resulted in effective tax rates for operating income of 19.2%, 31.7% and 32.7% in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The provisions for 2018 and 2017 reflect the aforementioned excess tax benefit related to stock-based compensation of $2.3 million and $5.3 million, respectively. In addition, the 2018 provision included the aforementioned tax benefit related to prior years of $4.3 million. Absent these items, the provision for income taxes for 2018 and 2017 would have been expense of $75.9 million, or 21.0% and $94.8 million, or 33.6%.\nThe income tax provision on the Chaucer business was an expense of $4.7 million, $21.7 million and $37.2 million for 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The provision for 2017 reflects a one-time expense of $26.2 million related to the enactment of the TCJA. This expense included a revaluation of our net deferred tax assets and the recognition of federal income tax on previously untaxed earnings from foreign operations of $13.5 million and $12.7 million, respectively. Absent these items, the provision for income tax for 2017 would have been a benefit of $4.5 million.\nThe income tax provision on the gain from the disposal of Chaucer business was an expense of $42.5 million. This provision includes a write off of $8.0 million of deferred tax assets primarily attributable to Lloyd's underwriting losses.\nDuring 2017, we recorded an increase to our uncertain tax positions of $0.9 million related to the recognition of federal income taxes on previously untaxed earnings from foreign operations. This amount is partially offset by a decrease in our uncertain tax positions of $0.6 million due to the expiration of a statute of limitation, for a net change of $0.3 million. We are subject to U.S. federal and state examinations and foreign examinations for years after 2014. There are no ongoing audits on our open tax years.\nIn prior years, we completed several transactions which resulted in the realization, for tax purposes only, of unrealized gains in our investment portfolio. As a result of these transactions, we were able to realize capital losses carried forward and release the valuation allowance recorded against the deferred tax asset related to those losses. The releases of valuation allowances were recorded as a benefit in accumulated other comprehensive income. Previously unrealized benefits of $9.2 million, $12.7 million and $20.7 million attributable to non-operating income, are recognized as part of our income from continuing operations during 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The remaining amount of $35.6 million in accumulated other comprehensive income will be released into income from continuing operations in future years, as the investment securities subject to these transactions are sold or mature.\nU.S. TAX REFORM\nOn December 22, 2017, the TCJA was enacted in the U.S. The Act substantially changed many aspects of the U.S. Tax code, including reducing the U.S. corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%. While the new corporate rate is effective on January 1, 2018, we have recognized the impact of the rate change on our deferred tax balances as of the enactment date. The effect of this re-measurement of our deferred tax balances is a provision of $9.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. This provision is recorded as a component of income tax expense in continuing operations and within discontinued operations as a component of income from Chaucer business. A tax benefit of $4.1 million was recognized in continuing operations and an expense of $13.5 million was recognized in discontinued operations. This amount includes the revaluation of deferred taxes initially recorded through other comprehensive income and recorded through discontinued operations, such as unrealized appreciation on investments, employee benefit plan-related items, foreign currency translation adjustments and reserve adjustments for discontinued business. Deferred taxes related to the revaluation of our pension plans at December 31, 2017, as well as changes in unrealized gains and losses occurring after the Act's enactment date, are recorded at 21% in other comprehensive income.\nThe Act also created a territorial tax system, which will generally allow companies to repatriate future non-U.S. sourced earnings without incurring additional U.S. taxes, by providing a 100% exemption on dividends received from certain non-U.S. subsidiaries. Although most of our non-U.S. income had been previously subject to U.S. taxes, a portion of our non-U.S. income had been\nindefinitely reinvested overseas and was not subject to U.S. tax until repatriated. These non-U.S. earnings are now subject to a one-time mandatory toll charge totaling $12.7 million, which is recorded within discontinued operations as a component of income tax expense related to the Chaucer business for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nIn addition, the Act limited various existing deductions such as executive compensation and introduced new income taxes on certain low-taxed non-U.S. income. Under the Act, the exemption from the $1 million limitation on certain executive compensation has been eliminated. As a result, we have recognized a provision of $0.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nThe cumulative effect of the enactment of TCJA is an expense of $22.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, comprising the aforementioned three components. Our estimates are not based upon provisional amounts, as defined in the SEC's Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\nThe discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon the consolidated financial statements. These statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP, which requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The following critical accounting estimates are those which we believe affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements. Additional information about other significant accounting policies and estimates may be found in Note 1- Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nRESERVE FOR LOSSES AND LOSS EXPENSES\nSee Reserve for Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses\u201d within Results of Operations - Segments\u201d for a discussion of our critical accounting estimates for loss reserves.\nREINSURANCE RECOVERABLE BALANCES\nSee Reinsurance Recoverables\u201d in Part I - Item 1 for information on our reinsurance recoverable balances.\nPENSION BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS\nWe currently have a U.S. qualified defined benefit plan and several smaller non-qualified benefit plans. Additionally, we held a defined benefit pension plan for our international subsidiary, Chaucer, until its sale on December 28, 2018. Accordingly, this discussion focuses on our domestic plans only. In order to measure the liabilities and expense associated with these plans, we must make various estimates and key assumptions, including discount rates used to value liabilities, assumed rates of return on plan assets, employee turnover rates and anticipated mortality rates. These estimates and assumptions are reviewed at least annually and are based on our historical experience, as well as current facts and circumstances. In addition, we use outside actuaries to assist in measuring the expenses and liabilities associated with our defined benefit pension plan.\nTwo significant assumptions used in the determination of benefit plan obligations and expenses that are dependent on market factors, which have been subject to a greater level of volatility in recent years, are the discount rate and the return on plan asset assumptions. The discount rate enables us to state expected future benefit payments as a present value on the measurement date. We also use this discount rate in the determination of our pre-tax pension expense or benefit. A lower discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations and increases pension expense. We determined our discount rate for the domestic plan utilizing independent yield curves which provide for a portfolio of high quality bonds that are expected to match the cash flows of our pension plans. Bond information used in the yield curve included only those rated Aa or better as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, and had been rated by at least two well-known rating agencies. The following provides the discount rates for our qualified pension plan.\nTable 115: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> U.S. Qualified\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Discount Rate Assumptions:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Plan\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4.50\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3.875\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTo determine the expected long-term return on plan assets, we generally consider historical mean returns by asset class for passive indexed strategies, as well as current and expected asset allocations, and adjust for certain factors that we believe will have an impact on future returns. Actual returns on plan assets in any given year seldom result in the achievement of the expected rate of return on assets. Actual returns on plan assets in excess of these expected returns will generally reduce our net actuarial losses (or increase actuarial gains) that are reflected in the accumulated other comprehensive income balance in shareholders' equity, whereas actual returns on plan assets that are less than expected returns will generally increase our net actuarial losses (or decrease actuarial gains) that are reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income. These gains or losses are amortized into expense in future years. The U.S. qualified plan held assets consisting of approximately 85% fixed maturities and 15% equities at December 31, 2018.\nThe expected return on asset assumption was 4.75% and 5.00% in 2018 and 2017, respectively. Asset returns are reflected net of administrative expenses.\nNet actuarial losses related to the domestic qualified plan of $19.9 million and gains of $11.4 million were reflected as changes to accumulated other comprehensive income in 2018 and 2017, respectively. Net actuarial losses in 2018 resulted primarily from investment losses experienced during the year, partially offset by increases in the discount rate. Net actuarial gains in 2017 resulted primarily from benefits from investment gains experienced during the year, partially offset by decreases in the discount rate. The change in these actuarial gains and losses is amortized into earnings in future periods. In 2018 and 2017, amortization of actuarial losses from prior years was $8.6 million and $12.5 million, respectively.\nExpenses related to our defined benefit plan are generally calculated based upon information available at the beginning of the plan year. Our pre-tax expense related to our domestic qualified defined benefit plan was $6.5 million and $11.4 million for 2018 and 2017, respectively. As a result of the significant decline of our actual investment experience in 2018, which was only partially offset by an increase in the discount rate, our pension expense related to our domestic qualified defined benefit plan is expected to increase from $6.5 million in 2018 to $7.6 million in 2019.\nHolding all other assumptions constant, sensitivity to changes in our key assumptions related to our qualified defined pension plan is as follows:\nTable 116: <table> <tr> <td> (in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Discount Rate -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 25 basis point increase\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Change in Benefit Obligation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (9.2\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Change in 2018 Expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1.0\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 25 basis point decrease\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Change in Benefit Obligation\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Change in 2018 Expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Expected Return on Plan Assets -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 25 basis point increase\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Change in 2018 Expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1.1\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> 25 basis point decrease\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Change in 2018 Expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENTS\nWe employ a systematic methodology to evaluate declines in fair values below amortized cost for all fixed maturity investments. The methodology utilizes a quantitative and qualitative process that seeks to ensure that available evidence concerning the declines in fair value below amortized cost is evaluated in a disciplined manner. In determining whether a decline in fair value below amortized cost is other-than-temporary, we evaluate several factors and circumstances, including the issuer's overall financial condition; the issuer's credit and financial strength ratings; the issuer's financial performance, including earnings trends, dividend payments and asset quality; any specific events which may influence the operations of the issuer; the general outlook for market conditions in the industry or geographic region in which the issuer operates; and the length of time and the degree to which the fair value of an issuer's securities remains below our cost. We consider factors that might raise doubt about the issuer's ability to make contractual payments as they become due and whether we expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security.\nWe monitor corporate fixed maturity securities with unrealized losses on a quarterly basis and more frequently when necessary to identify potential credit deterioration, as evidenced by ratings downgrades, unexpected price variances, and/or company or industry specific concerns. We apply consistent standards of credit analysis which includes determining whether the issuer is current on its contractual payments, and we consider past events, current conditions and reasonable forecasts to evaluate whether we expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security. We utilize valuation declines as a potential indicator of credit deterioration and apply additional levels of scrutiny in our analysis as the severity of the decline increases or duration persists.\nFor our impairment review of asset-backed fixed maturity securities, we forecast our best estimate of the prospective future cash flows of the security to determine if we expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security. Our analysis includes estimates of underlying collateral default rates based on historical and projected delinquency rates and estimates of the amount and timing of potential recovery. We consider available information relevant to the collectability of cash flows, including information about the payment terms of the security, prepayment speeds, the financial condition of the underlying borrowers, collateral trustee reports, credit ratings analysis and other market data when developing our estimate of the expected cash flows.\nWhen an OTTI of a fixed maturity security occurs, and we intend to sell or more likely than not will be required to sell the investment before recovery of its amortized cost basis, the amortized cost of the security is reduced to its fair value, with a corresponding charge to earnings, which reduces net income and earnings per share. If we do not intend to sell the fixed maturity investment or more likely than not will not be required to sell it, we separate the OTTI into the amount we estimate represents the credit loss and the amount related to all other factors. The amount of the estimated loss attributable to credit is recognized in earnings, which reduces net income and earnings per share. The amount of the estimated OTTI that is non-credit related is recognized in other comprehensive income, net of applicable taxes.\nWe estimate the amount of the OTTI that relates to credit by comparing the amortized cost of the fixed maturity security with the net present value of the fixed maturity security's projected future cash flows, discounted at the effective interest rate implicit in the investment prior to impairment. The non-credit portion of the impairment is equal to the difference between the fair value and the net present value of the fixed maturity security at the impairment measurement date.\nTemporary declines in market value are recorded as unrealized losses, which do not affect net income and earnings per share, but reduce accumulated other comprehensive income, which is reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We cannot provide assurance that the OTTIs will be adequate to cover future losses or that we will not have substantial additional impairments in the future. See Investments\u201d for further discussion regarding OTTIs and securities in an unrealized loss position.\nDEFERRED TAX ASSETS\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities primarily result from temporary differences between the amounts recorded in our consolidated financial statements and the tax basis of our assets and liabilities and loss and tax credit carryforwards. These temporary differences are measured at the balance sheet date using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years the temporary differences are expected to reverse.\nThe realization of deferred tax assets depends upon the existence of sufficient taxable income within the carryback or carryforward periods under the tax law in the applicable tax jurisdiction. Consideration is given to available positive and negative evidence, including reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income in each tax jurisdiction, tax planning strategies and recent financial operations. Valuation allowances are established if, based on the weight of available information, it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The determination of the valuation allowance for our deferred tax assets requires management to make certain judgments and assumptions. Our judgments and assumptions are subject to change given the inherent uncertainty in predicting future performance and specific industry and investment market conditions. Changes in valuation allowances are generally reflected in income tax expense or as an adjustment to other comprehensive income depending on the nature of the item for which the valuation allowance is being recorded.\nThe following are the components of our deferred tax assets and liabilities as of December 31, 2018.\nTable 117: <table> <tr> <td> DEFERRED TAX ASSETS (LIABILITIES)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Amount\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loss, LAE and unearned premium reserves, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 129.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Deferred acquisition costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (95.0\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Employee benefit plan\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 14.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Investments, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Software capitalization\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (18.3\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 15.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 50.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Less: Valuation allowance\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 0.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 50.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had $0.2 million of valuation allowance related to our employee benefit plan.

RBC ratios for regulatory purposes, as described in the glossary, are expressed as a percentage of the capital required to be above the Authorized Control Level (the Regulatory Scale\u201d); however, in the insurance industry, RBC ratios are widely expressed as a percentage of the Company Action Level. The following table reflects the Company Action Level, the Authorized Control Level and RBC ratios for Hanover Insurance (which includes Citizens and other insurance subsidiaries), as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, expressed both on the Industry Scale (Total Adjusted Capital divided by the Company Action Level) and Regulatory Scale (Total Adjusted Capital divided by Authorized Control Level):\nTable 119: <table> <tr> <td> (dollars in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> DECEMBER 31, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Company\nAction\nLevel\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Authorized\nControl\nLevel\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> RBC Ratio\nIndustry\nScale\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> RBC Ratio\nRegulatory\nScale\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> The Hanover Insurance Company\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,036.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 518.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> DECEMBER 31, 2017\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> The Hanover Insurance Company\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,001.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 500.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nLiquidity is a measure of our ability to generate sufficient cash flows to meet the cash requirements of business operations. As a holding company, our primary ongoing source of cash is dividends from our insurance subsidiaries. However, dividend payments to us by our insurance subsidiaries are subject to limitations imposed by regulators, such as prior notice periods and the requirement that dividends in excess of a specified percentage of statutory surplus or prior year's statutory earnings receive prior approval (so called extraordinary dividends\u201d). Hanover Insurance paid $140.0 million in dividends to the holding company during 2018. In 2017, Hanover Insurance paid $296.8 million in dividends to the holding company, which included $80.0 million of extraordinary dividends. In 2016, a $218.8 million ordinary dividend was paid by Hanover Insurance.\nDividend payments previously made to the holding company by Chaucer were regulated by U.K. law. Chaucer paid dividends of $85.0 million and $79.5 million to the holding company in 2018 and 2016, respectively, and did not pay any dividend in 2017. Additionally, in connection with an intercompany borrowing arrangement between Chaucer and a wholly-owned non-insurance subsidiary of the holding company, interest on a $300 million note was paid by Chaucer on a quarterly basis to this affiliate, which is ultimately available to provide dividends to the holding company. During 2018 and 2017, Chaucer made payments of $22.5 million and $20.7 million, respectively, related to this agreement of which $22.1 million and $20.2 million, respectively, were then dividended to the holding company. In 2016, Chaucer made a payment of $22.4 million directly to the holding company. This agreement was terminated as part of the sale of Chaucer.\nSources of cash for our insurance subsidiaries primarily consist of premiums collected, investment income and maturing investments. Primary cash outflows are paid claims, losses and loss adjustment expenses, policy and contract acquisition expenses, other underwriting expenses, and investment purchases. Cash outflows related to losses and loss adjustment expenses can be variable because of uncertainties surrounding settlement dates for liabilities for unpaid losses and because of the potential for large losses either individually or in the aggregate. We periodically adjust our investment policy to respond to changes in short-term and long-term cash requirements.\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $551.3 million during 2018, as compared to $704.6 million during 2017 and $743.4 million in 2016. During 2018, the $153.3 million decrease in cash provided was primarily the result of higher loss payments, the contribution made to the qualified defined benefit plan and taxes paid, partially offset by an increase in premiums collected. During 2017, the $38.8 million decrease in cash provided was primarily the result of higher loss payments and taxes paid to foreign jurisdictions, partially offset by an increase in premiums collected.\nNet cash provided by investing activities was $271.3 million during 2018, as compared to net cash used of $506.3 million during 2017 and $495.4 million in 2016. During 2018, cash provided by investing activities primarily related to net proceeds received from the sale of Chaucer. These proceeds were partially offset by net purchases of fixed maturities, commercial mortgage loan participations, and other investments. During 2017, cash used in investing activities primarily related to net purchases of fixed maturities, commercial mortgage loan participations, and other investments. During 2016, cash used in investing activities primarily related to net purchases of fixed maturities, commercial mortgage loan participations, and other investments. These cash outflows were partially offset by proceeds from net sales of equity securities.\nNet cash used in financing activities was $171.0 million during 2018, as compared to $111.7 million during 2017 and $300.8 million in 2016. During 2018, cash used in financing activities primarily resulted from the payment of dividends to shareholders and repurchases of common stock. During 2017, cash used in financing activities primarily resulted from the payment of dividends to shareholders and repurchases of common stock, partially offset by cash inflows related to option exercises. During 2016, cash used in financing activities primarily resulted from the repayment of debt, repurchases of common stock, and payment of dividends to shareholders. These cash outflows were partially offset by cash inflows related to the issuance of $375 million of senior unsecured debentures.\nDividends to common shareholders are subject to quarterly board approval and declaration. During 2018, as declared by the Board, dividends totaled $288.0 million. This included three quarterly dividends of $0.54 per share and one quarterly dividend of $0.60 per share to our shareholders, as well as a special dividend declared on December 30, 2018 of $4.75 per share. We believe that our holding company assets are sufficient to provide for future shareholder dividends, should the Board of Directors declare them.\nAt December 31, 2018, THG, as a holding company, held approximately $1.2 billion of fixed maturities and cash. This amount includes deployable capital primarily generated through the sale of Chaucer which provided approximately $779 million of proceeds to the holding company upon closing the sale of the U.K. subsidiaries in December 2018. On January 2, 2019, we paid cash of $250.0 million as part of an accelerated share repurchase ( ASR\u201d) agreement (described below). Additionally, in January 2019, we paid the aforementioned special dividend of $4.75 per share with total cash payments of approximately $193 million. We believe our holding company assets will be sufficient to meet other 2019 obligations, which consist primarily of quarterly dividends to our shareholders (as and to the extent declared), interest on our senior and subordinated debentures, certain costs associated with benefits due to our former life employees and agents, and, to the extent required, payments related to indemnification of liabilities associated with the sale of various subsidiaries. As discussed below, we have, and opportunistically may continue to, repurchase our common stock and debt. We do not expect that it will be necessary to dividend additional funds from our insurance subsidiaries in order to fund 2019 holding company obligations; however, we may decide to do so.\nWe expect to continue to generate sufficient positive operating cash to meet all short-term and long-term cash requirements relating to current operations, including the funding of our qualified defined benefit pension plan. Based upon the current estimate of liabilities and certain assumptions regarding investment returns and other factors, our qualified defined benefit pension plan has plan liabilities in excess of plan assets of approximately $19 million. The ultimate payment amounts for our benefit plan is based on several assumptions, including but not limited to, the rate of return on plan assets, the discount rate for benefit obligations, mortality experience, interest crediting rates, inflation and the ultimate valuation and determination of benefit obligations. Since differences between actual plan experience and our assumptions are almost certain, changes, both positive and negative, to our current funding status and ultimately our obligations in future periods are likely.\nOur insurance subsidiaries maintain a high degree of liquidity within their respective investment portfolios in fixed maturity and short-term investments. We believe that the quality of the assets we hold will allow us to realize the long-term economic value of our portfolio, including securities that are currently in an unrealized loss position. We do not anticipate the need to sell these securities to meet our insurance subsidiaries' cash requirements since we expect our insurance subsidiaries to generate sufficient operating cash to meet all short-term and long-term cash requirements relating to current operations. However, there can be no assurance that unforeseen business needs or other items will not occur causing us to have to sell those securities in a loss position before their values fully recover, thereby causing us to recognize impairment charges in that time period.\nOn December 30, 2018, the Board of Directors authorized a new stock repurchase program which provides for aggregate repurchases of our common stock of up to $600 million. Under the repurchase authorization, the Company may repurchase, from time to time, common shares in amounts, at prices and at such times as the Company deems appropriate, subject to market conditions and other considerations. Repurchases may be executed using open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions, accelerated repurchase programs or other transactions. We are not required to purchase any specific number of shares or to make purchases by any certain date under this program. On January 2, 2019, pursuant to the terms of an ASR agreement, we paid $250.0 million and received an initial delivery of approximately 1.8 million shares of our common stock, which is approximately 80% of the total number of shares expected to be repurchased under this agreement. Additionally, under the prior repurchase program, during 2018, we repurchased 0.5 million shares at a cost of $57.7 million.\nFrom time to time, we may repurchase our debt on an opportunistic basis. During the third quarter of 2018, we repurchased subordinated debentures with a net carrying value of $9.6 million at a cost of $11.5 million, resulting in a loss of $1.9 million.\nAdditionally, on January 2, 2019, we repaid $125 million of our FHLB advances due 2029 with a coupon of 5.5%. In the fourth quarter of 2018, we recorded a non-operating charge of approximately $26.3 million for related pre-payment fees. Membership in the FHLB provides us with access to additional liquidity based on our stock holdings and pledged collateral. At December 31, 2018, we had additional borrowing capacity of $90.1 million. There were no borrowings outstanding under this short-term facility at December 31, 2018; however, we have borrowed and may continue to borrow, from time to time, through this facility to provide short-term liquidity.\nWe have a $200.0 million credit agreement which expires in May 2019. Borrowings, if any, under the agreement are unsecured and incur interest at a rate per annum equal to, the higher of (a) the prime commercial lending rate of the administrative agent, (b) the Federal Funds Rate plus half a percent, or (c) the one month Adjusted LIBOR plus one percent and any applicable margin. The agreement contains financial covenants including, but not limited to, maintaining at least specified levels of consolidated equity and leverage ratios, and requires certain of our subsidiaries to maintain minimum RBC ratios. We had no borrowings under this agreement during 2018.\nAt December 31, 2018, we were in compliance with the covenants of our debt and credit agreements.\nCONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS\nFinancing obligations generally include repayment of our senior debentures, subordinated debentures, borrowings from the FHLB, and operating lease payments. The following table represents our annual payments related to the contractual principal and interest payments of these financing obligations as of December 31, 2018, unless otherwise noted, and operating lease payments reflect expected cash payments based upon lease terms. In addition, we also have included our estimated payments related to our loss and LAE obligations and our current expectation of payments to be made to support the obligations of our benefit plans. The following table also includes commitments to purchase investment securities at a future date. Actual payments may differ from the contractual and/or estimated payments in the table.\nTable 120: <table> <tr> <td> DECEMBER 31, 2018\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Maturity less\nthan 1 year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Maturity\n1-3 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Maturity\n4-5 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Maturity in\nexcess of\n5 years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Debt (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 125.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 662.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 787.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest associated with debt (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 36.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 73.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 73.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 390.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 575.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating lease commitments (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 13.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 19.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 8.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 41.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Defined benefit pension and post-retirement benefit\nobligation (3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 11.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Investment commitments (4)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 56.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 69.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 16.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 143.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loss and LAE obligations (5)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,656.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,586.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 659.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,402.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,304.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 121: <table> <tr> <td> (1)\n</td> <td> Debt included in the maturity less than 1 year category reflects our advances from the FHLB that were repaid on January 2, 2019.

Information related to certain regulatory and industry developments are contained in Regulation\u201d in Part 1 - Item 1 and in Risk Factors\u201d in Part 1 - Item 1A.\nRATING AGENCIES\nInsurance companies are rated by rating agencies to provide both industry participants and insurance consumers information on specific insurance companies. Higher ratings generally indicate the rating agencies' opinion regarding financial stability and a stronger ability to pay claims.\nWe believe that strong ratings are important factors in marketing our products to our agents and customers, since rating information is broadly disseminated and generally used throughout the industry. Insurance company financial strength ratings are assigned to an insurer based upon factors deemed by the rating agencies to be relevant to policyholders and are not directed toward protection of investors. Such ratings are neither a rating of securities nor a recommendation to buy, hold or sell any security. Customers typically focus on claims-paying ratings, while creditors focus on debt ratings. Investors use both to evaluate a company's overall financial strength.\nRISKS AND FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis contains forward-looking statements\u201d within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. For a discussion of indicators of forward-looking statements and specific important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in forward-looking statements, see Risk Factors\u201d in Part 1 - Item 1A. This Management's Discussion and Analysis should be read and interpreted in light of such factors.\nGLOSSARY OF SELECTED INSURANCE TERMS\nAccount business - Customers with multiple policies and/or coverages.\nAccount rounding - The conversion of single policy customers to accounts with multiple policies and/or additional coverages.\nBenefit payments - Payments made to an insured or their beneficiary in accordance with the terms of an insurance policy.\nCasualty insurance - Insurance that is primarily concerned with the losses caused by injuries to third persons and their property (other than the policyholder) and the related legal liability of the insured for such losses.\nCatastrophe - A severe loss, resulting from natural or manmade events, including, among others, hurricanes, tornadoes and other windstorms, earthquakes, hail, severe winter weather, fire, explosions, and terrorism.\nCatastrophe loss - Loss and directly identified loss adjustment expenses from catastrophes, including development on prior years' catastrophe loss reserves. The Insurance Services Office ( ISO\u201d) Property Claim Services ( PCS\u201d) defines a catastrophe loss as an event that causes $25 million or more in insured property losses from U.S. direct writers and affects a significant number of property and casualty policyholders and insurers. In limited instances where the impact of an event extends across multiple geographic areas or time periods, but is not within the specific parameters established by PCS, the Company may determine that certain losses are better included within the same catastrophe event. In addition to those catastrophe events declared by ISO, claims management also generally includes within the definition of a catastrophe loss\u201d, a property loss event that causes approximately $5 million or more in Company insured losses and affects in excess of one hundred policy holders.\nCede; cedent; ceding company - When a party reinsures its liability with another party, it cedes\u201d business and is referred to as the cedent\u201d or ceding company\u201d.\nCredit spread - The difference between the yield on the debt securities of a particular corporate debt issue and the yield of a similar maturity of U.S. Treasury debt securities.\nCurrent accident year results - A non-GAAP measure of the estimated earnings impact of current premiums offset by estimated loss experience and expenses for the current accident year. This measure includes the estimated increase in revenue associated with higher prices (premiums), including those caused by price inflation and changes in exposure, partially offset by higher volume driven expenses and inflation of loss costs. Volume driven expenses include acquisition costs such as commissions paid to agents, which are typically based on a percentage of premium dollars.\nEarned premium - The portion of a premium that is recognized as income, or earned, based on the expired portion of the policy period, that is, the period for which loss coverage has actually been provided. For example, after six months, $50 of a $100 annual premium is generally considered earned premium. The remaining $50 of annual premium is unearned premium. Net earned premium is earned premium net of reinsurance.\nExcess of loss reinsurance - Reinsurance that indemnifies the insured against all or a specific portion of losses under reinsured policies in excess of a specified dollar amount or retention\u201d.\nExposure - As it relates to underwriting, a measure of the rating units or premium basis of a risk; for example, an exposure of a number of automobiles. As it relates to loss events, the maximum value of claims made on an insurer from an event or events that would result in the total exhaustion of the cover or indemnity offered by an insurance policy.\nExposure management actions - Actions that focus on improving underwriting profitability and/or lessening earnings volatility by reducing our exposures and property concentrations in certain geographies and lines that are believed to be more prone to catastrophe and non-catastrophe losses. These actions include, but are not limited to, non-renewal, rate increases, stricter underwriting standards and higher deductible utilization, agency management actions, and more selective portfolio management by modifying our business mix.\nFrequency - The number of claims occurring during a given coverage period.\nInland Marine Insurance - In Commercial Lines, this is a type of coverage developed for insuring businesses against physical losses to property such as contractor's equipment, builder's risk and goods in transit that do not involve ocean transport. It covers articles in transit by all forms of land and air transportation as well as bridges, tunnels and other means of transportation and communication. In the context of Personal Lines, this term relates to floater policies that cover expensive personal items such as fine art and jewelry.\nLoss adjustment expenses ( LAE\u201d) - Expenses incurred in the adjusting, recording, and settlement of claims. These expenses include both internal company expenses and outside services. Allocated LAE ( ALAE\u201d) refers to defense and cost containment expenses, including legal fees, court costs, and investigation fees. Unallocated LAE ( ULAE\u201d) refers to expenses that generally cannot be associated with a specific claim. ULAE includes internal costs such as salaries, fringe benefits and other overhead costs associated with the claim settlement process and external adjustment and appraisal fees.\nLoss costs - An amount of money paid for an insurance claim.\nLoss reserves - Liabilities established by insurers to reflect the estimated cost of claims payments and the related expenses that the insurer will ultimately be required to pay in respect of insurance it has written. Reserves are established for losses and for LAE.\nMorbidity - Morbidity relates to the occurrence of illness, disability or other physical or psychological impairment, whether temporary or permanent, for insured risks. Morbidity is a key assumption for long-term care insurance and other forms of individual and group health benefits.\nPeril - A cause of loss.\nPrice(ing) increase or decrease (Commercial Lines) - Represents the average change in premium on renewed policies caused by the estimated net effect of base rate changes, discretionary pricing, inflation or changes in policy level exposure or insured risk.\nPrice(ing) increase or decrease (Personal Lines) - The estimated cumulative premium effect of approved rate actions applied to policies available for renewal, regardless of whether or not policies are actually renewed. Pricing changes do not represent actual increases or decreases realized by the Company.\nProperty insurance - Insurance that provides coverage for tangible property in the event of loss, damage or loss of use.\nRate - The estimated pure pricing factor upon which the policyholder's premium is based excluding changes in exposure or risk.\nRatios: (1)\nCatastrophe loss ratio -The ratio of catastrophe losses incurred to premiums earned.\nCombined ratio - This ratio is the GAAP equivalent of the statutory ratio that is widely used as a benchmark for determining an insurer's underwriting performance. A ratio below 100% generally indicates profitable underwriting prior to the consideration of investment income. A combined ratio over 100% generally indicates unprofitable underwriting prior to the consideration of investment income. The combined ratio is the sum of the loss and loss adjustment expense ratio and the expense ratio.\nExpense Ratio - The ratio of underwriting expenses (including the amortization of deferred acquisition costs), less premium installment fee income and premium charge offs, to premiums earned for a given period.\nLoss and Loss adjustment expense ( LAE\u201d) ratio - The ratio of loss and loss adjustment expenses to premiums earned for a given period. The LAE ratio includes catastrophe losses and prior year reserve development.\nLoss ratio - The ratio of losses (including catastrophe losses) to premiums earned for a given period.\nReinstatement premium - A pro-rata reinsurance premium that may be charged to us by our reinsurers. A reinstatement premium may be contractually required to be charged for restoring an amount of reinsurance coverage reduced as the result of a reinsurance loss payment that depletes or exhausts a reinsurance treaty or treaty layer. For example, in 2005, this premium was required to ensure that our property catastrophe occurrence treaty, which was exhausted by hurricane Katrina, was available again in the event of another large catastrophe loss in 2005. Reinsurance reinstatement premiums accrued by us are accounted for as a reduction in net premiums earned rather than as an expense\u201d. For certain reinsurance treaties, a ceding commission adjustment is recorded commensurate with a reinstatement premium accrual. A ceding commission is a fee paid by a reinsurance company to a direct writer to cover the costs of issuing the policy and is recorded as a contra-expense.\nReinsurance - An arrangement in which an insurance company, or a reinsurance company, known as the reinsurer, agrees to indemnify another insurance or reinsurance company, known as the ceding company, against all or a portion of the insurance or reinsurance risks underwritten by the ceding company under one or more policies. Reinsurance can provide a ceding company with several benefits, including a reduction in net liability on risks and catastrophe protection from large or multiple losses. Reinsurance does not legally discharge the primary insurer from its liability with respect to its obligations to the insured.\nRisk based capital ( RBC\u201d) - A method of measuring the minimum amount of capital appropriate for an insurance company to support its overall business operations in consideration of its size and risk profile. The RBC ratio for regulatory purposes is calculated as total adjusted capital divided by required risk based capital. Total adjusted capital for property and casualty companies is capital and surplus, adjusted for the non-tabular reserve discount applicable to our assumed discontinued accident and health insurance business. The Company Action Level is the first level at which regulatory involvement is specified based upon the level of capital.\nRegulators may take action for reasons other than triggering various RBC action levels. The various action levels are summarized as follows:\nTable 126: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> The Company Action Level, which equals 200% of the Authorized Control Level, requires a company to prepare and submit a RBC plan to the commissioner of the state of domicile. A RBC plan proposes actions which a company may take in order to bring statutory capital above the Company Action Level. After review, the commissioner will notify the company if the plan is satisfactory.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 127: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> The Regulatory Action Level, which equals 150% of the Authorized Control Level, requires the insurer to submit to the commissioner of the state of domicile an RBC plan, or if applicable, a revised RBC plan. After examination or analysis, the commissioner will issue an order specifying corrective actions to be taken.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 128: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> The Authorized Control Level authorizes the commissioner of the state of domicile to take whatever regulatory actions are considered necessary to protect the best interest of the policyholders and creditors of the insurer.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 129: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> The Mandatory Control Level, which equals 70% of the Authorized Control Level, authorizes the commissioner of the state of domicile to take actions necessary to place the company under regulatory control (i.e., rehabilitation or liquidation).\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nSecurity Lending - We engage our banking provider to lend securities from our investment portfolio to third parties. These lent securities are fully collateralized by cash. We monitor the fair value of the securities on a daily basis to assure that the collateral is maintained at a level of at least 102% of the fair value of the loaned securities. We record securities lending collateral as a cash equivalent, with an offsetting liability in expenses and taxes payable.\nSeverity - A monetary increase in the loss costs associated with the same or similar type of event or coverage.\nSpecialty Lines - A major component of our other commercial lines. There is no accepted industry definition of specialty lines\u201d, but for our purpose specialty lines consist of products such as inland and ocean marine, surety, specialty property, professional liability, management liability and various other program businesses. When discussing net premiums written and other financial measures of our specialty businesses, we may include non-specialty premiums that are written as part of the entire account.\nStatutory accounting practices - Recording transactions and preparing financial statements in accordance with the rules and procedures prescribed or permitted by insurance regulatory authorities including the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, which in general reflect a liquidating, rather than going concern, concept of accounting.\nUnderwriting - The process of selecting risks for insurance and determining in what amounts and on what terms the insurance company will accept risks.\nUnderwriting expenses - Expenses incurred in connection with the acquisition, pricing and administration of a policy or contract, and other insurance company expenses unrelated to claims handling or investments.\nUnearned premiums - The portion of a premium representing the unexpired amount of the contract term as of a certain date.\nWritten premium - The premium assessed for the entire coverage period of an insurance policy or contract without regard to how much of the premium has been earned. See also Earned premium\u201d above. Net premium written is written premium net of reinsurance.\n(1) Ratios may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies.", "summary": "- The Hanover Insurance Group, Inc. (NYSE: THG) today reported results for the year ended December 31, 2018.\n- Net income was $391.0 million in 2018, compared to $186.2 million in 2017, an increase of $204.8 million.\n- The year-over-year comparison of consolidated net income reflects a $131.9 million gain, net of taxes, on the sale of our Chaucer business.\n- Additionally, operating income before interest expense and income taxes increased $79.2 million, primarily due to lower catastrophe losses and higher net investment income.\n- Income increased from our discontinued operations, primarily Chaucer and, to a lesser extent, our discontinued life business, which incurred a 2017 reserve charge related to our participation in a long-term care pool.\n- The following table reflects operating income before

Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is intended to assist readers in understanding the consolidated results of operations and financial condition of The Hanover Insurance Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries ( THG\u201d). Consolidated results of operations and financial condition are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America ( U.S. GAAP\u201d). This discussion should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and related footnotes included elsewhere herein.\nResults of operations include the accounts of The Hanover Insurance Company ( Hanover Insurance\u201d) and Citizens Insurance Company of America ( Citizens\u201d), our principal property and casualty companies; and certain other insurance and non-insurance subsidiaries. Our results of operations also include the results of our discontinued operations, consisting primarily of our former Chaucer international business, Chaucer Holdings Limited ( Chaucer\u201d), a United Kingdom ( U.K.\u201d) domiciled specialist insurance underwriting group which operates through the Society and Corporation of Lloyd's ( Lloyd's\u201d), and the international insurance and non-insurance subsidiaries, which collectively constituted our former Chaucer segment. On December 28, 2018, we completed the sale of Chaucer Holdings Limited, the major portion of our Lloyd's international specialty business. As of December 31, 2018 and for all prior periods presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, operations from Chaucer and the related assets and liabilities are presented as discontinued operations. Results of operations also include the discontinued operations of our accident and health and former life insurance businesses.\nEXECUTIVE OVERVIEW\nBusiness operations consist of three operating segments: Commercial Lines, Personal Lines and Other.\nNet income was $391.0 million in 2018, compared to $186.2 million in 2017, an increase of $204.8 million, primarily due to the gain from the sale of our former Chaucer business and an increase in operating income.\nOperating income before interest expense and income taxes (a non-GAAP financial measure; see also Results of Operations - Consolidated - Non-GAAP Financial Measures\u201d) was $406.5 million in 2018 compared to $327.3 million in 2017, an increase of $79.2 million. This increase is primarily due to lower catastrophe losses, higher net investment income, a reduction in reinsurance reinstatement premiums, earned premium growth and lower expenses, partially offset by higher non-catastrophe current accident year losses. Pre-tax catastrophe losses were $219.2 million in 2018, compared to $251.5 million in 2017, a decrease of $32.3 million. Reinsurance reinstatement premium, net of ceding commissions, was a favorable change of $21.5 million. Net unfavorable development on prior years' loss and loss adjustment expense ( LAE\u201d) reserves ( prior years' loss reserves\u201d) was $0.4 million in 2018, compared to $1.2 million in 2017.\nAs discussed further in Discontinued Operations\u201d below, on December 28, 2018, we completed the sale of Chaucer to China Re. We subsequently completed the sale of our Chaucer-related Irish entity on February 14, 2019. The sale of the Australian entities is pending, subject only to local regulatory approval, and is expected to close in the first quarter of 2019. We received $28 million of additional consideration for the Irish entity, and we expect to receive $13 million of additional consideration related to the Australian entities.\nCommercial Lines\nOur account-focused approach to the small commercial market, distinctiveness in the middle market, and continued development of specialty lines provides us with a diversified portfolio of products and delivers significant value to agents and policyholders. Each of these businesses is expected to contribute to premium growth in Commercial Lines over the next several years as we continue to pursue our core strategy of developing strong partnerships with agents, enhanced franchise value through limited distribution, distinctive products and coverages, and continued investment in industry segmentation.\nThese efforts have driven, and we believe they will continue to drive, improvement in our overall mix of business and our underwriting profitability. Commercial Lines net premiums written grew by 6.0% in 2018, due to growth in small commercial, middle market, and the professional lines within our specialty business. Approximately 4.9% of this growth was due to rate and exposure increases, strong retention and targeted new business expansion, with the balance being attributable to improved reinsurance reinstatement activity.\nUnderwriting results improved in 2018, as compared to 2017, primarily due to lower catastrophe losses, higher favorable development on prior years' loss reserves, a reduction in reinsurance reinstatement premiums driven by prior year large loss activity, and lower expenses, partially offset by higher non-catastrophe current accident year losses. Catastrophe losses were $142.3 million in 2018, a decrease of $28.3 million when compared to 2017. Favorable development on prior years' loss reserve in 2018 was $34.1 million, compared to $9.4 million in 2017, an increase of $24.7 million. Reinsurance reinstatement premium, net of ceding commissions, had an unfavorable impact of $0.9 million in 2018, compared to $22.4 million in 2017, a favorable change of $21.5 million. The competitive nature of the Commercial Lines market requires us to be highly disciplined in our underwriting process to ensure that we write business at acceptable margins, and we continue to seek rate increases across our lines of business.\nPersonal Lines\nPersonal Lines focuses on partnering with high quality, value-oriented agencies that deliver consultative selling and stress the importance of account rounding (the conversion of single policy customers to accounts with multiple policies and additional coverages, to address customers' broader objectives). Approximately 84% of our policies in force are account business. We are focused on seeking profitable growth opportunities, building a distinctive position in the market, and diversifying geographically.\nNet premiums written grew by 7.7% in 2018, primarily due to higher renewal premium, driven by rate increases and strong retention, as well as new business growth. Underwriting results declined in 2018, as compared to 2017, primarily due to higher unfavorable development on prior years' loss reserves and higher non-catastrophe current accident year losses, partially offset by earned premium growth, lower catastrophe losses, and lower expenses. We continue to seek rate increases that meet or exceed underlying loss cost trends, subject to regulatory and competitive considerations.\nDESCRIPTION OF OPERATING SEGMENTS\nPrimary business operations include insurance products and services currently provided through three operating segments: Commercial Lines, Personal Lines, and Other. Commercial Lines includes commercial multiple peril, commercial automobile, workers' compensation, and other commercial coverages, such as inland marine, specialty program business, management and professional liability, surety, and specialty property. Personal Lines includes personal automobile, homeowners, and other personal coverages, such as umbrella. Included in the Other\u201d segment are Opus Investment Management, Inc., which markets investment management services to institutions, pension funds, and other organizations; earnings on holding company assets; holding company and other expenses, including certain costs associated with retirement benefits due to our former life insurance employees and agents; and a run-off voluntary pools business. Due to the sale of Chaucer on December 28, 2018, the operations of Chaucer have been classified as Discontinued Operations for the period ending December 31, 2018. Periods prior to 2018 have also been restated to present Chaucer as a discontinued operation. We present the separate financial information of each segment consistent with the manner in which our chief operating decision maker evaluates results in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance.\nWe report interest expense on debt separately from the earnings of our operating segments. This consists of interest on our senior debentures, subordinated debentures, and collateralized borrowings with the Federal Home Loan Bank ( FHLB\u201d).\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS - CONSOLIDATED\n2018 Compared to 2017\nConsolidated net income was $391.0 million in 2018, compared to $186.2 million in 2017, an increase of $204.8 million. The year over year comparison of consolidated net income reflects a $131.9 million gain, net of taxes, on the sale of our Chaucer business. Additionally, operating income before interest expense and income taxes increased $79.2 million, primarily due to lower catastrophe losses and higher net investment income. Income increased from our discontinued operations, primarily Chaucer and, to a lesser extent, our discontinued life business, which incurred a 2017 reserve charge related to our participation in a long-term care pool (See also Discontinued Operations\u201d section below). Also, income tax expense on operating income decreased $20.2 million, driven by a decrease in the U.S. statutory tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018. These increases in net income were partially offset by net realized and unrealized investment losses, net of taxes, of $30.9 million in 2018, compared to net realized investment gains, net of taxes, of $26.2 million in 2017, principally related to reductions in fair value of equity securities. Effective January 1, 2018, we implemented ASU 2016-01, which requires that the changes in fair value of equity securities be presented in net income. Prior to then, these changes were recognized through accumulated other comprehensive income (see also Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). Net income was also affected by $22.3 million in losses, net of taxes, associated with the repayment of debt in 2018.\n2017 Compared to 2016\nConsolidated net income was $186.2 million in 2017, compared to $155.1 million in 2016, an increase of $31.1 million. Operating income before interest expense and income taxes increased $134.4 million, primarily attributable to the year-over-year changes in development on prior years' loss reserves. Unfavorable development on prior years' loss reserves was $1.2 million in 2017 compared to $235.6 million in 2016. Additionally, our results in 2017 benefitted from improved non-catastrophe current accident year underwriting results and higher investment income. These increases were partially offset by a $134.4 million increase in current year catastrophe losses. The year over year comparison of consolidated net income was also affected by a $102.2 million decrease in earnings from the Chaucer business, now reclassified as discontinued operations, from income of $89.1 million in 2016 to losses of $13.1 million in 2017, primarily resulting from higher catastrophe losses. Also, consolidated net income in 2016 included a $57.4 million loss, after taxes, associated with the repayment of debt that did not recur in 2017. These increases in net income were partially offset by increases in 2017 of $15.8 million of after-tax losses from discontinued life operations, primarily due to an increase in our long-term care pool reserves.\nThe following table reflects operating income before interest expense and income taxes for each operating segment and a reconciliation to consolidated net income from operating income before interest expense and income taxes (a non-GAAP measure).\n\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nIn addition to consolidated net income, discussed above, we assess our financial performance based upon pre-tax operating income,\u201d and we assess the operating performance of each of our three operating segments based upon the pre-tax operating income (loss) generated by each segment. As reflected in the table above, operating income before taxes excludes interest expense on debt and certain other items which we believe are not indicative of our core operations, such as net realized investment gains and losses. Such gains and losses are excluded since they are determined by interest rates, financial markets and the timing of sales. Also, operating income before taxes excludes net gains and losses on disposals of businesses, gains and losses related to the repayment of debt, discontinued operations, costs to acquire businesses, restructuring costs, the cumulative effect of accounting changes and certain other items. Although the items excluded from operating income before taxes are important components in understanding and assessing our overall financial performance, we believe a discussion of operating income before taxes enhances an investor's understanding of our results of operations by highlighting net income attributable to the core operations of the business. However, operating income before taxes, which is a non-GAAP measure, should not be construed as a substitute for income before income taxes, and operating income should not be construed as a substitute for net income.\nCatastrophe losses and prior years' reserve development are significant components in understanding and assessing the financial performance of our business. Management reviews and evaluates catastrophes and prior years' reserve development separately from the other components of earnings. References to current accident year underwriting results\u201d exclude prior accident year reserve development, and may also be presented, excluding catastrophes\u201d. Prior years' reserve development and catastrophes are not predictable as to timing or the amount that will affect the results of our operations and have an effect on each year's operating and net income. Management believes that providing certain financial metrics and trends excluding the effects of catastrophes and prior years' reserve development helps investors to understand the variability in periodic earnings and to evaluate the underlying performance of our operations. Discussion of catastrophe losses in this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition includes development on prior years' catastrophe reserves and, unless otherwise indicated, such development is excluded from discussions of prior year loss and LAE reserve development.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS - SEGMENTS\nThe following is our discussion and analysis of the results of operations by business segment. The operating results are presented before interest expense, taxes and other items which management believes are not indicative of our core operations, including realized gains and losses and the results of discontinued operations.\nThe following table summarizes the results of operations for the periods indicated:\n\n2018 Compared to 2017\nOperating income before interest expense and income taxes was $406.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to $327.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of $79.2 million. This increase was primarily due to lower catastrophe losses, higher net investment income, a favorable change in reinsurance reinstatement premiums driven by prior year large loss activity, earned premium growth and lower expenses, partially offset by higher non-catastrophe current accident year losses.\nNet premiums written increased by $275.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, due to growth in both our Commercial and Personal Lines segments.\n2017 Compared to 2016\nOperating income before interest expense and income taxes was $327.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $192.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, an increase of $134.4 million. This increase was primarily due to a favorable change in development on prior years' loss reserves, partially offset by higher catastrophe losses. Unfavorable development on prior years' loss reserves was $1.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to unfavorable development of $235.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, a favorable change of $234.4 million. In 2016, we recognized a reserve charge of $174.1 million following the 2016 fourth quarter reserve review. Catastrophe-related activity for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $251.5 million, compared to $117.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, an increase of $134.4 million. This increase in catastrophe losses was primarily due to hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria that occurred in the third quarter of 2017, the California wildfires that occurred in the fourth quarter of 2017, and a Midwest wind event that occurred in the first quarter of 2017.\nNet premiums written increased by $226.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, due to growth in both our Personal and Commercial Lines segments.\nPRODUCTION AND UNDERWRITING RESULTS\nThe following table summarizes premiums written on a gross and net basis, net premiums earned and loss (including catastrophe losses), LAE, expense and combined ratios for the Commercial Lines and Personal Lines segments. Loss, LAE, catastrophe loss and combined ratios shown below include prior year reserve development. These items are not meaningful for our Other segment.\n\n\n\nThe following table summarizes net premiums written, and loss and LAE and catastrophe loss ratios by line of business for the Commercial Lines and Personal Lines segments. Loss and LAE and catastrophe loss ratios include prior year reserve development.\n\n\n\nThe following table summarizes GAAP underwriting results for the Commercial Lines, Personal Lines, and Other segments and reconciles them to operating income (loss) before interest expense and income taxes.\n\n\n\n2018 Compared to 2017\nCommercial Lines\nCommercial Lines net premiums written were $2,610.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to $2,462.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. This $148.7 million increase was primarily driven by pricing increases, strong retention, and targeted new business expansion, in addition to reductions in reinstatement premiums. Reinsurance reinstatements were $0.5 million unfavorable in 2018 compared to $27.8 million unfavorable in 2017. The year over year favorable change was $27.3 million due to several 2017 large losses above our retention level in our surety, inland marine and commercial multiple peril lines. The reinstatement premiums represent the pro-rata reinsurance premium charged for reinstating the amount of reinsurance coverage utilized as a result of the incurred losses that are reimbursable under our reinsurance treaties. See the Glossary of Selected Insurance Terms - Reinstatement premium\u201d.\nCommercial Lines underwriting profit for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $85.0 million, compared to $12.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, a change of $72.8 million. Catastrophe-related losses for the year ended December 31, 2018 were $142.3 million, compared to $170.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, a decrease of $28.3 million. Favorable development on prior years' loss reserves for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $34.1 million, compared to $9.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, a favorable change of $24.7 million.\nCommercial Lines current accident year underwriting profit, excluding catastrophes, was $193.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to $173.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. This $19.8 million improvement was primarily due to the reduction in large loss-related reinsurance reinstatement premiums, lower expenses and earned premium growth, partially offset by higher non-catastrophe current accident year losses. The reduction in reinsurance reinstatement premiums, net of ceding commissions, increased non-catastrophe current accident year underwriting profit by $21.5 million compared to the prior year. The higher non-catastrophe current accident year losses were driven by large property loss activity in our commercial multiple peril line and higher loss activity in our commercial automobile liability line, partially offset by lower loss activity in our other commercial lines.\nWe are continuing our efforts to improve underwriting results through increased rates, pricing segmentation, specific underwriting actions and targeted new business growth. Our ability to achieve overall rate increases is affected by the current competitive pricing\nenvironment, particularly within our workers' compensation line, as well as for larger middle market accounts, which may hamper our ability to grow in this portion of our business.\nPersonal Lines\nPersonal Lines net premiums written were $1,774.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to $1,647.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of $127.0 million. This was primarily due to higher renewal premium driven by rate increases and strong retention, as well as new business growth.\nNet premiums written in the personal automobile line of business for the year ended December 31, 2018 were $1,127.5 million, compared to $1,041.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of $85.9 million. This increase was primarily due to rate increases and an increase in policies in force of 2.5%. Net premiums written in the homeowners line of business for the year ended December 31, 2018 were $604.0 million, compared to $566.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of $37.1 million. This is attributable to rate increases and an increase in policies in force of 3.0%.\nPersonal Lines underwriting profit for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $66.6 million, compared to $83.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, a decline of $17.1 million. Catastrophe losses for the year ended December 31, 2018 were $76.9 million, compared to $80.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, a decrease of $4.0 million. Unfavorable development on prior years' loss reserves for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $33.3 million, compared to $9.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of $23.9 million.\nPersonal Lines current accident year underwriting profit, excluding catastrophes, was $176.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to $174.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. This $2.8 million increase was primarily a result of earned premium growth and lower expenses, partially offset by higher non-catastrophe current accident year losses. This increase in losses was driven by higher homeowners property losses, partly due to large losses and non-catastrophe weather activity, higher personal automobile bodily injury loss severity and, to a lesser extent, higher personal automobile property losses.\nWe have been able to obtain rate increases in our Personal Lines markets and believe that our ability to obtain these increases will continue. However, our ability to maintain Personal Lines net premiums written may be affected by price competition, and regulatory and legal developments. Additionally, these factors along with weather-related loss volatility may also affect our ability to maintain and improve underwriting results. We monitor these trends and consider them in our rate actions.\nOther\nOther operating losses were $5.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to $8.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, an improvement of $3.4 million, primarily due to higher net investment income.\n2017 Compared to 2016\nCommercial Lines\nCommercial Lines net premiums written were $2,462.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $2,361.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. This $100.5 million increase was due to growth of $117.4 million, primarily driven by pricing increases, strong retention, and targeted new business expansion, partially offset by a $16.9 million increase in reinsurance reinstatement premiums driven by large property losses in our inland marine and commercial multiple peril lines.\nCommercial Lines underwriting profit for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $12.2 million, compared to underwriting loss of $123.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, a change of $135.4 million. Favorable development on prior years' loss reserves for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $9.4 million, compared to unfavorable development of $223.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, a favorable change of $232.4 million, primarily due to the aforementioned reserve charge following our 2016 fourth quarter reserve review. Catastrophe-related losses for the year ended December 31, 2017 were $170.6 million, compared to $70.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, an increase of $100.5 million. This increase is primarily due to hurricanes Harvey and Irma that occurred in the third quarter, the California wildfires that occurred in the fourth quarter, and a large Midwest hail event that occurred in the second quarter.\nCommercial Lines current accident year underwriting profit, excluding catastrophes, was $173.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $169.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. This $3.5 million improvement was primarily due to lower losses in our workers' compensation line, lower expenses and premium growth, partially offset by higher large losses and the increase in reinstatement premiums. The impact of additional reinstatement premiums, net of ceding commissions, decreased 2017 current accident year underwriting profit by $12.0 million from 2016 levels.\nPersonal Lines\nPersonal Lines net premiums written were $1,647.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $1,521.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, an increase of $125.9 million. This was primarily due to higher renewal premium driven by rate increases and improved retention, as well as new business growth.\nNet premiums written in the personal automobile line of business for the year ended December 31, 2017 were $1,041.6 million, compared to $953.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, an increase of $88.0 million. This increase was primarily due to rate increases and an increase in policies in force of 3.8%. Net premiums written in the homeowners line of business for the year ended December 31, 2017 were $566.9 million, compared to $529.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, an increase of $37.2 million. This is attributable to rate increases and an increase in policies in force of 4.0%.\nPersonal Lines underwriting profit for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $83.7 million, compared to $103.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, a decline of $19.4 million. Catastrophe losses for the year ended December 31, 2017 were $80.9 million, compared to $47.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, an increase of $33.9 million. This increase is primarily due to a large Midwest wind event that occurred in the first quarter of 2017. Unfavorable development on prior years' loss reserves for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $9.4 million, compared to $4.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, an increase of $5.1 million.\nPersonal Lines current accident year underwriting profit, excluding catastrophes, was $174.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $154.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. This $19.6 million increase was primarily a result of earned premium growth and lower expenses. Also, higher current accident year losses in our homeowners line were substantially offset by lower losses in our personal automobile line.\nOther\nOther operating losses were $8.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $19.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, an improvement of $10.7 million, primarily due to 2016 unfavorable prior year reserve development in our run-off voluntary pools business (See 2016 Loss and LAE Development, excluding catastrophes\u201d section below for further discussion).\nRESERVE FOR LOSSES AND LOSS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES\nOverview of Loss Reserve Estimation Process\nWe maintain reserves for our property and casualty products to provide for our ultimate liability for losses and loss adjustment expenses (our loss reserves\u201d) with respect to reported and unreported claims incurred as of the end of each accounting period. These reserves are estimates, taking into account past loss experience, modified for current trends, as well as prevailing economic, legal and social conditions. Loss reserves represent our largest liability.\nManagement's process for establishing loss reserves is a comprehensive process that involves input from multiple functions throughout our organization, including actuarial, finance, claims, legal, underwriting, distribution and business operations management. The process incorporates facts currently known, as well as the current, and in some cases, the anticipated, state of the law and coverage litigation. Based on information currently available, we believe that the aggregate loss reserves at December 31, 2018 were adequate to cover claims for losses that had occurred as of that date, including both those known to us and those yet to be reported. However, as described below, there are significant uncertainties inherent in the loss reserving process. Our estimate of the ultimate liability for losses that had occurred as of December 31, 2018 is expected to change in future periods as we obtain further information, and such changes could have a material effect on our results of operations and financial position.\nOur loss reserves include case estimates for claims that have been reported and estimates for claims that have been incurred but not reported ( IBNR\u201d) at the balance sheet date. They also include estimates of the expenses associated with processing and settling all reported and unreported claims, less estimates of anticipated salvage and subrogation recoveries. Our property and casualty loss reserves are not discounted to present value.\nCase reserves are established by our claim personnel individually on a claim by claim basis and based on information specific to the occurrence and terms of the underlying policy. For some classes of business, average case reserves are used initially. Case reserves are periodically reviewed and modified based on new or additional information pertaining to the claim.\nOur ultimate IBNR reserves are estimated by management and our reserving actuaries on an aggregate basis for each line of business or coverage for loss and loss expense liabilities not reflected within the case reserves. The sum of the case reserves and the IBNR reserves represents our estimate of total unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses.\nWe regularly review our loss reserves using a variety of industry accepted analytical techniques. We update the loss reserves as historical loss experience develops, additional claims are reported and resolved and new information becomes available. Net changes in loss reserves are reflected in operating results in the period in which the reserves are changed.\nThe IBNR reserve includes a provision for claims that have occurred but have not yet been reported to us, some of which may not yet be known to the insured, as well as a provision for future development on reported claims. IBNR represents a significant proportion of our total net loss reserves, particularly for long-tail liability classes. In fact, approximately 48% of our aggregate net loss reserves at December 31, 2018 were for IBNR losses and loss expenses.\nCritical Judgments and Key Assumptions\nWe determine the amount of our loss reserves based on an estimation process that is complex and considers information from both company specific and industry data, as well as general economic and other information. The estimation process utilizes a combination of objective and subjective information, the blending of which requires significant professional judgment. There are various assumptions required, including future trends in frequency and severity of claims, operational changes in claim handling and case reserving practices, and trends related to general economic and social conditions. Informed judgments as to our ultimate exposure to losses are an integral component of our loss reserve estimation process.\nGiven the inherent complexity of our loss reserve estimation process and the potential variability of the assumptions used, the actual emergence of losses will vary, perhaps substantially, from the estimate of losses included in our financial statements, particularly in those instances where settlements or other claim resolutions do not occur until well into the future. Our net loss reserves at December 31, 2018 were $3.8 billion. Therefore, a relatively small percentage change in the estimate of net loss reserves would have a material effect on our results of operations.\nThere is greater inherent uncertainty in estimating insurance reserves for certain types of property and casualty insurance lines, particularly liability lines, where a longer period of time may elapse before a definitive determination of ultimate liability and losses may be made. In addition, the technological, judicial, regulatory and political climates involving these types of claims are continuously evolving. There is also greater uncertainty in establishing reserves with respect to business that is new to us, particularly new business which is generated with respect to newly introduced product lines, by newly appointed agents or in geographies in which we have less experience in conducting business. In such cases, there is less historical experience or knowledge and less data upon which we can rely. A combination of business that is both new to us and has longer development periods provides even greater uncertainty in estimating insurance reserves. In our management and professional liability lines, we are modestly increasing, and expect to continue to increase, our exposure to longer-tailed liability lines, including directors and officers liability, errors and omissions liability and product liability coverages. In addition, in recent periods we have experienced extensions of the tails\u201d in certain lines of business as the full value of claims are presented later than had been our historical experience.\nWe regularly update our reserve estimates as new information becomes available and additional events occur which may impact the resolution of unsettled claims. Reserve adjustments are reflected in the results of operations as adjustments to losses and LAE. Often, these adjustments are recognized in periods subsequent to the period in which the underlying policy was written and the loss event occurred. When these types of subsequent adjustments affect prior years, they are described separately as prior year reserve development\u201d. Such development can be either favorable or unfavorable to our financial results and may vary by line of business. As discussed below, estimated loss and LAE reserves for claims occurring in prior years, in the aggregate, developed unfavorably by $0.4 million, $1.2 million and $235.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively, although there was considerable variance by line of business. Additionally, our estimated loss and LAE reserves for catastrophe claims occurring in prior years developed favorably by $9.3 million, favorably by $1.4 million, and unfavorably by $2.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. There can be no assurance that current loss and LAE reserves will be sufficient.\nWe regularly review our reserving techniques, our overall reserving position and our reinsurance. Based on (i) our review of historical data, legislative enactments, judicial decisions, legal developments in impositions of damages and policy coverage, political attitudes and trends in general economic conditions, (ii) our review of per claim information, (iii) our historical loss experience and that of the industry, (iv) the nature of policies written by us, and (v) our internal estimates of required reserves, we believe that adequate provision has been made for loss reserves. However, establishment of appropriate reserves is an inherently uncertain process, and there can be no certainty that current established reserves will prove adequate in light of subsequent actual experience. A significant change to the estimated reserves could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position. An increase or decrease in reserve estimates would result in a corresponding decrease or increase in financial results. For example, each one percentage point change in the aggregate loss and LAE ratio resulting from a change in reserve estimation is currently projected to have an approximate $43 million impact on operating income, based on 2018 full year premiums.\nThe major causes of material uncertainty relating to ultimate losses and LAE ( risk factors\u201d) generally vary for each line of business, as well as for each separately analyzed component of the line of business. In some cases, such risk factors are explicit assumptions of the estimation method and in others, they are implicit. For example, a method may explicitly assume that a certain percentage of claims will close each year, but will implicitly assume that the legal interpretation of existing contract language will remain substantially unchanged. Actual results will likely vary from expectations for each of these assumptions, resulting in an ultimate claim liability that is different from that being estimated currently.\nSome risk factors affect multiple lines of business. Examples include changes in claim handling and claim reserving practices, changes in claim settlement patterns, regulatory and legislative actions, court actions, timeliness of claim reporting, state mix of claimants, and degree of claimant fraud. Additionally, there is also a higher degree of uncertainty due to growth in our newly acquired businesses, with respect to which we have less familiarity and, in some cases, limited historical claims experience. The extent of the impact of a risk factor will also vary by components within a line of business. Individual risk factors are subject to interactions with other risk factors within line of business components. Thus, risk factors can have offsetting or compounding effects on required reserves.\nInflation generally increases the cost of losses covered by insurance contracts. The effect of inflation varies by product. Our property and casualty insurance premiums are established before the amount of losses and LAE and the extent to which inflation may affect such expenses are known. Consequently, we attempt, in establishing rates and reserves, to anticipate the potential impact of inflation in the projection of ultimate costs. For example, we monitor and continue to experience increases in medical costs, wages and legal costs, which are key considerations in setting reserve assumptions for workers' compensation, bodily injury and other liability lines. We are also monitoring the continued advancements in technology and design found in automobiles and homes and the increased claims settlement costs that result from repairs or replacement of such equipment. Estimated increases are reflected in our current reserve estimates, but continued increases are expected to contribute to increased losses and LAE in the future.\nWe are also defendants in various litigation matters, including putative class actions, which may seek punitive damages, bad faith or extra-contractual damages, legal fees and interest, or claim a broader scope of policy coverage or settlement and payment obligations than our interpretation. Resolution of these cases are often highly unpredictable and could involve material unanticipated damage awards. We have experienced, and others in the industry have reported, increased attorney involvement in claims, delayed submissions of medical and other expense claims, and a trend toward higher valued settlements and litigation, all of which contribute to uncertainty regarding reserve estimates.\nLoss and LAE Reserves by Line of Business\nReserving Process Overview\nOur loss reserves include amounts related to short-tail and long-tail classes of business. Tail\u201d refers to the time period between the occurrence of a loss and the final settlement of the claim. The longer the time span between the incidence of a loss and the settlement of the claim (i.e., a longer tail), the more the ultimate settlement amount may likely vary from our original estimate.\nShort-tail classes consist principally of automobile physical damage, homeowners property, commercial property and marine business. For these property coverages, claims are generally reported and settled shortly after the loss occurs because the claims relate to tangible property and are more likely to be discovered shortly after the loss occurs. Consequently, the estimation of loss reserves for these classes is generally less complex.\nWhile we estimate that a majority of our written premium is in what we would characterize as shorter-tailed classes of business, most of our loss reserves relate to longer-tail liability classes of business. Long-tailed classes include commercial liability, automobile liability, workers' compensation and other types of third-party coverage. For many liability claims, significant periods of time, ranging up to several years or more, may elapse between the occurrence of the loss, the discovery and reporting of the loss to us and the settlement of the claim. As a result, loss experience in the more recent accident years for long-tailed liability coverage has limited statistical credibility because a relatively small proportion of losses in these accident years (the calendar years in which losses are incurred) are reported claims and an even smaller proportion are paid losses. Liability claims are also more susceptible to litigation and can be significantly affected by changing contract interpretations, the legal, political and social environment, the risk and expense of protracted litigation and inflation. Consequently, the estimation of loss reserves for these coverages is more complex and typically subject to a higher degree of variability and uncertainty compared to short-tailed coverages.\nMost of our indirect business from our run-off voluntary and ongoing involuntary pools is assumed long-tailed casualty reinsurance. Reserve estimates for this business are therefore subject to the variability caused by extended loss emergence periods. The estimation of loss reserves for this business is further complicated by delays between the time the claim is reported to the ceding insurer and when it is reported by the ceding insurer to the pool manager and then to us, and by our dependence on the quality and consistency of the loss reporting by the ceding company and actuarial estimates by the pool manager. These reserving factors also apply to our discontinued assumed accident and health reinsurance pools and arrangements that are included in our liabilities of discontinued life business (See Risk Factors\u201d in Part I - Item 1A for further discussion).\nA review of loss reserves for each of the classes of business which we write is conducted regularly, generally quarterly. This review process takes into consideration a variety of trends that impact the ultimate settlement of claims. Where appropriate, the review includes a review of overall payment patterns and the emergence of paid and reported losses relative to expectations.\nThe loss reserve estimation process relies on the basic assumption that past experience, adjusted for the effects of current developments and likely trends, is an appropriate basis for predicting future outcomes. As part of this process, we use a variety of analytical methods that consider experience, trends and other relevant factors. IBNR reserves are generally calculated by first projecting the ultimate cost of all claims that have been reported or expected to be reported in the future and then subtracting reported losses and loss expenses. Reported losses include cumulative paid losses and loss expenses plus case reserves. Within the loss reserving process, standard actuarial methods which include: (1) loss development factor methods; (2) expected loss methods (Bornheutter-Ferguson); and (3) adjusted loss methods (Berquist-Sherman), are given due consideration. These methods are described below:\n \u2022 Loss development factor methods generally assume that the losses yet to emerge for an accident year are proportional to the paid or reported loss amount observed to date. Historical patterns of the development of paid and reported losses by \n accident year can be predictive of the expected future patterns that are applied to current paid and reported losses to generate estimated ultimate losses by accident year. \n \u2022 Bornheutter-Ferguson methods utilize the product of the expected ultimate losses times the proportion of ultimate losses estimated to be unreported or unpaid to calculate IBNR. The expected ultimate losses are based upon current estimates of ultimate losses from prior accident years, adjusted to reflect expected earned premium, current rating, claims cost levels and changes in business mix. The expected losses, and corresponding loss ratios, are a critical component of Bornheutter-Ferguson methodologies and provide a general reasonability guide. \n \u2022 Berquist-Sherman methods are used for estimating", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7 - MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nTable 70: <table> <tr> <td> Introduction\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Executive Overview\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Description of Operating Segments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Results of Operations - Consolidated\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Results of Operations - Segments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Investments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other Items\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Discontinued Operations - Chaucer Business\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income Taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Critical Accounting Estimates\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Statutory Surplus of U.S. Insurance Subsidiaries\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Liquidity and Capital Resources\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Contingencies and Regulatory Matters\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Rating Agencies\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Risks and Forward-Looking Statements\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Glossary of Selected Insurance Terms\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nINTRODUCTION\nThe following Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is intended to assist readers in understanding the consolidated results of operations and financial condition of The Hanover Insurance Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries ( THG\u201d). Consolidated results of operations and financial condition are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America ( U.S. GAAP\u201d). This discussion should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and related footnotes included elsewhere herein.\nResults of operations include the accounts of The Hanover Insurance Company ( Hanover Insurance\u201d) and Citizens Insurance Company of America ( Citizens\u201d), our principal property and casualty companies; and certain other insurance and non-insurance subsidiaries. Our results of operations also include the results of our discontinued operations, consisting primarily of our former Chaucer international business, Chaucer Holdings Limited ( Chaucer\u201d), a United Kingdom ( U.K.\u201d) domiciled specialist insurance underwriting group which operates through the Society and Corporation of Lloyd's ( Lloyd's\u201d), and the international insurance and non-insurance subsidiaries, which collectively constituted our former Chaucer segment. On December 28, 2018, we completed the sale of Chaucer Holdings Limited, the major portion of our Lloyd's international specialty business. As of December 31, 2018 and for all prior periods presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, operations from Chaucer and the related assets and liabilities are presented as discontinued operations. Results of operations also include the discontinued operations of our accident and health and former life insurance businesses.\nEXECUTIVE OVERVIEW\nBusiness operations consist of three operating segments: Commercial Lines, Personal Lines and Other.\nNet income was $391.0 million in 2018, compared to $186.2 million in 2017, an increase of $204.8 million, primarily due to the gain from the sale of our former Chaucer business and an increase in operating income.\nOperating income before interest expense and income taxes (a non-GAAP financial measure; see also Results of Operations - Consolidated - Non-GAAP Financial Measures\u201d) was $406.5 million in 2018 compared to $327.3 million in 2017, an increase of $79.2 million. This increase is primarily due to lower catastrophe losses, higher net investment income, a reduction in reinsurance reinstatement premiums, earned premium growth and lower expenses, partially offset by higher non-catastrophe current accident year losses. Pre-tax catastrophe losses were $219.2 million in 2018, compared to $251.5 million in 2017, a decrease of $32.3 million. Reinsurance reinstatement premium, net of ceding commissions, was a favorable change of $21.5 million. Net unfavorable development on prior years' loss and loss adjustment expense ( LAE\u201d) reserves ( prior years' loss reserves\u201d) was $0.4 million in 2018, compared to $1.2 million in 2017.\nAs discussed further in Discontinued Operations\u201d below, on December 28, 2018, we completed the sale of Chaucer to China Re. We subsequently completed the sale of our Chaucer-related Irish entity on February 14, 2019. The sale of the Australian entities is pending, subject only to local regulatory approval, and is expected to close in the first quarter of 2019. We received $28 million of additional consideration for the Irish entity, and we expect to receive $13 million of additional consideration related to the Australian entities.\nCommercial Lines\nOur account-focused approach to the small commercial market, distinctiveness in the middle market, and continued development of specialty lines provides us with a diversified portfolio of products and delivers significant value to agents and policyholders. Each of these businesses is expected to contribute to premium growth in Commercial Lines over the next several years as we continue to pursue our core strategy of developing strong partnerships with agents, enhanced franchise value through limited distribution, distinctive products and coverages, and continued investment in industry segmentation.\nThese efforts have driven, and we believe they will continue to drive, improvement in our overall mix of business and our underwriting profitability. Commercial Lines net premiums written grew by 6.0% in 2018, due to growth in small commercial, middle market, and the professional lines within our specialty business. Approximately 4.9% of this growth was due to rate and exposure increases, strong retention and targeted new business expansion, with the balance being attributable to improved reinsurance reinstatement activity.\nUnderwriting results improved in 2018, as compared to 2017, primarily due to lower catastrophe losses, higher favorable development on prior years' loss reserves, a reduction in reinsurance reinstatement premiums driven by prior year large loss activity, and lower expenses, partially offset by higher non-catastrophe current accident year losses. Catastrophe losses were $142.3 million in 2018, a decrease of $28.3 million when compared to 2017. Favorable development on prior years' loss reserve in 2018 was $34.1 million, compared to $9.4 million in 2017, an increase of $24.7 million. Reinsurance reinstatement premium, net of ceding commissions, had an unfavorable impact of $0.9 million in 2018, compared to $22.4 million in 2017, a favorable change of $21.5 million. The competitive nature of the Commercial Lines market requires us to be highly disciplined in our underwriting process to ensure that we write business at acceptable margins, and we continue to seek rate increases across our lines of business.\nPersonal Lines\nPersonal Lines focuses on partnering with high quality, value-oriented agencies that deliver consultative selling and stress the importance of account rounding (the conversion of single policy customers to accounts with multiple policies and additional coverages, to address customers' broader objectives). Approximately 84% of our policies in force are account business. We are focused on seeking profitable growth opportunities, building a distinctive position in the market, and diversifying geographically.\nNet premiums written grew by 7.7% in 2018, primarily due to higher renewal premium, driven by rate increases and strong retention, as well as new business growth. Underwriting results declined in 2018, as compared to 2017, primarily due to higher unfavorable development on prior years' loss reserves and higher non-catastrophe current accident year losses, partially offset by earned premium growth, lower catastrophe losses, and lower expenses. We continue to seek rate increases that meet or exceed underlying loss cost trends, subject to regulatory and competitive considerations.\nDESCRIPTION OF OPERATING SEGMENTS\nPrimary business operations include insurance products and services currently provided through three operating segments: Commercial Lines, Personal Lines, and Other. Commercial Lines includes commercial multiple peril, commercial automobile, workers' compensation, and other commercial coverages, such as inland marine, specialty program business, management and professional liability, surety, and specialty property. Personal Lines includes personal automobile, homeowners, and other personal coverages, such as umbrella. Included in the Other\u201d segment are Opus Investment Management, Inc., which markets investment management services to institutions, pension funds, and other organizations; earnings on holding company assets; holding company and other expenses, including certain costs associated with retirement benefits due to our former life insurance employees and agents; and a run-off voluntary pools business. Due to the sale of Chaucer on December 28, 2018, the operations of Chaucer have been classified as Discontinued Operations for the period ending December 31, 2018. Periods prior to 2018 have also been restated to present Chaucer as a discontinued operation. We present the separate financial information of each segment consistent with the manner in which our chief operating decision maker evaluates results in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance.\nWe report interest expense on debt separately from the earnings of our operating segments. This consists of interest on our senior debentures, subordinated debentures, and collateralized borrowings with the Federal Home Loan Bank ( FHLB\u201d).\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS - CONSOLIDATED\n2018 Compared to 2017\nConsolidated net income was $391.0 million in 2018, compared to $186.2 million in 2017, an increase of $204.8 million. The year over year comparison of consolidated net income reflects a $131.9 million gain, net of taxes, on the sale of our Chaucer business. Additionally, operating income before interest expense and income taxes increased $79.2 million, primarily due to lower catastrophe losses and higher net investment income. Income increased from our discontinued operations, primarily Chaucer and, to a lesser extent, our discontinued life business, which incurred a 2017 reserve charge related to our participation in a long-term care pool (See also Discontinued Operations\u201d section below). Also, income tax expense on operating income decreased $20.2 million, driven by a decrease in the U.S. statutory tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018. These increases in net income were partially offset by net realized and unrealized investment losses, net of taxes, of $30.9 million in 2018, compared to net realized investment gains, net of taxes, of $26.2 million in 2017, principally related to reductions in fair value of equity securities. Effective January 1, 2018, we implemented ASU 2016-01, which requires that the changes in fair value of equity securities be presented in net income. Prior to then, these changes were recognized through accumulated other comprehensive income (see also Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). Net income was also affected by $22.3 million in losses, net of taxes, associated with the repayment of debt in 2018.\n2017 Compared to 2016\nConsolidated net income was $186.2 million in 2017, compared to $155.1 million in 2016, an increase of $31.1 million. Operating income before interest expense and income taxes increased $134.4 million, primarily attributable to the year-over-year changes in development on prior years' loss reserves. Unfavorable development on prior years' loss reserves was $1.2 million in 2017 compared to $235.6 million in 2016. Additionally, our results in 2017 benefitted from improved non-catastrophe current accident year underwriting results and higher investment income. These increases were partially offset by a $134.4 million increase in current year catastrophe losses. The year over year comparison of consolidated net income was also affected by a $102.2 million decrease in earnings from the Chaucer business, now reclassified as discontinued operations, from income of $89.1 million in 2016 to losses of $13.1 million in 2017, primarily resulting from higher catastrophe losses. Also, consolidated net income in 2016 included a $57.4 million loss, after taxes, associated with the repayment of debt that did not recur in 2017. These increases in net income were partially offset by increases in 2017 of $15.8 million of after-tax losses from discontinued life operations, primarily due to an increase in our long-term care pool reserves.\nThe following table reflects operating income before interest expense and income taxes for each operating segment and a reconciliation to consolidated net income from operating income before interest expense and income taxes (a non-GAAP measure).\nTable 71: <table> <tr> <td> YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td>

income,\u201d and we assess the operating performance of each of our three operating segments based upon the pre-tax operating income (loss) generated by each segment. As reflected in the table above, operating income before taxes excludes interest expense on debt and certain other items which we believe are not indicative of our core operations, such as net realized investment gains and losses. Such gains and losses are excluded since they are determined by interest rates, financial markets and the timing of sales. Also, operating income before taxes excludes net gains and losses on disposals of businesses, gains and losses related to the repayment of debt, discontinued operations, costs to acquire businesses, restructuring costs, the cumulative effect of accounting changes and certain other items. Although the items excluded from operating income before taxes are important components in understanding and assessing our overall financial performance, we believe a discussion of operating income before taxes enhances an investor's understanding of our results of operations by highlighting net income attributable to the core operations of the business. However, operating income before taxes, which is a non-GAAP measure, should not be construed as a substitute for income before income taxes, and operating income should not be construed as a substitute for net income.\nCatastrophe losses and prior years' reserve development are significant components in understanding and assessing the financial performance of our business. Management reviews and evaluates catastrophes and prior years' reserve development separately from the other components of earnings. References to current accident year underwriting results\u201d exclude prior accident year reserve development, and may also be presented, excluding catastrophes\u201d. Prior years' reserve development and catastrophes are not predictable as to timing or the amount that will affect the results of our operations and have an effect on each year's operating and net income. Management believes that providing certain financial metrics and trends excluding the effects of catastrophes and prior years' reserve development helps investors to understand the variability in periodic earnings and to evaluate the underlying performance of our operations. Discussion of catastrophe losses in this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition includes development on prior years' catastrophe reserves and, unless otherwise indicated, such development is excluded from discussions of prior year loss and LAE reserve development.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS - SEGMENTS\nThe following is our discussion and analysis of the results of operations by business segment. The operating results are presented before interest expense, taxes and other items which management believes are not indicative of our core operations, including realized gains and losses and the results of discontinued operations.\nThe following table summarizes the results of operations for the periods indicated:\nTable 72: <table> <tr> <td> YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (in millions)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net premiums written\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,384.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,109.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,882.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net premiums earned\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,254.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,980.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,789.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net investment income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 267.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 243.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 231.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 23.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 22.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 22.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total operating revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,545.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,246.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,043.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Losses and operating expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Losses and LAE\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,724.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,574.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,546.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Amortization of deferred acquisition costs\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 891.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 840.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 803.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other operating expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 522.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 503.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 501.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total losses and operating expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,138.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,919.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3,850.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating income before interest expense and income taxes\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 406.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 327.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 192.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n2018 Compared to 2017\nOperating income before interest expense and income taxes was $406.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to $327.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of $79.2 million. This increase was primarily due to lower catastrophe losses, higher net investment income, a favorable change in reinsurance reinstatement premiums driven by prior year large loss activity, earned premium growth and lower expenses, partially offset by higher non-catastrophe current accident year losses.\nNet premiums written increased by $275.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, due to growth in both our Commercial and Personal Lines segments.\n2017 Compared to 2016\nOperating income before interest expense and income taxes was $327.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $192.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, an increase of $134.4 million. This increase was primarily due to a favorable change in development on prior years' loss reserves, partially offset by higher catastrophe losses. Unfavorable development on prior years' loss reserves was $1.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to unfavorable development of $235.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, a favorable change of $234.4 million. In 2016, we recognized a reserve charge of $174.1 million following the 2016 fourth quarter reserve review. Catastrophe-related activity for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $251.5 million, compared to $117.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, an increase of $134.4 million. This increase in catastrophe losses was primarily due to hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria that occurred in the third quarter of 2017, the California wildfires that occurred in the fourth quarter of 2017, and a Midwest wind event that occurred in the first quarter of 2017.\nNet premiums written increased by $226.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the year ended December 31, 2016, due to growth in both our Personal and Commercial Lines segments.\nPRODUCTION AND UNDERWRITING RESULTS\nThe following table summarizes premiums written on a gross and net basis, net premiums earned and loss (including catastrophe losses), LAE, expense and combined ratios for the Commercial Lines and Personal Lines segments. Loss, LAE, catastrophe loss and combined ratios shown below include prior year reserve development.

December 31, 2018, compared to $2,462.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. This $148.7 million increase was primarily driven by pricing increases, strong retention, and targeted new business expansion, in addition to reductions in reinstatement premiums. Reinsurance reinstatements were $0.5 million unfavorable in 2018 compared to $27.8 million unfavorable in 2017. The year over year favorable change was $27.3 million due to several 2017 large losses above our retention level in our surety, inland marine and commercial multiple peril lines. The reinstatement premiums represent the pro-rata reinsurance premium charged for reinstating the amount of reinsurance coverage utilized as a result of the incurred losses that are reimbursable under our reinsurance treaties. See the Glossary of Selected Insurance Terms - Reinstatement premium\u201d.\nCommercial Lines underwriting profit for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $85.0 million, compared to $12.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, a change of $72.8 million. Catastrophe-related losses for the year ended December 31, 2018 were $142.3 million, compared to $170.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, a decrease of $28.3 million. Favorable development on prior years' loss reserves for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $34.1 million, compared to $9.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, a favorable change of $24.7 million.\nCommercial Lines current accident year underwriting profit, excluding catastrophes, was $193.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to $173.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. This $19.8 million improvement was primarily due to the reduction in large loss-related reinsurance reinstatement premiums, lower expenses and earned premium growth, partially offset by higher non-catastrophe current accident year losses. The reduction in reinsurance reinstatement premiums, net of ceding commissions, increased non-catastrophe current accident year underwriting profit by $21.5 million compared to the prior year. The higher non-catastrophe current accident year losses were driven by large property loss activity in our commercial multiple peril line and higher loss activity in our commercial automobile liability line, partially offset by lower loss activity in our other commercial lines.\nWe are continuing our efforts to improve underwriting results through increased rates, pricing segmentation, specific underwriting actions and targeted new business growth. Our ability to achieve overall rate increases is affected by the current competitive pricing\nenvironment, particularly within our workers' compensation line, as well as for larger middle market accounts, which may hamper our ability to grow in this portion of our business.\nPersonal Lines\nPersonal Lines net premiums written were $1,774.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to $1,647.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of $127.0 million. This was primarily due to higher renewal premium driven by rate increases and strong retention, as well as new business growth.\nNet premiums written in the personal automobile line of business for the year ended December 31, 2018 were $1,127.5 million, compared to $1,041.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of $85.9 million. This increase was primarily due to rate increases and an increase in policies in force of 2.5%. Net premiums written in the homeowners line of business for the year ended December 31, 2018 were $604.0 million, compared to $566.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of $37.1 million. This is attributable to rate increases and an increase in policies in force of 3.0%.\nPersonal Lines underwriting profit for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $66.6 million, compared to $83.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, a decline of $17.1 million. Catastrophe losses for the year ended December 31, 2018 were $76.9 million, compared to $80.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, a decrease of $4.0 million. Unfavorable development on prior years' loss reserves for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $33.3 million, compared to $9.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, an increase of $23.9 million.\nPersonal Lines current accident year underwriting profit, excluding catastrophes, was $176.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to $174.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. This $2.8 million increase was primarily a result of earned premium growth and lower expenses, partially offset by higher non-catastrophe current accident year losses. This increase in losses was driven by higher homeowners property losses, partly due to large losses and non-catastrophe weather activity, higher personal automobile bodily injury loss severity and, to a lesser extent, higher personal automobile property losses.\nWe have been able to obtain rate increases in our Personal Lines markets and believe that our ability to obtain these increases will continue. However, our ability to maintain Personal Lines net premiums written may be affected by price competition, and regulatory and legal developments. Additionally, these factors along with weather-related loss volatility may also affect our ability to maintain and improve underwriting results. We monitor these trends and consider them in our rate actions.\nOther\nOther operating losses were $5.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to $8.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, an improvement of $3.4 million, primarily due to higher net investment income.\n2017 Compared to 2016\nCommercial Lines\nCommercial Lines net premiums written were $2,462.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $2,361.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. This $100.5 million increase was due to growth of $117.4 million, primarily driven by pricing increases, strong retention, and targeted new business expansion, partially offset by a $16.9 million increase in reinsurance reinstatement premiums driven by large property losses in our inland marine and commercial multiple peril lines.\nCommercial Lines underwriting profit for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $12.2 million, compared to underwriting loss of $123.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, a change of $135.4 million. Favorable development on prior years' loss reserves for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $9.4 million, compared to unfavorable development of $223.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, a favorable change of $232.4 million, primarily due to the aforementioned reserve charge following our 2016 fourth quarter reserve review. Catastrophe-related losses for the year ended December 31, 2017 were $170.6 million, compared to $70.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, an increase of $100.5 million. This increase is primarily due to hurricanes Harvey and Irma that occurred in the third quarter, the California wildfires that occurred in the fourth quarter, and a large Midwest hail event that occurred in the second quarter.\nCommercial Lines current accident year underwriting profit, excluding catastrophes, was $173.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $169.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. This $3.5 million improvement was primarily due to lower losses in our workers' compensation line, lower expenses and premium growth, partially offset by higher large losses and the increase in reinstatement premiums. The impact of additional reinstatement premiums, net of ceding commissions, decreased 2017 current accident year underwriting profit by $12.0 million from 2016 levels.\nPersonal Lines\nPersonal Lines net premiums written were $1,647.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $1,521.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, an increase of $125.9 million. This was primarily due to higher renewal premium driven by rate increases and improved retention, as well as new business growth.\nNet premiums written in the personal automobile line of business for the year ended December 31, 2017 were $1,041.6 million, compared to $953.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, an increase of $88.0 million. This increase was primarily due to rate increases and an increase in policies in force of 3.8%. Net premiums written in the homeowners line of business for the year ended December 31, 2017 were $566.9 million, compared to $529.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, an increase of $37.2 million. This is attributable to rate increases and an increase in policies in force of 4.0%.\nPersonal Lines underwriting profit for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $83.7 million, compared to $103.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, a decline of $19.4 million. Catastrophe losses for the year ended December 31, 2017 were $80.9 million, compared to $47.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, an increase of $33.9 million. This increase is primarily due to a large Midwest wind event that occurred in the first quarter of 2017. Unfavorable development on prior years' loss reserves for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $9.4 million, compared to $4.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, an increase of $5.1 million.\nPersonal Lines current accident year underwriting profit, excluding catastrophes, was $174.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $154.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. This $19.6 million increase was primarily a result of earned premium growth and lower expenses. Also, higher current accident year losses in our homeowners line were substantially offset by lower losses in our personal automobile line.\nOther\nOther operating losses were $8.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $19.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, an improvement of $10.7 million, primarily due to 2016 unfavorable prior year reserve development in our run-off voluntary pools business (See 2016 Loss and LAE Development, excluding catastrophes\u201d section below for further discussion).\nRESERVE FOR LOSSES AND LOSS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSES\nOverview of Loss Reserve Estimation Process\nWe maintain reserves for our property and casualty products to provide for our ultimate liability for losses and loss adjustment expenses (our loss reserves\u201d) with respect to reported and unreported claims incurred as of the end of each accounting period. These reserves are estimates, taking into account past loss experience, modified for current trends, as well as prevailing economic, legal and social conditions. Loss reserves represent our largest liability.\nManagement's process for establishing loss reserves is a comprehensive process that involves input from multiple functions throughout our organization, including actuarial, finance, claims, legal, underwriting, distribution and business operations management. The process incorporates facts currently known, as well as the current, and in some cases, the anticipated, state of the law and coverage litigation. Based on information currently available, we believe that the aggregate loss reserves at December 31, 2018 were adequate to cover claims for losses that had occurred as of that date, including both those known to us and those yet to be reported. However, as described below, there are significant uncertainties inherent in the loss reserving process. Our estimate of the ultimate liability for losses that had occurred as of December 31, 2018 is expected to change in future periods as we obtain further information, and such changes could have a material effect on our results of operations and financial position.\nOur loss reserves include case estimates for claims that have been reported and estimates for claims that have been incurred but not reported ( IBNR\u201d) at the balance sheet date. They also include estimates of the expenses associated with processing and settling all reported and unreported claims, less estimates of anticipated salvage and subrogation recoveries. Our property and casualty loss reserves are not discounted to present value.\nCase reserves are established by our claim personnel individually on a claim by claim basis and based on information specific to the occurrence and terms of the underlying policy. For some classes of business, average case reserves are used initially. Case reserves are periodically reviewed and modified based on new or additional information pertaining to the claim.\nOur ultimate IBNR reserves are estimated by management and our reserving actuaries on an aggregate basis for each line of business or coverage for loss and loss expense liabilities not reflected within the case reserves. The sum of the case reserves and the IBNR reserves represents our estimate of total unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses.\nWe regularly review our loss reserves using a variety of industry accepted analytical techniques. We update the loss reserves as historical loss experience develops, additional claims are reported and resolved and new information becomes available. Net changes in loss reserves are reflected in operating results in the period in which the reserves are changed.\nThe IBNR reserve includes a provision for claims that have occurred but have not yet been reported to us, some of which may not yet be known to the insured, as well as a provision for future development on reported claims. IBNR represents a significant proportion of our total net loss reserves, particularly for long-tail liability classes. In fact, approximately 48% of our aggregate net loss reserves at December 31, 2018 were for IBNR losses and loss expenses.\nCritical Judgments and Key Assumptions\nWe determine the amount of our loss reserves based on an estimation process that is complex and considers information from both company specific and industry data, as well as general economic and other information. The estimation process utilizes a combination of objective and subjective information, the blending of which requires significant professional judgment. There are various assumptions required, including future trends in frequency and severity of claims, operational changes in claim handling and case reserving practices, and trends related to general economic and social conditions. Informed judgments as to our ultimate exposure to losses are an integral component of our loss reserve estimation process.\nGiven the inherent complexity of our loss reserve estimation process and the potential variability of the assumptions used, the actual emergence of losses will vary, perhaps substantially, from the estimate of losses included in our financial statements, particularly in those instances where settlements or other claim resolutions do not occur until well into the future. Our net loss reserves at December 31, 2018 were $3.8 billion. Therefore, a relatively small percentage change in the estimate of net loss reserves would have a material effect on our results of operations.\nThere is greater inherent uncertainty in estimating insurance reserves for certain types of property and casualty insurance lines, particularly liability lines, where a longer period of time may elapse before a definitive determination of ultimate liability and losses may be made. In addition, the technological, judicial, regulatory and political climates involving these types of claims are continuously evolving. There is also greater uncertainty in establishing reserves with respect to business that is new to us, particularly new business which is generated with respect to newly introduced product lines, by newly appointed agents or in geographies in which we have less experience in conducting business. In such cases, there is less historical experience or knowledge and less data upon which we can rely. A combination of business that is both new to us and has longer development periods provides even greater uncertainty in estimating insurance reserves. In our management and professional liability lines, we are modestly increasing, and expect to continue to increase, our exposure to longer-tailed liability lines, including directors and officers liability, errors and omissions liability and product liability coverages. In addition, in recent periods we have experienced extensions of the tails\u201d in certain lines of business as the full value of claims are presented later than had been our historical experience.\nWe regularly update our reserve estimates as new information becomes available and additional events occur which may impact the resolution of unsettled claims. Reserve adjustments are reflected in the results of operations as adjustments to losses and LAE. Often, these adjustments are recognized in periods subsequent to the period in which the underlying policy was written and the loss event occurred. When these types of subsequent adjustments affect prior years, they are described separately as prior year reserve development\u201d. Such development can be either favorable or unfavorable to our financial results and may vary by line of business. As discussed below, estimated loss and LAE reserves for claims occurring in prior years, in the aggregate, developed unfavorably by $0.4 million, $1.2 million and $235.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively, although there was considerable variance by line of business. Additionally, our estimated loss and LAE reserves for catastrophe claims occurring in prior years developed favorably by $9.3 million, favorably by $1.4 million, and unfavorably by $2.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. There can be no assurance that current loss and LAE reserves will be sufficient.\nWe regularly review our reserving techniques, our overall reserving position and our reinsurance. Based on (i) our review of historical data, legislative enactments, judicial decisions, legal developments in impositions of damages and policy coverage, political attitudes and trends in general economic conditions, (ii) our review of per claim information, (iii) our historical loss experience and that of the industry, (iv) the nature of policies written by us, and (v) our internal estimates of required reserves, we believe that adequate provision has been made for loss reserves. However, establishment of appropriate reserves is an inherently uncertain process, and there can be no certainty that current established reserves will prove adequate in light of subsequent actual experience. A significant change to the estimated reserves could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position. An increase or decrease in reserve estimates would result in a corresponding decrease or increase in financial results. For example, each one percentage point change in the aggregate loss and LAE ratio resulting from a change in reserve estimation is currently projected to have an approximate $43 million impact on operating income, based on 2018 full year premiums.\nThe major causes of material uncertainty relating to ultimate losses and LAE ( risk factors\u201d) generally vary for each line of business, as well as for each separately analyzed component of the line of business. In some cases, such risk factors are explicit assumptions of the estimation method and in others, they are implicit. For example, a method may explicitly assume that a certain percentage of claims will close each year, but will implicitly assume that the legal interpretation of existing contract language will remain substantially unchanged. Actual results will likely vary from expectations for each of these assumptions, resulting in an ultimate claim liability that is different from that being estimated currently.\nSome risk factors affect multiple lines of business. Examples include changes in claim handling and claim reserving practices, changes in claim settlement patterns, regulatory and legislative actions, court actions, timeliness of claim reporting, state mix of claimants, and degree of claimant fraud. Additionally, there is also a higher degree of uncertainty due to growth in our newly acquired businesses, with respect to which we have less familiarity and, in some cases, limited historical claims experience. The extent of the impact of a risk factor will also vary by components within a line of business. Individual risk factors are subject to interactions with other risk factors within line of business components. Thus, risk factors can have offsetting or compounding effects on required reserves.\nInflation generally increases the cost of losses covered by insurance contracts. The effect of inflation varies by product. Our property and casualty insurance premiums are established before the amount of losses and LAE and the extent to which inflation may affect such expenses are known. Consequently, we attempt, in establishing rates and reserves, to anticipate the potential impact of inflation in the projection of ultimate costs. For example, we monitor and continue to experience increases in medical costs, wages and legal costs, which are key considerations in setting reserve assumptions for workers' compensation, bodily injury and other liability lines. We are also monitoring the continued advancements in technology and design found in automobiles and homes and the increased claims settlement costs that result from repairs or replacement of such equipment. Estimated increases are reflected in our current reserve estimates, but continued increases are expected to contribute to increased losses and LAE in the future.\nWe are also defendants in various litigation matters, including putative class actions, which may seek punitive damages, bad faith or extra-contractual damages, legal fees and interest, or claim a broader scope of policy coverage or settlement and payment obligations than our interpretation. Resolution of these cases are often highly unpredictable and could involve material unanticipated damage awards. We have experienced, and others in the industry have reported, increased attorney involvement in claims, delayed submissions of medical and other expense claims, and a trend toward higher valued settlements and litigation, all of which contribute to uncertainty regarding reserve estimates.\nLoss and LAE Reserves by Line of Business\nReserving Process Overview\nOur loss reserves include amounts related to short-tail and long-tail classes of business. Tail\u201d refers to the time period between the occurrence of a loss and the final settlement of the claim. The longer the time span between the incidence of a loss and the settlement of the claim (i.e., a longer tail), the more the ultimate settlement amount may likely vary from our original estimate.\nShort-tail classes consist principally of automobile physical damage, homeowners property, commercial property and marine business. For these property coverages, claims are generally reported and settled shortly after the loss occurs because the claims relate to tangible property and are more likely to be discovered shortly after the loss occurs. Consequently, the estimation of loss reserves for these classes is generally less complex.\nWhile we estimate that a majority of our written premium is in what we would characterize as shorter-tailed classes of business, most of our loss reserves relate to longer-tail liability classes of business. Long-tailed classes include commercial liability, automobile liability, workers' compensation and other types of third-party coverage. For many liability claims, significant periods of time, ranging up to several years or more, may elapse between the occurrence of the loss, the discovery and reporting of the loss to us and the settlement of the claim. As a result, loss experience in the more recent accident years for long-tailed liability coverage has limited statistical credibility because a relatively small proportion of losses in these accident years (the calendar years in which losses are incurred) are reported claims and an even smaller proportion are paid losses. Liability claims are also more susceptible to litigation and can be significantly affected by changing contract interpretations, the legal, political and social environment, the risk and expense of protracted litigation and inflation. Consequently, the estimation of loss reserves for these coverages is more complex and typically subject to a higher degree of variability and uncertainty compared to short-tailed coverages.\nMost of our indirect business from our run-off voluntary and ongoing involuntary pools is assumed long-tailed casualty reinsurance. Reserve estimates for this business are therefore subject to the variability caused by extended loss emergence periods. The estimation of loss reserves for this business is further complicated by delays between the time the claim is reported to the ceding insurer and when it is reported by the ceding insurer to the pool manager and then to us, and by our dependence on the quality and consistency of the loss reporting by the ceding company and actuarial estimates by the pool manager. These reserving factors also apply to our discontinued assumed accident and health reinsurance pools and arrangements that are included in our liabilities of discontinued life business (See Risk Factors\u201d in Part I - Item 1A for further discussion).\nA review of loss reserves for each of the classes of business which we write is conducted regularly, generally quarterly. This review process takes into consideration a variety of trends that impact the ultimate settlement of claims. Where appropriate, the review includes a review of overall payment patterns and the emergence of paid and reported losses relative to expectations.\nThe loss reserve estimation process relies on the basic assumption that past experience, adjusted for the effects of current developments and likely trends, is an appropriate basis for predicting future outcomes. As part of this process, we use a variety of analytical methods that consider experience, trends and other relevant factors. IBNR reserves are generally calculated by first projecting the ultimate cost of all claims that have been reported or expected to be reported in the future and then subtracting reported losses and loss expenses. Reported losses include cumulative paid losses and loss expenses plus case reserves. Within the loss reserving process, standard actuarial methods which include: (1) loss development factor methods; (2) expected loss methods (Bornheutter-Ferguson); and (3) adjusted loss methods (Berquist-Sherman), are given due consideration. These methods are described below:\n \u2022 Loss development factor methods generally assume that the losses yet to emerge for an accident year are proportional to the paid or reported loss amount observed to date. Historical patterns of the development of paid and reported losses by \n accident year can be predictive of the expected future patterns that are applied to current paid and reported losses to generate estimated ultimate losses by accident year. \n \u2022 Bornheutter-Ferguson methods utilize the product of the expected ultimate losses times the proportion of ultimate losses estimated to be unreported or unpaid to calculate IBNR. The expected ultimate losses are based upon current estimates of ultimate losses from prior accident years, adjusted to reflect expected earned premium, current rating, claims cost levels and changes in business mix. The expected losses, and corresponding loss ratios, are a critical component of Bornheutter-Ferguson methodologies and provide a general reasonability guide. \n \u2022 Berquist-Sherman methods are used for estimating"}
