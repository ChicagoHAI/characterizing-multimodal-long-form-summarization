Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with Item 1. Business,\u201d Item 1A. Risk Factors,\u201d and the consolidated financial statements, and the notes thereto, included in \"Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nThe information covered in this section provides a comparison of material changes in the Company's results of operations and financial condition for fiscal year 2020 and fiscal year 2019. For the comparison of fiscal year 2019 and fiscal year 2018, see \"Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019, filed with the SEC on February 27, 2020.\nExecutive Overview\nNet income attributable to Equitrans Midstream common shareholders was $364.4 million in 2020 compared with a net loss attributable to Equitrans Midstream common shareholders of $203.7 million in 2019. The increase resulted primarily from a decrease in impairment charges associated with long-lived assets on Gathering (as discussed in Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements), higher equity income from the Company's investment in the MVP Joint Venture, increased revenue from firm reservation fees primarily on Water and Gathering and unrealized gains on derivative instruments associated with the Henry Hub cash bonus payment provision, partially offset by lower volumetric-based fee revenues primarily due to the impacts of the EQT Global GGA, higher net income attributable to noncontrolling interests, higher income tax expense, preferred dividends associated with the Equitrans Midstream Preferred Shares, higher net interest expense, higher depreciation expense, higher selling, general and administrative expense and a loss on early extinguishment of debt.\nCOVID-19 Update\nThe ongoing COVID-19 outbreak has resulted in a severe global economic downturn and a recession of unknown duration and has caused increased volatility in and intermittent disruptions to the global financial and credit markets. The outbreak has directly resulted in a significant decrease in demand for oil and NGLs, at least in the short term, which caused extreme volatility in oil and other liquids prices and a significant negative impact to, at a minimum, the short- and medium-term outlook for oil prices. The downward pressure on oil prices was further exacerbated by the failure, in March 2020, of Saudi Arabia and Russia to agree to cut oil production, which contributed to a sharp drop in the price of oil (and at one point negative prices for oil) and an imbalance between the supply and demand for oil. The revised outlook for oil and other liquids prices caused a significant reduction in the number of operating drilling rigs in the United States, with a substantial portion of this reduction in rigs accounted for in shale plays targeted primarily at developing oil resources, including the Permian Basin. According to Baker Hughes, the average U.S. rig count fell to approximately 367 during January 2021, compared to an average rig count of approximately 791 during January 2020. This dramatic decrease in the number of operating drilling rigs has positively impacted the natural gas forward price strip based on the market expectation that the reduced or curtailed production of associated gas from basins such as the Permian Basin will at least in the near- and medium-term cause a reduction in the overall supply of natural gas which will more than offset reduced demand for natural gas as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak. See Commodity Prices\u201d under Outlook\u201d below for a further discussion of the current commodity price environment for the Company and its producer customers.\nFuture disruptions to the global financial and credit markets from the COVID-19 outbreak and related economic impacts could, both directly and indirectly, negatively impact the Company's financial condition and results of operations. The Company closed EQM's offerings of the 2021 Senior Notes (defined in Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements) and the 2020 Senior Notes (defined in Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements) in January 2021 and June 2020, respectively; however, there can be no guarantee that future disruptions to the financial and credit markets as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak and related economic impacts would not affect the Company's ability to again access such markets, if needed, on acceptable terms or at all. Further, certain of the Company's producer customers have significant capital needs, primarily to refinance existing indebtedness that matures during the next several years, and further disruptions or instability in financial and credit markets as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak and the economic disruptions therefrom may have a significant, negative impact on such producers' abilities to access the financial and credit markets and refinance existing indebtedness as it becomes due. If such producer customers have difficulty refinancing such indebtedness on acceptable terms or at all (or undertaking other transactions to generate cash for debt service), the Company's exposure to risk of nonpayment and/or nonperformance by its customers would increase. Additionally, the ability of the Company's producer customers to maintain or grow their production would likely be adversely affected as a result of such refinancing challenges, which would have a negative impact on demand for the Company's current services as well as the prospect of future pipeline expansion projects that would enhance the Company's business.\nFrom an operational perspective, while the COVID-19 outbreak has significantly impacted the manner in which the Company's employees and contractors perform their job functions, the outbreak has had, and continues to have, a minimal impact on the Company's overall operations. However, the situation surrounding COVID-19 remains fluid, and the Company continues to actively manage its response in collaboration with relevant parties, including its employees, contractors, customers and suppliers. As a midstream energy company, during applicable state-issued stay-at-home orders, the Company has been recognized as an essential business under various regulations related to the COVID-19 outbreak and continued to operate as permitted under these regulations. The Company has proactively undertaken a number of companywide measures intended to promote the safety of field and office-based employees and contractors. These measures include, among other things, establishing an Infectious Disease Response Team, instituting enhanced self-protection and office sanitation measures, eliminating non-essential business travel, implementing a mandatory work-from-home protocol for a substantial majority of the Company's employees through at least June 1, 2021, instituting face covering protocols, providing certain medical benefit enhancements, practicing social distancing in the field where possible, sharing the Company's infectious disease response plan with suppliers and contractors, and timely communicating updates to employees and other relevant parties. In addition, the Company has implemented additional mitigation efforts in connection with the remobilization of certain field employees and contractors. The Company's Infectious Disease Response Team continues to monitor and assist in implementing mitigation efforts in respect of potential areas of risk for the Company and its stakeholders. Additionally, the Company has provided support to local communities through corporate giving and the Equitrans Midstream Foundation. The Company's operations have been able to maintain a consistent level of effectiveness through the measures taken. The Company believes that it is following best practices under COVID-19 guidance and intends to continue to refine its practices as additional guidance is released and assess potential impacts from COVID-19 to its financial position and operating results, as well as any regulatory and legislative activities relating to COVID-19 that could impact its business.\nThe Company is unable to predict, in light of the ongoing and dynamic nature of the circumstances related to COVID-19 and the continued growth in COVID-19 infections in the United States (including in certain of the Company's areas of operation) and globally, any additional impact the outbreak may have on the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition. The extent of COVID-19's impact on the Company will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with any reasonable degree of certainty, including new information that may emerge concerning the severity of COVID-19, the duration of the outbreak, spikes in infection rates (including in the Company's areas of operation) and related economic effects and after effects (including on the natural gas industry), and actions taken to contain COVID-19 or its impact, including vaccine acceptance, distribution and effectiveness, among others. For further information regarding the potential impact of COVID-19, see \"The outbreak of COVID-19 (or any future pandemic), and related declines in economic output and demand for natural gas, could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.\" under \"Item 1A. Risk Factors.\"\nBusiness Segment Results\nOperating segments are revenue-producing components of an enterprise for which separate financial information is produced internally and is subject to evaluation by the chief operating decision maker in deciding how to allocate resources. Headquarters costs consist primarily of transaction costs and other unallocated corporate expenses. Net interest expense, components of other income and income tax expense are managed on a consolidated basis. The Company has presented each segment's operating income (loss), unrealized gain on derivative instruments, equity income and various operational measures in the following sections. Management believes that the presentation of this information is useful to management and investors regarding the financial condition, results of operations and trends of its segments. The Company has reconciled each segment's operating income (loss) to the Company's consolidated operating income (loss) and net income (loss) in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements.\nGATHERING RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Table 13: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>

provision. See \"Other Income Statement Items\" below for further information.\n(c)Includes volumes under agreements structured with MVCs.\n(d)Includes approximately $41.6 million and $25.9 million of capital expenditures related to noncontrolling interests in Eureka Midstream for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nYear Ended December 31, 2020 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2019\nGathering operating revenues decreased by $147.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. Firm reservation fee revenues increased by $14.6 million primarily due to a $196.6 million increase in MVC billed revenues primarily under the EQT Global GGA and a full year of MVC revenues generated by the operating entities acquired in the Bolt-on Acquisition, which closed in April 2019, partly offset by $225.7 million of deferred revenue in 2020 under the EQT Global GGA. Volumetric-based fee revenues decreased by $162.3 million primarily due to increased MVC revenues attributable to volumes that previously were subject to volumetric-based fees prior to the EQT Global GGA.\nGathering operating expenses decreased by $772.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily as a result of a $798.7 million decrease in impairment charges (as discussed in Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements), a $15.2 million decrease in separation and other transaction costs primarily given acquisition-related costs associated with the Bolt-on Acquisition and a $9.4 million decrease in operating and maintenance expense primarily associated with a decrease in repairs and maintenance expense, partially offset by an increase in non-income tax reserves. The decrease in such operating expenses was partly offset by a $28.7 million increase in depreciation expense as a result of additional assets placed in-service, including a full year of depreciation on assets acquired in the Bolt-on Acquisition, and a $9.9 million increase in amortization of intangible assets as a result of intangible assets acquired in the Bolt-on Acquisition and a corresponding adjustment to the useful lives of these intangibles (as discussed in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements). Selling, general and administrative expense increased by $12.2 million primarily due to higher personnel costs.\nSee \"Outlook\" and Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the impairment of long-lived assets. See also Outlook\u201d for discussions of certain customer production curtailments during the second and third quarters of 2020 and Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for discussions of the EQT Global GGA and the transactions related thereto, including the potential cash fee relief to EQT in connection with a further delay in the targeted MVP in-service date. The Company expects that the revenues resulting from the MVCs under the EQT Global GGA will increase the proportion of the Company's total operating revenues that are firm reservation fee revenues, and correspondingly decrease the portion of the Company's total operating revenues that are volumetric-based fee revenues, in future periods. Firm reservation fee revenues under the Company's Hammerhead gathering agreement with EQT (which is subject to a pending dispute with EQT) are also expected to contribute to an increase in the Company's firm reservation fee revenues. See also Outlook\u201d for discussions of the Hammerhead dispute with EQT and the Gulfport bankruptcy.\nTRANSMISSION RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Table 14: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

Effective January 2021, the MVP Joint Venture temporarily suspended AFUDC accruals until growth construction activities resume. Depending on the timing for when growth construction may resume, the Company's equity income could be negatively impacted in future periods, and such impact could be substantial.\nWATER RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Table 15: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Years Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>%\nChange </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td>%\nChange </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>FINANCIAL DATA </td> <td>(Thousands) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Firm reservation fee revenues </td> <td>$ </td> <td>41,798 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>11,190 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>273.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Volumetric-based fee revenues </td> <td>62,910 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>68,601 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(8.3) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>111,227 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(38.3) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total operating revenues </td> <td>104,708 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>79,791 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>31.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>111,227 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(28.3) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating expenses: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating and maintenance </td> <td>29,131 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>34,638 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(15.9) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>44,152 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(21.5) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling, general and administrative </td> <td>5,941 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,933 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>102.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,895 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(50.2) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation </td> <td>30,880 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>26,915 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>23,513 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14.5 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total operating expenses </td> <td>65,952 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>64,486 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>73,560 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(12.3) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income </td> <td>$ </td> <td>38,756 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>15,305 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>153.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>37,667 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(59.4) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>OPERATIONAL DATA </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Water services volumes (MMgal) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Firm capacity reservation(a)\n</td> <td>697 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>249 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>179.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Volumetric-based services </td> <td>1,219 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,559 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(21.8) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,088 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(25.3) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total water volumes </td> <td>1,916 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,808 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,088 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(13.4) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capital expenditures </td> <td>$ </td> <td>11,905 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>37,457 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(68.2) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>23,537 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>59.1 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(a) Includes volumes under agreements structured with MVCs.\nYear Ended December 31, 2020 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2019\nWater operating revenues increased by $24.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. Firm reservation fee revenues increased by $30.6 million primarily as a result of increased revenues generated under agreements with MVCs. Volumetric-based fee revenues decreased $5.7 million primarily due to higher reservation fee revenues under agreements with MVCs and a decrease in customer hydraulic fracturing activity, partly offset by increased realized rates on a per gallon basis.\nWater operating expenses increased by $1.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily as a result of higher selling, general and administrative expense primarily due to increased bad debt expense associated with Gulfport's announced bankruptcy proceedings and higher personnel costs. Depreciation expense increased as a result of additional assets placed in-service. These increases were partly offset by lower operating and maintenance expense associated with the timing of costs related to customer activities on drilling pads.\nThe Company's water services are directly associated with producers' well completion activities and fresh and produced water needs (which are partially driven by horizontal lateral lengths and the number of completion stages per well). Therefore, the Water operating results traditionally fluctuate from year-to-year in response to producers' well completion activities. The Company expects Water operating income to be lower for the year ending December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020 primarily due to lower MVCs and an expected decrease in customer activity.\nOther Income Statement Items\nOther Income\nOther income increased $14.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily as a result of a $16.5 million unrealized gain on derivative instruments associated with the Henry Hub cash bonus payment provision entered into in the first quarter of 2020 and a $2.5 million increase in the net settlement of incentive compensation, partially offset by a $4.3 million decrease in AFUDC - equity.\nLoss on Early Extinguishment of Debt\nThe Company incurred a loss on the early extinguishment of debt of $24.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2020 related to the write off of unamortized discounts and financing costs on the ETRN Term Loan Credit Agreement (defined in Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements) and the Equitrans Midstream Credit Facility (defined in Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements) in the first quarter of 2020. See Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements.\nNet Interest Expense\nNet interest expense increased by $51.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily due to $56.1 million in higher interest expense associated with the 2020 Senior Notes, $22.1 million in higher interest expense on the EQM Term Loans (defined in Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements) and decreased capitalized interest and AFUDC - debt of $12.1 million, partially offset by lower interest expense of $39.8 million on the ETRN Term Loans as a result of their termination in March 2020.\nAfter accounting for the issuance of the 2020 and 2021 Senior Notes and use of those proceeds to pay off other outstanding debt, the Company expects interest expense to increase in future periods.\nSee also Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of certain of the Company's outstanding debt.\nSee Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements for discussion of the 2021 Senior Notes, prepayment and termination of the Amended 2019 EQM Term Loan Agreement and the Tender Offers.\nIncome Taxes\nSee Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements for an explanation of the increase in income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019.\nThe Company files a consolidated income tax return for federal income taxes and uses the asset and liability method to account for income taxes. EQM is, and for the period prior to the EQGP Buyout, EQGP was, a limited partnership for U.S. federal and state income tax purposes. Eureka Midstream is a limited liability company for such purposes. EQM, EQGP, and Eureka Midstream are not subject to U.S. federal or state income taxes.\nAll of Eureka Midstream's income is, for the period prior to the closing of the EQM Merger, all of EQM's income was, and for the period prior to the EQGP Buyout, all of EQGP's income was included in the Company's pre-tax income; however, the Company does not record income tax expense on the portions of its income attributable to the noncontrolling member of Eureka Midstream and did not record income tax expense on the portions of its income attributable to the noncontrolling limited partners of EQM and EQGP for the periods prior to the closings of the EQM Merger and the EQGP Buyout, respectively. This reduces the Company's effective tax rate in periods when the Company has consolidated pre-tax income. The Company expects its effective tax rate for periods following the EQM Merger to generally be higher than the pre-EQM Merger periods due to the decrease in net income attributable to noncontrolling interests as a result of the Company's acquisition of the outstanding EQM common units not held by the Company and its subsidiaries and related Restructuring in connection with the closing of the EQM Merger.\nNet Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests\nNet income attributable to noncontrolling interests increased for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily as a result of higher net income attributable to the noncontrolling interests in EQM and Eureka Midstream, partly offset by lower net income allocated to the EQM Series A Preferred Units prior to the closing of the Restructuring.\nThe Company recorded net income attributable to noncontrolling interest for the third-party ownership interests in EQM (including the EQM Series A Preferred Units) through the closing of the EQM Merger. Upon the closing of the EQM Merger on June 17, 2020, the Company's remaining noncontrolling interest consists solely of the third-party ownership interest in Eureka Midstream.\nCapital Expenditures\nSee \"Investing Activities\" and \"Capital Requirements\" under \"Capital Resources and Liquidity\" for discussion of capital expenditures and capital contributions.\nOutlook\nThe Company's strategically-located assets overlay core acreage in the Appalachian Basin. The location of the Company's assets allows its producer customers to access major demand markets in the U.S. The Company is one of the largest natural gas gatherers in the U.S., and its largest customer, EQT, was the largest natural gas producer in the U.S. based on average daily sales volumes as of December 31, 2020. The Company maintains a stable cash flow profile, with approximately 66% of its revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020 generated by firm reservation fees. Further, the percentage of the Company's revenues that are generated by firm reservation fees is expected to increase in future years as a result of the 15-year term EQT Global GGA, which includes an MVC that became effective on April 1, 2020 of 3.0 Bcf per day and gradually steps up to 4.0 Bcf per day for several years following the full in-service date of the MVP project. This contract structure enhances the stability of the Company's cash flows and limits its direct exposure to commodity price risk.\nThe Company's principal strategy is to achieve greater scale and scope and enhance the durability if its financial strength, which the Company expects will drive future growth and investment. The Company is implementing its strategy by leveraging its existing assets, executing on its growth projects (including through potential expansion and extension opportunities), focusing on ESG initiatives, and, where appropriate, seeking and executing on strategically-aligned acquisition and joint venture opportunities and other strategic transactions, while strengthening its balance sheet through:\n\u2022highly predictable cash flows backed by firm reservation fees;\n\u2022actions to de-lever its balance sheet;\n\u2022disciplined capital spending;\n\u2022operating cost control; and\n\u2022an appropriate dividend policy.\nAs part of its approach to organic growth, the Company is focused on its projects and assets outlined under \"Strategy\" in \"Item 1. Business,\" many of which are supported by contracts with firm capacity or MVC commitments. The Company believes that this approach will enable the Company to achieve its strategic goals.\nThe Company expects that the MVP project, together with the Hammerhead pipeline and EEP, will primarily drive the Company's organic growth and that its future growth also will be supported by the MVP Southgate project and water services business.\nEQT Global GGA. On February 27, 2020, the Company announced the EQT Global GGA, which is a 15-year contract that includes, among other things, a 3.0 Bcf per day MVC (which gradually steps up to 4.0 Bcf per day for several years following the in-service date of the MVP project) and the dedication of a substantial majority of EQT's core acreage in Pennsylvania and West Virginia to the Company. Under the EQT Global GGA, EQT will receive certain gathering fee relief over a period of three years following the in-service date of the MVP (as further described in Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements). The EQT Global GGA replaced 14 previous gathering agreements between EQT and the Company.\nUnder the EQT Global GGA, the performance obligation is to provide daily MVC capacity and as such the total consideration is allocated proportionally to the daily MVC over the life of the contract. In periods that the gathering MVC revenue billed will exceed the allocated consideration, the excess will be deferred to the contract liability and recognized in revenue when the performance obligation has been satisfied. Assuming a full in-service date in late 2021 for the MVP, the deferral to the contract liability is expected to increase by approximately $295 million and $6 million during 2021 and 2022, respectively. While the 3.0 Bcf per day MVC capacity became effective on April 1, 2020, additional daily MVC capacity and the associated gathering MVC fees payable by EQT to the Company as set forth in the EQT Global GGA are conditioned upon the in-service date of the MVP. There are ongoing legal and regulatory matters that must be resolved favorably before the MVP project can be completed which could have a material effect on the performance obligation and the allocation of the total consideration over the life of the contract and the gathering MVC fees payable by EQT under the contract.\nBased on the Henry Hub natural gas forward strip prices as of February 19, 2021 and the terms of the Henry Hub cash bonus payment provision, any delays in the in-service date for the MVP project, including beyond the most recent targeted full in-service of late 2021, would decrease the estimated fair value of the derivative asset attributable to the Henry Hub cash bonus payment provision, and such decrease may be substantial. Such changes in estimated fair value, if any, would be recognized in other income on the Company's statements of consolidated comprehensive income.\nFor a discussion of the Company's commercial relationship with EQT and related considerations, including risks associated with this relationship, see \"Item 1A. Risk Factors.\" See also Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for additional\ninformation regarding the EQT Global GGA and the transactions related thereto. For further discussion on litigation and regulatory challenges affecting the completion of the MVP project, see \"Strategy\" under \"Developments, Market Trends and Competitive Conditions\" in \"Item 1. Business\" and \"Item 3. Legal Proceedings.\"\nHammerhead Pipeline. On September 23, 2020, EQT and certain affiliates of EQT instituted arbitration proceedings against the Company by filing a Demand for Arbitration with the American Arbitration Association. The arbitration arises out of the Hammerhead gathering agreement, pursuant to which the Company agreed to construct the Hammerhead pipeline and gather gas for EQT. EQT sought a declaratory judgment that it may exercise an early termination right and purchase the Hammerhead pipeline and related facilities under the terms of the Hammerhead gathering agreement. With its Demand for Arbitration, EQT also sought emergency relief, asking that an emergency arbitrator: (i) resolve the parties' dispute on the merits by October 1, 2020; or (ii) alternatively, toll the contractual deadline for EQT's exercise of its termination right, which was set to expire on October 11, 2020, until after the parties' dispute was resolved. On October 6, 2020, the emergency arbitrator issued an order denying EQT's request for emergency resolution on the merits but tolling the early termination deadline until the arbitration has been resolved. The Company's answer to the Notice of Arbitration was filed on October 8, 2020, and the parties are currently engaged in arbitration. The Company will vigorously defend against EQT's claims and litigate its rights, including the assertion of appropriate counterclaims.\nGulfport Bankruptcy. On November 13, 2020, Gulfport commenced bankruptcy proceedings. On November 24, 2020, Gulfport moved to reject its gas gathering agreements with the Company and made certain related court filings, which motions the Company has opposed. The Company and Gulfport have entered into negotiations related to the contracts. For the year ended December 31, 2020, Gulfport accounted for approximately 9% of the Company's operating revenues.\nCommodity Prices. The Company's business is dependent on continued natural gas production and the availability and development of reserves in its areas of operation. Low prices for natural gas and NGLs have adversely affected development of additional reserves and production that is accessible by the Company's pipeline and storage assets, which also negatively affects the Company's water services business. See COVID-19 Update\u201d under Executive Overview\u201d above for a discussion of the impact the COVID-19 outbreak has had on oil, NGLs and natural gas prices, and the positive impact lower oil prices are perceived to have on natural gas prices in the near- and medium-term, primarily as a result of corresponding declines in the production of associated gas in the United States which the market expects will more than offset reduced demand for natural gas as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak.\nHenry Hub spot and local spot natural gas prices, which were under pressure prior to the COVID-19 outbreak due primarily to a warmer than normal 2019 - 2020 winter heating season, a temperate spring 2020 season and an oversupply of natural gas (caused in part by the significant increase in production of associated gas from the Permian Basin and similar basins in recent years), were further pressured by a reduction in global demand for natural gas during 2020 (for which the COVID-19 outbreak was a contributing factor), lack of available natural gas storage and the continued significant supplies of natural gas being produced, particularly from the Appalachian Basin. The Henry Hub natural gas price ranged from $1.33 per MMbtu to $3.03 per MMbtu between January 1, 2020 and December 31, 2020, with some prices reflecting the lowest natural gas prices in more than 20 years. Further, market prices for natural gas in the Appalachian Basin continue to be lower than Henry Hub natural gas prices and were significantly lower during portions of 2020. Natural gas prices have improved since the spring of 2020 and are expected to further improve during 2021, as reflected by the natural gas forward price strip as of February 19, 2021, primarily due to demand, such as in the winter months, for natural gas potentially exceeding available supply (as a result of, in part, the decrease in associated gas production from the Permian Basin given the dramatic decrease in oil production caused by historical low oil prices during the first half of 2020). However, the length and extent of that price recovery (if any) and its effect on the development plans of the Company's customers, which impact both the Company's ability to execute new commercial agreements with its customers as well as the volumetric-based fee revenues the Company earns under existing contracts, will be impacted by global demand for natural gas, the length and severity of the 2020-2021 winter heating season, rates of natural gas production (including amounts of associated gas from the Permian Basin, which certain analysts are projecting will increase in 2021 and later years), and the length and severity of the COVID-19 outbreak. There is no assurance that the elevated natural gas prices indicated by the current forward natural gas price strip will be realized or be realized for any particular length of time, or that producers will increase production volume as a result of any particular price level.\nLower natural gas prices have caused certain producers, including customers of the Company, to determine to reduce their rig count (and thereby delay production), temporarily shut in portions of their production or otherwise take actions to slow production growth and/or reduce production, which when effected by the Company's producer customers reduces the demand for, and usage of, the Company's services. For instance, in May 2020 and September 2020, EQT publicly disclosed that it had made the strategic decision to temporarily curtail significant portions of its production, and certain other Company customers also curtailed portions of their production during the second and/or third quarters of 2020. The temporary production curtailments in 2020 resulted in a decrease in the Company's volumetric-based fee revenues for portions of 2020, and an extended period of low natural gas prices and/or a slow recovery of natural gas prices in 2021 could cause EQT or other\nproducers to take similar actions in the future, which could have a significant negative effect on the demand for the Company's services and therefore its results of operation.\nCertain of the Company's customers reduced their capital spending forecasts in 2020 as compared to 2019 capital expenditures and 2021. For example, EQT's 2020 capital expenditures were approximately $694 million, or 39%, lower than EQT's 2019 capital expenditures. Although EQT announced a modest increase in its 2021 capital expenditure forecast compared to EQT's 2020 actual capital expenditures, EQT's 2021 sales volume forecast is approximately flat relative to its pro-forma 2020 sales volume (adjusted for the Chevron Acquisition). Price declines and sustained periods of low natural gas and NGL prices could continue to have an adverse effect on the creditworthiness of the Company's customers and related ability to pay firm reservation fees under long-term contracts and/or affect activity levels and, accordingly, volumetric-based fees, which could affect the Company's results of operations, liquidity or financial position. Each of S&P, Moody's and Fitch took negative ratings actions on a number of Appalachian exploration and production companies during 2020, including EQT, Range Resources and Gulfport, citing, among other things, lower natural gas price assumptions and current and future financing needs (although all three ratings agencies have since taken positive action on EQT citing, among other things, subsequent debt reduction and improvements in natural gas fundamentals). On November 13, 2020, Gulfport filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, as further described above under \"Gulfport Bankruptcy.\" Many of the Company's customers, including EQT, have entered into long-term firm reservation transmission and gathering contracts or contracts with MVCs on the Company's systems. However, approximately 34% of the Company's operating revenues for 2020 were volumetric-based fee revenues. For more information, see \"Decreases in production of natural gas in our areas of operation have adversely affected, and future decreases could further adversely affect, our business and operating results and reduce our cash available to pay cash dividends to our shareholders.\" included in \"Item 1A. Risk Factors.\"\nPotential Future Impairments. During the first quarter of 2020, the Company recognized an impairment of long-lived assets of approximately $55.6 million, including $37.9 million related to certain Hornet Midstream-related gathering assets and $17.7 million related to certain Hornet Midstream-related intangible assets associated with the Eureka/Hornet reporting unit (as such terms are defined in Note 4 to the consolidated Financial Statements). See Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.\nThe accounting estimates related to impairments are susceptible to change, including estimating fair value which requires considerable judgment. For goodwill, management's estimate of a reporting unit's future financial results is sensitive to changes in assumptions, such as changes in stock prices, weighted-average cost of capital, terminal growth rates and industry multiples. Similarly, cash flow estimates utilized for purposes of evaluating long-lived assets and equity method investments (such as in the MVP Joint Venture) require us to make projections and assumptions for many years into the future for pricing, demand, competition, operating cost, commencement of operations, resolution of relevant legal and regulatory matters, and other factors. The Company evaluates long-lived assets and equity method investments for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate, in management's judgment, that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable (meaning, in the case of equity method investments, that such investments have suffered other-than-temporary declines in value under ASC 323). For the Company's equity investment in the MVP Joint Venture, management must evaluate the Company's investment for other-than-temporary declines in fair value under ASC 323. The Company believes the estimates and assumptions used in estimating its reporting units', long-lived assets' and its equity investment's fair values as of December 31, 2020 are reasonable and appropriate; however, assumptions and estimates are inherently subject to significant business, economic, competitive, regulatory, judicial and other risks that could materially affect the calculated fair values and the resulting conclusions regarding impairments, which could materially affect the Company's results of operations and financial position. Additionally, actual results could differ from these estimates and assumptions may not be realized. The Company also continues to evaluate and monitor the ongoing legal and regulatory matters related to the MVP and MVP Southgate projects that affect project completion, as further described in Item 3. Legal Proceedings.\u201d Adverse or delayed developments with respect to such matters or other adverse developments could require that the Company modify assumptions reflected in the probability-weighted scenarios of discounted future net cash flows (including with respect to the probability of success) utilized to estimate fair value of its equity investment in the MVP Joint Venture, which could result in an other-than-temporary impairment of that investment. See also Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements, Reviews of our goodwill, intangible and other long-lived assets have resulted in significant impairment charges and reviews of our goodwill, intangible and other long-lived assets could result in future significant impairment charges, including with respect to our investment in the MVP Joint Venture.\u201d included in Item 1A. Risk Factors,\" and the Company's discussion of \"Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates\" included in \"Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation.\"\nAs of the filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the Company cannot predict the likelihood or magnitude of any future impairment. However, the Company's closing stock price decreased by approximately 17% between January 15, 2021 and January 20, 2021. If the Company's stock price does not recover before the end of the first quarter of 2021, such change in the Company's market value during the first quarter may trigger a quantitative assessment for impairment for the first quarter of\n2021, which may result in the Company realizing impairments the magnitude of which the Company is unable to estimate as of the filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nFor a discussion of capital expenditures, see \"Capital Requirements\" below.\nCapital Resources and Liquidity\nThe Company's liquidity requirements are to finance its operations, its capital expenditures, potential acquisitions and other strategic transactions and capital contributions to joint ventures, including the MVP Joint Venture, to pay cash dividends and to satisfy any indebtedness obligations. The Company's ability to meet these liquidity requirements depends on the Company's cash flow from operations, the continued ability of the Company to borrow under its credit facilities and the Company's ability to raise capital in banking, capital and other markets (including refinancing existing credit facilities as they mature). Cash flow and capital raising activities (including the ability in refinancings to obtain similar terms to those currently present in existing credit facilities) may be affected by prevailing economic conditions in the natural gas industry and other financial and business factors (including market forces causing shifts in investor sentiment and credit allocations to industries and companies perceived as having better growth opportunities and/or stronger ESG metrics and practices, as well as the COVID-19 outbreak), some of which are beyond the Company's control. The Company's available sources of liquidity include cash from operations, cash on hand, borrowings under its subsidiaries' revolving credit facilities, issuances of additional debt and issuances of additional equity securities. As of December 31, 2020, pursuant to the terms of the Amended EQM Credit Facility and Amended 2019 EQM Term Loan Agreement, the Company would have been able to borrow approximately $2.0 billion under the Amended EQM Credit Facility. The amount the Company is able to borrow under the Amended EQM Credit Facility is bounded by a maximum consolidated leverage ratio specified in the Amended EQM Credit Facility, which ratio varies over the course of the term of the Amended EQM Credit Facility from not more than 5.75 to 1.00 to not more than 5.00 to 1.00 tested as of the end of each fiscal quarter. The Company's consolidated leverage ratio is derived from a number of components, including the amount of projected Consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the Amended EQM Credit Facility) from certain approved projects, including the MVP project, that is available to be included in the consolidated leverage ratio calculation under the Amended EQM Credit Facility. If the targeted in-service date for the MVP project is further delayed, such delay could result in a decrease in the amount of projected Consolidated EBITDA for future quarters, which, absent other actions which may be available to the Company to reduce its then-leverage, may further limit the Company's availability to borrow under the Amended EQM Credit Facility. See also Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements.\nSee Security Ratings\u201d below for a discussion of the downgrades of EQM's credit ratings during 2020. The non-investment grade ratings from Moody's, S&P and Fitch have caused the Company to incur higher borrowing costs under the Amended EQM Credit Facility and, prior to its termination, the Amended 2019 EQM Term Loan Agreement. As a result of the February 2020 downgrades (discussed below), EQM was also obligated to deliver additional credit support to the MVP Joint Venture in the form of letters of credit, which, in the case of the MVP project (based on the midpoint of the targeted cost for the project), is in the amount of approximately $231.2 million and is, in the case of the MVP Southgate, $14.2 million, in each case as of the filing date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Additionally, pursuant to the EQT Global GGA, if EQM does not maintain minimum credit ratings from two of three credit rating agencies of at least Ba3 with respect to Moody's and BB- with respect to S&P and Fitch, EQM will be obligated to provide additional credit support in an amount equal to approximately $196 million to EQT in support of the potential payment obligation related to the EQT Cash Option (the Cash Option Letter of Credit). See \"A further downgrade of EQM's credit ratings, including in connection with the MVP project or customer credit ratings changes, including EQT's, which are determined by independent third parties, could impact our liquidity, access to capital, and costs of doing business.\" included in \"Item 1A. Risk Factors.\"\nOperating Activities\nNet cash flows provided by operating activities were $1,140.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $976.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase was primarily driven by the timing of working capital receipts and payments, and a full year of cash flows generated by assets acquired in the Bolt-on Acquisition.\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash flows used in investing activities were $729.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $2,574.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease was attributable to cash used for the Bolt-on Acquisition in 2019, a $501.8 million decrease in capital contributions to the MVP Joint Venture in 2020 consistent with a lower level of construction activities for the MVP project and decreased capital expenditures. Capital expenditures decreased by approximately $505.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily due to decreased spending on the Hammerhead pipeline and various wellhead gathering projects, partly offset by increased spending on the Eureka Midstream gathering system in 2020 compared to 2019, which was acquired by the Company in April 2019.\nSee Capital Requirements\u201d below for a discussion of forecasted 2021 capital expenditures and capital contributions to the MVP Joint Venture.\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash flows used in financing activities were $291.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to net cash flows provided by financing activities of $1,392.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the primary source of financing cash flows was net proceeds from the 2020 Senior Notes issuance, while the primary uses of financing cash flows were the redemption of the EQM Series A Preferred Units, payment to retire the ETRN Term Loans, the payments of dividends and distributions to shareholders and unitholders and net payments of borrowings on the Amended EQM Credit Facility. The net proceeds from the 2020 Senior Notes were primarily used to repay borrowings on the Amended EQM Credit Facility. For the year ended December 31, 2019, the primary sources of financing cash flows were borrowings on the Company's and EQM's credit facilities, proceeds from the issuance of the term loans under the 2019 EQM Term Loan Agreement (defined in Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements), which were used primarily to pay down borrowings under the EQM Credit Facility, and the net proceeds from the issuance of the EQM Series A Preferred Units, which were used in part to fund the purchase price of the Bolt-on Acquisition and to pay certain fees and expenses related to the Bolt-on Acquisition, while the primary uses of financing cash flows were payments on the Company's and EQM's credit facility borrowings, the payment of dividends, the payments of distributions to noncontrolling interest unitholders, the Company's purchase of EQGP common units and the payment of distributions to holders of EQM Series A Preferred Units.\nSee Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements for discussion of the 2021 Senior Notes, the prepayment and termination of the Amended 2019 EQM Term Loan Agreement and the Tender Offers.\nCapital Requirements\nThe gathering, transmission and storage and water service businesses are capital intensive, requiring significant investment to develop new facilities and to maintain and upgrade existing operations.\nIn 2021, the Company expects to make capital contributions to the MVP Joint Venture of $670 million to $720 million depending on the timing of the construction of the MVP project and approximately $20 million for the MVP Southgate project. Capital expenditures for 2021 are expected to be approximately $370 million to $420 million (including approximately $20 million attributable to the noncontrolling interests in Eureka Midstream). The Company's future capital investments may vary significantly from period to period based on the available investment opportunities, the timing of the construction of the MVP, MVP Southgate and other projects, and maintenance needs. The Company expects to fund future capital expenditures and capital contributions primarily through cash on hand, cash generated from operations and borrowings under its subsidiaries' credit facilities.\nCredit Facilities\nSee Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for discussion of the Amended EQM Credit Facility, the Amended 2019 EQM Term Loan Agreement and the Eureka Credit Facility. See Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements for discussion of the prepayment and termination of the Amended 2019 EQM Term Loan Agreement.\nSecurity Ratings\nThe table below sets forth the credit ratings for EQM's debt instruments at December 31, 2020.\nTable 16: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>EQM </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Senior Notes </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Rating Service </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Rating </td> <td> </td> <td>Outlook </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Moody's\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Ba3 </td> <td> </td> <td>Negative </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>S&P\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>BB- </td> <td> </td> <td>Stable </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fitch\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>BB </td> <td> </td> <td>Negative </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOn February 4, 2020, S&P downgraded EQM's credit to a BB+ rating, with a negative outlook, from a BBB- rating following S&P's downgrade of EQT. On February 27, 2020, S&P further downgraded EQM's credit to a BB rating, with a stable outlook. On February 18, 2020, Fitch downgraded EQM to a BB rating, with a negative outlook, from a BBB- rating, citing a downgrade of EQT's credit rating from BBB- to BB, with a negative outlook, on February 14, 2020, as well as uncertainty around the MVP project, as the principal reasons for the ratings action. On February 27, 2020, Moody's downgraded EQM's credit from Ba1, with a negative outlook, to Ba2, with a negative outlook, citing EQT's weakening credit profile, risks to completion of the MVP\nproject and the increase to EQM's financial leverage resulting from actions in connection with the EQM Merger and the Share Purchases. On April 2, 2020, Moody's further downgraded EQM's credit rating from Ba2, with a negative outlook, to Ba3, with a negative outlook, following Moody's downgrade of EQT's credit rating. On April 7, 2020, S&P further downgraded EQM's credit rating from BB, with a stable outlook, to BB-, with a negative outlook, following S&P's further downgrade of EQT's credit rating. On September 2, 2020, S&P, following its upgrade of EQT's outlook from negative to stable (based on EQT's reduced debt and improved leverage and maturity profile), lifted EQM's outlook from negative to stable, citing primarily the change in EQT's outlook. In January 2021, each of Moody's, S&P and Fitch affirmed EQM's credit ratings in connection with the issuance of the 2021 Senior Notes. The ETRN Term Loans were paid off on March 3, 2020 with proceeds from the EQM Credit Facility and the ETRN Term Loan Credit Agreement was terminated; therefore, the Company no longer has any credit ratings assigned to its debt.\nEQM's credit ratings are subject to further revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization, and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. The Company cannot ensure that a rating will remain in effect for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a credit rating agency if, in its judgment, circumstances so warrant, including in connection with the MVP project or the creditworthiness of EQM's customers, including EQT. As of December 31, 2020, EQT's public debt had credit ratings of BB from S&P (with a stable outlook), Ba3 from Moody's (with a positive outlook) (which was subsequently upgraded to BA2 with a stable outlook on February 2, 2021) and BB from Fitch (with a positive outlook). As of December 31, 2019, EQT's credit ratings with each of S&P, Moody's and Fitch were considered investment grade. If any credit rating agency further downgrades or withdraws EQM's ratings, including for reasons relating to the MVP project (such as future delays in the targeted full in-service date of the MVP project or increases in such project's costs), EQM's leverage or credit ratings of our customers (including EQT), the Company's access to the capital markets could become more challenging, borrowing costs will likely increase, the Company may be required to provide additional credit assurances (the amount of which may be substantial), including the Cash Option Letter of Credit, in support of commercial agreements such as joint venture agreements, and the potential pool of investors and funding sources may decrease. In order to be considered investment grade, a company must be rated Baa3 or higher by Moody's, BBB- or higher by S&P, or BBB- or higher by Fitch. Anything below these ratings, including all of EQM's credit ratings, are considered non-investment grade.\nSchedule of Contractual Obligations\nThe following represents the Company's contractual obligations as of December 31, 2020. Purchase obligations exclude future capital contributions to the MVP Joint Venture, purchase obligations of the MVP Joint Venture and dividends associated with the Equitrans Midstream Preferred Shares.\nTable 17: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2022 - 2023\n</td> <td> </td> <td>2024 - 2025\n</td> <td> </td> <td>2026 + </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(Thousands) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term debt (a)\n</td> <td>$ </td> <td>6,500,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,500,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,200,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,800,000 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Credit facility borrowings (b)\n</td> <td>787,500 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>302,500 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>485,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest payments on senior notes (c)\n</td> <td>2,232,938 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>275,875 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>527,802 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>397,917 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,031,344 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchase obligations (d)\n</td> <td>10,340 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,083 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,766 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,491 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating lease obligations (e)\n</td> <td>66,981 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12,508 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17,833 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10,948 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>25,692 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other liabilities (f)\n</td> <td>13,970 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,674 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10,296 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total contractual obligations </td> <td>$ </td> <td>9,611,729 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>600,640 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,543,697 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,610,356 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,857,036 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(a)Includes $5.1 billion in aggregate principal amount of EQM's senior notes and $1.4 billion associated with the term loans issued pursuant to the Amended 2019 EQM Term Loan Agreement as of December 31, 2020. See Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for further information. See Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements for discussion of issuance of the 2021 Senior Notes, the prepayment and termination of the Amended 2019 EQM Term Loan Agreement and the Tender Offers.\n(b)Credit facility borrowings were classified based on the termination date of the credit facility agreements. As of December 31, 2020, the Company had aggregate credit facility borrowings outstanding of approximately $485 million and $302.5 million under the Amended EQM Credit Facility and the Eureka Credit Facility, respectively. See Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for further information.\n(c)Interest payments exclude interest related to the Amended EQM Credit Facility, the Eureka Credit Facility and, prior to its termination, the Amended 2019 EQM Term Loan Agreement as the interest rates on the credit facility borrowings and the term loan are (and in the case of the 2019 EQM Term Loan Agreement, were) variable. See Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements for discussion of the issuance of the 2021 Senior Notes and the Tender Offers.\n(d)Purchase obligations represent agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable, legally binding and specify all significant terms, including the approximate timing of the transaction. As of December 31, 2020, the Company's purchase obligations included commitments for capital expenditures, operating expenses and service contracts.\n(e)Operating leases are primarily entered into for various office locations and compression equipment.\n(f)Other liabilities represent commitments for estimated payouts as of December 31, 2020 for various Equitrans Midstream liability award plans. See \"Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates\" below and Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements for discussion of factors that affect the ultimate amount of the payout of these obligations.\nCommitments and Contingencies\nIn the ordinary course of business, various legal and regulatory claims and proceedings are pending or threatened against the Company and its subsidiaries. While the amounts claimed may be substantial, the Company is unable to predict with certainty the ultimate outcome of such claims and proceedings. The Company accrues legal and other direct costs related to loss contingencies when incurred. The Company establishes reserves whenever it believes it to be appropriate for pending matters. Furthermore, after consultation with counsel and considering available insurance, the Company believes that the ultimate outcome of any matter currently pending against it or any of its subsidiaries will not materially affect its business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity or ability to pay dividends to its shareholders.\nSee \"The regulatory approval process for the construction of new midstream assets is very challenging, and decisions by regulatory and judicial authorities in pending or potential proceedings could impact our or the MVP Joint Venture's ability to obtain or maintain in effect all approvals and authorizations necessary to complete certain projects on the targeted time frame or at all or our ability to achieve the expected investment returns on the projects.\" included in \"Item 1A. Risk Factors,\" and see \"Item 3. Legal Proceedings\" for discussion of litigation and regulatory proceedings, including related to the MVP and MVP Southgate projects.\nSee Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the Company's commitments and contingencies.\nDividends\nOn February 12, 2021, the Company paid cash dividends for the fourth quarter of 2020 of $0.15 per common share and $0.4873 per Equitrans Midstream Preferred Share to shareholders of record at the close of business on February 3, 2021.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nSee Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for discussion of the former MVP Joint Venture guarantees.\nRecently Issued Accounting Standards\nRecently issued accounting standards relevant to the Company are described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe Company's significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements. Preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and the related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. The following critical accounting policies, which were reviewed by the Company's Audit Committee, relate to its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nIncome Taxes. The Company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the Company's consolidated financial statements or tax returns.\nThe Company has federal and state net operating loss (NOL) carryforwards related to federal and various state jurisdictions. The federal and states of Virginia and West Virginia NOL carryforwards have no expiration, but utilization is limited to 80% of taxable income in the year of utilization. The Company's Pennsylvania NOL carryforwards expire in 2038 and 2040. The Company believes that it is more likely than not that the benefit from certain federal and state NOL carryforwards will be realized. In addition to the NOL carryforwards, the Company has recorded deferred tax liabilities principally resulting from its investment in partnerships. No valuation allowances have been established on the Company's deferred tax assets because the Company believes that future sources of taxable income, reversing temporary differences and other tax planning strategies will be sufficient to realize these deferred tax assets. Any determination to change the valuation allowance would impact the Company's income tax expense in the period in which such a determination is made.\nValuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not (greater than 50%) that a tax benefit will not be realized. In evaluating the need for a valuation allowance, management considers all potential sources of taxable income, including income available in carry-back periods, future reversals of taxable temporary differences, projections of taxable income and income from tax planning strategies, as well as all available positive and negative evidence. Positive evidence includes factors such as a history of profitable operations, projections of future profitability within the carry-forward period, including from tax planning strategies, and experience. The Company has not identified any significant negative evidence.\nDeferred tax assets for which no valuation allowance is recorded may not be realized, and changes in facts and circumstances may result in the establishment of a valuation allowance. Existing valuation allowances are re-examined under the same standards of positive and negative evidence that apply to valuation allowance establishment. If it is determined that it is more likely than not that a deferred tax asset for which a valuation is recorded will be realized, all or a portion of the valuation allowance may be released. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are also re-measured to reflect changes in underlying tax rates from law changes.\nTax benefits related to uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return are recorded when such benefits meet a more likely than not threshold; otherwise, the tax benefit is recorded when the tax position has been effectively settled, either because the statute of limitations has expired or the appropriate taxing authority has completed its examination. Interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions are recognized as part of the provision for income taxes and are accrued beginning in the period that such interest and penalties would be applicable under relevant tax law until such time that the related tax benefits are recognized.\nThe Company believes that accounting estimates related to income taxes are \"critical accounting estimates\" because the Company must assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income, exercise judgment when evaluating whether or not a valuation allowance must be established on deferred tax assets and exercise judgment regarding the amount of financial statement benefit to record for uncertain tax positions. To the extent that a valuation allowance or an uncertain tax position is established or increased or decreased during a period, the Company includes an expense or benefit within income tax expense on the statements of comprehensive income. Future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in the Company's assumptions. See Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.\nProperty, Plant and Equipment. Determination of depreciation requires judgment regarding the estimated useful lives and salvage values of property, plant and equipment. The Company has not historically experienced material changes in its results of operations from changes in the estimated useful lives or salvage values of its property, plant and equipment; however, these estimates are reviewed periodically, including each time Equitrans, L.P. files with the FERC for a change in its transmission, storage and gathering rates. The Company believes that the accounting estimate related to depreciation is a \"critical accounting estimate\" because it is susceptible to change. These assumptions affect depreciation expense and, if changed, would have an effect on the Company's results of operations and financial position. See Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.\nImpairments of Long-Lived Assets and Equity Method Investments. The Company evaluates long-lived assets and equity method investments for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate, in management's judgment, that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable. With respect to property, plant and equipment and finite lived intangibles, asset recoverability is measured by comparing the carrying value of the asset or asset group with its expected future pre-tax undiscounted cash flows. Any accounting estimate related to impairment of property, plant and equipment, finite-lived intangible assets, goodwill or an investment in an unconsolidated entity may require the Company's management to make assumptions about future cash flows, discount rates, the fair value of investments and whether losses in the value of its investments are other than temporary. Management's assumptions about future cash flows require significant judgment because, among other things, actual operating levels have fluctuated in the past and are expected to fluctuate in the future.\nGoodwill is the cost of an acquisition less the fair value of the identifiable net assets of the acquired business. Goodwill is evaluated for impairment at least annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. The Company uses a combination of an income and market approach to estimate the fair value of a reporting unit.\nThe Company believes that the accounting estimates related to impairments are \"critical accounting estimates\" because they require assumptions that are susceptible to change, including estimating fair value which requires considerable judgment. For example, in the case of goodwill, management's estimate of a reporting unit's future financial results is sensitive to changes in assumptions, such as changes in stock prices, weighted-average cost of capital, terminal growth rates and industry multiples. The Company believes the estimates and assumptions used in estimating its reporting units' fair values are reasonable and\nappropriate; however, different assumptions and estimates could materially affect the calculated fair value and the resulting conclusion on impairment of goodwill, which could materially affect the Company's results of operations and financial position.\nThe Company's investments in unconsolidated entities also require considerable judgment to estimate fair value because the Company's investments are not traded on an active market. Additionally, the Company's investments in unconsolidated entities are susceptible to impairment risk from further adverse macroeconomic conditions and/or other adverse factors such as permit and litigation matters impacting the MVP project. For example, adverse or delayed developments with respect to such matters or other adverse developments could require that the Company modify assumptions reflected in the probability-weighted scenarios of discounted future net cash flows (including with respect to the probability of success) utilized to estimate fair value of its equity investment in the MVP Joint Venture, which could result in an other-than-temporary impairment of that investment.\nAny potential impairment would have an effect on the Company's results of operations and financial position. See Notes 1 and 4 for additional information.\nRevenue Recognition. Revenue from the gathering, transmission and storage of natural gas is generally recognized when the service is provided. Revenue from water services is generally recognized when water is delivered. Contracts often contain fixed and variable consideration. Fixed consideration primarily relates to firm reservation payments including MVCs. Variable consideration is generally dependent on volumes and recognized in the period they occur. For all contracts, the Company allocates the transaction price to each performance obligation based on the judgment determined relative standalone selling price. When applicable, the excess of consideration received over revenue recognized results in the deferral of those amounts until future periods based on a units of production or straight-line methodology as these methods appropriately match the consumption of services provided to the customer. The units of production methodology requires the use of production estimates that are uncertain and the use of judgment when developing estimates of future production volumes, thus impacting the rate of revenue recognition. Production estimates are monitored as circumstances and events warrant. Certain of the Company's gas gathering and water agreements have MVCs. If a customer under such an agreement fails to meet its MVC for a specified period (thus not exercising all the contractual rights to gathering and water services within the specified period, herein referred to as breakage\u201d), it is obligated to pay a contractually determined fee based upon the shortfall between the actual gathered or water volumes and the MVC for the period contained in the contract. When management determines it is probable that the customer will not exercise all or a portion of its remaining rights, the Company recognizes revenue associated with such breakage amount in proportion to the pattern of exercised rights within the respective MVC period.\nRevenue related to services provided but not yet billed is estimated each month. These estimates are generally based on contract data, preliminary throughput and allocation measurements. Final bills for the current month are billed and collected in the following month. See Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.\nThe Company records an allowance for credit losses on a quarterly basis in order to estimate uncollectible receivables. The Company's current expected credit loss (CECL) methodology considers risks of collection based on a customer's current credit status. The standard requires an entity to assess whether financial assets share similar risk characteristics and, if so, group such assets in a pool. Customer balances are aggregated for evaluation based on their credit risk rating, which takes into account changes in economic factors that impact a customer's ability to meet its financial obligations. The Company's CECL methodology assigns a reserve, even if remote, to each customer based on credit risk and the reserve is evaluated on a quarterly basis. In order to calculate the appropriate provision, the Company utilizes an estimated loss rate factor based on a customer's credit rating for receivables and a risk-adjusted reserve based on the receivable aging schedule in order to account for the receivables which may be at a greater risk of collection. Customer credit risk ratings are updated quarterly and management has enabled a risk-responsive approach to changes in customer and economic factors. While the Company has not historically experienced material losses on uncollected receivables, declines in the market price for natural gas affecting producer activity combined with the increase in customers on the Company's systems may result in a greater exposure to potential losses than management's current estimates.\nThe Company believes that the accounting estimates related to revenue recognition are \"critical accounting estimates\" because estimated volumes are subject to change based on actual measurements, including prior period adjustments. In addition, the Company believes that the accounting estimates related to the allowance for credit losses are \"critical accounting estimates\" because the underlying assumptions used for the allowance can change and the actual mix of customers and their ability to pay may vary significantly from management's estimates, which could affect the collectability of customer receivables. These accounting estimates could potentially have a material effect on the Company's results of operations and financial position.\nBusiness Combinations. During the second quarter of 2019, the Company recorded the Bolt-on Acquisition using the acquisition method of accounting; accordingly, the values assigned to the assets and liabilities are based on the Company's\npurchase price accounting estimates. Accounting for the acquisition of a business requires a company to record the acquired identifiable assets and liabilities at fair value. The estimated fair value of midstream facilities and equipment, which generally consist of pipeline systems and compression stations, was estimated using the cost approach. Significant unobservable inputs in the estimate of fair value include management's assumptions about the replacement costs for similar assets, the relative age of the acquired assets and any potential economic or functional obsolescence associated with the acquired assets. The fair value of intangible assets was determined using the income approach, which requires a forecast of the expected future cash flows generated and an estimated market-based weighted average cost of capital. Significant unobservable inputs in the determination of fair value include future revenue estimates, future cost assumptions and estimated customer retention rates.\nGiven the time required to obtain pertinent information necessary to finalize the allocation of the purchase price to the acquired net assets, the purchase price allocation remained preliminary for a period of time before the required fair value estimates were finalized. It is not uncommon for the initial estimates to be subsequently revised. During the fourth quarter of 2019, the Bolt-on Acquisition purchase price accounting was finalized. See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.\nThe Company believes that the accounting estimates related to business combinations are \"critical accounting estimates\" because in determining the fair value of assets acquired, assumptions must be made about projections regarding the timing and amount of future development and operating costs and projections of replacement costs of and future cash flows from midstream assets and cash flows from customer relationships. Different assumptions may result in materially different values for these assets, which would affect the Company's future results of operations and financial position.\nShare-Based Compensation. The Company awards share-based compensation in connection with specific programs. Awards to employees are typically made in the form of performance-based awards, time-based restricted stock awards and time-based restricted unit awards; and certain former employees were awarded stock options in the past. Awards to directors are typically made in the form of phantom units that vest upon grant.\nPerformance-based awards expected to be satisfied in cash are treated as liability awards and remeasured at fair value at the end of each reporting period, recognizing a proportionate amount of the expense for each period over the vesting period of the award. Performance-based awards expected to be satisfied in Company common stock are treated as equity awards and recorded based on an estimated grant date fair value over the vesting period of the award. Determination of the fair value of the awards requires judgments and estimates regarding, among other things, the appropriate methodologies to follow in valuing the awards and the related inputs required by those valuation methodologies. Most often, the Company obtains a valuation at the grant date for equity awards and at each remeasurement date for liability awards based upon assumptions regarding risk-free rates of return, expected volatilities, the expected term of the award and dividend yield, as applicable. The risk-free rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of valuation. Expected volatilities are based on historical volatility of the Company's common stock and, where applicable, the common stock of the peer group members at the time of valuation. The expected term represents the period of time elapsing during the applicable performance period. The dividend yield is based on the historical dividend yield of the Company's common stock adjusted for any expected changes and, where applicable, of the common stock of the peer group members at the time of valuation.\nFor plans that include a performance condition that affects the number of shares that will ultimately vest, the probability that the performance condition will be achieved is reevaluated at the end of each reporting period and the payout multiplier is applied to the grant date fair value or measurement date fair value to record compensation expense, as applicable. For plans that include a market condition, compensation expense is based on a grant date fair value using a Monte Carlo simulation that remains constant throughout the vesting period for equity plans and a fair value using a Monte Carlo simulation remeasured at each reporting period for liability plans. Each plan subject to a market condition is accounted for separately for each vesting tranche of the award.\nTime-based restricted units expected to be satisfied in cash are accounted for as liability awards recorded over the requisite service period, typically three years. The fair value of liability awards is remeasured at the end of each reporting period based on the closing price of the Company's common stock. Time-based restricted stock awards expected to be satisfied in Company common stock are accounted for as equity awards and are recorded over the requisite service period, typically three years, based on the grant date fair value. Director phantom units expected to be satisfied in Company common stock vest on the date of grant and are recorded based on the grant date fair value. The grant date fair value, in both cases, is determined based upon the closing price of the Company's common stock on the day before the grant date.\nThe Company believes that the accounting estimates related to share-based compensation are \"critical accounting estimates\" because they may change from period to period based on changes in assumptions about factors affecting the ultimate payout of awards, including the number of awards to ultimately vest and the market price and volatility of the Company's common stock.\nFuture results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in the Company's assumptions.

$1,012,281, a decrease of $158,650, or 13.7%, compared to the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019.\n- Volumetric-based fee revenues decreased $416,561, or 28.0%, for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, due to a decrease in overall traffic resulting from lower industrial demand and lower overall economic activity, partially offset by an increase in traffic due to the Company's acquisition of the remaining 50.0% interest in the Company's joint venture, which owns and operates the Mountain Valley Pipeline (\"MVP\"), in the third quarter of 2020.\n- For the year ended December 31, 2020, operating income (loss) was $423,407, a decrease of $88,850, or 13.0%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2019.\n- For the year ended December 31,

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with Item 1. Business,\u201d Item 1A. Risk Factors,\u201d and the consolidated financial statements, and the notes thereto, included in \"Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nThe information covered in this section provides a comparison of material changes in the Company's results of operations and financial condition for fiscal year 2020 and fiscal year 2019. For the comparison of fiscal year 2019 and fiscal year 2018, see \"Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019, filed with the SEC on February 27, 2020.\nExecutive Overview\nNet income attributable to Equitrans Midstream common shareholders was $364.4 million in 2020 compared with a net loss attributable to Equitrans Midstream common shareholders of $203.7 million in 2019. The increase resulted primarily from a decrease in impairment charges associated with long-lived assets on Gathering (as discussed in Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements), higher equity income from the Company's investment in the MVP Joint Venture, increased revenue from firm reservation fees primarily on Water and Gathering and unrealized gains on derivative instruments associated with the Henry Hub cash bonus payment provision, partially offset by lower volumetric-based fee revenues primarily due to the impacts of the EQT Global GGA, higher net income attributable to noncontrolling interests, higher income tax expense, preferred dividends associated with the Equitrans Midstream Preferred Shares, higher net interest expense, higher depreciation expense, higher selling, general and administrative expense and a loss on early extinguishment of debt.\nCOVID-19 Update\nThe ongoing COVID-19 outbreak has resulted in a severe global economic downturn and a recession of unknown duration and has caused increased volatility in and intermittent disruptions to the global financial and credit markets. The outbreak has directly resulted in a significant decrease in demand for oil and NGLs, at least in the short term, which caused extreme volatility in oil and other liquids prices and a significant negative impact to, at a minimum, the short- and medium-term outlook for oil prices. The downward pressure on oil prices was further exacerbated by the failure, in March 2020, of Saudi Arabia and Russia to agree to cut oil production, which contributed to a sharp drop in the price of oil (and at one point negative prices for oil) and an imbalance between the supply and demand for oil. The revised outlook for oil and other liquids prices caused a significant reduction in the number of operating drilling rigs in the United States, with a substantial portion of this reduction in rigs accounted for in shale plays targeted primarily at developing oil resources, including the Permian Basin. According to Baker Hughes, the average U.S. rig count fell to approximately 367 during January 2021, compared to an average rig count of approximately 791 during January 2020. This dramatic decrease in the number of operating drilling rigs has positively impacted the natural gas forward price strip based on the market expectation that the reduced or curtailed production of associated gas from basins such as the Permian Basin will at least in the near- and medium-term cause a reduction in the overall supply of natural gas which will more than offset reduced demand for natural gas as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak. See Commodity Prices\u201d under Outlook\u201d below for a further discussion of the current commodity price environment for the Company and its producer customers.\nFuture disruptions to the global financial and credit markets from the COVID-19 outbreak and related economic impacts could, both directly and indirectly, negatively impact the Company's financial condition and results of operations. The Company closed EQM's offerings of the 2021 Senior Notes (defined in Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements) and the 2020 Senior Notes (defined in Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements) in January 2021 and June 2020, respectively; however, there can be no guarantee that future disruptions to the financial and credit markets as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak and related economic impacts would not affect the Company's ability to again access such markets, if needed, on acceptable terms or at all. Further, certain of the Company's producer customers have significant capital needs, primarily to refinance existing indebtedness that matures during the next several years, and further disruptions or instability in financial and credit markets as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak and the economic disruptions therefrom may have a significant, negative impact on such producers' abilities to access the financial and credit markets and refinance existing indebtedness as it becomes due. If such producer customers have difficulty refinancing such indebtedness on acceptable terms or at all (or undertaking other transactions to generate cash for debt service), the Company's exposure to risk of nonpayment and/or nonperformance by its customers would increase. Additionally, the ability of the Company's producer customers to maintain or grow their production would likely be adversely affected as a result of such refinancing challenges, which would have a negative impact on demand for the Company's current services as well as the prospect of future pipeline expansion projects that would enhance the Company's business.\nFrom an operational perspective, while the COVID-19 outbreak has significantly impacted the manner in which the Company's employees and contractors perform their job functions, the outbreak has had, and continues to have, a minimal impact on the Company's overall operations. However, the situation surrounding COVID-19 remains fluid, and the Company continues to actively manage its response in collaboration with relevant parties, including its employees, contractors, customers and suppliers. As a midstream energy company, during applicable state-issued stay-at-home orders, the Company has been recognized as an essential business under various regulations related to the COVID-19 outbreak and continued to operate as permitted under these regulations. The Company has proactively undertaken a number of companywide measures intended to promote the safety of field and office-based employees and contractors. These measures include, among other things, establishing an Infectious Disease Response Team, instituting enhanced self-protection and office sanitation measures, eliminating non-essential business travel, implementing a mandatory work-from-home protocol for a substantial majority of the Company's employees through at least June 1, 2021, instituting face covering protocols, providing certain medical benefit enhancements, practicing social distancing in the field where possible, sharing the Company's infectious disease response plan with suppliers and contractors, and timely communicating updates to employees and other relevant parties. In addition, the Company has implemented additional mitigation efforts in connection with the remobilization of certain field employees and contractors. The Company's Infectious Disease Response Team continues to monitor and assist in implementing mitigation efforts in respect of potential areas of risk for the Company and its stakeholders. Additionally, the Company has provided support to local communities through corporate giving and the Equitrans Midstream Foundation. The Company's operations have been able to maintain a consistent level of effectiveness through the measures taken. The Company believes that it is following best practices under COVID-19 guidance and intends to continue to refine its practices as additional guidance is released and assess potential impacts from COVID-19 to its financial position and operating results, as well as any regulatory and legislative activities relating to COVID-19 that could impact its business.\nThe Company is unable to predict, in light of the ongoing and dynamic nature of the circumstances related to COVID-19 and the continued growth in COVID-19 infections in the United States (including in certain of the Company's areas of operation) and globally, any additional impact the outbreak may have on the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition. The extent of COVID-19's impact on the Company will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with any reasonable degree of certainty, including new information that may emerge concerning the severity of COVID-19, the duration of the outbreak, spikes in infection rates (including in the Company's areas of operation) and related economic effects and after effects (including on the natural gas industry), and actions taken to contain COVID-19 or its impact, including vaccine acceptance, distribution and effectiveness, among others. For further information regarding the potential impact of COVID-19, see \"The outbreak of COVID-19 (or any future pandemic), and related declines in economic output and demand for natural gas, could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.\" under \"Item 1A. Risk Factors.\"\nBusiness Segment Results\nOperating segments are revenue-producing components of an enterprise for which separate financial information is produced internally and is subject to evaluation by the chief operating decision maker in deciding how to allocate resources. Headquarters costs consist primarily of transaction costs and other unallocated corporate expenses. Net interest expense, components of other income and income tax expense are managed on a consolidated basis. The Company has presented each segment's operating income (loss), unrealized gain on derivative instruments, equity income and various operational measures in the following sections. Management believes that the presentation of this information is useful to management and investors regarding the financial condition, results of operations and trends of its segments. The Company has reconciled each segment's operating income (loss) to the Company's consolidated operating income (loss) and net income (loss) in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements.\nGATHERING RESULTS OF OPERATIONS \n(a)For the year ended December 31, 2020, firm reservation fee revenues included approximately $15.0 million of MVC unbilled revenues.\n(b)Other income in the Company's statements of consolidated comprehensive income includes the unrealized gain on derivative instruments associated with the Henry Hub cash bonus payment provision. See \"Other Income Statement Items\" below for further information.\n(c)Includes volumes under agreements structured with MVCs.\n(d)Includes approximately $41.6 million and $25.9 million of capital expenditures related to noncontrolling interests in Eureka Midstream for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nYear Ended December 31, 2020 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2019\nGathering operating revenues decreased by $147.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. Firm reservation fee revenues increased by $14.6 million primarily due to a $196.6 million increase in MVC billed revenues primarily under the EQT Global GGA and a full year of MVC revenues generated by the operating entities acquired in the Bolt-on Acquisition, which closed in April 2019, partly offset by $225.7 million of deferred revenue in 2020 under the EQT Global GGA. Volumetric-based fee revenues decreased by $162.3 million primarily due to increased MVC revenues attributable to volumes that previously were subject to volumetric-based fees prior to the EQT Global GGA.\nGathering operating expenses decreased by $772.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily as a result of a $798.7 million decrease in impairment charges (as discussed in Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements), a $15.2 million decrease in separation and other transaction costs primarily given acquisition-related costs associated with the Bolt-on Acquisition and a $9.4 million decrease in operating and maintenance expense primarily associated with a decrease in repairs and maintenance expense, partially offset by an increase in non-income tax reserves. The decrease in such operating expenses was partly offset by a $28.7 million increase in depreciation expense as a result of additional assets placed in-service, including a full year of depreciation on assets acquired in the Bolt-on Acquisition, and a $9.9 million increase in amortization of intangible assets as a result of intangible assets acquired in the Bolt-on Acquisition and a corresponding adjustment to the useful lives of these intangibles (as discussed in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements). Selling, general and administrative expense increased by $12.2 million primarily due to higher personnel costs.\nSee \"Outlook\" and Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the impairment of long-lived assets. See also Outlook\u201d for discussions of certain customer production curtailments during the second and third quarters of 2020 and Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for discussions of the EQT Global GGA and the transactions related thereto, including the potential cash fee relief to EQT in connection with a further delay in the targeted MVP in-service date. The Company expects that the revenues resulting from the MVCs under the EQT Global GGA will increase the proportion of the Company's total operating revenues that are firm reservation fee revenues, and correspondingly decrease the portion of the Company's total operating revenues that are volumetric-based fee revenues, in future periods. Firm reservation fee revenues under the Company's Hammerhead gathering agreement with EQT (which is subject to a pending dispute with EQT) are also expected to contribute to an increase in the Company's firm reservation fee revenues. See also Outlook\u201d for discussions of the Hammerhead dispute with EQT and the Gulfport bankruptcy.\nTRANSMISSION RESULTS OF OPERATIONS \n(a)Transmission capital expenditures do not include capital contributions made to the MVP Joint Venture for the MVP and MVP Southgate projects of approximately $272.8 million, $774.6 million and $913.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nYear Ended December 31, 2020 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2019\nTransmission operating revenues increased by $3.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. Firm reservation fee revenues increased by $8.0 million primarily due to customers contracting for additional firm transmission capacity, and volumetric-based fee revenues decreased $4.6 million due to lower throughput volumes primarily due to producer curtailments as a result of depressed natural gas prices.\nOperating expenses increased by $5.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily as a result of increased operating and maintenance expense and increased depreciation expense as a result of additional assets placed in-service.\nEquity income increased by $70.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 due to the increase in the MVP Joint Venture's AFUDC on the MVP as a result of continued spending on the project. Effective January 2021, the MVP Joint Venture temporarily suspended AFUDC accruals until growth construction activities resume. Depending on the timing for when growth construction may resume, the Company's equity income could be negatively impacted in future periods, and such impact could be substantial.\nWATER RESULTS OF OPERATIONS \n(a) Includes volumes under agreements structured with MVCs.\nYear Ended December 31, 2020 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2019\nWater operating revenues increased by $24.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. Firm reservation fee revenues increased by $30.6 million primarily as a result of increased revenues generated under agreements with MVCs. Volumetric-based fee revenues decreased $5.7 million primarily due to higher reservation fee revenues under agreements with MVCs and a decrease in customer hydraulic fracturing activity, partly offset by increased realized rates on a per gallon basis.\nWater operating expenses increased by $1.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily as a result of higher selling, general and administrative expense primarily due to increased bad debt expense associated with Gulfport's announced bankruptcy proceedings and higher personnel costs. Depreciation expense increased as a result of additional assets placed in-service. These increases were partly offset by lower operating and maintenance expense associated with the timing of costs related to customer activities on drilling pads.\nThe Company's water services are directly associated with producers' well completion activities and fresh and produced water needs (which are partially driven by horizontal lateral lengths and the number of completion stages per well). Therefore, the Water operating results traditionally fluctuate from year-to-year in response to producers' well completion activities. The Company expects Water operating income to be lower for the year ending December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020 primarily due to lower MVCs and an expected decrease in customer activity.\nOther Income Statement Items\nOther Income\nOther income increased $14.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily as a result of a $16.5 million unrealized gain on derivative instruments associated with the Henry Hub cash bonus payment provision entered into in the first quarter of 2020 and a $2.5 million increase in the net settlement of incentive compensation, partially offset by a $4.3 million decrease in AFUDC - equity.\nLoss on Early Extinguishment of Debt\nThe Company incurred a loss on the early extinguishment of debt of $24.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2020 related to the write off of unamortized discounts and financing costs on the ETRN Term Loan Credit Agreement (defined in Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements) and the Equitrans Midstream Credit Facility (defined in Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements) in the first quarter of 2020. See Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements.\nNet Interest Expense\nNet interest expense increased by $51.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily due to $56.1 million in higher interest expense associated with the 2020 Senior Notes, $22.1 million in higher interest expense on the EQM Term Loans (defined in Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements) and decreased capitalized interest and AFUDC - debt of $12.1 million, partially offset by lower interest expense of $39.8 million on the ETRN Term Loans as a result of their termination in March 2020.\nAfter accounting for the issuance of the 2020 and 2021 Senior Notes and use of those proceeds to pay off other outstanding debt, the Company expects interest expense to increase in future periods.\nSee also Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of certain of the Company's outstanding debt.\nSee Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements for discussion of the 2021 Senior Notes, prepayment and termination of the Amended 2019 EQM Term Loan Agreement and the Tender Offers.\nIncome Taxes\nSee Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements for an explanation of the increase in income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019.\nThe Company files a consolidated income tax return for federal income taxes and uses the asset and liability method to account for income taxes. EQM is, and for the period prior to the EQGP Buyout, EQGP was, a limited partnership for U.S. federal and state income tax purposes. Eureka Midstream is a limited liability company for such purposes. EQM, EQGP, and Eureka Midstream are not subject to U.S. federal or state income taxes.\nAll of Eureka Midstream's income is, for the period prior to the closing of the EQM Merger, all of EQM's income was, and for the period prior to the EQGP Buyout, all of EQGP's income was included in the Company's pre-tax income; however, the Company does not record income tax expense on the portions of its income attributable to the noncontrolling member of Eureka Midstream and did not record income tax expense on the portions of its income attributable to the noncontrolling limited partners of EQM and EQGP for the periods prior to the closings of the EQM Merger and the EQGP Buyout, respectively. This reduces the Company's effective tax rate in periods when the Company has consolidated pre-tax income. The Company expects its effective tax rate for periods following the EQM Merger to generally be higher than the pre-EQM Merger periods due to the decrease in net income attributable to noncontrolling interests as a result of the Company's acquisition of the outstanding EQM common units not held by the Company and its subsidiaries and related Restructuring in connection with the closing of the EQM Merger.\nNet Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests\nNet income attributable to noncontrolling interests increased for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily as a result of higher net income attributable to the noncontrolling interests in EQM and Eureka Midstream, partly offset by lower net income allocated to the EQM Series A Preferred Units prior to the closing of the Restructuring.\nThe Company recorded net income attributable to noncontrolling interest for the third-party ownership interests in EQM (including the EQM Series A Preferred Units) through the closing of the EQM Merger. Upon the closing of the EQM Merger on June 17, 2020, the Company's remaining noncontrolling interest consists solely of the third-party ownership interest in Eureka Midstream.\nCapital Expenditures\nSee \"Investing Activities\" and \"Capital Requirements\" under \"Capital Resources and Liquidity\" for discussion of capital expenditures and capital contributions.\nOutlook\nThe Company's strategically-located assets overlay core acreage in the Appalachian Basin. The location of the Company's assets allows its producer customers to access major demand markets in the U.S. The Company is one of the largest natural gas gatherers in the U.S., and its largest customer, EQT, was the largest natural gas producer in the U.S. based on average daily sales volumes as of December 31, 2020. The Company maintains a stable cash flow profile, with approximately 66% of its revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020 generated by firm reservation fees. Further, the percentage of the Company's revenues that are generated by firm reservation fees is expected to increase in future years as a result of the 15-year term EQT Global GGA, which includes an MVC that became effective on April 1, 2020 of 3.0 Bcf per day and gradually steps up to 4.0 Bcf per day for several years following the full in-service date of the MVP project. This contract structure enhances the stability of the Company's cash flows and limits its direct exposure to commodity price risk.\nThe Company's principal strategy is to achieve greater scale and scope and enhance the durability if its financial strength, which the Company expects will drive future growth and investment. The Company is implementing its strategy by leveraging its existing assets, executing on its growth projects (including through potential expansion and extension opportunities), focusing on ESG initiatives, and, where appropriate, seeking and executing on strategically-aligned acquisition and joint venture opportunities and other strategic transactions, while strengthening its balance sheet through:\n\u2022highly predictable cash flows backed by firm reservation fees;\n\u2022actions to de-lever its balance sheet;\n\u2022disciplined capital spending;\n\u2022operating cost control; and\n\u2022an appropriate dividend policy.\nAs part of its approach to organic growth, the Company is focused on its projects and assets outlined under \"Strategy\" in \"Item 1. Business,\" many of which are supported by contracts with firm capacity or MVC commitments. The Company believes that this approach will enable the Company to achieve its strategic goals.\nThe Company expects that the MVP project, together with the Hammerhead pipeline and EEP, will primarily drive the Company's organic growth and that its future growth also will be supported by the MVP Southgate project and water services business.\nEQT Global GGA. On February 27, 2020, the Company announced the EQT Global GGA, which is a 15-year contract that includes, among other things, a 3.0 Bcf per day MVC (which gradually steps up to 4.0 Bcf per day for several years following the in-service date of the MVP project) and the dedication of a substantial majority of EQT's core acreage in Pennsylvania and West Virginia to the Company. Under the EQT Global GGA, EQT will receive certain gathering fee relief over a period of three years following the in-service date of the MVP (as further described in Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements). The EQT Global GGA replaced 14 previous gathering agreements between EQT and the Company.\nUnder the EQT Global GGA, the performance obligation is to provide daily MVC capacity and as such the total consideration is allocated proportionally to the daily MVC over the life of the contract. In periods that the gathering MVC revenue billed will exceed the allocated consideration, the excess will be deferred to the contract liability and recognized in revenue when the performance obligation has been satisfied. Assuming a full in-service date in late 2021 for the MVP, the deferral to the contract liability is expected to increase by approximately $295 million and $6 million during 2021 and 2022, respectively. While the 3.0 Bcf per day MVC capacity became effective on April 1, 2020, additional daily MVC capacity and the associated gathering MVC fees payable by EQT to the Company as set forth in the EQT Global GGA are conditioned upon the in-service date of the MVP. There are ongoing legal and regulatory matters that must be resolved favorably before the MVP project can be completed which could have a material effect on the performance obligation and the allocation of the total consideration over the life of the contract and the gathering MVC fees payable by EQT under the contract.\nBased on the Henry Hub natural gas forward strip prices as of February 19, 2021 and the terms of the Henry Hub cash bonus payment provision, any delays in the in-service date for the MVP project, including beyond the most recent targeted full in-service of late 2021, would decrease the estimated fair value of the derivative asset attributable to the Henry Hub cash bonus payment provision, and such decrease may be substantial. Such changes in estimated fair value, if any, would be recognized in other income on the Company's statements of consolidated comprehensive income.\nFor a discussion of the Company's commercial relationship with EQT and related considerations, including risks associated with this relationship, see \"Item 1A. Risk Factors.\" See also Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for additional\ninformation regarding the EQT Global GGA and the transactions related thereto. For further discussion on litigation and regulatory challenges affecting the completion of the MVP project, see \"Strategy\" under \"Developments, Market Trends and Competitive Conditions\" in \"Item 1. Business\" and \"Item 3. Legal Proceedings.\"\nHammerhead Pipeline. On September 23, 2020, EQT and certain affiliates of EQT instituted arbitration proceedings against the Company by filing a Demand for Arbitration with the American Arbitration Association. The arbitration arises out of the Hammerhead gathering agreement, pursuant to which the Company agreed to construct the Hammerhead pipeline and gather gas for EQT. EQT sought a declaratory judgment that it may exercise an early termination right and purchase the Hammerhead pipeline and related facilities under the terms of the Hammerhead gathering agreement. With its Demand for Arbitration, EQT also sought emergency relief, asking that an emergency arbitrator: (i) resolve the parties' dispute on the merits by October 1, 2020; or (ii) alternatively, toll the contractual deadline for EQT's exercise of its termination right, which was set to expire on October 11, 2020, until after the parties' dispute was resolved. On October 6, 2020, the emergency arbitrator issued an order denying EQT's request for emergency resolution on the merits but tolling the early termination deadline until the arbitration has been resolved. The Company's answer to the Notice of Arbitration was filed on October 8, 2020, and the parties are currently engaged in arbitration. The Company will vigorously defend against EQT's claims and litigate its rights, including the assertion of appropriate counterclaims.\nGulfport Bankruptcy. On November 13, 2020, Gulfport commenced bankruptcy proceedings. On November 24, 2020, Gulfport moved to reject its gas gathering agreements with the Company and made certain related court filings, which motions the Company has opposed. The Company and Gulfport have entered into negotiations related to the contracts. For the year ended December 31, 2020, Gulfport accounted for approximately 9% of the Company's operating revenues.\nCommodity Prices. The Company's business is dependent on continued natural gas production and the availability and development of reserves in its areas of operation. Low prices for natural gas and NGLs have adversely affected development of additional reserves and production that is accessible by the Company's pipeline and storage assets, which also negatively affects the Company's water services business. See COVID-19 Update\u201d under Executive Overview\u201d above for a discussion of the impact the COVID-19 outbreak has had on oil, NGLs and natural gas prices, and the positive impact lower oil prices are perceived to have on natural gas prices in the near- and medium-term, primarily as a result of corresponding declines in the production of associated gas in the United States which the market expects will more than offset reduced demand for natural gas as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak.\nHenry Hub spot and local spot natural gas prices, which were under pressure prior to the COVID-19 outbreak due primarily to a warmer than normal 2019 - 2020 winter heating season, a temperate spring 2020 season and an oversupply of natural gas (caused in part by the significant increase in production of associated gas from the Permian Basin and similar basins in recent years), were further pressured by a reduction in global demand for natural gas during 2020 (for which the COVID-19 outbreak was a contributing factor), lack of available natural gas storage and the continued significant supplies of natural gas being produced, particularly from the Appalachian Basin. The Henry Hub natural gas price ranged from $1.33 per MMbtu to $3.03 per MMbtu between January 1, 2020 and December 31, 2020, with some prices reflecting the lowest natural gas prices in more than 20 years. Further, market prices for natural gas in the Appalachian Basin continue to be lower than Henry Hub natural gas prices and were significantly lower during portions of 2020. Natural gas prices have improved since the spring of 2020 and are expected to further improve during 2021, as reflected by the natural gas forward price strip as of February 19, 2021, primarily due to demand, such as in the winter months, for natural gas potentially exceeding available supply (as a result of, in part, the decrease in associated gas production from the Permian Basin given the dramatic decrease in oil production caused by historical low oil prices during the first half of 2020). However, the length and extent of that price recovery (if any) and its effect on the development plans of the Company's customers, which impact both the Company's ability to execute new commercial agreements with its customers as well as the volumetric-based fee revenues the Company earns under existing contracts, will be impacted by global demand for natural gas, the length and severity of the 2020-2021 winter heating season, rates of natural gas production (including amounts of associated gas from the Permian Basin, which certain analysts are projecting will increase in 2021 and later years), and the length and severity of the COVID-19 outbreak. There is no assurance that the elevated natural gas prices indicated by the current forward natural gas price strip will be realized or be realized for any particular length of time, or that producers will increase production volume as a result of any particular price level.\nLower natural gas prices have caused certain producers, including customers of the Company, to determine to reduce their rig count (and thereby delay production), temporarily shut in portions of their production or otherwise take actions to slow production growth and/or reduce production, which when effected by the Company's producer customers reduces the demand for, and usage of, the Company's services. For instance, in May 2020 and September 2020, EQT publicly disclosed that it had made the strategic decision to temporarily curtail significant portions of its production, and certain other Company customers also curtailed portions of their production during the second and/or third quarters of 2020. The temporary production curtailments in 2020 resulted in a decrease in the Company's volumetric-based fee revenues for portions of 2020, and an extended period of low natural gas prices and/or a slow recovery of natural gas prices in 2021 could cause EQT or other\nproducers to take similar actions in the future, which could have a significant negative effect on the demand for the Company's services and therefore its results of operation.\nCertain of the Company's customers reduced their capital spending forecasts in 2020 as compared to 2019 capital expenditures and 2021. For example, EQT's 2020 capital expenditures were approximately $694 million, or 39%, lower than EQT's 2019 capital expenditures. Although EQT announced a modest increase in its 2021 capital expenditure forecast compared to EQT's 2020 actual capital expenditures, EQT's 2021 sales volume forecast is approximately flat relative to its pro-forma 2020 sales volume (adjusted for the Chevron Acquisition). Price declines and sustained periods of low natural gas and NGL prices could continue to have an adverse effect on the creditworthiness of the Company's customers and related ability to pay firm reservation fees under long-term contracts and/or affect activity levels and, accordingly, volumetric-based fees, which could affect the Company's results of operations, liquidity or financial position. Each of S&P, Moody's and Fitch took negative ratings actions on a number of Appalachian exploration and production companies during 2020, including EQT, Range Resources and Gulfport, citing, among other things, lower natural gas price assumptions and current and future financing needs (although all three ratings agencies have since taken positive action on EQT citing, among other things, subsequent debt reduction and improvements in natural gas fundamentals). On November 13, 2020, Gulfport filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, as further described above under \"Gulfport Bankruptcy.\" Many of the Company's customers, including EQT, have entered into long-term firm reservation transmission and gathering contracts or contracts with MVCs on the Company's systems. However, approximately 34% of the Company's operating revenues for 2020 were volumetric-based fee revenues. For more information, see \"Decreases in production of natural gas in our areas of operation have adversely affected, and future decreases could further adversely affect, our business and operating results and reduce our cash available to pay cash dividends to our shareholders.\" included in \"Item 1A. Risk Factors.\"\nPotential Future Impairments. During the first quarter of 2020, the Company recognized an impairment of long-lived assets of approximately $55.6 million, including $37.9 million related to certain Hornet Midstream-related gathering assets and $17.7 million related to certain Hornet Midstream-related intangible assets associated with the Eureka/Hornet reporting unit (as such terms are defined in Note 4 to the consolidated Financial Statements). See Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.\nThe accounting estimates related to impairments are susceptible to change, including estimating fair value which requires considerable judgment. For goodwill, management's estimate of a reporting unit's future financial results is sensitive to changes in assumptions, such as changes in stock prices, weighted-average cost of capital, terminal growth rates and industry multiples. Similarly, cash flow estimates utilized for purposes of evaluating long-lived assets and equity method investments (such as in the MVP Joint Venture) require us to make projections and assumptions for many years into the future for pricing, demand, competition, operating cost, commencement of operations, resolution of relevant legal and regulatory matters, and other factors. The Company evaluates long-lived assets and equity method investments for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate, in management's judgment, that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable (meaning, in the case of equity method investments, that such investments have suffered other-than-temporary declines in value under ASC 323). For the Company's equity investment in the MVP Joint Venture, management must evaluate the Company's investment for other-than-temporary declines in fair value under ASC 323. The Company believes the estimates and assumptions used in estimating its reporting units', long-lived assets' and its equity investment's fair values as of December 31, 2020 are reasonable and appropriate; however, assumptions and estimates are inherently subject to significant business, economic, competitive, regulatory, judicial and other risks that could materially affect the calculated fair values and the resulting conclusions regarding impairments, which could materially affect the Company's results of operations and financial position. Additionally, actual results could differ from these estimates and assumptions may not be realized. The Company also continues to evaluate and monitor the ongoing legal and regulatory matters related to the MVP and MVP Southgate projects that affect project completion, as further described in Item 3. Legal Proceedings.\u201d Adverse or delayed developments with respect to such matters or other adverse developments could require that the Company modify assumptions reflected in the probability-weighted scenarios of discounted future net cash flows (including with respect to the probability of success) utilized to estimate fair value of its equity investment in the MVP Joint Venture, which could result in an other-than-temporary impairment of that investment. See also Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements, Reviews of our goodwill, intangible and other long-lived assets have resulted in significant impairment charges and reviews of our goodwill, intangible and other long-lived assets could result in future significant impairment charges, including with respect to our investment in the MVP Joint Venture.\u201d included in Item 1A. Risk Factors,\" and the Company's discussion of \"Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates\" included in \"Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation.\"\nAs of the filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the Company cannot predict the likelihood or magnitude of any future impairment. However, the Company's closing stock price decreased by approximately 17% between January 15, 2021 and January 20, 2021. If the Company's stock price does not recover before the end of the first quarter of 2021, such change in the Company's market value during the first quarter may trigger a quantitative assessment for impairment for the first quarter of\n2021, which may result in the Company realizing impairments the magnitude of which the Company is unable to estimate as of the filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nFor a discussion of capital expenditures, see \"Capital Requirements\" below.\nCapital Resources and Liquidity\nThe Company's liquidity requirements are to finance its operations, its capital expenditures, potential acquisitions and other strategic transactions and capital contributions to joint ventures, including the MVP Joint Venture, to pay cash dividends and to satisfy any indebtedness obligations. The Company's ability to meet these liquidity requirements depends on the Company's cash flow from operations, the continued ability of the Company to borrow under its credit facilities and the Company's ability to raise capital in banking, capital and other markets (including refinancing existing credit facilities as they mature). Cash flow and capital raising activities (including the ability in refinancings to obtain similar terms to those currently present in existing credit facilities) may be affected by prevailing economic conditions in the natural gas industry and other financial and business factors (including market forces causing shifts in investor sentiment and credit allocations to industries and companies perceived as having better growth opportunities and/or stronger ESG metrics and practices, as well as the COVID-19 outbreak), some of which are beyond the Company's control. The Company's available sources of liquidity include cash from operations, cash on hand, borrowings under its subsidiaries' revolving credit facilities, issuances of additional debt and issuances of additional equity securities. As of December 31, 2020, pursuant to the terms of the Amended EQM Credit Facility and Amended 2019 EQM Term Loan Agreement, the Company would have been able to borrow approximately $2.0 billion under the Amended EQM Credit Facility. The amount the Company is able to borrow under the Amended EQM Credit Facility is bounded by a maximum consolidated leverage ratio specified in the Amended EQM Credit Facility, which ratio varies over the course of the term of the Amended EQM Credit Facility from not more than 5.75 to 1.00 to not more than 5.00 to 1.00 tested as of the end of each fiscal quarter. The Company's consolidated leverage ratio is derived from a number of components, including the amount of projected Consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the Amended EQM Credit Facility) from certain approved projects, including the MVP project, that is available to be included in the consolidated leverage ratio calculation under the Amended EQM Credit Facility. If the targeted in-service date for the MVP project is further delayed, such delay could result in a decrease in the amount of projected Consolidated EBITDA for future quarters, which, absent other actions which may be available to the Company to reduce its then-leverage, may further limit the Company's availability to borrow under the Amended EQM Credit Facility. See also Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements.\nSee Security Ratings\u201d below for a discussion of the downgrades of EQM's credit ratings during 2020. The non-investment grade ratings from Moody's, S&P and Fitch have caused the Company to incur higher borrowing costs under the Amended EQM Credit Facility and, prior to its termination, the Amended 2019 EQM Term Loan Agreement. As a result of the February 2020 downgrades (discussed below), EQM was also obligated to deliver additional credit support to the MVP Joint Venture in the form of letters of credit, which, in the case of the MVP project (based on the midpoint of the targeted cost for the project), is in the amount of approximately $231.2 million and is, in the case of the MVP Southgate, $14.2 million, in each case as of the filing date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Additionally, pursuant to the EQT Global GGA, if EQM does not maintain minimum credit ratings from two of three credit rating agencies of at least Ba3 with respect to Moody's and BB- with respect to S&P and Fitch, EQM will be obligated to provide additional credit support in an amount equal to approximately $196 million to EQT in support of the potential payment obligation related to the EQT Cash Option (the Cash Option Letter of Credit). See \"A further downgrade of EQM's credit ratings, including in connection with the MVP project or customer credit ratings changes, including EQT's, which are determined by independent third parties, could impact our liquidity, access to capital, and costs of doing business.\" included in \"Item 1A. Risk Factors.\"\nOperating Activities\nNet cash flows provided by operating activities were $1,140.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $976.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase was primarily driven by the timing of working capital receipts and payments, and a full year of cash flows generated by assets acquired in the Bolt-on Acquisition.\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash flows used in investing activities were $729.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $2,574.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease was attributable to cash used for the Bolt-on Acquisition in 2019, a $501.8 million decrease in capital contributions to the MVP Joint Venture in 2020 consistent with a lower level of construction activities for the MVP project and decreased capital expenditures. Capital expenditures decreased by approximately $505.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily due to decreased spending on the Hammerhead pipeline and various wellhead gathering projects, partly offset by increased spending on the Eureka Midstream gathering system in 2020 compared to 2019, which was acquired by the Company in April 2019.\nSee Capital Requirements\u201d below for a discussion of forecasted 2021 capital expenditures and capital contributions to the MVP Joint Venture.\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash flows used in financing activities were $291.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to net cash flows provided by financing activities of $1,392.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the primary source of financing cash flows was net proceeds from the 2020 Senior Notes issuance, while the primary uses of financing cash flows were the redemption of the EQM Series A Preferred Units, payment to retire the ETRN Term Loans, the payments of dividends and distributions to shareholders and unitholders and net payments of borrowings on the Amended EQM Credit Facility. The net proceeds from the 2020 Senior Notes were primarily used to repay borrowings on the Amended EQM Credit Facility. For the year ended December 31, 2019, the primary sources of financing cash flows were borrowings on the Company's and EQM's credit facilities, proceeds from the issuance of the term loans under the 2019 EQM Term Loan Agreement (defined in Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements), which were used primarily to pay down borrowings under the EQM Credit Facility, and the net proceeds from the issuance of the EQM Series A Preferred Units, which were used in part to fund the purchase price of the Bolt-on Acquisition and to pay certain fees and expenses related to the Bolt-on Acquisition, while the primary uses of financing cash flows were payments on the Company's and EQM's credit facility borrowings, the payment of dividends, the payments of distributions to noncontrolling interest unitholders, the Company's purchase of EQGP common units and the payment of distributions to holders of EQM Series A Preferred Units.\nSee Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements for discussion of the 2021 Senior Notes, the prepayment and termination of the Amended 2019 EQM Term Loan Agreement and the Tender Offers.\nCapital Requirements\nThe gathering, transmission and storage and water service businesses are capital intensive, requiring significant investment to develop new facilities and to maintain and upgrade existing operations.\nIn 2021, the Company expects to make capital contributions to the MVP Joint Venture of $670 million to $720 million depending on the timing of the construction of the MVP project and approximately $20 million for the MVP Southgate project. Capital expenditures for 2021 are expected to be approximately $370 million to $420 million (including approximately $20 million attributable to the noncontrolling interests in Eureka Midstream). The Company's future capital investments may vary significantly from period to period based on the available investment opportunities, the timing of the construction of the MVP, MVP Southgate and other projects, and maintenance needs. The Company expects to fund future capital expenditures and capital contributions primarily through cash on hand, cash generated from operations and borrowings under its subsidiaries' credit facilities.\nCredit Facilities\nSee Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for discussion of the Amended EQM Credit Facility, the Amended 2019 EQM Term Loan Agreement and the Eureka Credit Facility. See Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements for discussion of the prepayment and termination of the Amended 2019 EQM Term Loan Agreement.\nSecurity Ratings\nThe table below sets forth the credit ratings for EQM's debt instruments at December 31, 2020.\n\nOn February 4, 2020, S&P downgraded EQM's credit to a BB+ rating, with a negative outlook, from a BBB- rating following S&P's downgrade of EQT. On February 27, 2020, S&P further downgraded EQM's credit to a BB rating, with a stable outlook. On February 18, 2020, Fitch downgraded EQM to a BB rating, with a negative outlook, from a BBB- rating, citing a downgrade of EQT's credit rating from BBB- to BB, with a negative outlook, on February 14, 2020, as well as uncertainty around the MVP project, as the principal reasons for the ratings action. On February 27, 2020, Moody's downgraded EQM's credit from Ba1, with a negative outlook, to Ba2, with a negative outlook, citing EQT's weakening credit profile, risks to completion of the MVP\nproject and the increase to EQM's financial leverage resulting from actions in connection with the EQM Merger and the Share Purchases. On April 2, 2020, Moody's further downgraded EQM's credit", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with Item 1. Business,\u201d Item 1A. Risk Factors,\u201d and the consolidated financial statements, and the notes thereto, included in \"Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nThe information covered in this section provides a comparison of material changes in the Company's results of operations and financial condition for fiscal year 2020 and fiscal year 2019. For the comparison of fiscal year 2019 and fiscal year 2018, see \"Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019, filed with the SEC on February 27, 2020.\nExecutive Overview\nNet income attributable to Equitrans Midstream common shareholders was $364.4 million in 2020 compared with a net loss attributable to Equitrans Midstream common shareholders of $203.7 million in 2019. The increase resulted primarily from a decrease in impairment charges associated with long-lived assets on Gathering (as discussed in Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements), higher equity income from the Company's investment in the MVP Joint Venture, increased revenue from firm reservation fees primarily on Water and Gathering and unrealized gains on derivative instruments associated with the Henry Hub cash bonus payment provision, partially offset by lower volumetric-based fee revenues primarily due to the impacts of the EQT Global GGA, higher net income attributable to noncontrolling interests, higher income tax expense, preferred dividends associated with the Equitrans Midstream Preferred Shares, higher net interest expense, higher depreciation expense, higher selling, general and administrative expense and a loss on early extinguishment of debt.\nCOVID-19 Update\nThe ongoing COVID-19 outbreak has resulted in a severe global economic downturn and a recession of unknown duration and has caused increased volatility in and intermittent disruptions to the global financial and credit markets. The outbreak has directly resulted in a significant decrease in demand for oil and NGLs, at least in the short term, which caused extreme volatility in oil and other liquids prices and a significant negative impact to, at a minimum, the short- and medium-term outlook for oil prices. The downward pressure on oil prices was further exacerbated by the failure, in March 2020, of Saudi Arabia and Russia to agree to cut oil production, which contributed to a sharp drop in the price of oil (and at one point negative prices for oil) and an imbalance between the supply and demand for oil. The revised outlook for oil and other liquids prices caused a significant reduction in the number of operating drilling rigs in the United States, with a substantial portion of this reduction in rigs accounted for in shale plays targeted primarily at developing oil resources, including the Permian Basin. According to Baker Hughes, the average U.S. rig count fell to approximately 367 during January 2021, compared to an average rig count of approximately 791 during January 2020. This dramatic decrease in the number of operating drilling rigs has positively impacted the natural gas forward price strip based on the market expectation that the reduced or curtailed production of associated gas from basins such as the Permian Basin will at least in the near- and medium-term cause a reduction in the overall supply of natural gas which will more than offset reduced demand for natural gas as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak. See Commodity Prices\u201d under Outlook\u201d below for a further discussion of the current commodity price environment for the Company and its producer customers.\nFuture disruptions to the global financial and credit markets from the COVID-19 outbreak and related economic impacts could, both directly and indirectly, negatively impact the Company's financial condition and results of operations. The Company closed EQM's offerings of the 2021 Senior Notes (defined in Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements) and the 2020 Senior Notes (defined in Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements) in January 2021 and June 2020, respectively; however, there can be no guarantee that future disruptions to the financial and credit markets as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak and related economic impacts would not affect the Company's ability to again access such markets, if needed, on acceptable terms or at all. Further, certain of the Company's producer customers have significant capital needs, primarily to refinance existing indebtedness that matures during the next several years, and further disruptions or instability in financial and credit markets as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak and the economic disruptions therefrom may have a significant, negative impact on such producers' abilities to access the financial and credit markets and refinance existing indebtedness as it becomes due. If such producer customers have difficulty refinancing such indebtedness on acceptable terms or at all (or undertaking other transactions to generate cash for debt service), the Company's exposure to risk of nonpayment and/or nonperformance by its customers would increase. Additionally, the ability of the Company's producer customers to maintain or grow their production would likely be adversely affected as a result of such refinancing challenges, which would have a negative impact on demand for the Company's current services as well as the prospect of future pipeline expansion projects that would enhance the Company's business.\nFrom an operational perspective, while the COVID-19 outbreak has significantly impacted the manner in which the Company's employees and contractors perform their job functions, the outbreak has had, and continues to have, a minimal impact on the Company's overall operations. However, the situation surrounding COVID-19 remains fluid, and the Company continues to actively manage its response in collaboration with relevant parties, including its employees, contractors, customers and suppliers. As a midstream energy company, during applicable state-issued stay-at-home orders, the Company has been recognized as an essential business under various regulations related to the COVID-19 outbreak and continued to operate as permitted under these regulations. The Company has proactively undertaken a number of companywide measures intended to promote the safety of field and office-based employees and contractors. These measures include, among other things, establishing an Infectious Disease Response Team, instituting enhanced self-protection and office sanitation measures, eliminating non-essential business travel, implementing a mandatory work-from-home protocol for a substantial majority of the Company's employees through at least June 1, 2021, instituting face covering protocols, providing certain medical benefit enhancements, practicing social distancing in the field where possible, sharing the Company's infectious disease response plan with suppliers and contractors, and timely communicating updates to employees and other relevant parties. In addition, the Company has implemented additional mitigation efforts in connection with the remobilization of certain field employees and contractors. The Company's Infectious Disease Response Team continues to monitor and assist in implementing mitigation efforts in respect of potential areas of risk for the Company and its stakeholders. Additionally, the Company has provided support to local communities through corporate giving and the Equitrans Midstream Foundation. The Company's operations have been able to maintain a consistent level of effectiveness through the measures taken. The Company believes that it is following best practices under COVID-19 guidance and intends to continue to refine its practices as additional guidance is released and assess potential impacts from COVID-19 to its financial position and operating results, as well as any regulatory and legislative activities relating to COVID-19 that could impact its business.\nThe Company is unable to predict, in light of the ongoing and dynamic nature of the circumstances related to COVID-19 and the continued growth in COVID-19 infections in the United States (including in certain of the Company's areas of operation) and globally, any additional impact the outbreak may have on the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition. The extent of COVID-19's impact on the Company will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with any reasonable degree of certainty, including new information that may emerge concerning the severity of COVID-19, the duration of the outbreak, spikes in infection rates (including in the Company's areas of operation) and related economic effects and after effects (including on the natural gas industry), and actions taken to contain COVID-19 or its impact, including vaccine acceptance, distribution and effectiveness, among others. For further information regarding the potential impact of COVID-19, see \"The outbreak of COVID-19 (or any future pandemic), and related declines in economic output and demand for natural gas, could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.\" under \"Item 1A. Risk Factors.\"\nBusiness Segment Results\nOperating segments are revenue-producing components of an enterprise for which separate financial information is produced internally and is subject to evaluation by the chief operating decision maker in deciding how to allocate resources. Headquarters costs consist primarily of transaction costs and other unallocated corporate expenses. Net interest expense, components of other income and income tax expense are managed on a consolidated basis. The Company has presented each segment's operating income (loss), unrealized gain on derivative instruments, equity income and various operational measures in the following sections. Management believes that the presentation of this information is useful to management and investors regarding the financial condition, results of operations and trends of its segments. The Company has reconciled each segment's operating income (loss) to the Company's consolidated operating income (loss) and net income (loss) in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements.\nGATHERING RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Table 13: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>

provision. See \"Other Income Statement Items\" below for further information.\n(c)Includes volumes under agreements structured with MVCs.\n(d)Includes approximately $41.6 million and $25.9 million of capital expenditures related to noncontrolling interests in Eureka Midstream for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nYear Ended December 31, 2020 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2019\nGathering operating revenues decreased by $147.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. Firm reservation fee revenues increased by $14.6 million primarily due to a $196.6 million increase in MVC billed revenues primarily under the EQT Global GGA and a full year of MVC revenues generated by the operating entities acquired in the Bolt-on Acquisition, which closed in April 2019, partly offset by $225.7 million of deferred revenue in 2020 under the EQT Global GGA. Volumetric-based fee revenues decreased by $162.3 million primarily due to increased MVC revenues attributable to volumes that previously were subject to volumetric-based fees prior to the EQT Global GGA.\nGathering operating expenses decreased by $772.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily as a result of a $798.7 million decrease in impairment charges (as discussed in Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements), a $15.2 million decrease in separation and other transaction costs primarily given acquisition-related costs associated with the Bolt-on Acquisition and a $9.4 million decrease in operating and maintenance expense primarily associated with a decrease in repairs and maintenance expense, partially offset by an increase in non-income tax reserves. The decrease in such operating expenses was partly offset by a $28.7 million increase in depreciation expense as a result of additional assets placed in-service, including a full year of depreciation on assets acquired in the Bolt-on Acquisition, and a $9.9 million increase in amortization of intangible assets as a result of intangible assets acquired in the Bolt-on Acquisition and a corresponding adjustment to the useful lives of these intangibles (as discussed in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements). Selling, general and administrative expense increased by $12.2 million primarily due to higher personnel costs.\nSee \"Outlook\" and Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the impairment of long-lived assets. See also Outlook\u201d for discussions of certain customer production curtailments during the second and third quarters of 2020 and Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for discussions of the EQT Global GGA and the transactions related thereto, including the potential cash fee relief to EQT in connection with a further delay in the targeted MVP in-service date. The Company expects that the revenues resulting from the MVCs under the EQT Global GGA will increase the proportion of the Company's total operating revenues that are firm reservation fee revenues, and correspondingly decrease the portion of the Company's total operating revenues that are volumetric-based fee revenues, in future periods. Firm reservation fee revenues under the Company's Hammerhead gathering agreement with EQT (which is subject to a pending dispute with EQT) are also expected to contribute to an increase in the Company's firm reservation fee revenues. See also Outlook\u201d for discussions of the Hammerhead dispute with EQT and the Gulfport bankruptcy.\nTRANSMISSION RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Table 14: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

million and $913.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nYear Ended December 31, 2020 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2019\nTransmission operating revenues increased by $3.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. Firm reservation fee revenues increased by $8.0 million primarily due to customers contracting for additional firm transmission capacity, and volumetric-based fee revenues decreased $4.6 million due to lower throughput volumes primarily due to producer curtailments as a result of depressed natural gas prices.\nOperating expenses increased by $5.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily as a result of increased operating and maintenance expense and increased depreciation expense as a result of additional assets placed in-service.\nEquity income increased by $70.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 due to the increase in the MVP Joint Venture's AFUDC on the MVP as a result of continued spending on the project. Effective January 2021, the MVP Joint Venture temporarily suspended AFUDC accruals until growth construction activities resume. Depending on the timing for when growth construction may resume, the Company's equity income could be negatively impacted in future periods, and such impact could be substantial.\nWATER RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Table 15: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Years Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>%\nChange </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td>%\nChange </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>FINANCIAL DATA </td> <td>(Thousands) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Firm reservation fee revenues </td> <td>$ </td> <td>41,798 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>11,190 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>273.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Volumetric-based fee revenues </td> <td>62,910 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>68,601 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(8.3) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>111,227 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(38.3) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total operating revenues </td> <td>104,708 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>79,791 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>31.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>111,227 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(28.3) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating expenses: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating and maintenance </td> <td>29,131 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>34,638 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(15.9) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>44,152 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(21.5) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling, general and administrative </td> <td>5,941 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,933 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>102.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,895 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(50.2) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation </td> <td>30,880 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>26,915 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>23,513 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14.5 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total operating expenses </td> <td>65,952 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>64,486 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>73,560 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(12.3) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income </td> <td>$ </td> <td>38,756 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>15,305 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>153.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>37,667 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(59.4) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>OPERATIONAL DATA </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Water services volumes (MMgal) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Firm capacity reservation(a)\n</td> <td>697 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>249 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>179.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Volumetric-based services </td> <td>1,219 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,559 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(21.8) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,088 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(25.3) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total water volumes </td> <td>1,916 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,808 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,088 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(13.4) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capital expenditures </td> <td>$ </td> <td>11,905 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>37,457 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(68.2) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>23,537 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>59.1 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(a) Includes volumes under agreements structured with MVCs.\nYear Ended December 31, 2020 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2019\nWater operating revenues increased by $24.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. Firm reservation fee revenues increased by $30.6 million primarily as a result of increased revenues generated under agreements with MVCs. Volumetric-based fee revenues decreased $5.7 million primarily due to higher reservation fee revenues under agreements with MVCs and a decrease in customer hydraulic fracturing activity, partly offset by increased realized rates on a per gallon basis.\nWater operating expenses increased by $1.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily as a result of higher selling, general and administrative expense primarily due to increased bad debt expense associated with Gulfport's announced bankruptcy proceedings and higher personnel costs. Depreciation expense increased as a result of additional assets placed in-service. These increases were partly offset by lower operating and maintenance expense associated with the timing of costs related to customer activities on drilling pads.\nThe Company's water services are directly associated with producers' well completion activities and fresh and produced water needs (which are partially driven by horizontal lateral lengths and the number of completion stages per well). Therefore, the Water operating results traditionally fluctuate from year-to-year in response to producers' well completion activities. The Company expects Water operating income to be lower for the year ending December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020 primarily due to lower MVCs and an expected decrease in customer activity.\nOther Income Statement Items\nOther Income\nOther income increased $14.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily as a result of a $16.5 million unrealized gain on derivative instruments associated with the Henry Hub cash bonus payment provision entered into in the first quarter of 2020 and a $2.5 million increase in the net settlement of incentive compensation, partially offset by a $4.3 million decrease in AFUDC - equity.\nLoss on Early Extinguishment of Debt\nThe Company incurred a loss on the early extinguishment of debt of $24.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2020 related to the write off of unamortized discounts and financing costs on the ETRN Term Loan Credit Agreement (defined in Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements) and the Equitrans Midstream Credit Facility (defined in Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements) in the first quarter of 2020. See Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements.\nNet Interest Expense\nNet interest expense increased by $51.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily due to $56.1 million in higher interest expense associated with the 2020 Senior Notes, $22.1 million in higher interest expense on the EQM Term Loans (defined in Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements) and decreased capitalized interest and AFUDC - debt of $12.1 million, partially offset by lower interest expense of $39.8 million on the ETRN Term Loans as a result of their termination in March 2020.\nAfter accounting for the issuance of the 2020 and 2021 Senior Notes and use of those proceeds to pay off other outstanding debt, the Company expects interest expense to increase in future periods.\nSee also Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of certain of the Company's outstanding debt.\nSee Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements for discussion of the 2021 Senior Notes, prepayment and termination of the Amended 2019 EQM Term Loan Agreement and the Tender Offers.\nIncome Taxes\nSee Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements for an explanation of the increase in income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019.\nThe Company files a consolidated income tax return for federal income taxes and uses the asset and liability method to account for income taxes. EQM is, and for the period prior to the EQGP Buyout, EQGP was, a limited partnership for U.S. federal and state income tax purposes. Eureka Midstream is a limited liability company for such purposes. EQM, EQGP, and Eureka Midstream are not subject to U.S. federal or state income taxes.\nAll of Eureka Midstream's income is, for the period prior to the closing of the EQM Merger, all of EQM's income was, and for the period prior to the EQGP Buyout, all of EQGP's income was included in the Company's pre-tax income; however, the Company does not record income tax expense on the portions of its income attributable to the noncontrolling member of Eureka Midstream and did not record income tax expense on the portions of its income attributable to the noncontrolling limited partners of EQM and EQGP for the periods prior to the closings of the EQM Merger and the EQGP Buyout, respectively. This reduces the Company's effective tax rate in periods when the Company has consolidated pre-tax income. The Company expects its effective tax rate for periods following the EQM Merger to generally be higher than the pre-EQM Merger periods due to the decrease in net income attributable to noncontrolling interests as a result of the Company's acquisition of the outstanding EQM common units not held by the Company and its subsidiaries and related Restructuring in connection with the closing of the EQM Merger.\nNet Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests\nNet income attributable to noncontrolling interests increased for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily as a result of higher net income attributable to the noncontrolling interests in EQM and Eureka Midstream, partly offset by lower net income allocated to the EQM Series A Preferred Units prior to the closing of the Restructuring.\nThe Company recorded net income attributable to noncontrolling interest for the third-party ownership interests in EQM (including the EQM Series A Preferred Units) through the closing of the EQM Merger. Upon the closing of the EQM Merger on June 17, 2020, the Company's remaining noncontrolling interest consists solely of the third-party ownership interest in Eureka Midstream.\nCapital Expenditures\nSee \"Investing Activities\" and \"Capital Requirements\" under \"Capital Resources and Liquidity\" for discussion of capital expenditures and capital contributions.\nOutlook\nThe Company's strategically-located assets overlay core acreage in the Appalachian Basin. The location of the Company's assets allows its producer customers to access major demand markets in the U.S. The Company is one of the largest natural gas gatherers in the U.S., and its largest customer, EQT, was the largest natural gas producer in the U.S. based on average daily sales volumes as of December 31, 2020. The Company maintains a stable cash flow profile, with approximately 66% of its revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020 generated by firm reservation fees. Further, the percentage of the Company's revenues that are generated by firm reservation fees is expected to increase in future years as a result of the 15-year term EQT Global GGA, which includes an MVC that became effective on April 1, 2020 of 3.0 Bcf per day and gradually steps up to 4.0 Bcf per day for several years following the full in-service date of the MVP project. This contract structure enhances the stability of the Company's cash flows and limits its direct exposure to commodity price risk.\nThe Company's principal strategy is to achieve greater scale and scope and enhance the durability if its financial strength, which the Company expects will drive future growth and investment. The Company is implementing its strategy by leveraging its existing assets, executing on its growth projects (including through potential expansion and extension opportunities), focusing on ESG initiatives, and, where appropriate, seeking and executing on strategically-aligned acquisition and joint venture opportunities and other strategic transactions, while strengthening its balance sheet through:\n\u2022highly predictable cash flows backed by firm reservation fees;\n\u2022actions to de-lever its balance sheet;\n\u2022disciplined capital spending;\n\u2022operating cost control; and\n\u2022an appropriate dividend policy.\nAs part of its approach to organic growth, the Company is focused on its projects and assets outlined under \"Strategy\" in \"Item 1. Business,\" many of which are supported by contracts with firm capacity or MVC commitments. The Company believes that this approach will enable the Company to achieve its strategic goals.\nThe Company expects that the MVP project, together with the Hammerhead pipeline and EEP, will primarily drive the Company's organic growth and that its future growth also will be supported by the MVP Southgate project and water services business.\nEQT Global GGA. On February 27, 2020, the Company announced the EQT Global GGA, which is a 15-year contract that includes, among other things, a 3.0 Bcf per day MVC (which gradually steps up to 4.0 Bcf per day for several years following the in-service date of the MVP project) and the dedication of a substantial majority of EQT's core acreage in Pennsylvania and West Virginia to the Company. Under the EQT Global GGA, EQT will receive certain gathering fee relief over a period of three years following the in-service date of the MVP (as further described in Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements). The EQT Global GGA replaced 14 previous gathering agreements between EQT and the Company.\nUnder the EQT Global GGA, the performance obligation is to provide daily MVC capacity and as such the total consideration is allocated proportionally to the daily MVC over the life of the contract. In periods that the gathering MVC revenue billed will exceed the allocated consideration, the excess will be deferred to the contract liability and recognized in revenue when the performance obligation has been satisfied. Assuming a full in-service date in late 2021 for the MVP, the deferral to the contract liability is expected to increase by approximately $295 million and $6 million during 2021 and 2022, respectively. While the 3.0 Bcf per day MVC capacity became effective on April 1, 2020, additional daily MVC capacity and the associated gathering MVC fees payable by EQT to the Company as set forth in the EQT Global GGA are conditioned upon the in-service date of the MVP. There are ongoing legal and regulatory matters that must be resolved favorably before the MVP project can be completed which could have a material effect on the performance obligation and the allocation of the total consideration over the life of the contract and the gathering MVC fees payable by EQT under the contract.\nBased on the Henry Hub natural gas forward strip prices as of February 19, 2021 and the terms of the Henry Hub cash bonus payment provision, any delays in the in-service date for the MVP project, including beyond the most recent targeted full in-service of late 2021, would decrease the estimated fair value of the derivative asset attributable to the Henry Hub cash bonus payment provision, and such decrease may be substantial. Such changes in estimated fair value, if any, would be recognized in other income on the Company's statements of consolidated comprehensive income.\nFor a discussion of the Company's commercial relationship with EQT and related considerations, including risks associated with this relationship, see \"Item 1A. Risk Factors.\" See also Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements for additional\ninformation regarding the EQT Global GGA and the transactions related thereto. For further discussion on litigation and regulatory challenges affecting the completion of the MVP project, see \"Strategy\" under \"Developments, Market Trends and Competitive Conditions\" in \"Item 1. Business\" and \"Item 3. Legal Proceedings.\"\nHammerhead Pipeline. On September 23, 2020, EQT and certain affiliates of EQT instituted arbitration proceedings against the Company by filing a Demand for Arbitration with the American Arbitration Association. The arbitration arises out of the Hammerhead gathering agreement, pursuant to which the Company agreed to construct the Hammerhead pipeline and gather gas for EQT. EQT sought a declaratory judgment that it may exercise an early termination right and purchase the Hammerhead pipeline and related facilities under the terms of the Hammerhead gathering agreement. With its Demand for Arbitration, EQT also sought emergency relief, asking that an emergency arbitrator: (i) resolve the parties' dispute on the merits by October 1, 2020; or (ii) alternatively, toll the contractual deadline for EQT's exercise of its termination right, which was set to expire on October 11, 2020, until after the parties' dispute was resolved. On October 6, 2020, the emergency arbitrator issued an order denying EQT's request for emergency resolution on the merits but tolling the early termination deadline until the arbitration has been resolved. The Company's answer to the Notice of Arbitration was filed on October 8, 2020, and the parties are currently engaged in arbitration. The Company will vigorously defend against EQT's claims and litigate its rights, including the assertion of appropriate counterclaims.\nGulfport Bankruptcy. On November 13, 2020, Gulfport commenced bankruptcy proceedings. On November 24, 2020, Gulfport moved to reject its gas gathering agreements with the Company and made certain related court filings, which motions the Company has opposed. The Company and Gulfport have entered into negotiations related to the contracts. For the year ended December 31, 2020, Gulfport accounted for approximately 9% of the Company's operating revenues.\nCommodity Prices. The Company's business is dependent on continued natural gas production and the availability and development of reserves in its areas of operation. Low prices for natural gas and NGLs have adversely affected development of additional reserves and production that is accessible by the Company's pipeline and storage assets, which also negatively affects the Company's water services business. See COVID-19 Update\u201d under Executive Overview\u201d above for a discussion of the impact the COVID-19 outbreak has had on oil, NGLs and natural gas prices, and the positive impact lower oil prices are perceived to have on natural gas prices in the near- and medium-term, primarily as a result of corresponding declines in the production of associated gas in the United States which the market expects will more than offset reduced demand for natural gas as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak.\nHenry Hub spot and local spot natural gas prices, which were under pressure prior to the COVID-19 outbreak due primarily to a warmer than normal 2019 - 2020 winter heating season, a temperate spring 2020 season and an oversupply of natural gas (caused in part by the significant increase in production of associated gas from the Permian Basin and similar basins in recent years), were further pressured by a reduction in global demand for natural gas during 2020 (for which the COVID-19 outbreak was a contributing factor), lack of available natural gas storage and the continued significant supplies of natural gas being produced, particularly from the Appalachian Basin. The Henry Hub natural gas price ranged from $1.33 per MMbtu to $3.03 per MMbtu between January 1, 2020 and December 31, 2020, with some prices reflecting the lowest natural gas prices in more than 20 years. Further, market prices for natural gas in the Appalachian Basin continue to be lower than Henry Hub natural gas prices and were significantly lower during portions of 2020. Natural gas prices have improved since the spring of 2020 and are expected to further improve during 2021, as reflected by the natural gas forward price strip as of February 19, 2021, primarily due to demand, such as in the winter months, for natural gas potentially exceeding available supply (as a result of, in part, the decrease in associated gas production from the Permian Basin given the dramatic decrease in oil production caused by historical low oil prices during the first half of 2020). However, the length and extent of that price recovery (if any) and its effect on the development plans of the Company's customers, which impact both the Company's ability to execute new commercial agreements with its customers as well as the volumetric-based fee revenues the Company earns under existing contracts, will be impacted by global demand for natural gas, the length and severity of the 2020-2021 winter heating season, rates of natural gas production (including amounts of associated gas from the Permian Basin, which certain analysts are projecting will increase in 2021 and later years), and the length and severity of the COVID-19 outbreak. There is no assurance that the elevated natural gas prices indicated by the current forward natural gas price strip will be realized or be realized for any particular length of time, or that producers will increase production volume as a result of any particular price level.\nLower natural gas prices have caused certain producers, including customers of the Company, to determine to reduce their rig count (and thereby delay production), temporarily shut in portions of their production or otherwise take actions to slow production growth and/or reduce production, which when effected by the Company's producer customers reduces the demand for, and usage of, the Company's services. For instance, in May 2020 and September 2020, EQT publicly disclosed that it had made the strategic decision to temporarily curtail significant portions of its production, and certain other Company customers also curtailed portions of their production during the second and/or third quarters of 2020. The temporary production curtailments in 2020 resulted in a decrease in the Company's volumetric-based fee revenues for portions of 2020, and an extended period of low natural gas prices and/or a slow recovery of natural gas prices in 2021 could cause EQT or other\nproducers to take similar actions in the future, which could have a significant negative effect on the demand for the Company's services and therefore its results of operation.\nCertain of the Company's customers reduced their capital spending forecasts in 2020 as compared to 2019 capital expenditures and 2021. For example, EQT's 2020 capital expenditures were approximately $694 million, or 39%, lower than EQT's 2019 capital expenditures. Although EQT announced a modest increase in its 2021 capital expenditure forecast compared to EQT's 2020 actual capital expenditures, EQT's 2021 sales volume forecast is approximately flat relative to its pro-forma 2020 sales volume (adjusted for the Chevron Acquisition). Price declines and sustained periods of low natural gas and NGL prices could continue to have an adverse effect on the creditworthiness of the Company's customers and related ability to pay firm reservation fees under long-term contracts and/or affect activity levels and, accordingly, volumetric-based fees, which could affect the Company's results of operations, liquidity or financial position. Each of S&P, Moody's and Fitch took negative ratings actions on a number of Appalachian exploration and production companies during 2020, including EQT, Range Resources and Gulfport, citing, among other things, lower natural gas price assumptions and current and future financing needs (although all three ratings agencies have since taken positive action on EQT citing, among other things, subsequent debt reduction and improvements in natural gas fundamentals). On November 13, 2020, Gulfport filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, as further described above under \"Gulfport Bankruptcy.\" Many of the Company's customers, including EQT, have entered into long-term firm reservation transmission and gathering contracts or contracts with MVCs on the Company's systems. However, approximately 34% of the Company's operating revenues for 2020 were volumetric-based fee revenues. For more information, see \"Decreases in production of natural gas in our areas of operation have adversely affected, and future decreases could further adversely affect, our business and operating results and reduce our cash available to pay cash dividends to our shareholders.\" included in \"Item 1A. Risk Factors.\"\nPotential Future Impairments. During the first quarter of 2020, the Company recognized an impairment of long-lived assets of approximately $55.6 million, including $37.9 million related to certain Hornet Midstream-related gathering assets and $17.7 million related to certain Hornet Midstream-related intangible assets associated with the Eureka/Hornet reporting unit (as such terms are defined in Note 4 to the consolidated Financial Statements). See Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.\nThe accounting estimates related to impairments are susceptible to change, including estimating fair value which requires considerable judgment. For goodwill, management's estimate of a reporting unit's future financial results is sensitive to changes in assumptions, such as changes in stock prices, weighted-average cost of capital, terminal growth rates and industry multiples. Similarly, cash flow estimates utilized for purposes of evaluating long-lived assets and equity method investments (such as in the MVP Joint Venture) require us to make projections and assumptions for many years into the future for pricing, demand, competition, operating cost, commencement of operations, resolution of relevant legal and regulatory matters, and other factors. The Company evaluates long-lived assets and equity method investments for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate, in management's judgment, that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable (meaning, in the case of equity method investments, that such investments have suffered other-than-temporary declines in value under ASC 323). For the Company's equity investment in the MVP Joint Venture, management must evaluate the Company's investment for other-than-temporary declines in fair value under ASC 323. The Company believes the estimates and assumptions used in estimating its reporting units', long-lived assets' and its equity investment's fair values as of December 31, 2020 are reasonable and appropriate; however, assumptions and estimates are inherently subject to significant business, economic, competitive, regulatory, judicial and other risks that could materially affect the calculated fair values and the resulting conclusions regarding impairments, which could materially affect the Company's results of operations and financial position. Additionally, actual results could differ from these estimates and assumptions may not be realized. The Company also continues to evaluate and monitor the ongoing legal and regulatory matters related to the MVP and MVP Southgate projects that affect project completion, as further described in Item 3. Legal Proceedings.\u201d Adverse or delayed developments with respect to such matters or other adverse developments could require that the Company modify assumptions reflected in the probability-weighted scenarios of discounted future net cash flows (including with respect to the probability of success) utilized to estimate fair value of its equity investment in the MVP Joint Venture, which could result in an other-than-temporary impairment of that investment. See also Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements, Reviews of our goodwill, intangible and other long-lived assets have resulted in significant impairment charges and reviews of our goodwill, intangible and other long-lived assets could result in future significant impairment charges, including with respect to our investment in the MVP Joint Venture.\u201d included in Item 1A. Risk Factors,\" and the Company's discussion of \"Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates\" included in \"Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation.\"\nAs of the filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the Company cannot predict the likelihood or magnitude of any future impairment. However, the Company's closing stock price decreased by approximately 17% between January 15, 2021 and January 20, 2021. If the Company's stock price does not recover before the end of the first quarter of 2021, such change in the Company's market value during the first quarter may trigger a quantitative assessment for impairment for the first quarter of\n2021, which may result in the Company realizing impairments the magnitude of which the Company is unable to estimate as of the filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nFor a discussion of capital expenditures, see \"Capital Requirements\" below.\nCapital Resources and Liquidity\nThe Company's liquidity requirements are to finance its operations, its capital expenditures, potential acquisitions and other strategic transactions and capital contributions to joint ventures, including the MVP Joint Venture, to pay cash dividends and to satisfy any indebtedness obligations. The Company's ability to meet these liquidity requirements depends on the Company's cash flow from operations, the continued ability of the Company to borrow under its credit facilities and the Company's ability to raise capital in banking, capital and other markets (including refinancing existing credit facilities as they mature). Cash flow and capital raising activities (including the ability in refinancings to obtain similar terms to those currently present in existing credit facilities) may be affected by prevailing economic conditions in the natural gas industry and other financial and business factors (including market forces causing shifts in investor sentiment and credit allocations to industries and companies perceived as having better growth opportunities and/or stronger ESG metrics and practices, as well as the COVID-19 outbreak), some of which are beyond the Company's control. The Company's available sources of liquidity include cash from operations, cash on hand, borrowings under its subsidiaries' revolving credit facilities, issuances of additional debt and issuances of additional equity securities. As of December 31, 2020, pursuant to the terms of the Amended EQM Credit Facility and Amended 2019 EQM Term Loan Agreement, the Company would have been able to borrow approximately $2.0 billion under the Amended EQM Credit Facility. The amount the Company is able to borrow under the Amended EQM Credit Facility is bounded by a maximum consolidated leverage ratio specified in the Amended EQM Credit Facility, which ratio varies over the course of the term of the Amended EQM Credit Facility from not more than 5.75 to 1.00 to not more than 5.00 to 1.00 tested as of the end of each fiscal quarter. The Company's consolidated leverage ratio is derived from a number of components, including the amount of projected Consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the Amended EQM Credit Facility) from certain approved projects, including the MVP project, that is available to be included in the consolidated leverage ratio calculation under the Amended EQM Credit Facility. If the targeted in-service date for the MVP project is further delayed, such delay could result in a decrease in the amount of projected Consolidated EBITDA for future quarters, which, absent other actions which may be available to the Company to reduce its then-leverage, may further limit the Company's availability to borrow under the Amended EQM Credit Facility. See also Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements.\nSee Security Ratings\u201d below for a discussion of the downgrades of EQM's credit ratings during 2020. The non-investment grade ratings from Moody's, S&P and Fitch have caused the Company to incur higher borrowing costs under the Amended EQM Credit Facility and, prior to its termination, the Amended 2019 EQM Term Loan Agreement. As a result of the February 2020 downgrades (discussed below), EQM was also obligated to deliver additional credit support to the MVP Joint Venture in the form of letters of credit, which, in the case of the MVP project (based on the midpoint of the targeted cost for the project), is in the amount of approximately $231.2 million and is, in the case of the MVP Southgate, $14.2 million, in each case as of the filing date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Additionally, pursuant to the EQT Global GGA, if EQM does not maintain minimum credit ratings from two of three credit rating agencies of at least Ba3 with respect to Moody's and BB- with respect to S&P and Fitch, EQM will be obligated to provide additional credit support in an amount equal to approximately $196 million to EQT in support of the potential payment obligation related to the EQT Cash Option (the Cash Option Letter of Credit). See \"A further downgrade of EQM's credit ratings, including in connection with the MVP project or customer credit ratings changes, including EQT's, which are determined by independent third parties, could impact our liquidity, access to capital, and costs of doing business.\" included in \"Item 1A. Risk Factors.\"\nOperating Activities\nNet cash flows provided by operating activities were $1,140.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $976.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase was primarily driven by the timing of working capital receipts and payments, and a full year of cash flows generated by assets acquired in the Bolt-on Acquisition.\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash flows used in investing activities were $729.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $2,574.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease was attributable to cash used for the Bolt-on Acquisition in 2019, a $501.8 million decrease in capital contributions to the MVP Joint Venture in 2020 consistent with a lower level of construction activities for the MVP project and decreased capital expenditures. Capital expenditures decreased by approximately $505.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily due to decreased spending on the Hammerhead pipeline and various wellhead gathering projects, partly offset by increased spending on the Eureka Midstream gathering system in 2020 compared to 2019, which was acquired by the Company in April 2019.\nSee Capital Requirements\u201d below for a discussion of forecasted 2021 capital expenditures and capital contributions to the MVP Joint Venture.\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash flows used in financing activities were $291.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to net cash flows provided by financing activities of $1,392.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the primary source of financing cash flows was net proceeds from the 2020 Senior Notes issuance, while the primary uses of financing cash flows were the redemption of the EQM Series A Preferred Units, payment to retire the ETRN Term Loans, the payments of dividends and distributions to shareholders and unitholders and net payments of borrowings on the Amended EQM Credit Facility. The net proceeds from the 2020 Senior Notes were primarily used to repay borrowings on the Amended EQM Credit Facility. For the year ended December 31, 2019, the primary sources of financing cash flows were borrowings on the Company's and EQM's credit facilities, proceeds from the issuance of the term loans under the 2019 EQM Term Loan Agreement (defined in Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements), which were used primarily to pay down borrowings under the EQM Credit Facility, and the net proceeds from the issuance of the EQM Series A Preferred Units, which were used in part to fund the purchase price of the Bolt-on Acquisition and to pay certain fees and expenses related to the Bolt-on Acquisition, while the primary uses of financing cash flows were payments on the Company's and EQM's credit facility borrowings, the payment of dividends, the payments of distributions to noncontrolling interest unitholders, the Company's purchase of EQGP common units and the payment of distributions to holders of EQM Series A Preferred Units.\nSee Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements for discussion of the 2021 Senior Notes, the prepayment and termination of the Amended 2019 EQM Term Loan Agreement and the Tender Offers.\nCapital Requirements\nThe gathering, transmission and storage and water service businesses are capital intensive, requiring significant investment to develop new facilities and to maintain and upgrade existing operations.\nIn 2021, the Company expects to make capital contributions to the MVP Joint Venture of $670 million to $720 million depending on the timing of the construction of the MVP project and approximately $20 million for the MVP Southgate project. Capital expenditures for 2021 are expected to be approximately $370 million to $420 million (including approximately $20 million attributable to the noncontrolling interests in Eureka Midstream). The Company's future capital investments may vary significantly from period to period based on the available investment opportunities, the timing of the construction of the MVP, MVP Southgate and other projects, and maintenance needs. The Company expects to fund future capital expenditures and capital contributions primarily through cash on hand, cash generated from operations and borrowings under its subsidiaries' credit facilities.\nCredit Facilities\nSee Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for discussion of the Amended EQM Credit Facility, the Amended 2019 EQM Term Loan Agreement and the Eureka Credit Facility. See Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements for discussion of the prepayment and termination of the Amended 2019 EQM Term Loan Agreement.\nSecurity Ratings\nThe table below sets forth the credit ratings for EQM's debt instruments at December 31, 2020.\nTable 16: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>EQM </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Senior Notes </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Rating Service </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Rating </td> <td> </td> <td>Outlook </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Moody's\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Ba3 </td> <td> </td> <td>Negative </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>S&P\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>BB- </td> <td> </td> <td>Stable </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Fitch\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>BB </td> <td> </td> <td>Negative </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOn February 4, 2020, S&P downgraded EQM's credit to a BB+ rating, with a negative outlook, from a BBB- rating following S&P's downgrade of EQT. On February 27, 2020, S&P further downgraded EQM's credit to a BB rating, with a stable outlook. On February 18, 2020, Fitch downgraded EQM to a BB rating, with a negative outlook, from a BBB- rating, citing a downgrade of EQT's credit rating from BBB- to BB, with a negative outlook, on February 14, 2020, as well as uncertainty around the MVP project, as the principal reasons for the ratings action. On February 27, 2020, Moody's downgraded EQM's credit from Ba1, with a negative outlook, to Ba2, with a negative outlook, citing EQT's weakening credit profile, risks to completion of the MVP\nproject and the increase to EQM's financial leverage resulting from actions in connection with the EQM Merger and the Share Purchases. On April 2, 2020, Moody's further downgraded EQM's credit"}
