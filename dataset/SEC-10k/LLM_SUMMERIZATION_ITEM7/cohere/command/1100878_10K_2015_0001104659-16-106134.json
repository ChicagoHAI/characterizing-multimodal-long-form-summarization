In addition, the general causes to which certain price movements are attributed may or may not have caused such movements, but simply occurred at or about the same time.\nTable 14: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total Trading\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Year ended December 31, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Profit (Loss)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Energy\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 401,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Currencies\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1,024,801\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Agricultural Commodities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (409,117\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest Rates\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (231,887\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Stock Indices\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (384,125\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Metals\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 360,170\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (1,288,760\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Partnership experienced a net trading loss of $1,288,760 before brokerage commissions and related fees for the year ended December 31, 2015. The Partnership's profits were primarily attributable to energy and metals sectors. The interest rates, stock indices, agriculture and currency sectors posted losses.\nThe energy sector posted profits to the Partnership. Profits were posted to the Partnership at the beginning of the first quarter. The Partnership's short positions across the sector were profitable with natural gas and gasoil leading the way. Only RBOB gasoline failed to yield profit in January as, overall, energy continued to be a source of opportunity for the Trading Program. Losses were posted to the Partnership in the middle of the first quarter. February saw a waning of the downward price move as markets across the energy sector rallied and appeared to set a potential bottom after months of gloom. The Trading Program was hit hardest on its positions short Brent crude, gasoil, heating oil and RBOB gasoline and also suffered a slight loss for February in WTI crude. Profits were posted to the Partnership at the end of the first quarter. The Trading Program found its best opportunities in the energy sector. Despite a lot of intra-month price vacillation, prices ultimately moved downward in March and as a result the Partnership was able to capitalize on short positions in various components of its diversified investment models. Brent crude, heating oil, and RBOB gasoline offered the best outcomes and ultimately, only the\nPartnership's short position in crude oil lost money for March. Losses were posted to the Partnership at the beginning of the second quarter. In April, prices bolted upward to buck what had been a sustained downward move in recent months. The result for the Partnership was losses short the entire product spectrum: crude, Brent crude, gasoil, heating oil, natural gas, and RBOB gasoline. Losses were posted to the Partnership in the middle of the second quarter. In the energy markets prices whipped back and forth and ultimately caused losses for the Partnership's short positions in natural gas and crude oil and long positions across other markets including Brent crude, gasoil, and heating oil. Losses were posted to the Partnership at the end of the second quarter. In the energy sector, general market uncertainty characterized June as neither the Partnership's short positions in natural gas and crude oil nor its long positions in Brent crude oil, crude oil, gasoil or heating oil were able to find their way to profitability. Profits were posted to the Partnership at the beginning of the third quarter as the Partnership's short positions aligned nicely with downward price moves in crude oil, Brent crude oil, gasoil, and heating oil. Losses were posted to the Partnership in the middle of the third quarter. In energy, losses were largely uniform as the markets climbed during August against the Partnership's short positions. Profits were posted to the Partnership at the end of the third quarter. Investor concerns about waning global economic strength appeared to drive falling prices in Brent crude, oil, gasoil, natural gas and RBOB gasoline as they all conformed nicely to the Partnership's short positions and the result was a profitable September across the board in energies. Losses were posted to the Partnership at the beginning of the fourth quarter due to the Partnership's short positions in natural gas, crude, brent crude, heating oil, and gasoil. Profits were posted to the Partnership in the middle of the fourth quarter. In energies, November was driven by falling prices in natural gas, WTI crude, Brent crude, heating oil and gasoil, all of which appear to be in far greater supply than demand globally. Only the Trading Program's small investment short RBOB gasoline went against the Trading Program as global investors seemed to unite in a bearish outlook on energy that synched nicely with the Trading Program's short positions. Profits were posted to the Partnership at the end of the fourth quarter. The Trading Program was able to capitalize on the ongoing energy slump with short positions in crude oil, gasoil, Brent crude and heating oil.\nThe metals sector posted profits to the Partnership. Profits were posted to the Partnership at the beginning of the first quarter. Driving January's success were sharp downward moves in the copper and aluminum markets as industrial metals got caught in the downdraft of energy and equity prices. The Trading Program's short positions were not as successful in nickel and whippy gold and silver markets continued to test investment approach but, overall, profits in the sector outweighed losses to lead to a successful January in metals for the Partnership. Losses were posted to the Partnership in the middle of the first quarter. The Trading Program suffered losses shorting copper in the face of a solid rally in that market and also misplayed gold with an unsuccessful long trade and platinum with an unsuccessful short trade. Losses were posted to the Partnership at the end of the first quarter. The global metals sector was unprofitable for the Trading Program, particularly gold and silver markets that did not settle into any defined pattern. The industrial metals provided little sanctuary as only a short position in nickel yielded a profit for the Trading Program in March versus losing positions in copper, zinc and aluminum. Losses were posted to the Partnership at the beginning of the second quarter. In April, there was a price resurgence which caused the Partnership to sustain losses shorting industrial metals, aluminum, copper and nickel. Profits were posted to the Partnership in the middle of the second quarter. Global metals markets delivered positive results in May as a general downward price move lined up nicely with the Partnership's short positions. Base metals were the story for May as the Partnership booked profits on short positions in aluminum, copper and nickel but avoided the precious metals sector completely due to lack of opportunity. Profits were posted to the Partnership at the end of the second quarter. The global metals sector yielded profits for the Partnership in June as investor concerns about China and other factors drove industrial metal prices further downward throughout June. Specifically, the Partnership found profits on short positions in aluminum, copper and nickel. Profits were posted to the Partnership at the beginning of the third quarter. In July, the Partnership captured gold and silver's plummeting price moves for profits and added gains short several industrial metals including aluminum, copper, and nickel. Losses were posted to the Partnership in the middle of the third quarter. In metals, gold was the big story, spiking sharply in late August against the Partnership's short positions. Profits were posted to the Partnership at the end of the third quarter. The Partnership held short positions across the sector and by the end of September, nearly all of those positions, particularly those in industrial metals, resulted in profits including aluminum, copper, gold, nickel, silver and zinc. Losses were posted to the Partnership at the beginning of the fourth quarter. Gold would not pick a consistent path as it swayed on investor concerns regarding the U.S. Federal Reserve and other factors. Silver followed gold's indecisive lead to some degree and added to losses along with zinc. Profits were posted to the Partnership in the middle of the fourth quarter. Leading the way for the Trading Program was the global metals sector which moved downward substantially as November unfolded. Whether driven by investors' lingering concerns regarding China's demand for industrial metals or a weakening of the view that precious metals equal safety, the downward move in metals markets allowed the Trading Program to find profits. Losses were posted to the Partnership at the end of the fourth quarter. The Trading Program's gains on short positions in gold, silver, platinum, and nickel were offset by losses on short positions in industrial metals including copper, zinc, aluminum and lead.\nThe interest rate sector posted losses to the Partnership. Profits were posted to the Partnership at the beginning of the first quarter. Global bonds led the way for the Trading Program in January as investors reached for safety in the face of equity market retracement and ongoing downward price pressure on commodities. With bond prices rising around the world, most of the Trading Program's long positions were profitable in January with the best returns emerging in U.S. 30, 10 and 5 year treasuries, Japanese government bonds, and European Bobl. Additional profits were added in Australian and Canadian bond markets, and only the Trading Program's positions in the British Short Sterling and the U.S. 2 year treasury markets failed to make profits for the Partnership in January. Losses were posted to the Partnership in the middle of the first quarter. Global bond markets were challenging for February and the Trading Program was largely unprofitable across the board in the various markets in which the Partnership invests. Particularly challenging were the British Long Gilt and U.S. 30, 10 and 5 year treasuries, each of which whipped around and ultimately trended downward against the Trading Program's long positions during February as investor fears eased after a panicky January. Losses were posted to the Partnership at the end of the first quarter. Global bonds were perhaps the trickiest sector during March with prices vacillating in connection with commentary and speculation on the potential timing and magnitude of anticipated U.S. rate hikes resulting in losses incurred long the German bund and U.S. 30 year treasury. Losses were posted to the Partnership at the beginning of the second quarter. Long positions in the German Bund and French OAT 10 year were shaken out when prices in those markets dove and small profits across the U.S. yield curve and in Italian BTP 10 years were insufficient to offset those losses. Losses were posted to the Partnership in the middle of the second quarter. In global bonds, price choppiness was pronounced as prices ebbed downward for much of the first part of May and then shot back upward as May wound down. The net results of this vacillation were losses short the German Bund, French OAT and long the U.S. 10 year. Profits were posted to the Partnership at the end of the second quarter. The key to the Partnership's relative success in June was a strong month of global bond trading. Short positions in the German Bund and Bobl as well as the French OAT 10 year generated profits as those markets plummeted in the wake of emerging European chaos. Adding to the Partnership's gains were successful short positions in the U.S. 30 year and 5 year markets. Losses were posted to the Partnership at the beginning of the third quarter. The global bond sector's profits were elusive almost across the board. Just as many of the Partnership's models began to take short positions in the wake of a burst of European bond price softening, many global markets rallied causing the Partnership to incur losses in BTP Italian 10 years, German Bobls and Bunds and OAT French 10 years. Shorts versus the U.S. 30 and 10 year markets also lost money. Losses were posted to the Partnership in the middle of the third quarter. The bond market which at times vacillated with stock market twists and turns found itself predominantly long throughout August and ultimately was undercut by a downward chop across the U.S. yield curve in 2, 5, 10 and 30 year U.S. Treasuries. Bond markets outside of the U.S. proved indecisive for the Partnership and stayed neutral everywhere else with the exception of Canada where a small long position yielded a flat result for August. Profits were posted to the Partnership at the end of the third quarter as the Partnership generated a slight profit on long positions in both U.S. 2 years and 5 years bonds. Losses were posted to the Partnership at the beginning of fourth quarter. In the bond sector, the Trading Program's losses were primarily domestic as the Trading Program's long positions for October did not align with the U.S. yield curve. Losses were posted to the Partnership in the middle of the fourth quarter. In November global bonds bounced up and down on conflicting narratives about what the U.S. Federal Reserve might do with interest rates and other related factors. The Trading Program suffered losses with long positions in the Italian 10 year, and U.S. 2, 5 and 10 year bonds. Profits were posted to the Partnership at the end of the fourth quarter due to the Trading Program's long positions in the Italian 10 year bonds.\nThe stock indices sector posted losses to the Partnership. Losses were posted to the Partnership at the beginning of the first quarter due to the long positions in many facets of sagging U.S. equity markets. Profits were posted to the Partnership in the middle of the first quarter. The Trading Program was successful in the equities sector for February. Global markets rallied on solid economic and earnings data, constructive input from the U.S. Federal Reserve, and other inputs finding their way upward after a rough January correction from Australian SPI 200, NASDAQ, S&P 500, Dow Jones, Swedish OMX, German DAX and EU Euro Stoxx. Losses were posted to the Partnership at the end of the first quarter as the Trading Program suffered losses in the S&P 500, NASDAQ and the Dow. Profits were posted to the Partnership at the beginning of the second quarter. In April markets trended upward around the globe and the Partnership capitalized. Leading the way were long positions in Hong Kong's Hang Seng, China's H-Shares, Japanese Topix, German DAX, and EuroStoxx. The Partnership made money in several global equity markets. Profits were posted to the Partnership in the middle of the second quarter as the Partnership generated profits long the Dow, NASDAQ, S&P 500, and the Japanese Nikkei and Topix. Losses were posted to the Partnership at the end of the second quarter as the late-June panic over Greece caused sizable equity losses, bucking a trend that to that point had been largely positive for June. Losses were posted to the Partnership at the beginning of the third quarter because of long positions in various European indices such as the AEX, OMX EuroStoxx 50 as well as long positions in the Japanese Nikkei and Topix. Losses were posted to the Partnership in the middle of the third quarter. The damage was predominantly on the U.S. side of the ledger as the NASDAQ and the S&P 500 were erratic and uncooperative with the Partnership's systematic approach. On the global side of the ledger, the Italian FTSE MIB and South African FTSE JSE added to the losses. Losses were posted to the Partnership at the end of the third quarter as the Partnership sustained losses on long positions in the S&P 500 and short positions in the NASDAQ, the Dow, the German Dax, and India's Nifty. Losses were\nposted to the Partnership at the beginning of the fourth quarter. Sharply down in the early part of October then back upward and then, in some cases, back downward again, the least cooperative equity markets were Hong Kong's Hang Seng, Sweden's OMX and Japan's Topix and Nikkei. Profits were posted to the Partnership in the middle of the fourth quarter. The global equity sector began to show a somewhat consistent upward pattern over the second half of November allowing the Trading Program to finish the month profitably in this sector. Specifically, the Partnership had profits long positions in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, Hong Kong's Hang Seng, China's H Shares, the German DAX, Holland's AEX, and the Indian Nifty. Losses were posted to the Partnership at the end of the fourth quarter. Most challenging for the Trading Program in December were global equity markets. Down, up and then down again, stocks wavered throughout December on a variety of factors including sagging energy prices, the U.S. Federal Reserve's decision to slightly raise interest rates, and a myriad of geopolitical matters ranging from Middle East conflict to the U.S. election cycle. The Partnership had a profit short Euro Stoxx and Holland's AEX but beyond that, a series of relatively small losses across markets in Asia, Europe and the U.S. collectively overshadowed the Trading Program's few monthly gains.\nThe agriculture sector posted losses to the Partnership. Losses were posted to the Partnership at the beginning of the first quarter where wheat backtracked sharply against the Partnership's long position and caused a loss that outweighed small gains earned for the Partnership in long corn and short rubber and cotton positions. Profits were posted to the Partnership in the middle of the first quarter due to the Partnership's short positions in coffee and wheat, which aligned nicely with falling prices in those markets. Profits were posted to the Partnership at the end of the first quarter. Leading the way were short positions that captured a sharp drop in sugar prices and a less significant, but still profitable drop in coffee prices during March. Losses were posted to the Partnership at the beginning of the second quarter due to short positions in sugar. Profits were posted to the Partnership in the middle of the second quarter as downward price moves in coffee and sugar aligned well with the Partnership's ongoing short positions and rubber moved up slightly in support of a long position built by the Partnership as May unfolded. Losses were posted to the Partnership at the end of the second quarter as heavy rains and flooding in parts of the U.S. led to a negative crop report in late June. For the Partnership, the results were losses in short positions in coffee, corn, wheat and soybeans, along with losses on long positions in rubber. Losses were posted to the Partnership at the beginning of the third quarter. Most notable losses for the Partnership were long positions in wheat, soy products, and corn. Profits were posted to the Partnership in the middle of the third quarter. Leading the way were gains long positions in wheat and soybean meal and short positions in sugar and rubber. Profits were posted to the Partnership at the end of the third quarter. Profitable for the Partnership were short positions in live cattle, soybeans, coffee and rubber and those profits were sufficient to outpace relatively small monthly losses. Losses were posted to the Partnership at the beginning of the fourth quarter as gains in the Trading Program's short positions in soybeans were offset by losses in short positions in cattle and, to a lesser extent, sugar. Profits were posted to the Partnership in the middle of the fourth quarter due to the Trading Program's short positions in wheat, soybeans and coffee. Profits were posted to the Partnership at the end of the fourth quarter due to the Trading Program's short positions in soymeal, soybeans and corn.\nThe currency sector posted losses to the Partnership. Profits were posted to the Partnership at the beginning of the first quarter. A sharp loss short the Swiss franc on the Swiss government's mid-month bolstering effort was offset by gains short the Euro, Australian dollar, New Zealand dollar, Danish krone, and Singapore dollar, among other currencies. Losses were posted to the Partnership in the middle of the first quarter as the Trading Program incurred another monthly loss in Swiss francs as the Swiss National Bank continued a series of measures at intervention. Profits were posted to the Partnership at the end of the first quarter. In this sector, the U.S. dollar continued to surge versus most currencies and the outcome for the Partnership was profitable investing short the Euro, British pound, South African rand, and various other global denominations. Losses were posted to the Partnership at the beginning of the second quarter. In April, the Partnership sustained losses across its entire currency book including British pound, Australian dollar, Euro, Japanese yen, South African rand, and others. Profits were posted to the Partnership in the middle of the second quarter. Most successful for the Partnership was the global currency sector which delivered opportunities on both the long and short side. Specifically, after opening May with significant short positions in the British pound, the Partnership ended May long and over the course of several weeks, booked profits on both sides of the market. In respect of the Japanese yen, the Partnership was solidly long to start May, shifted to short by May's month end, and banked some profits on both sides. Adding to solid performance in the pound and yen, the Partnership booked profits short the New Zealand dollar, South African rand, and Euro and long the Swiss franc. Profits were posted to the Partnership at the end of the quarter. Key to June's success were the Partnership's positions long the British pound and short the New Zealand dollar as those two currencies moved nicely in opposite directions. Losses were posted to the Partnership at the beginning of the third quarter. In July, Europe was a flashpoint as the Partnership lost money long both the British pound and the Euro, and Asia proved tricky as well as an upward move against the Partnership's short positions in the Japanese yen was also unsuccessful. Losses were posted to the Partnership in the middle of the third quarter. Worst for August were the Partnership's short and later long positions in the Euro and Japanese yen. Profits were posted to the Partnership at the end of the third quarter. Global currencies also proved fruitful for the Partnership as the Partnership harnessed opportunities throughout September. In particular, the Partnership found profits through short positions in the South African rand, Singapore,\nCanadian and Australian dollars, and long positions in the Japanese yen. Losses were posted to the Partnership at the beginning of the fourth quarter due to the Partnership's short positions in the Australian dollar, Japanese yen, British pound, and various minor currencies including the Singapore and New Zealand dollars. Profits were posted to the Partnership in the middle of the fourth quarter. In November global currencies were profitable for the Trading Program as the U.S. dollar strengthened versus other global currencies. Leading the way for November was the Trading Program's short euro and Swiss franc positions. Losses were posted to the Partnership at the end of the fourth quarter as global currencies wavered indecisively as December unfolded. Small profits were posted to the Partnership from the Trading Program's short positions in the South African rand, Singapore dollar, and Norwegian kroner and similarly small profits were found investing in the Japanese yen, British pound and Canadian dollar. However, losses in the Trading Program's short positions in the Euro, Swiss franc, and Australian dollar outweighed other currency gains and resulted in a net loss for the Partnership in December.\nTable 15: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total Trading\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Year ended December 31, 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Profit (Loss)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Energy\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,224,231\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Currencies\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,956,862\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Agricultural Commodities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 262,187\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest Rates\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 368,190\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Stock Indices\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 196,685\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Metals\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1,112,781\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,895,374\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Partnership experienced a net trading profit before brokerage commissions and related fees for the year ended December 31, 2014 of $3,895,374. Profits were primarily attributable to the Partnership trading in the energy, currencies, interest rates, agriculture and stock indices sectors posting profits. The metals sector posted losses.\nThe energy sector posted profits to the Partnership. Profits were posted to the Partnership at the beginning of the first quarter as the Partnership captured the price move of natural gas triggered by winter weather across the U.S. Small losses in the Partnership's long crude oil positions were insufficient to offset the strong performance in natural gas. Profits were posted to the Partnership in the middle of the first quarter due to the Partnership's long positions in natural gas, crude oil and rbob gasoline. Losses were posted to the Partnership at the end of the first quarter as the energy sector calmed significantly in March. As a result, the Partnership was flat for March. Profits were posted to the Partnership at the beginning of the second quarter as the Partnership benefitted from a generally inactive energy sector. In April profits earned on long natural gas and Brent crude oil slightly outweighed losses in U.S. crude oil and RBOB. Losses were posted to the Partnership in the middle of the second quarter as small profits were earned long the crude oil market, but were outweighed with losses incurred long Brent crude, natural gas and RBOB gasoline. Losses were posted to the Partnership at the end of the second quarter. The Partnership's long positions across the oil and gas complex were largely bucked by a sector-wide downward price move for June. The Partnership's profits in crude oil were not enough to offset losses in other energy markets. Losses were posted to the Partnership at the beginning of the third quarter as investors apparently lost confidence in global energy demand. As a result, the Partnership suffered losses long Brent crude oil, WTI crude oil and RBOB gasoline. Those losses were too significant to overcome the Trading Program's gain short natural gas. Profits were posted to the Partnership in the middle of the third quarter as the Trading Program profited from the short gasoil and heating oil. Profits were posted to the Partnership at the end of the third quarter. Global energy markets offered investment opportunities as well. Specifically, the Partnership capitalized on sagging prices with short positions in gasoil, heating oil, Brent crude, natural gas, and RBOB gasoline. Profits were posted to the Partnership at the beginning of the fourth quarter due to the plummeting oil prices. As a result, continuing short positions in crude, Brent crude, gasoil, heating oil and RBOB gasoline all generated tidy profits. These energy profits where undercut only by a relatively small loss short the natural gas market which, as is often the case, bucked the broader downward price trend in energy. Profits were posted to the Partnership in the middle of the fourth quarter as energy prices plummeted throughout November and lead to profits for the Trading Program's short positions in crude, Brent crude, gasoil, heating oil, and RBOB unleaded gasoline. Profits were posted to the Partnership in the end of the fourth quarter. Most profitable in December was the plummeting energy sector which continued to unravel upon headline after headline regarding a global over-supply of energy products of all types. The Trading Program held short positions across the energy complex for December and all positions yielded profits whether in crude oil, Brent crude oil, Gasoil, heating oil, RBOB gasoline or even, natural gas.\nThe currency sector posted profits to the Partnership. Losses were posted to the Partnership at the beginning of the first quarter due to the sharp upward move in the Japanese yen that bucked 2013's downward trend and the\nPartnership's carryover short position from 2013. Adding to the losses were downward moves in the Swiss franc and euro that went against the Partnership's long positions. These outcomes could not be overcome by winning short trades against the Australian dollar and South African rand. Losses were posted to the Partnership in the middle of the first quarter as profits were outweighed by losses incurred shorting the Japanese yen, Australian dollar, and the South African rand. Losses were posted to the Partnership at the end of the first quarter due to the Partnership's long positions in the British pound and on both sides of the euro market. Profits were posted to the Partnership at the beginning of the second quarter. Currencies such as the British pound and Swiss franc moved upward in April and the Partnership's long positions in both markets benefitted as a result. Gains in these two currencies outweighed small losses short the Japanese yen and long the Australian dollar. The Partnership suffered losses in the middle of the second quarter due to a sharp reversal in the Euro, a downward movement in the Danish krone and New Zealand dollar, and an uptick in the South African rand. Profits were posted to the Partnership at the end of the second quarter. In June profits were obtained from the Japanese yen, British pound, New Zealand dollar, and Australian dollar as well as the short euro. Profits were posted to the Partnership at the beginning of the third quarter as short dollar positions bolstered gains. The strongest performers were short Euro and short Swiss franc, followed up by positions short Japanese yen, Czech koruna and Swedish krona. Profits were posted to the Partnership in the middle of the third quarter as the Trading Program benefitted from short the foreign currencies and long the dollar as the Euro, Japanese yen, Swiss franc, and Czech koruna all moved downward sharply in support of the Trading Program's investment approach. Profits were posted to the Partnership at the end of the third quarter. Leading the way were short positions in Swiss franc, Euro, and Japanese yen, all of which fell sharply at various points in September. Adding to the profits were investments short the Australian dollar, Danish krone, New Zealand dollar, Czech koruna, Norwegian krone, Swedish krona, and Polish zloty, all of which moved downward sharply as the world dealt with various macro developments. Overall, but for a loss generated by investing long the British pound, the Partnership found profits in currencies in which it invested. Losses were posted to the Partnership at the beginning of the fourth quarter due to the short Japanese yen, British pound, Singapore dollar and South African rand. Profits were posted to the Partnership in the middle of the fourth quarter. Most beneficial for the Partnership were short positions in Japanese yen and Singapore dollars. Additionally helpful were short positions in the British pound, euro, Australian dollar and Norwegian krone. Profits were posted to the Partnership in the end of the fourth quarter.\nThe interest rate sector posted profits to the Partnership. Losses were posted to the Partnership at the beginning of the first quarter. The bond sector was a disappointment in January. The Partnership's directional basket of global positions failed to gain profits, even with the U.S. Federal Reserve's reaffirmation of its plans to taper its easing policy. Overall, small gains in the U.S. and Japanese bond markets were insufficient to offset losses selling European markets such as the bund and gilt. Profits were posted to the Partnership in the middle of the first quarter. There were profits from the Partnership's long positions in the U.S. 5 and 10 year Treasury note markets as well as in Japanese, Canadian and British bonds that slightly outweighed losses long U.S. treasury bonds and German bunds. Profits were posted to the Partnership at the end of the first quarter. The Partnership's long positions in the German, British and longer-term U.S. treasuries generated profits that were sufficient to outweigh losses on the long side of Japanese bonds and shorter-term U.S. treasuries. Profits were posted to the Partnership at the beginning of the second quarter as rates largely moved downward and bond prices, conversely, upward in the U.S., Europe and Asia. In April leading the way for the Partnership were long positions of Japanese, German, and British longer-term bonds. Profits were posted to the Partnership in the middle of the second quarter as the Partnership's long positions rose across the yield curve. In May profits with no offsetting bond losses were in Europe (Bund, Bobl and Long Gilt), Asia (JGBs), and in the U.S. (medium and long-term treasuries). Losses were posted to the Partnership at the end of the second quarter. With the Partnership long (short interest rates) across the board, most of the markets moved sideways (Australia, Canada, and Europe) or downward (U.S.). Profits were posted to the Partnership at the beginning of the third quarter due to long bond positions. Specifically, the Partnership found profits on three continents - North America, Asia and Europe - as investors took cover from market unrest in fixed income investments of various durations. Profits were posted to the Partnership in the middle of the third quarter from the global bond sector where its long bond/short interest rate combination continued to bear gains for investors. Particularly productive in August were the Trading Program's positions long the U.S. 30 year and long bonds in Japan, Canada, and Germany. Losses were posted to the Partnership at the end of the third quarter. In the global bond markets, the price action was uniformly bad across geographies and durations. As a result, the Partnership lost money in each of its positions with the worst investments being U.S. 5, 10 and 30 years instruments. Losses were posted to the Partnership at the beginning of the fourth quarter due to German bund and European bobl markets. Profits were posted to the Partnership in the middle of the fourth quarter. Most successful for the Partnership were positions in U.S. 30, 10 and 5 year treasuries, Canadian Government Bonds, and German Bund as investors continued to flock to those markets and interest rates continued to stay low around the globe. Profits were posted to the Partnership in the end of the fourth quarter as global bonds which generally moved upward in price in stride with long positions across the Trading Program's portfolio. Most profitable in December were Japanese Government Bonds, U.S. 10 Year Treasuries, German Bobl and Bunds, British Gilts, and Australian and Canadian issues.

Losses were posted to the Partnership at the beginning of the fourth quarter as the agricultural sector, which reversed upward sharply in October whittled away many of its gains that the Partnership had made at the end of the third quarter. Coffee, corn, cotton, wheat, rubber, soy products and sugar all spiked against the Trading Program's short positions for October and the only mitigation came from an ongoing long position in cattle which generated profits.

Losses were posted to the Partnership at the beginning of the fourth quarter as many markets swung from peak to trough over the course of October. The types of whippy, irrational equity moves witnessed in view defy explanation but fundamentalists will point to everything from the Ebola crisis, to the Middle East, to perceptions of a softening Chinese economy.

Adding to the Trading Program's equity profits were gains in the Italian, European, and German stock indices as well as profits in various Asian markets. Profits were posted to the Partnership in the middle of the quarter where the 2013 bull market continued to run upward in November. Leading the charge were China H-shares and the S&P which surged on positive economic indicators as November came to a close. Also, the NASDAQ, Japan's Nikkei and Germany's DAX, all added profits from an equity index standpoint. Profits were posted to the Partnership at the end of the fourth quarter.

Most harmful to the Trading Program was a price rally in gold and copper. Losses were posted to the Partnership in the middle of the third quarter as the downward trend that has prevailed for much of 2013 stalled and then reversed course for much of August. Losses across the board against the Trading Program's short positions in silver, aluminum, gold, and copper drove unprofitable trading with nickel being the only metals market from which the Trading Program emerged unscathed. Profits were posted to the Partnership at the end of the third quarter. Losses were posted to the Partnership at the beginning of the fourth quarter. No news was good news for the Partnership in metals as a relatively low volatility environment kept the Trading Program largely inactive for October and out of any trouble that might have undercut the profits generated in other sectors. Profits were posted to the Partnership in the middle of the fourth quarter due to the Trading Program's sizable profits with its short positions against global metals markets. Tumbling prices in the copper markets led the way for the Trading Program's profitable November in metals with gold closely following suit.

Profits were posted to the Partnership at the beginning of the first quarter. The sharp downward move in the Japanese yen that began late 2012 accelerated in January and led to profit taking by the Trading Program. Complementing the Japanese yen's productive move was an upward surge in the euro and European minor currencies. Profits were also found shorting the South African rand which continued a downward trend and further bolstered the Trading Program's January performance in currency. These trading gains were sufficient to offset\nlosses suffered when the Swiss franc and Australian dollar moved against the Trading Program's long positions and the British pound spiked upward against the Trading Program's short position. Losses in the euro, Swiss franc, Australian dollar and a range of minor European currencies outweighed gains in the British pound, Japanese yen, and South African rand resulting in losses posted to the Partnership in the middle of the first quarter. Profits were posted to the Partnership at the end of the first quarter. March began with the Trading Program's short euro trade causing a loss, which was offset by winning short positions in the Japanese yen, Swiss franc and South African rand. Profits were posted to the Partnership at the beginning of the second quarter. Currency trading was essentially flat for April as profitable trades such as long positions in the euro and Swiss franc and short positions in the Japanese yen were offset by long positions in the Australian dollar and short positions in the British pound and South African rand. Profits were posted to the Partnership in the middle of the second quarter. The Trading Program's short trades in the Australian dollar made money as it declined amid numbers out of China that pointed to a slowing economy and the prospect of softening demand for Australian commodities. The Trading Program short Japanese yen plays against the U.S. dollar, British pound and Euro were all profitable. The South African rand weakening against the U.S. dollar benefitted the Trading Program. Losses were posted to the Partnership at the end of the second quarter. Profits from the Trading Program's Australian dollar and buying British pounds and Euros were not enough to offset losses incurred shorting the Japanese yen, Singapore dollar, New Zealand dollar, and South African rand. Losses were posted to the Partnership at the beginning of the third quarter as the British pound (long), Japanese yen (short), and New Zealand dollar (short) all moved against the Trading Program. Profits were posted to the Partnership in the middle of the third quarter as the Trading Program captured profits in short Australian dollar and Japanese yen positions. Long Swiss franc and short New Zealand and Singapore dollar positions also generated profits. Losses were posted to the Partnership at the end of the third quarter. Most damaging was the Australian dollar which spiked upward sharply against the Trading Program's short position such that it turned many of the models to the long side by month end. Compounding the harm were losses in the Singapore dollar, South African rand, New Zealand dollar, and Japanese yen, all of which strengthened against the U.S. dollar upon the U.S. Federal Reserve's decision not to taper quantitative easing. However, the British pound and Euro moved upward in support of the Trading Program's long positions in those markets and mitigated some losses. Profits were posted to the Partnership at the beginning of the fourth quarter. No news was good news for the Partnership in currencies as a relatively low volatility environment kept the Trading Program largely inactive for October and out of any trouble that might have undercut the profits generated in other sectors.

Additional profits were long the Swiss franc, and short the Australian dollar and euro.\nThe agriculture sector posted profits to the Partnership.

Profits were posted to the Partnership in the middle of the second quarter resulting from the Trading Program's short positions in grains and softs. Profits were posted to the Partnership at the end of the second quarter resulting from the Trading Program's short position in wheat. Profits were posted to the Partnership at the beginning of the third quarter as falling corn, soybean and soymeal prices made for good trading opportunities, particularly for some of the Trading Program's shorter term investment models. Wheat and rubber generated small losses which were overshadowed by the Trading Program's gains in corn and the soybean complex.

Losses were posted to the Partnership at the beginning of the first quarter. In particular, the U.S. and European interest rates moved downward against the Trading Program's short bond positions. Losses were posted to the Partnership in the middle of the first quarter due to small losses in\nEuropean interest rates. Profits were posted to the Partnership at the end of the first quarter due to the Trading Program's long bond/short interest rate positions across Europe and in Japan and long T- note/short rate positions in the U.S. Profits were posted to the Partnership at the beginning of the second quarter. Fixed income trading was profitable April as long bond/short rate positions in both Germany and across the U.S. yield curve all turned profits posted to the Partnership which offset losses on the Trading Program's long bond/short rate position in Japan. Losses were posted to the Partnership in the middle of the second quarter. The interest rate sector lost money across the board, appearing to be principally driven by U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke's comments that the Federal Reserve may reduce its bond purchasing program given recent signs of an improving economy. Markets reacted strongly to this, with the yield on the U.S. ten year Treasury note. This material move caused the Trading Program to exit its long positions held at the beginning of the month and go short U.S. treasuries across the yield curve. Profits were posted to the Partnership at the end of the second quarter. The Trading Program captured profits with short positions across the U.S. yield curve and Canada. Losses were posted to the Partnership at the beginning of the third quarter. Fixed income markets, after offering some good shorting opportunities early in July, settled into a fairly indecisive pattern that ultimately led to small Trading Program losses for the month. The least helpful markets were in Europe where bobl and bund futures turned against the Trading Program's short positions. The Trading Program's ongoing short positions along the U.S. yield curve garnered nearly offsetting profits as U.S. bonds continue to lose value. Profits were posted to the Partnership in the middle of the third quarter from the Trading Program's short positions in the global bond market. The Trading Program's short positions in the back end of the curve in the United States, Canada and Europe proved profitable. Losses were posted to the Partnership at the end of the third quarter as the downward move in bond prices and corresponding uptick in interest rates that had characterized the previous several months reversed course sharply upon the U.S. Federal Reserve's decision to maintain its current level of quantitative easing. Also corresponding losses in Europe's bund market added to the losses at the end of September. Profits were posted to the Partnership at the beginning of the fourth quarter. Profits were posted to the Partnership in the middle of the fourth quarter. In the bond markets, the Trading Program was essentially flat for November as there was little price action in any of the global markets the Partnership trades in and a limited book of existing positions, a mix of longs and shorts, largely held steady for November. Profits were posted to the Partnership at the end of the fourth quarter as interest rates started to creep upward on the U.S. Federal Reserve's tapering indication and drove bond prices into a downward move. While not all markets were as responsive to the U. S. Federal Reserve's tapering indication as others, profits resulted from short positions in the German bund market and on longer term segments of the U.S. yield curve. These profits were sufficient to outweigh losses in the European BOBL market.\nThe energy sector posted losses to the Partnership. Profits were posted to the Partnership at the beginning of the first quarter. Most notably, crude oil spiked sharply yielding profits for the Trading Program. Supplementing these profits were favorable trades in heating oil, and various gasoline markets. Losses were posted to the Partnership in the middle of the first quarter. Strong upward trends and seemingly orderly pullbacks were disrupted by unpredicted price turmoil when an unidentified investor sold large quantities of crude oil futures within a very short time window toward the end of February. This occurrence reduced prices below the Trading Program's risk tolerances and forced the Trading Program out of trading positions that otherwise appeared on track to produce positive returns. The Trading Program also generated losses in unleaded gas, gas oil, heating oil and Brent crude. Profits were posted to the Partnership at the end of the first quarter as the Trading Program's long natural gas trade toward the end of March generated gains to offset losses realized by shorting the same market in early March. Losses were posted to the Partnership at the beginning of the second quarter resulting from the downward price movement that persisted for much of the year in oil and gas products stalled and reversed just enough to undercut many of the Trading Program's short positions. Losses were posted to the Partnership in the middle of the second quarter. Volatility in natural gas led to losses that tipped the sector into negative territory in May. Profits were posted to the Partnership at the end of the second quarter resulting from price fall-offs in RBOB gasoline, gasoil and Brent crude. Losses were posted to the Partnership at the beginning of the third quarter. The energy sector was neutral for the month of July as small profits buying Brent crude, crude and gasoil and selling natural gas were offset by small losses in the heating oil and RBOB markets. Profits were posted to the Partnership in the middle of the third quarter as the Trading Program profited from the long positions that captured sharp price spikes in the Brent and crude oil markets. The gains in these trades outpaced small losses in natural gas and heating oil. Losses were posted to the Partnership at the end of the third quarter. After the prospect of military action in Syria seemed to subside, energy prices, which had risen due to the possibility of conflict in the Middle East, sold off across the board. Gas and crude oil proved to be particularly troublesome and heating oil, Brent crude, RBOB and even natural gas added to the Trading Program's negative performance in energy for September. Losses were posted to the Partnership at the beginning of the fourth quarter. No news was good news for the Partnership in energy as a relatively low volatility environment kept the Trading Program largely inactive for October and out of any trouble that might have undercut the profits generated in other sectors. Losses were posted to the Partnership in the middle of the fourth quarter. The volatility patterns that characterized 2013 continued in November when upward price moves in natural gas and Brent crude suddenly bucked the Trading Program's short positions and caused additional losses in energies. Profits were posted to the Partnership at the end of the fourth quarter. After a year in which opportunities in the sector were far and few between, energies delivered positive returns for December. Most of the profit came from various long trades in natural gas which spiked significantly\nduring December as an early winter enveloped much of the U.S. Adding to the month's results were profitable long positions in the crude oil market.\nVariables Affecting Performance\nThe principal variables that determine the net performance of the Partnership are gross profitability from the Partnership's trading activities and interest income.\nThe Partnership receives an interest based on the daily effective federal funds rate less 20 basis points on their U.S. dollar deposits. Other rates exist for the non U.S. dollar deposits, however, most of the Partnership's cash is held in U.S. dollars. The current short term interest rates have remained extremely low when compared with historical rates and thus has contributed negligible amounts to overall Partnership performance.\nDuring all periods set forth above in \u201cSelected Financial Data\u201d, the interest rates in many countries were at unusually low levels. In addition, low interest rates are frequently associated with reduced fixed income market volatility, and in static markets the Partnership's profit potential generally tends to be diminished. On the other hand, during periods of higher interest rates, the relative attractiveness of a high risk investment such as the Partnership may be reduced as compared to high yielding and much lower risk fixed-income investments.\nThe Partnership's brokerage commissions and administrative fees are a constant percentage of the Partnership costs, other than the insignificant currency trading costs which are not based on a percentage of the Partnership's assets allocated to trading or total. The Profit Shares payable to the Trading Advisor are based on the New Trading Profits generated by the Partnership excluding interest and after reduction for a portion of the brokerage commissions.\nUnlike many investment fields, there is no meaningful distinction in the operation of the Partnership between realized and unrealized profits. Most of the contracts traded by the Partnership are highly liquid and can be closed out at any time.\nExcept in unusual circumstances, factors-regulatory approvals, cost of goods sold, employee relations and the like-which often materially affect an operating business, have no material impact on the Partnership.\nLiquidity; Capital Resources\nThe Partnership borrows only to a limited extent and only on a strictly short-term basis in order to finance losses on non-U.S. dollar denominated trading positions pending the conversion of the Partnership's U.S. dollar deposits. These borrowings are at a prevailing short-term rate in the relevant currency.\nSubstantially all of the Partnership's assets are held in cash with the brokers. Changes in interest rates could cause periods of strong up or down price trends, during which the Partnership's profit or loss potential might increase. Inflation in commodity prices could also generate price movements, which the strategies might successfully follow.\nThe Partnership should be able to close out its open trading positions and liquidate its holdings relatively quickly and at market prices, except in unusual circumstances. This typically permits the Partnership to limit losses as well as reduce market exposure on short notice should its strategies indicate doing so.\nAs a commodity pool, the Partnership maintains an extremely large percentage of its assets in cash, which it must have available to post initial and variation margin on futures contracts. This cash is also used to fund redemptions. While the Partnership has the ability to fund redemption proceeds from liquidating positions, as a practical matter positions are not liquidated to fund redemptions. In the event that positions were liquidated to fund redemptions, MLAI, as the General Partner of the Partnership, has the ability to override decisions of the Trading Advisor to fund redemptions if necessary, but in practice the Trading Advisor would determine in its discretion which investments should be liquidated.\nThe Partnership has no applicable off-balance sheet arrangements or tabular disclosure of contractual obligations of the type described in Items 303(a)(4) and 303(a)(5) of Regulation S-K.\nRecent Accounting Developments\nRecent accounting developments, if any, are discussed in the notes to the financial statements, which are included in Exhibit 13.01", "summary": "- For the year ending December 31, 2013, the Partnership posted profits in 8 out of 4 quarters, and suffered losses in the other 4 quarters.\n- Profits were primarily attributable to the Partnership trading in the energy, currencies, interest rates, agriculture and stock indices sectors posting profits.\n- Losses were posted to the Partnership in the middle of the first quarter.\n- Profits were posted to the Partnership at the end of the first quarter.\n- Losses were posted to the Partnership at the beginning of the second quarter.\n- Profits were posted to the Partnership in the middle of the second quarter.\n- Losses were posted to the Partnership at the end of the quarter.\n- Losses were posted to the Partnership at the beginning of the third quarter.\n- Losses were posted to the Partnership in the middle of the third quarter.\n- Profits were posted to the Partnership at the end of the third quarter.\n- Losses were posted to the Partnership at the beginning of the fourth quarter.\n- Profits were posted to the Partnership in the middle of the fourth quarter.\n- Losses were posted to the Partnership at the end of the fourth quarter.", "item_7_tables": "Table 14: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total Trading\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Year ended December 31, 2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Profit (Loss)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Energy\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 401,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Currencies\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1,024,801\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Agricultural Commodities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (409,117\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest Rates\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (231,887\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Stock Indices\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (384,125\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Metals\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 360,170\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (1,288,760\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n</table>Table 15: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total Trading\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Year ended December 31, 2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Profit (Loss)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Energy\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,224,231\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Currencies\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,956,862\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Agricultural Commodities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 262,187\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest Rates\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 368,190\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Stock Indices\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 196,685\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Metals\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1,112,781\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,895,374\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>Table 16: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total Trading\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Year ended December 31, 2013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Profit (Loss)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Energy\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (1,974,070\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Currencies\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 488,421\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Agricultural Commodities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 478,801\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest Rates\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (1,225,655\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Stock Indices\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,191,876\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Metals\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,894,769\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 6,854,142\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>", "item_7_text": "Item 7: Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe Partnership's critical accounting policies are as follows:\n\u00b7 Preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that may affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements.

In addition, the general causes to which certain price movements are attributed may or may not have caused such movements, but simply occurred at or about the same time.\n\nThe Partnership experienced a net trading loss of $1,288,760 before brokerage commissions and related fees for the year ended December 31, 2015. The Partnership's profits were primarily attributable to energy and metals sectors. The interest rates, stock indices, agriculture and currency sectors posted losses.\nThe energy sector posted profits to the Partnership. Profits were posted to the Partnership at the beginning of the first quarter. The Partnership's short positions across the sector were profitable with natural gas and gasoil leading the way. Only RBOB gasoline failed to yield profit in January as, overall, energy continued to be a source of opportunity for the Trading Program. Losses were posted to the Partnership in the middle of the first quarter. February saw a waning of the downward price move as markets across the energy sector rallied and appeared to set a potential bottom after months of gloom. The Trading Program was hit hardest on its positions short Brent crude, gasoil, heating oil and RBOB gasoline and also suffered a slight loss for February in WTI crude. Profits were posted to the Partnership at the end of the first quarter. The Trading Program found its best opportunities in the energy sector. Despite a lot of intra-month price vacillation, prices ultimately moved downward in March and as a result the Partnership was able to capitalize on short positions in various components of its diversified investment models. Brent crude, heating oil, and RBOB gasoline offered the best outcomes and ultimately, only the\nPartnership's short position in crude oil lost money for March. Losses were posted to the Partnership at the beginning of the second quarter. In April, prices bolted upward to buck what had been a sustained downward move in recent months. The result for the Partnership was losses short the entire product spectrum: crude, Brent crude, gasoil, heating oil, natural gas, and RBOB gasoline. Losses were posted to the Partnership in the middle of the second quarter. In the energy markets prices whipped back and forth and ultimately caused losses for the Partnership's short positions in natural gas and crude oil and long positions across other markets including Brent crude, gasoil, and heating oil. Losses were posted to the Partnership at the end of the second quarter. In the energy sector, general market uncertainty characterized June as neither the Partnership's short positions in natural gas and crude oil nor its long positions in Brent crude oil, crude oil, gasoil or heating oil were able to find their way to profitability. Profits were posted to the Partnership at the beginning of the third quarter as the Partnership's short positions aligned nicely with downward price moves in crude oil, Brent crude oil, gasoil, and heating oil. Losses were posted to the Partnership in the middle of the third quarter. In energy, losses were largely uniform as the markets climbed during August against the Partnership's short positions. Profits were posted to the Partnership at the end of the third quarter. Investor concerns about waning global economic strength appeared to drive falling prices in Brent crude, oil, gasoil, natural gas and RBOB gasoline as they all conformed nicely to the Partnership's short positions and the result was a profitable September across the board in energies. Losses were posted to the Partnership at the beginning of the fourth quarter due to the Partnership's short positions in natural gas, crude, brent crude, heating oil, and gasoil. Profits were posted to the Partnership in the middle of the fourth quarter. In energies, November was driven by falling prices in natural gas, WTI crude, Brent crude, heating oil and gasoil, all of which appear to be in far greater supply than demand globally. Only the Trading Program's small investment short RBOB gasoline went against the Trading Program as global investors seemed to unite in a bearish outlook on energy that synched nicely with the Trading Program's short positions. Profits were posted to the Partnership at the end of the fourth quarter. The Trading Program was able to capitalize on the ongoing energy slump with short positions in crude oil, gasoil, Brent crude and heating oil.\nThe metals sector posted profits to the Partnership. Profits were posted to the Partnership at the beginning of the first quarter. Driving January's success were sharp downward moves in the copper and aluminum markets as industrial metals got caught in the downdraft of energy and equity prices. The Trading Program's short positions were not as successful in nickel and whippy gold and silver markets continued to test investment approach but, overall, profits in the sector outweighed losses to lead to a successful January in metals for the Partnership. Losses were posted to the Partnership in the middle of the first quarter. The Trading Program suffered losses shorting copper in the face of a solid rally in that market and also misplayed gold with an unsuccessful long trade and platinum with an unsuccessful short trade. Losses were posted to the Partnership at the end of the first quarter. The global metals sector was unprofitable for the Trading Program, particularly gold and silver markets that did not settle into any defined pattern. The industrial metals provided little sanctuary as only a short position in nickel yielded a profit for the Trading Program in March versus losing positions in copper, zinc and aluminum. Losses were posted to the Partnership at the beginning of the second quarter. In April, there was a price resurgence which caused the Partnership to sustain losses shorting industrial metals, aluminum, copper and nickel. Profits were posted to the Partnership in the middle of the second quarter. Global metals markets delivered positive results in May as a general downward price move lined up nicely with the Partnership's short positions. Base metals were the story for May as the Partnership booked profits on short positions in aluminum, copper and nickel but avoided the precious metals sector completely due to lack of opportunity. Profits were posted to the Partnership at the end of the second quarter. The global metals sector yielded profits for the Partnership in June as investor concerns about China and other factors drove industrial metal prices further downward throughout June. Specifically, the Partnership found profits on short positions in aluminum, copper and nickel. Profits were posted to the Partnership at the beginning of the third quarter. In July, the Partnership captured gold and silver's plummeting price moves for profits and added gains short several industrial metals including aluminum, copper, and nickel. Losses were posted to the Partnership in the middle of the third quarter. In metals, gold was the big story, spiking sharply in late August against the Partnership's short positions. Profits were posted to the Partnership at the end of the third quarter. The Partnership held short positions across the sector and by the end of September, nearly all of those positions, particularly those in industrial metals, resulted in profits including aluminum, copper, gold, nickel, silver and zinc. Losses were posted to the Partnership at the beginning of the fourth quarter. Gold would not pick a consistent path as it swayed on investor concerns regarding the U.S. Federal Reserve and other factors. Silver followed gold's indecisive lead to some degree and added to losses along with zinc. Profits were posted to the Partnership in the middle of the fourth quarter. Leading the way for the Trading Program was the global metals sector which moved downward substantially as November unfolded. Whether driven by investors' lingering concerns regarding China's demand for industrial metals or a weakening of the view that precious metals equal safety, the downward move in metals markets allowed the Trading Program to find profits. Losses were posted to the Partnership at the end of the fourth quarter. The Trading Program's gains on short positions in gold, silver, platinum, and nickel were offset by losses on short positions in industrial metals including copper, zinc, aluminum and lead.\nThe interest rate sector posted losses to the Partnership. Profits were posted to the Partnership at the beginning of the first quarter. Global bonds led the way for the Trading Program in January as investors reached for safety in the face of equity market retracement and ongoing downward price pressure on commodities. With bond prices rising around the world, most of the Trading Program's long positions were profitable in January with the best returns emerging in U.S. 30, 10 and 5 year treasuries, Japanese government bonds, and European Bobl. Additional profits were added in Australian and Canadian bond markets, and only the Trading Program's positions in the British Short Sterling and the U.S. 2 year treasury markets failed to make profits for the Partnership in January. Losses were posted to the Partnership in the middle of the first quarter. Global bond markets were challenging for February and the Trading Program was largely unprofitable across the board in the various markets in which the Partnership invests. Particularly challenging were the British Long Gilt and U.S. 30, 10 and 5 year treasuries, each of which whipped around and ultimately trended downward against the Trading Program's long positions during February as investor fears eased after a panicky January. Losses were posted to the Partnership at the end of the first quarter. Global bonds were perhaps the trickiest sector during March with prices vacillating in connection with commentary and speculation on the potential timing and magnitude of anticipated U.S. rate hikes resulting in losses incurred long the German bund and U.S. 30 year treasury. Losses were posted to the Partnership at the beginning of the second quarter. Long positions in the German Bund and French OAT 10 year were shaken out when prices in those markets dove and small profits across the U.S. yield curve and in Italian BTP 10 years were insufficient to offset those losses. Losses were posted to the Partnership in the middle of the second quarter. In global bonds, price choppiness was pronounced as prices ebbed downward for much of the first part of May and then shot back upward as May wound down. The net results of this vacillation were losses short the German Bund, French OAT and long the U.S. 10 year. Profits were posted to the Partnership at the end of the second quarter. The key to the Partnership's relative success in June was a strong month of global bond trading. Short positions in the German Bund and Bobl as well as the French OAT 10 year generated profits as those markets plummeted in the wake of emerging European chaos. Adding to the Partnership's gains were successful short positions in the U.S. 30 year and 5 year markets. Losses were posted to the Partnership at the beginning of the third quarter. The global bond sector's profits were elusive almost across the board. Just as many of the Partnership's models began to take short positions in the wake of a burst of European bond price softening, many global markets rallied causing the Partnership to incur losses in BTP Italian 10 years, German Bobls and Bunds and OAT French 10 years. Shorts versus the U.S. 30 and 10 year markets also lost money. Losses were posted to the Partnership in the middle of the third quarter. The bond market which at times vacillated with stock market twists and turns found itself predominantly long throughout August and ultimately was undercut by a downward chop across the U.S. yield curve in 2, 5, 10 and 30 year U.S. Treasuries. Bond markets outside of the U.S. proved indecisive for the Partnership and stayed neutral everywhere else with the exception of Canada where a small long position yielded a flat result for August. Profits were posted to the Partnership at the end of the third quarter as the Partnership generated a slight profit on long positions in both U.S. 2 years and 5 years bonds. Losses were posted to the Partnership at the beginning of fourth quarter. In the bond sector, the Trading Program's losses were primarily domestic as the Trading Program's long positions for October did not align with the U.S. yield curve. Losses were posted to the Partnership in the middle of the fourth quarter. In November global bonds bounced up and down on conflicting narratives about what the U.S. Federal Reserve might do with interest rates and other related factors. The Trading Program suffered losses with long positions in the Italian 10 year, and U.S. 2, 5 and 10 year bonds. Profits were posted to the Partnership at the end of the fourth quarter due to the Trading Program's long positions in the Italian 10 year bonds.\nThe stock indices sector posted losses to the Partnership. Losses were posted to the Partnership at the beginning of the first quarter due to the long positions in many facets of sagging U.S. equity markets. Profits were posted to the Partnership in the middle of the first quarter. The Trading Program was successful in the equities sector for February. Global markets rallied on solid economic and earnings data, constructive input from the U.S. Federal Reserve, and other inputs finding their way upward after a rough January correction from Australian SPI 200, NASDAQ, S&P 500, Dow Jones, Swedish OMX, German DAX and EU Euro Stoxx. Losses were posted to the Partnership at the end of the first quarter as the Trading Program suffered losses in the S&P 500, NASDAQ and the Dow. Profits were posted to the Partnership at the beginning of the second quarter. In April markets trended upward around the globe and the Partnership capitalized. Leading the way were long positions in Hong Kong's Hang Seng, China's H-Shares, Japanese Topix, German DAX, and EuroStoxx. The Partnership made money in several global equity markets. Profits were posted to the Partnership in the middle of the second quarter as the Partnership generated profits long the Dow, NASDAQ, S&P 500, and the Japanese Nikkei and Topix. Losses were posted to the Partnership at the end of the second quarter as the late-June panic over Greece caused sizable equity losses, bucking a trend that to that point had been largely positive for June. Losses were posted to the Partnership at the beginning of the third quarter because of long positions in various European indices such as the AEX, OMX EuroStoxx 50 as well as long positions in the Japanese Nikkei and Topix. Losses were posted to the Partnership in the middle of the third quarter. The damage was predominantly on the U.S. side of the ledger as the NASDAQ and the S&P 500 were erratic and uncooperative with the Partnership's systematic approach. On the global side of the ledger, the Italian FTSE MIB and South African FTSE JSE added to the losses. Losses were posted to the Partnership at the end of the third quarter as the Partnership sustained losses on long positions in the S&P 500 and short positions in the NASDAQ, the Dow, the German Dax, and India's Nifty. Losses were\nposted to the Partnership at the beginning of the fourth quarter. Sharply down in the early part of October then back upward and then, in some cases, back downward again, the least cooperative equity markets were Hong Kong's Hang Seng, Sweden's OMX and Japan's Topix and Nikkei. Profits were posted to the Partnership in the middle of the fourth quarter. The global equity sector began to show a somewhat consistent upward pattern over the second half of November allowing the Trading Program to finish the month profitably in this sector. Specifically, the Partnership had profits long positions in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, Hong Kong's Hang Seng, China's H Shares, the German DAX, Holland's AEX, and the Indian Nifty. Losses were posted to the Partnership at the end of the fourth quarter. Most challenging for the Trading Program in December were global equity markets. Down, up and then down again, stocks wavered throughout December on a variety of factors including sagging energy prices, the U.S. Federal Reserve's decision to slightly raise interest rates, and a myriad of geopolitical matters ranging from Middle East conflict to the U.S. election cycle. The Partnership had a profit short Euro Stoxx and Holland's AEX but beyond that, a series of relatively small losses across markets in Asia, Europe and the U.S. collectively overshadowed the Trading Program's few monthly gains.\nThe agriculture sector posted losses to the Partnership. Losses were posted to the Partnership at the beginning of the first quarter where wheat backtracked sharply against the Partnership's long position and caused a loss that outweighed small gains earned for the Partnership in long corn and short rubber and cotton positions. Profits were posted to the Partnership in the middle of the first quarter due to the Partnership's short positions in coffee and wheat, which aligned nicely with falling prices in those markets. Profits were posted to the Partnership at the end of the first quarter. Leading the way were short positions that captured a sharp drop in sugar prices and a less significant, but still profitable drop in coffee prices during March. Losses were posted to the Partnership at the beginning of the second quarter due to short positions in sugar. Profits were posted to the Partnership in the middle of the second quarter as downward price moves in coffee and sugar aligned well with the Partnership's ongoing short positions and rubber moved up slightly in support of a long position built by the Partnership as May unfolded. Losses were posted to the Partnership at the end of the second quarter as heavy rains and flooding in parts of the U.S. led to a negative crop report in late June. For the Partnership, the results were losses in short positions in coffee, corn, wheat and soybeans, along with losses on long positions in rubber. Losses were posted to the Partnership at the beginning of the third quarter. Most notable losses for the Partnership were long positions in wheat, soy products, and corn. Profits were posted to the Partnership in the middle of the third quarter. Leading the way were gains long positions in wheat and soybean meal and short positions in sugar and rubber. Profits were posted to the Partnership at the end of the third quarter. Profitable for the Partnership were short positions in live cattle, soybeans, coffee and rubber and those profits were sufficient to outpace relatively small monthly losses. Losses were posted to the Partnership at the beginning of the fourth quarter as gains in the Trading Program's short positions in soybeans were offset by losses in short positions in cattle and, to a lesser extent, sugar. Profits were posted to the Partnership in the middle of the fourth quarter due to the Trading Program's short positions in wheat, soybeans and coffee. Profits were posted to the Partnership at the end of the fourth quarter due to the Trading Program's short positions in soymeal, soybeans and corn.\nThe currency sector posted losses to the Partnership. Profits were posted to the Partnership at the beginning of the first quarter. A sharp loss short the Swiss franc on the Swiss government's mid-month bolstering effort was offset by gains short the Euro, Australian dollar, New Zealand dollar, Danish krone, and Singapore dollar, among other currencies. Losses were posted to the Partnership in the middle of the first quarter as the Trading Program incurred another monthly loss in Swiss francs as the Swiss National Bank continued a series of measures at intervention. Profits were posted to the Partnership at the end of the first quarter. In this sector, the U.S. dollar continued to surge versus most currencies and the outcome for the Partnership was profitable investing short the Euro, British pound, South African rand, and various other global denominations. Losses were posted to the Partnership at the beginning of the second quarter. In April, the Partnership sustained losses across its entire currency book including British pound, Australian dollar, Euro, Japanese yen, South African rand, and others. Profits were posted to the Partnership in the middle of the second quarter. Most successful for the Partnership was the global currency sector which delivered opportunities on both the long and short side. Specifically, after opening May with significant short positions in the British pound, the Partnership ended May long and over the course of several weeks, booked profits on both sides of the market. In respect of the Japanese yen, the Partnership was solidly long to start May, shifted to short by May's month end, and banked some profits on both sides. Adding to solid performance in the pound and yen, the Partnership booked profits short the New Zealand dollar, South African rand, and Euro and long the Swiss franc. Profits were posted to the Partnership at the end of the quarter. Key to June's success were the Partnership's positions long the British pound and short the New Zealand dollar as those two currencies moved nicely in opposite directions. Losses were posted to the Partnership at the beginning of the third quarter. In July, Europe was a flashpoint as the Partnership lost money long both the British pound and the Euro, and Asia proved tricky as well as an upward move against the Partnership's short positions in the Japanese yen was also unsuccessful. Losses were posted to the Partnership in the middle of the third quarter. Worst for August were the Partnership's short and later long positions in the Euro and Japanese yen. Profits were posted to the Partnership at the end of the third quarter. Global currencies also proved fruitful for the Partnership as the Partnership harnessed opportunities throughout September. In particular, the Partnership found profits through short positions in the South African rand, Singapore,\nCanadian and Australian dollars, and long positions in the Japanese yen. Losses were posted to the Partnership at the beginning of the fourth quarter due to the Partnership's short positions in the Australian dollar, Japanese yen, British pound, and various minor currencies including the Singapore and New Zealand dollars. Profits were posted to the Partnership in the middle of the fourth quarter. In November global currencies were profitable for the Trading Program as the U.S. dollar strengthened versus other global currencies. Leading the way for November was the Trading Program's short euro and Swiss franc positions. Losses were posted to the Partnership at the end of the fourth quarter as global currencies wavered indecisively as December unfolded. Small profits were posted to the Partnership from the Trading Program's short positions in the South African rand, Singapore dollar, and Norwegian kroner and similarly small profits were found investing in the Japanese yen, British pound and Canadian dollar. However, losses in the Trading Program's short positions in the Euro, Swiss franc, and Australian dollar outweighed other currency gains and resulted in a net loss for the Partnership in December.\n\nThe Partnership experienced a net trading profit before brokerage commissions and related fees for the year ended December 31, 2014 of $3,895,374. Profits were primarily attributable to the Partnership trading in the energy, currencies, interest rates, agriculture and stock indices sectors posting profits. The metals sector posted losses.\nThe energy sector posted profits to the Partnership. Profits were posted to the Partnership at the beginning of the first quarter as the Partnership captured the price move of natural gas triggered by winter weather across the U.S. Small losses in the Partnership's long crude oil positions were insufficient to offset the strong performance in natural gas. Profits were posted to the Partnership in the middle of the first quarter due to the Partnership's long positions in natural gas, crude oil and rbob gasoline. Losses were posted to the Partnership at the end of the first quarter as the energy sector calmed significantly in March. As a result, the Partnership was flat for March. Profits were posted to the Partnership at the beginning of the second quarter as the Partnership benefitted from a generally inactive energy sector. In April profits earned on long natural gas and Brent crude oil slightly outweighed losses in U.S. crude oil and RBOB. Losses were posted to the Partnership in the middle of the second quarter as small profits were earned long the crude oil market, but were outweighed with losses incurred long Brent crude, natural gas and RBOB gasoline. Losses were posted to the Partnership at the end of the second quarter. The Partnership's long positions across the oil and gas complex were largely bucked by a sector-wide downward price move for June. The Partnership's profits in crude oil were not enough to offset losses in other energy markets. Losses were posted to the Partnership at the beginning of the third quarter as investors apparently lost confidence in global energy demand. As a result, the Partnership suffered losses long Brent crude oil, WTI crude oil and RBOB gasoline. Those losses were too significant to overcome the Trading Program's gain short natural gas. Profits were posted to the Partnership in the middle of the third quarter as the Trading Program profited from the short gasoil and heating oil. Profits were posted to the Partnership at the end of the third quarter. Global energy markets offered investment opportunities as well. Specifically, the Partnership capitalized on sagging prices with short positions in gasoil, heating oil, Brent crude, natural gas, and RBOB gasoline. Profits were posted to the Partnership at the beginning of the fourth quarter due to the plummeting oil prices. As a result, continuing short positions in crude, Brent crude, gasoil, heating oil and RBOB gasoline all generated tidy profits. These energy profits where undercut only by a relatively small loss short the natural gas market which, as is often the case, bucked the broader downward price trend in energy. Profits were posted to the Partnership in the middle of the fourth quarter as energy prices plummeted throughout November and lead to profits for the Trading Program's short positions in crude, Brent crude, gasoil, heating oil, and RBOB unleaded gasoline. Profits were posted to the Partnership in the end of the fourth quarter. Most profitable in December was the plummeting energy sector which continued to unravel upon headline after headline regarding a global over-supply of energy products of all types. The Trading Program held short positions across the energy complex for December and all positions yielded profits whether in crude oil, Brent crude oil, Gasoil, heating oil, RBOB gasoline or even, natural gas.\nThe currency sector posted profits to the Partnership. Losses were posted to the Partnership at the beginning of the first quarter due to the sharp upward move in the Japanese yen that bucked 2013's downward trend and the\nPartnership's carryover short position from 2013. Adding to the losses were downward moves in the Swiss franc and euro that went against the Partnership's long positions. These outcomes could not be overcome by winning short trades against the Australian dollar and South African rand. Losses were posted to the Partnership in the middle of the first quarter as profits were outweighed by losses incurred shorting the Japanese yen, Australian dollar, and the South African rand. Losses were posted to the Partnership at the end of the first quarter due to the Partnership's long positions in the British pound and on both sides of the euro market. Profits were posted to the Partnership at the beginning of the second quarter. Currencies such as the British pound and Swiss franc moved upward in April and the Partnership's long positions in both markets benefitted as a result. Gains in these two currencies outweighed small losses short the Japanese yen and long the Australian dollar. The Partnership suffered losses in the middle of the second quarter due to a sharp reversal in the Euro, a downward movement in the Danish krone and New Zealand dollar, and an uptick in the South African rand. Profits were posted to the Partnership at the end of the second quarter. In June profits were obtained from the Japanese yen, British pound, New Zealand dollar, and Australian dollar as well as the short euro. Profits were posted to the Partnership at the beginning of the third quarter as short dollar positions bolstered gains. The strongest performers were short Euro and short Swiss franc, followed up by positions short Japanese yen, Czech koruna and Swedish krona. Profits were posted to the Partnership in the middle of the third quarter as the Trading Program benefitted from short the foreign currencies and long the dollar as the Euro, Japanese yen, Swiss franc, and Czech koruna all moved downward sharply in support of the Trading Program's investment approach. Profits were posted to the Partnership at the end of the third quarter. Leading the way were short positions in Swiss franc, Euro, and Japanese yen, all of which fell sharply at various points in September. Adding to the profits were investments short the Australian dollar, Danish krone, New Zealand dollar, Czech koruna, Norwegian krone, Swedish krona, and Polish zloty, all of which moved downward sharply as the world dealt with various macro developments. Overall, but for a loss generated by investing long the British pound, the Partnership found profits in currencies in which it invested. Losses were posted to the Partnership at the beginning of the fourth quarter due to the short Japanese yen, British pound, Singapore dollar and South African rand. Profits were posted to the Partnership in the middle of the fourth quarter. Most beneficial for the Partnership were short positions in Japanese yen and Singapore dollars. Additionally helpful were short positions in the British pound, euro, Australian dollar and Norwegian krone. Profits were posted to the Partnership in the end of the fourth quarter.\nThe interest rate sector posted profits to the Partnership.

Losses were posted to the Partnership at the beginning of the fourth quarter as many markets swung from peak to trough over the course of October. The types of whippy, irrational equity moves witnessed in view defy explanation but fundamentalists will point to everything from the Ebola crisis, to the Middle East, to perceptions of a softening Chinese economy.

The interest rates, stock indices, agriculture and currency sectors posted losses.\nThe energy sector posted profits to the Partnership. Profits were posted to the Partnership at the beginning of the first quarter. The Partnership's short positions across the sector were profitable with natural gas and gasoil leading the way. Only RBOB gasoline failed to yield profit in January as, overall, energy continued to be a source of opportunity for the Trading Program. Losses were posted to the Partnership in the middle of the first quarter. February saw a waning of the downward price move as markets across the energy sector rallied and appeared to set a potential bottom after months of gloom. The Trading Program was hit hardest on its positions short Brent crude, gasoil, heating oil and RBOB gasoline and also suffered a slight loss for February in WTI crude. Profits were posted to the Partnership at the end of the first quarter. The Trading Program found its best opportunities in the energy sector. Despite a lot of intra-month price vacillation, prices ultimately moved downward in March and as a result the Partnership was able to capitalize on short positions in various components of its diversified investment models. Brent crude, heating oil, and RBOB gasoline offered the best outcomes and ultimately, only the\nPartnership's short position in crude oil lost money for March. Losses were posted to the Partnership at the beginning of the second quarter. In April, prices bolted upward to buck what had been a sustained downward move in recent months.

Losses were posted to the Partnership at the end of the second quarter. In the energy sector, general market uncertainty characterized June as neither the Partnership's short positions in natural gas and crude oil nor its long positions in Brent crude oil, crude oil, gasoil or heating oil were able to find their way to profitability.

Losses were posted to the Partnership in the middle of the third quarter. In energy, losses were largely uniform as the markets climbed during August against the Partnership's short positions. Profits were posted to the Partnership at the end of the third quarter. Investor concerns about waning global economic strength appeared to drive falling prices in Brent crude, oil, gasoil, natural gas and RBOB gasoline as they all conformed nicely to the Partnership's short positions and the result was a profitable September across the board in energies. Losses were posted to the Partnership at the beginning of the fourth quarter due to the Partnership's short positions in natural gas, crude, brent crude, heating oil, and gasoil. Profits were posted to the Partnership in the middle of the fourth quarter. In energies, November was driven by falling prices in natural gas, WTI crude, Brent crude, heating oil and gasoil, all of which appear to be in far greater supply than demand globally. Only the Trading Program's small investment short RBOB gasoline went against the Trading Program as global investors seemed to unite in a bearish outlook on energy that synched nicely with the Trading Program's short positions. Profits were posted to the Partnership at the end of the fourth quarter. The Trading Program was able to capitalize on the ongoing energy slump with short positions in crude oil, gasoil, Brent crude and heating oil.\nThe metals sector posted profits to the Partnership. Profits were posted to the Partnership at the beginning of the first quarter. Driving January's success were sharp downward moves in the copper and aluminum markets as industrial metals got caught in the downdraft of energy and equity prices. The Trading Program's short positions were not as successful in nickel and whippy gold and silver markets continued to test investment approach but, overall, profits in the sector outweighed losses to lead to a successful January in metals for the Partnership. Losses were posted to the Partnership in the middle of the first quarter. The Trading Program suffered losses shorting copper in the face of a solid rally in that market and also misplayed gold with an unsuccessful long trade and platinum with an unsuccessful short trade. Losses were posted to the Partnership at the end of the first quarter. The global metals sector was unprofitable for the Trading Program, particularly gold and silver markets that did not settle into any defined pattern. The industrial metals provided little sanctuary as only a short position in nickel yielded a profit for the Trading Program in March versus losing positions in copper, zinc and aluminum. Losses were posted to the Partnership at the beginning of the second quarter. In April, there was a price resurgence which caused the Partnership to sustain losses shorting industrial metals, aluminum, copper and nickel. Profits were posted to the Partnership in the middle of the second quarter. Global metals markets delivered positive results in May as a general downward price move lined up nicely with the Partnership's short positions. Base metals were the story for May as the Partnership booked profits on short positions in aluminum, copper and nickel but avoided the precious metals sector completely due to lack of opportunity. Profits were posted to the Partnership at the end of the second quarter.

Losses were posted to the Partnership at the beginning of the fourth quarter. Gold would not pick a consistent path as it swayed on investor concerns regarding the U.S. Federal Reserve and other factors. Silver followed gold's indecisive lead to some degree and added to losses along with zinc. Profits were posted to the Partnership in the middle of the fourth quarter. Leading the way for the Trading Program was the global metals sector which moved downward substantially as November unfolded. Whether driven by investors' lingering concerns regarding China's demand for industrial metals or a weakening of the view that precious metals equal safety, the downward move in metals markets allowed the Trading Program to find profits. Losses were posted to the Partnership at the end of the fourth quarter. The Trading Program's gains on short positions in gold, silver, platinum, and nickel were offset by losses on short positions in industrial metals including copper, zinc, aluminum and lead.\nThe interest rate sector posted losses to the Partnership. Profits were posted to the Partnership at the beginning of the first quarter. Global bonds led the way for the Trading Program in January as investors reached for safety in the face of equity market retracement and ongoing downward price pressure on commodities. With bond prices rising around the world, most of the Trading Program's long positions were profitable in January with the best returns emerging in U.S. 30, 10 and 5 year treasuries, Japanese government bonds, and European Bobl. Additional profits were added in Australian and Canadian bond markets, and only the Trading Program's positions in the British Short Sterling and the U.S. 2 year treasury markets failed to make profits for the Partnership in January. Losses were posted to the Partnership in the middle of the first quarter. Global bond markets were challenging for February and the Trading Program was largely unprofitable across the board in the various markets in which the Partnership invests. Particularly challenging were the British Long Gilt and U.S. 30, 10 and 5 year treasuries, each of which whipped around and ultimately trended downward against the Trading Program's long positions during February as investor fears eased after a panicky January. Losses were posted to the Partnership at the end of the first quarter. Global bonds were perhaps the trickiest sector during March with prices vacillating in connection with commentary and speculation on the potential timing and magnitude of anticipated U.S. rate hikes resulting in losses incurred long the German bund and U.S. 30 year treasury. Losses were posted to the Partnership at the beginning of the second quarter. Long positions in the German Bund and French OAT 10 year were shaken out when prices in those markets dove and small profits across the U.S. yield curve and in Italian BTP 10 years were insufficient to offset those losses. Losses were posted to the Partnership in the middle of the second quarter. In global bonds, price choppiness was pronounced as prices ebbed downward for much of the first part of May and then shot back upward as May wound down. The net results of this vacillation were losses short the German Bund, French OAT and long the U.S. 10 year. Profits were posted to the Partnership at the end of the second quarter. The key to the Partnership's relative success in June was a strong month of global bond trading. Short positions in the German Bund and Bobl as well as the French OAT 10 year generated profits as those markets plummeted in the wake of emerging European chaos. Adding to the Partnership's gains were successful short positions in the U.S. 30 year and 5 year markets. Losses were posted to the Partnership at the beginning of the third quarter. The global bond sector's profits were elusive almost across the board. Just as many of the Partnership's models began to take short positions in the wake of a burst of European bond price softening, many global markets rallied causing the Partnership to incur losses in BTP Italian 10 years, German Bobls and Bunds and OAT French 10 years. Shorts versus the U.S. 30 and 10 year markets also lost money. Losses were posted to the Partnership in the middle of the third quarter. The bond market which at times vacillated with stock market twists and turns found itself predominantly long throughout August and ultimately was undercut by a downward chop across the U.S. yield curve in 2, 5, 10 and 30 year U.S. Treasuries. Bond markets outside of the U.S. proved indecisive for the Partnership and stayed neutral everywhere else with the exception of Canada where a small long position yielded a flat result for August. Profits were posted to the Partnership at the end of the third quarter as the Partnership generated a slight profit on long positions in both U.S. 2 years and 5 years bonds.

Losses were posted to the Partnership in the middle of the third quarter. The damage was predominantly on the U.S. side of the ledger as the NASDAQ and the S&P 500 were erratic and uncooperative with the Partnership's systematic approach.

The Partnership had a profit short Euro Stoxx and Holland's AEX but beyond that, a series of relatively small losses across markets in Asia, Europe and the U.S. collectively overshadowed the Trading Program's few monthly gains.\nThe agriculture sector posted losses to the Partnership.

Specifically, after opening May with significant short positions in the British pound, the Partnership ended May long and over the course of several weeks, booked profits on both sides of the market. In respect of the Japanese yen, the Partnership was solidly long to start May, shifted to short by May's month end, and banked some profits on both sides. Adding to solid performance in the pound and yen, the Partnership booked profits short the New Zealand dollar, South African rand, and Euro and long the Swiss franc.
