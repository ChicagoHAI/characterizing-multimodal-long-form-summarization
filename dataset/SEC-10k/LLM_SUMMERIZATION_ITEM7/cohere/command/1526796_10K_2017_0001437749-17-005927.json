MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nYou should read the following discussion together with Selected Financial Data,\u201d and the historical financial statements and related notes included in this annual report on Form 10-K. The statements in this discussion regarding industry outlook, our expectations regarding our future performance, liquidity and capital resources and other non-historical statements in this discussion are forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, the risks and uncertainties described in Risk Factors\u201d and Forward-Looking Statements\u201d included in this report. Our actual results may differ materially from those contained in or implied by any forward-looking statements.\nOur fiscal year ends on the Monday nearest to December 31 of each year. Fiscal year 2016 was a 53-week year and ended on January 2, 2017. Fiscal years 2015 and 2014 were 52-week years. References to fiscal years 2015 and 2014 are references to fiscal years ended December 28, 2015 and December 29, 2014, respectively.\nOverview\nIgnite Restaurant Group, Inc. operates two restaurant brands in the casual dining segment, Joe's Crab Shack ( Joe's\u201d) and Brick House Tavern + Tap ( Brick House\u201d). Each of our restaurant brands offers a variety of high-quality food in a distinctive, casual, high-energy atmosphere. Joe's and Brick House operate in a diverse set of markets across the United States and internationally. As of January 2, 2017, we operated 112 Joe's and 25 Brick House restaurants in 32 states and franchised three Joe's restaurants in Dubai, U.A.E.\nJoe's is an established, national chain of casual dining seafood restaurants. Joe's serves a variety of high-quality seafood items, with an emphasis on crab. Joe's is a high-energy, family-friendly restaurant that encourages guests to roll up your sleeves and crack into some crab.\u201d Brick House is a casual restaurant brand that provides guests an elevated experience appropriate for every day usage.\nIn fiscal year 2016, we opened three new Brick House restaurants, all of which were conversions from Joe's restaurants. We also closed 18 Joe's restaurants and one Brick House restaurant during 2016.\nOutlook\nWe have experienced a decline in the operating performance at Joe's. During fiscal year 2016, the comparable restaurant sales of Joe's declined by 7.3% which contributed to a decrease in income from operations from the prior year. The largest impact on the decline in comparable restaurant sales is from our Northeast and Texas markets. We are also experiencing sales declines in other geographic regions primarily due to decreased guest traffic. In order to reverse these negative trends, we have deployed many different operational strategies, but so far none have had a meaningful impact on sales or guest traffic. The biggest declines in sales and guest traffic continue to be on weekends. We have started introducing new menu items at both brands to enhance the current offerings as well as to improve the value proposition for our guests. We will continue to evaluate our menu offerings and look for other value offerings that could increase sales and traffic.\nWe have also experienced a decline in operating performance at Brick House. During fiscal year 2016, the comparable restaurant sales of Brick House decreased by 7.7%, which contributed to a $0.6 million decrease in income from operations from the prior year, excluding the $2.7 million non-cash impairment charge in 2016. We are continuing to evaluate our menu to ensure we are offering items that are consistent with the expectations of our guests.\nWe are continuing to evaluate our underperforming restaurants. During 2016, we closed 18 Joe's and one Brick House restaurant. Additional declines in the operating performance at Joe's or Brick House could cause us to close or sell more restaurants which may require us to recognize additional asset impairment or closure-related expenses and increase our valuation allowance during 2017 against some or all of our deferred tax assets.\nThe Board of Directors, working together with our management team and our financial advisor, has commenced a process to pursue the sale of our business, which could be sold as an entirety or through the separate sales of our two restaurant brands, Joe's and Brick House. There can be no assurance that the process that we are undertaking will be successful. In addition, we cannot predict the terms or timing of any transaction that we may undertake or whether any such transaction will result in any proceeds for the holders of our common stock. We are also exploring a variety of strategic alternatives to strengthen our capital structure. For the remainder of 2017, we are committed to preserving liquidity and improving our capital structure. Our capital expenditures will remain at maintenance levels and we will continue to manage working capital and restaurant-level operating expenses. However, there can be no assurance regarding these matters. Further deterioration would negatively impact our anticipated revenues, profitability and cash flows from operations. Our expectations with respect to our performance over the remainder of 2017 are subject to a number of assumptions, many of which are outside of our control.\nWe are currently in discussions with our lenders in connection with our pursuit of various strategic alternatives. We can give no assurance that we will successfully execute any strategic alternatives we are currently pursuing or any others, and our ability to do so could be adversely affected by numerous factors, including changes in the economic or business environment, financial market volatility, the performance of our business, and the terms and conditions of the 2014 Credit Facility. See Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d below for further discussion of our operational plan to preserve liquidity.\nRecent Developments\nAsset Impairment and Closures\nWe evaluate the recoverability of the carrying amount of long-lived assets, which include property and equipment and intangible assets, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be fully recoverable. Due to continued declines in operating performance at certain Joe's and Brick House restaurants in 2016 we recorded impairment charges of $26.2 million related to Joe's and Brick House's long-lived assets. In 2015 and 2014 we recorded impairment charges of $9.4 and $1.8 million, respectively, related to Joe's long-lived assets. Additionally, in 2016, 2015 and 2014 we recorded restaurant closure expenses of $5.1 million, $1.1 million and $210 thousand, respectively.\nValuation Allowance\nWe evaluate our deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis to determine whether a valuation allowance is required. We assess whether a valuation allowance should be established based on our determination of whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible and prior to the expiration of our credit carryforwards which begin to expire in 2031. We consider the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. Due to continued operating losses and asset impairments we are in a three-year cumulative loss position. According to ASC Topic No. 740, Income Taxes, cumulative losses in recent years represent significant negative evidence in considering whether deferred tax assets are realizable. During fiscal year 2016, 2015 and 2014 we recorded a valuation allowance of $17.8 million, $12.8 million and $25.6 million, respectively in continuing operations.\nWe excluded the deferred tax liabilities related to certain indefinite lived intangibles when calculating the amount of valuation allowance needed as these liabilities cannot be considered as a source of income when determining the realizability of the net deferred tax assets. The valuation allowance was recorded as a reduction to our income tax benefit in our consolidated statement of operations. If we are able to generate sufficient taxable income in the future such that it becomes more likely than not that we will be able to fully utilize the net deferred tax assets on which a valuation allowance was recorded, our effective tax rate may decrease if the valuation allowance is reversed.\nKey Performance Indicators\nIn assessing the performance of our business, we consider a variety of performance and financial measures. The key measures for determining how our business is performing are comparable restaurant sales growth, average weekly sales, restaurant operating weeks, average check, average unit volume and number of restaurant openings.\nComparable Restaurant Sales Growth\nComparable restaurant sales growth reflects the change in year-over-year sales for the comparable restaurant base. We define the comparable restaurant base to include those restaurants open for at least 104 weeks, or approximately 24 months. As of January 2, 2017, December 28, 2015 and December 29, 2014 there were 132, 147 and 142, respectively, in our comparable restaurant base. Comparable restaurant sales growth can be generated by an increase in guest counts and/or by increases in the average check amount resulting from a shift in menu mix and/or increase in price. This measure highlights performance of existing restaurants as the impact of new restaurant openings is excluded.\nAverage Weekly Sales\nAverage weekly sales is a key measure of individual restaurant economic performance of new and existing restaurants. Average weekly sales reflects total sales of all restaurants divided by restaurant operating weeks (see below). This measure is subject to seasonality for periods less than one year.\nRestaurant Operating Weeks\nRestaurant operating weeks is the aggregate number of weeks that our restaurants are in operation over a specific period of time.\nAverage Check\nAverage check is calculated for Joe's by dividing net sales by guest counts for a given time period. Management uses this indicator to analyze the dollars spent in our Joe's restaurants per guest. This measure aids management in identifying trends in guest preferences, as well as the effectiveness of menu price increases and other menu changes.\nGuest counts represent the estimated number of guests served in our restaurants. The count is estimated based on the number of entr\u00e9es sold. Our estimates may vary from actual guest counts due to the variability in the level of sharing of certain entr\u00e9e items on our menu. Given the significant level of alcohol sales and appetizer sales at Brick House, guest count is more difficult to quantify and therefore, we do not currently calculate average check as a key performance indicator for that brand.\nAverage Unit Volume\nAverage unit volume represents the average sales for restaurants included in the comparable restaurant base for a given time period, typically annually. Average unit volume reflects total sales for restaurants in our comparable restaurant base divided by the number of restaurants in our comparable restaurant base. This measure is subject to seasonality for periods less than one year.\nNumber of Restaurant Openings\nNumber of restaurant openings reflects the number of restaurants opened or converted during a particular reporting period. Before we open new restaurants or convert existing restaurants, we incur pre-opening costs. Typically, new restaurants open with an initial start-up period of higher than normalized sales volumes, which subsequently decrease to stabilized levels. While sales volumes are generally higher during the initial opening period, new restaurants typically experience normal inefficiencies in the form of higher cost of sales, labor and other direct operating expenses for several months and as a result, restaurant operating margins are generally lower during the start-up period of operation. The number and timing of restaurant openings has had an impact on our results of operations.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table presents the consolidated statement of operations for the past three fiscal years expressed as a percentage of revenues.\nTable 88: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Fiscal Year\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revenues\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Costs and expenses\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Restaurant operating costs and expenses\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cost of sales\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>32.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>31.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>32.5 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Labor expenses\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>29.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>28.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>28.3 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Occupancy expenses\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7.8 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other operating expenses\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>19.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18.7 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> General and administrative\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7.7 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.7 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Pre-opening costs\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.6 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Asset impairments and closures\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.4 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loss (gain) on disposal of assets\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.0 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.3 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total costs and expenses\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>107.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>101.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.9 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loss from operations\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(7.2 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1.7 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.9 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest expense, net\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2.8 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(3.3 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2.5 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gain (loss) on insurance settlements\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.1 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.0 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loss from continuing operations before income taxes\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(9.8 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(5.1 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(3.4 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income tax expense (benefit)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.1 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.2 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loss from continuing operations\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(9.9 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(5.1 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(6.6 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loss from discontinued operations, net of tax\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(4.4 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(4.0 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net loss\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(9.9 </td> <td> )%\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(9.4 </td> <td> )%\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(10.6 </td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n__________________________\nTable 89: <table> <tr> <td> *\n</td> <td> The percentages reflected are subject to rounding adjustments.

$450.3 million for fiscal year 2016, a decrease of $41.8 million, or 8.5%, compared to revenues of $492.0 million for fiscal year 2015. The decrease is primarily due to a decrease of 7.3% in comparable restaurant sales and the closure of 19 restaurants.\nRevenues at Joe's decreased 11.5% to $366.6 million in fiscal year 2016 compared to $414.3 million in fiscal year 2015. The decrease is primarily caused by a 7.3% decrease in comparable restaurant sales and the closure of 18 restaurants. The comparable restaurant sales decrease is comprised of 8.4% decrease in guest count partially offset by a 1.1% increase in pricing. Joe's average weekly sales decreased to $55 thousand from $59 thousand in the prior year. Restaurant operating weeks decreased to 6,605 in 2016 from 7,058 in 2015 due to restaurant closures. We believe the decline in comparable restaurant sales is primarily due to a decrease in guest traffic and continued sales declines at restaurants in our Northeast and Texas markets.\nBrick House revenues increased 7.7% to $83.7 million in fiscal year 2016 versus $77.7 million in fiscal year 2015 due to three new restaurant openings in the first quarter of 2016, partially offset by the closing of one restaurant and a 7.7% decrease in comparable restaurant sales. The comparable restaurant sales decrease was comprised of an 8.1% decrease from traffic and mix and a 0.4% increase in pricing. Brick House's average weekly sales decreased to $62 thousand from $66 thousand in prior year. Restaurant operating weeks increased to 1,341 in 2016 from 1,176 in 2015 due to new restaurant openings.\nCosts of Sales\nCost of sales decreased by $7.2 million, or 4.7%, to $147.0 million in 2016 versus $154.3 million in 2015 mainly due to the decrease in sales volume and restaurant closures, partially offset by increased commodity pricing during 2016. As a percent of revenue, cost of sales increased to 32.7% from 31.4% primarily due to commodity price inflation.\nLabor Expenses\nLabor expenses decreased by $8.2 million, or 5.7%, to $134.0 million in 2016 versus $142.2 million in 2015. The decrease is mainly due to the closure of 19 restaurants in 2016 partially offset by the opening of three new Brick House restaurants. As a percent of revenue, labor expenses increased to 29.8% in fiscal year 2016 from 28.9% in fiscal year 2015 due to increases in minimum wage and deleverage from lower sales.\nOccupancy Expenses\nOccupancy expenses decreased by $2.6 million, or 6.3%, to $38.3 million in 2016 compared to $40.9 million in 2015. The decrease is primarily caused by the closure of 19 restaurants. As a percentage of revenue, occupancy expenses increased to 8.5% from 8.3% primarily due to deleveraging of fixed rent expense from the decrease in comparable restaurant sales.\nOther Operating Expenses\nOther operating expenses decreased by $11.8 million, or 12.4%, to $83.6 million in 2016 versus $95.4 million in 2015. The decrease is primarily caused by the closure of 19 restaurants and the decrease in advertising costs partially offset by higher insurance costs and operating supplies. As a percent of revenue, other operating expenses decreased to 18.6% in 2016 from 19.4% in 2015 primarily due to decreased advertising costs.\nGeneral and Administrative\nGeneral and administrative expenses decreased by $7.0 million, or 23.1%, to $23.5 million in 2016 compared to $30.5 million in 2015. As a percent of revenue, general and administrative expenses decreased to 5.2% in fiscal year 2016 from 6.2% in fiscal year 2015 due to decreased personnel costs, including a reduction of $1.6 million in severance costs, and professional fees.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nDepreciation and amortization expense decreased by $2.6 million, or 10.1%, to $23.2 million in 2016 versus $25.8 million in 2015. This decrease is primarily due to the closure of 19 restaurants during 2016. As a percentage of revenue, depreciation and amortization remained constant at 5.2% in fiscal year 2016 and 2015.\nPre-Opening Costs\nPre-opening costs decreased by $51 thousand, or 5.5%, to $0.9 million in 2016 from $0.9 million in 2015. This decrease is mainly due to the timing of scheduled restaurant openings. We converted three restaurants in 2016 and converted two restaurants in 2015.\nAsset Impairments and Closures\nAsset impairments and closures increased to $31.4 million for fiscal year 2016 from $10.5 million for fiscal year 2015. The $20.9 million increase is mainly due to the impairment charges on long-lived assets of $26.2 million and $9.4 million in 2016 and 2015, respectively. We also closed 19 restaurants in the current year versus nine in the prior year and recorded $5.1 million and $1.1 million, respectively, in closure-related expenses, primarily comprised of future minimum lease obligations. If we are unable to improve the performance of our restaurants or if we experience deteriorating results at some of our restaurants, we could recognize additional impairment charges or closure related expenses.\nLoss (Gain) on Disposal of Assets\nLoss on disposal of assets increased by $0.7 million, to a $0.6 million loss in fiscal year 2016. The loss in fiscal year 2016 was primarily due to asset retirement losses for closed and converted restaurants, partially offset by gains on the sale of the leasehold interest for two locations. The gain in fiscal year 2015 included a $2.0 million net gain on restaurants sold, offset by the impact of writing off $0.6 million in book value of replaced restaurant equipment and facilities improvements, and $1.3 million in asset retirement losses for closed, converted and remodeled restaurants.\nIncome (Loss) from Operations\nAs a result of the foregoing, consolidated loss from operations increased by $23.9 million, to a $32.3 million loss in fiscal year 2016 from an $8.4 million loss in fiscal year 2015.\nJoe's income from operations decreased by $26.1 million, to a $16.6 million loss in fiscal year 2016 from $9.5 million in income in fiscal year 2015. As a percent of revenue, excluding the impact of non-cash impairment charges, accelerated depreciation, pre-opening costs, severance and other costs related to conversions, remodels and closures, income from operations for Joe's decreased to 3.2% in the current year from 5.2% in the prior year. This decrease is primarily attributable to lower comparable restaurant sales and deleveraging of fixed costs against lower sales volume and increases in commodity pricing.\nIncome from operations for Brick House decreased by $3.4 million, to $2.2 million in fiscal year 2016 from $5.5 million in fiscal year 2015. As a percent of revenue, excluding the impact of non-cash impairment charges, pre-opening costs, severance and other costs related to conversions, remodels and closures, Brick House's income from operations decreased to 7.6% in the current year from 8.3% in the prior year. The decrease is primarily due to lower comparable restaurant sales and increases in cost of sales.\nInterest Expense, Net\nInterest expense, net decreased by $3.8 million, or 23.0%, to $12.6 million in 2016 from $16.4 million in 2015. The decrease is due to lower average debt balance in 2016 due to voluntary prepayments of $46.5 million since the end of fiscal year 2015. The fiscal 2016 balance includes a $0.3 million write-off of debt issuance costs and debt discount compared to a $1.0 million write-off of debt issuance costs in 2015.\nIncome Tax Expense (Benefit)\nThe income tax expense increased by $0.5 million, to a $0.2 million expense in fiscal year 2016 from a $0.3 million benefit in fiscal year 2015 mainly due to an increase of $17.8 million in valuation allowance in 2016 compared to an increase of $12.8 million in 2015. Excluding the impact of the valuation allowance, the effective income tax rate decreased to 39.8% in fiscal year 2016 from 52.1% in fiscal year 2015 primarily due to the impact of the tax credit carryforwards.\nFiscal Year 2015 (52 Weeks) Compared to Fiscal Year 2014 (52 Weeks)\nRevenues\nRevenues were $492.0 million for fiscal year 2015, a decrease of $11.5 million, or 2.3%, compared to revenues of $503.5 million for fiscal year 2014. The decrease is primarily due to a decrease of 3.9% in comparable restaurant sales, partially offset by higher operating weeks caused by the timing of restaurant opening and closure activities.\nRevenues at Joe's decreased 4.3% to $414.3 million in fiscal year 2015 compared to $433.0 million in fiscal year 2014. The decrease is primarily caused by a 4.5% decrease in comparable restaurant sales. The comparable restaurant sales decrease is comprised of 5.1% decrease in guest count and a 1.0% decrease in mix, partially offset by a 1.6% increase in pricing. Joe's average weekly sales decreased to $59 thousand from $61 thousand in the prior year. Restaurant operating weeks decreased to 7,058 in 2015 from 7,107 in 2014 due to restaurant closures. We believe the decline in comparable restaurant sales is primarily due to a decrease in guest traffic and continued sales declines at restaurants in the Northeast region.\nBrick House revenues increased 10.2% to $77.7 million in fiscal year 2015 versus $70.5 million in fiscal year 2014. The increase was the result of a 1.0% increase in comparable restaurant sales and new restaurant openings. The comparable restaurant sales increase is comprised of a 2.8% increase in pricing, partially offset by a 1.8% decrease in combined guest count and mix benefits. Brick House's average weekly sales were at $66 thousand for both fiscal years 2015 and 2014. Restaurant operating weeks increased to 1,176 in 2015 from 1,062 in 2014 due to new restaurant openings.\nCosts of Sales\nCost of sales decreased by $9.1 million, or 5.6%, to $154.3 million in 2015 versus $163.4 million in 2014 mainly due to the decrease in sales volume. As a percent of revenue, cost of sales decreased to 31.4% from 32.5% primarily due to improvement in seafood pricing at Joe's and reduced discounting at Brick House.\nLabor Expenses\nLabor expenses decreased by $0.5 million, or 0.3%, to $142.2 million in 2015 versus $142.7 million in 2014. The decrease is mainly due to lower restaurant management bonuses caused by lower sales, partially offset by decreased productivity in hourly labor at Joe's. As a percent of revenue, labor expenses increased to 28.9% in fiscal year 2015 from 28.3% in fiscal year 2014 due to decreased productivity, increases in minimum wage, and deleverage from lower sales.\nOccupancy Expenses\nOccupancy expenses increased by $1.5 million, or 3.8%, to $40.9 million in 2015 compared to $39.4 million in 2014. The increase is primarily caused by the increase in operating weeks. As a percentage of revenue, occupancy expenses increased to 8.3% from 7.8% primarily due to deleveraging of fixed rent expense from the decrease in comparable restaurant sales.\nOther Operating Expenses\nOther operating expenses increased by $1.3 million, or 1.4%, to $95.4 million in 2015 versus $94.1 million in 2014. This is mainly due to increased insurance costs and building expenses, partially offset by lower credit card fees attributable to lower sales in the current year. As a percent of revenue, other operating expenses increased to 19.4% in 2015 from 18.7% in 2014 due to increased insurance costs and deleverage from lower sales.\nGeneral and Administrative\nGeneral and administrative expenses decreased by $8.1 million, or 21.1%, to $30.5 million in 2015 compared to $38.7 million in 2014. As a percent of revenue, excluding the items mentioned above, general and administrative expenses decreased to 6.2% in fiscal year 2015 from 7.6% in fiscal year 2014 due to reduction of professional fees and personnel costs, partially offset by an increase of $1.7 million in severance costs.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nDepreciation and amortization expense increased by $1.9 million, or 8.1%, to $25.8 million in 2015 versus $23.9 million in 2014. This increase is primarily due to a higher depreciable base from newly opened restaurants and accelerated depreciation on closed restaurants. As a percentage of revenue, depreciation and amortization increased to 5.2% in fiscal year 2015 from 4.7% in fiscal year 2014 due to deleveraging from negative same-restaurant sales.\nPre-Opening Costs\nPre-opening costs decreased by $1.9 million, or 66.9%, to $0.9 million in 2015 from $2.8 million in 2014. This decrease is mainly due to the timing of scheduled restaurant openings. We opened two converted restaurants in 2015 and opened four new restaurants, including one conversion, in 2014. We also incurred pre-opening costs in both years for restaurants opened in the subsequent fiscal year.\nAsset Impairments and Closures\nAsset impairments and closures increased to $10.5 million for fiscal year 2015 from $2.0 million for fiscal year 2014. The $8.5 million increase is mainly due to the impairment charges on long-lived assets of $9.4 million and $1.8 million in 2015 and 2014, respectively. We also closed nine restaurants in the current year versus none in the prior year. The closure-related expenses for fiscal year 2015 were primarily comprised of future minimum lease obligations. If we are unable to improve the performance of our restaurants or if we experience deteriorating results at some of our restaurants, we could recognize additional impairment charges.\nLoss (Gain) on Disposal of Assets\nLoss on disposal of assets decreased by $1.5 million, or 109.0%, to a $0.1 million gain in fiscal year 2015 from a $1.3 million loss in fiscal year 2014. The gain in fiscal year 2015 included a $2.0 million net gain on restaurants sold, offset by the impact of writing off $0.6 million in book value of replaced restaurant equipment and facilities improvements, and $1.3 million in asset retirement losses for closed, converted and remodeled restaurants. The loss in fiscal year 2014 was primarily from the impact of writing off the book value of replaced restaurant equipment and facilities improvements offset by any related sales proceeds.\nIncome (Loss) from Operations\nAs a result of the foregoing, consolidated loss from operations increased by $3.6 million, or 76.6%, to $8.4 million in fiscal year 2015 from $4.7 million in fiscal year 2014.\nJoe's income from operations decreased by $11.9 million, or 55.5%, to $9.5 million in fiscal year 2015 from $21.5 million in fiscal year 2014. As a percent of revenue, excluding the impact of non-cash impairment charges, accelerated depreciation, pre-opening costs, severance and other costs related to conversions, remodels and closures, income from operations for Joe's decreased to 5.2% in the current year from 5.9% in the prior year. This decrease is primarily attributable to lower comparable restaurant sales and deleveraging of fixed costs against lower sales volume, partially offset by improvement in seafood pricing.\nIncome from operations for Brick House increased by $1.7 million, or 44.7%, to $5.5 million in fiscal year 2015 from $3.8 million in fiscal year 2014. As a percent of revenue, Brick House's income from operations increased to 7.1% in the current year from 5.4% in the prior year. This margin improvement is primarily due to the increase in comparable restaurant sales, reduced discounting, and lower general and administrative expenses.\nInterest Expense, Net\nInterest expense, net increased by $3.8 million, or 30.7%, to $16.4 million in 2015 from $12.5 million in 2014, primarily due to the higher average debt balances and interest rates in the current year, partially offset by higher write-offs of debt issuance costs in the prior year. The fiscal 2015 balance includes $1.0 million write-off of debt issuance costs and debt discount compared to $2.2 million write-off of debt issuance costs in 2014.\nIncome Tax Expense (Benefit)\nThe income tax expense decreased by $16.5 million, or 101.9%, to a $0.3 million benefit in fiscal year 2015 from a $16.2 million expense in fiscal year 2014 mainly due to an increase of $12.8 million in valuation allowance in 2015 compared to an increase of $25.6 million in 2014. The decrease is also attributable to a higher loss before income taxes in the current year. Excluding the impact of the valuation allowance, the effective income tax rate decreased to 52.1% in fiscal year 2015 from 54.9% in fiscal year 2014 primarily due to the impact of the tax credit carryforwards.\nDiscontinued Operations, net\nLoss from discontinued operations was $21.5 million for fiscal 2015 compared to $20.2 million for fiscal year 2014. In April 2015, we completed the sale of Macaroni Grill. We recorded a $22.4 million impairment charge during the first quarter of 2015 to write down the net assets of Macaroni Grill to their estimated fair value less cost to sell. During the first quarter of 2015, we also recorded a net gain of $2.1 million on the sale of certain assets of Macaroni Grill and a $1.0 million gain on insurance settlements. During the second quarter of 2015, we recorded a $6.1 million loss on disposal of the Macaroni Grill, which was partially offset by the related tax benefit. The loss from discontinued operations in 2014 relates to the full year operating loss of Macaroni Grill, net of related tax expense, which included impairment charges of $6.3 million for Macaroni Grill's goodwill and $0.7 million related to Macaroni Grill's long-lived and intangible assets.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nGeneral\nOur primary sources of liquidity and capital resources are cash provided from operating activities, cash and cash equivalents, and our senior secured credit facility. Our primary requirements for liquidity and capital are restaurant development, working capital and general corporate needs. Additionally since December 2015, we have repaid $46.5 million of our 2014 Term Loan in an effort to reduce our leverage. Our operations have not required significant working capital and, like many restaurant companies, we have been able to operate, and will continue to operate, with negative working capital. Our requirement for working capital is not significant since our restaurant guests pay for their food and beverage purchases in cash or payment cards (credit or debit) at the time of sale. Thus, we are able to sell and collect payment for many of our inventory items before we have to pay our suppliers for such items. Our restaurants do not require significant inventories or receivables.\nGoing Concern\nWe have continued to experience declines in comparable restaurant sales and income from operations at Joe's and Brick House. We have closed underperforming restaurants and implemented cost reduction measures to help mitigate the effect of these declines and improve our financial position and liquidity. In late 2016, we engaged a financial advisor to assist us in evaluating various strategic alternatives potentially available to us. As part of this ongoing evaluation of strategic alternatives, on April 3, 2017, we announced that our Board of Directors, working together with our management team and our financial advisor, has commenced a process to pursue the sale of our business, which could be sold as an entirety or through the separate sales of Joe's or Brick House.\nAs of January 2, 2017, we were in compliance with all of our debt covenants. However, we are forecasting in 2017 that we may no longer be in compliance with the financial covenant ratios in our 2014 Credit Agreement. In an event of default, our lenders may accelerate the maturity of all of our indebtedness. If our lenders accelerate the maturity of our indebtedness, we will not have sufficient liquidity to repay the entire balance of our outstanding borrowings. The uncertainty associated with our ability to repay our outstanding debt obligations as they become due raises substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern for one year after the issuance date of the financial statements. The report of our independent registered public accounting firm that accompanies our audited consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended January 2, 2017 also contains an explanatory paragraph regarding our ability to continue as a going concern.\nOn March 31, 2017, we entered into a forbearance agreement with certain of the lenders and the Administrative Agent (collectively, the Forbearing Lenders\u201d) under the 2014 Credit Facility, whereby the Forbearing Lenders agreed to, among other things, forbear from taking any action to enforce certain of their rights or remedies under the 2014 Credit Agreement with respect to certain defaults, events of default, and anticipated events of default (the Forbearance Agreement\u201d). The Forbearance Agreement is effective until the earliest of (i) May 9, 2017, and (ii) the occurrence or existence of any default or event of default other than defaults, events of default and anticipated events of default that are subject to the Forbearance Agreement. Should we be in default of the Forbearance Agreement or should the required lenders and the Administrative Agent not agree to further extend such Forbearance Agreement, the Administrative Agent and lenders would be free to exercise any rights and remedies with respect to such defaults and events of defaults pursuant to the terms of the 2014 Credit Facility. which could include accelerating the maturity of all our indebtedness.\nWe are currently in discussions with our lenders in connection with our pursuit of various strategic alternatives to improve our capital structure. While we pursue these strategic alternatives, we are operating under a cash management strategy to enhance and preserve liquidity. This ongoing cash management strategy limits many of our operational and strategic initiatives designed to grow our business over the long term. We have successfully completed certain elements of our cash management strategy, including, among other things:\nTable 93: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> Closed 28 underperforming restaurants in the last two years\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 94: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> Reduced inventory levels in the restaurants\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 95: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> Sold non-core assets\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 96: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> Reduced annual marketing spend by $5.6 million with a focus on more cost-effective marketing strategies\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 97: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> Reduced and maintained restaurant-level labor and operating expenses\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 98: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> Reduced selling, general, and administrative expenses by over $9.0 million in 2016 through lower personnel costs and professional fees\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 99: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> \u25cf\n</td> <td> Eliminated new restaurant development and reduced capital expenditures to maintenance levels\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nBased on our current internal forecasts, our cash flows will be sufficient to fund anticipated cash requirements over the next 12 months for minimum capital expenditures, working capital purposes, and scheduled payments of principal and interest required pursuant to the terms of the 2014 Credit Facility. Increased competition and uncertainty in the casual dining industry continue to make it more difficult to accurately forecast our results of operations and cash position, so our revenues may deteriorate beyond what we anticipate. Our current plan for the remainder of 2017 contemplates a comparable restaurant sales decline in the high-single digits. A greater sales decline than reflected in our plan would negatively impact our results of operations and cash flows. If we cannot meet our capital needs using cash on hand and cash from operations as our current forecasts suggest, are not in compliance with the covenants in our debt agreement, and are unable to improve our capital structure, we may have to take other actions such as modify our business plan to close additional restaurants, pursue additional external liquidity generating events, seek additional financing to the extent available, further reduce or delay capital expenditures or file for protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. We can give no assurance that we will successfully execute the strategic transactions we are currently pursuing or any others, and our ability to do so could be adversely affected by numerous factors, including changes in the economic or business environment, financial market volatility, the performance of our business, and the terms and conditions of our debt agreement. It is possible that even a successful and efficient implementation of the recapitalization initiatives we are pursuing will require us to make a filing for protection under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.\nWe rely upon vendor financing in managing our liquidity. As a result, if our trade creditors were to impose unfavorable terms on us, it would negatively impact our ability to obtain products and services on acceptable terms and operate our business. In such event, our ability to maintain optimal inventory and service levels would be adversely affected, and our results of operations and financial performance would suffer.\nCash Flow\nThe following table shows summary cash flows information for fiscal years 2016, 2015 and 2014 (in thousands):\nTable 100: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Fiscal Year\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash provided by (used in):\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating activities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Continuing operations\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>6,150 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>25,379 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>18,392 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Discontinued operations\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,668 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,432 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Investing activities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Continuing operations\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(6,896 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(13,908 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(25,879 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Discontinued operations\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>240 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11,639 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>585 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Financing activities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(6,881 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(36,234 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>25,635 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(7,387 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(10,456 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17,301 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Increase in cash and cash equivalents - discontinued operations\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2,291 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(573 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents - continuing operations\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(7,387 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(12,747 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>16,728 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating Activities\nNet cash provided by operating activities - continuing operations decreased to $6.2 million for fiscal year 2016 from $25.4 million for fiscal year 2015. The decrease was primarily due to lower sales and changes in working capital including the timing of rent payments and collection of accounts receivable, partially offset by lower general and administrative expenses.\nNet cash provided by operating activities - continuing operations increased to $25.4 million for fiscal year 2015 from $18.4 million for fiscal year 2014. This increase was primarily due to lower general and administrative expenses and changes in working capital including the timing of rent payments and collection of accounts receivable, offset by higher interest payments.\nNet cash provided by operating activities - discontinued operations was $2.7 million in fiscal year 2015 versus net cash used of $1.4 million in fiscal year 2014 due to decrease in marketing expenses and costs related to restaurant closures.\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities - continuing operations was $6.9 million, $13.9 million and $25.9 million in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The net cash used was primarily attributable to capital expenditures for fiscal years 2016, 2015 and 2014 of $9.4 million, $16.6 million and $25.9 million, respectively. Variances in capital expenditures are primarily due to the number and timing of new or converted locations under construction. We also received $1.8 million and $2.0 million of proceeds from disposal of assets, respectively, in 2016 and 2015 primarily related to the closure of Joe's restaurants.\nNet cash provided by investing activities - discontinued operations was $0.2 million, $11.6 million and $0.6 million in 2016, 2015 and 2014, were primarily caused by the sale of Macaroni Grill in 2015.\nWe estimate that total capital expenditures for fiscal year 2017 will be approximately $5.0 million to $10.0 million.\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash used in financing activities was $6.9 million for fiscal year 2016, $36.2 million for fiscal year 2015, while net cash provided by financing activities was $25.6 million for fiscal year 2014. The 2016 balance reflects scheduled quarterly payments on the term loan plus $11.5 million in voluntary prepayments, partially offset by a net $6.0 million borrowing on the revolver. The 2015 balance reflects scheduled quarterly payments on the term loan plus a $35.0 million voluntary prepayment in December 2015. The 2014 balance reflects net borrowings of $25.8 million on our credit facility in fiscal year 2014, representing $41.8 million in net proceeds from our August 2014 refinancing, before accrued interest and fees and net of $4.8 million debt issuance cost payment, and $16.4 million in net repayments from our previous senior secured credit facility.\nSenior Secured Credit Facility\nOn August 13, 2014, we entered into a new senior secured credit facility ( 2014 Credit Agreement\u201d), which consists of a $30.0 million revolving credit facility ( 2014 Revolving Credit Facility\u201d) and a $165.0 million term loan ( 2014 Term Loan\u201d), which both mature on February 13, 2019. The 2014 Term Loan was issued at 98.5% of par. The principal amount of the 2014 Term Loan was payable in consecutive quarterly installments of $412,500, commencing on December 31, 2014, with the balance payable in full at maturity. Since December 2015, we have made $46.5 million in voluntary prepayments on our 2014 Term Loan, which reduced our quarterly installment payments to $294,886.\nInterest rates for borrowings under the 2014 Credit Agreement for the revolver and the term loan are equal to, at our option, either LIBOR (subject to a 1% floor) or the base rate as defined in the agreement, plus a margin of 7.0% for LIBOR loans and 6.0% for base rate loans. The interest rate for the 2014 Term Loan and the 2014 Revolving Credit Facility was 8.0% as of January 2, 2017. In addition, we are required to pay commitment fees on the unused portion of the 2014 Revolving Credit Facility. The commitment fee rate is currently at 0.5%. The commitment fee is subject to adjustment on a quarterly basis based on our leverage ratio as defined by the credit agreement.\nThe 2014 Credit Agreement is guaranteed by each of our subsidiaries and secured by substantially all of our present and future assets and a lien on the capital stock or other equity interests of our direct and indirect subsidiaries. The 2014 Credit Agreement contains covenants which, among other things, limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness, create liens on our assets, make certain investments or loans, merge or otherwise dispose of assets other than in the ordinary course of business, make acquisitions, and pay dividends or make other restricted payments. The 2014 Credit Agreement also contains customary covenants regarding, among other matters, the maintenance of insurance, the preservation and maintenance of our corporate existence, material compliance with laws, and the payment of taxes and other material obligations.\nThe 2014 Credit Agreement provides that (a) the leverage ratio shall not exceed (i) 5.75x through December 29, 2014, (ii) 5.5x from December 30, 2014 through June 29, 2015, (iii) 5.25x from June 30, 2015 through December 28, 2015, (iv) 5.0x from December 29, 2015 through March 28, 2016, (v) 4.75x from March 29, 2016 through June 27, 2016, (vi) 4.25x from June 28, 2016 through September 26, 2016, (vii) 4.0x from September 27, 2016 through April 3, 2017, (viii) 3.75x from April 4, 2017 through October 2, 2017, (ix) 3.5x from October 3, 2017 through April 2, 2018, (x) 3.25x from April 3, 2018 through December 31, 2018, and (xi) 3.0x from January 1, 2019 through maturity date; and requires (b) an interest coverage ratio of at least (i) 2.0x through June 29, 2015, (ii) 2.25x from June 30, 2015 through March 28, 2016, (iii) 2.5x from March 29, 2016 through June 27, 2016, (iv) 2.75x from June 28, 2016 through January 2, 2017, (v) 3.0x from January 3, 2017 through July 3, 2017, (vi) 3.25x from July 4, 2017 through April 2, 2018, (vii) 3.5x from April 3, 2018 through December 31, 2018, and (viii) 3.75x from January 1, 2019 through maturity date. The 2014 Credit Agreement limits capital expenditures to an amount in respect of any period not to exceed (i) $29.5 million from the closing date through December 29, 2014, (ii) $45.5 million for fiscal 2015, (iii) $45.8 million for fiscal 2016, (iv) $52.5 million for fiscal 2017, (v) $53.7 million for fiscal 2018, and (vi) $58.6 million from January 1, 2019 through maturity date, provided that the amount of permitted capital expenditures in any period can be increased by the unused permitted capital expenditures from the immediately preceding period, subject to certain limitations as defined by the agreement. We were in compliance with these covenants as of January 2, 2017.\nIn December 2015, we made a $35.0 million voluntary prepayment of our 2014 Term Loan and wrote off $0.6 million of debt issuance costs and $0.4 million of debt discount, which are included in interest expense. In 2016, we made $11.5 million in voluntary prepayments of our 2014 Term Loan and wrote off $161 thousand of debt issuance costs and $105 thousand of debt discount, which are included in interest expense.\nAs of January 2, 2017, we had letters of credit of approximately $10.1 million outstanding under the 2014 Revolving Credit Facility and had available borrowing capacity of approximately $13.9 million.\nNASDAQ Delisting\nOn March 10, 2017, we received a notice (the Notice\u201d) from the Office of General Counsel of NASDAQ indicating that the NASDAQ Hearings Panel (the Panel\u201d) has determined that our securities would be delisted from The NASDAQ Global Select Market. Accordingly, trading of our common stock was suspended at the opening of business on March 14, 2017, and a Form 25-Notification of Delisting will be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which will remove our securities from listing and registration on NASDAQ.\nThe Notice indicated that the Panel's determination was based on concerns about our ability to sustain compliance with all requirements for continued listing on The NASDAQ Stock Market. Specifically, on July 28, 2016, NASDAQ Listing Qualifications Staff (the Staff\u201d) notified us that we were no longer in compliance with NASDAQ Marketplace Rule 5450(b)(3)(C) since the market value of our publicly held shares closed below the required minimum of $15,000,000 for the previous 30 consecutive business days. In accordance with NASDAQ Marketplace Rule 5810(c) (3)(D), the Staff granted us a 180-day period, or until January 24, 2017, to regain compliance. We were unable to regain compliance with Rule 5450(b)(2)(C) by January 24, 2017. Accordingly, on January 25, 2017, we received a letter from Staff notifying us that our common stock would be delisted from The NASDAQ Global Select Market on February 3, 2017 unless we timely requested a hearing before the Panel. We appealed the Staff's determination by requesting a hearing before the Panel to seek continued listing. On March 10, 2017, the Panel determined that our shares would be delisted from The NASDAQ Stock Market effective at the open of business on March 14, 2017. Since March 15, 2017, our common stock has traded in the OTC market under the symbol IRGT.\nThe OTC market is a significantly more limited market than the NASDAQ Global Select Market and the quotation of our common stock on the OTC market has resulted in a less liquid market available for existing and potential stockholders to trade shares of our common stock. This could further depress the trading price of our common stock and could also have a long-term adverse effect on our ability to raise capital. We cannot provide any assurances as to if or when we will be in a position to relist our common stock on a nationally-recognized securities exchange. See Item 1A. Risk Factors-Our common stock is no longer listed on a national securities exchange and is quoted only on the over-the-counter ( OTC\u201d) market, which could negatively affect our stock price and liquidity.\u201d\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nExcept for restaurant operating leases, we have no material off-balance sheet arrangements.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table sets forth our contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of January 2, 2017 (in thousands):\nTable 101: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Payments Due by Period in Years\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Less than 1\nyear\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1 - 3 years\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 3 - 5 years\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> More than 5\nyears\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Long-term debt\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>121,301 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,180 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>120,121 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating leases\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>230,737 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>29,655 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>56,091 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>48,172 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>96,819 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest payments(a)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>24,447 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11,547 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12,900 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Uncertain tax positions(b)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>376,485 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>42,382 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>189,112 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>48,172 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>96,819 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n__________________________\nTable 102: <table> <tr> <td> (a)\n</td> <td> We estimate future interest payments on our long-term debt using interest rates and applicable margin in effect at January 2, 2017.\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (b)\n</td> <td> We have $0.4 million of uncertain tax positions, including interest and penalties, recorded in other long-term liabilities or as a reduction to net operating loss carryforwards. It is not reasonably possible to predict at this time when (or if) any of these assessments will be settled.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nImpact of Inflation\nOur profitability is dependent, among other things, on our ability to anticipate and react to changes in the costs of key operating resources, including food and beverages, labor, energy and other services. Substantial increases in costs and expenses, including the cost of crab and other shellfish, could impact our operating results to the extent such increases cannot be passed along to our guests. We have been able to substantially offset restaurant and operating cost increases resulting from inflation by altering our menu items, increasing menu prices, making productivity improvements or other adjustments. However, certain areas of costs, notably labor and utilities, can be significantly volatile or subject to significant changes due to changes in laws or regulations, such as the minimum wage laws. There can be no assurance that we will generate increases in comparable restaurant sales in amounts sufficient to offset inflationary or other cost pressures.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nWe utilize financial measures and terms not calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ( GAAP\u201d) to evaluate our operating performance. These non-GAAP measures are provided to enhance the reader's overall understanding of our current financial performance. These measurements are used by many investors as a supplemental measure to evaluate the overall operating performance of companies in our industry. Management believes that investors' understanding of our performance is enhanced by including these non-GAAP financial measures as a reasonable basis for comparing our ongoing results of operations. Many investors are interested in understanding the performance of our business by comparing our results from ongoing operations from one period to the next and would ordinarily add back events that are not part of normal day-to-day operations of our business. Management and our principal stockholder also use such measures as measurements of operating performance, for planning purposes, and to evaluate the performance and effectiveness of our operational strategies.\nThese non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. We have provided a definition below for these non-GAAP financial measures, together with an explanation of why management uses these measures and why management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors. In addition, we have provided a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures utilized to their equivalent GAAP financial measures.\nAdjusted Loss from Continuing Operations\nWe calculate adjusted loss from continuing operations by eliminating from loss from continuing operations the impact of items we do not consider indicative of our ongoing operations. Specifically, we believe that this non-GAAP measure provides greater comparability and enhanced visibility into our results of operations, excluding the impact of special charges and certain other expenses. Adjusted loss from continuing operations represents loss from continuing operations less items such as (a) transaction costs, (b) costs related to conversions, remodels and closures, (c) write-off of debt issuance costs and debt discount, (d) asset impairments, (e) loss (gain) on insurance settlements, (f) the current and deferred income tax effect of the above described adjustments (calculated using a marginal rate of 38.5% in fiscal year 2016, 39.0% in fiscal year 2015 and 39.6% in fiscal year 2014, and (g) the deferred tax asset valuation allowance. We believe this measure provides additional information to facilitate the comparison of our past and present financial results. We utilize results that both include and exclude the identified items in evaluating business performance. However, our inclusion of these adjusted measure should not be construed as an indication that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or infrequent items. In the future, we may incur expenses or generate income similar to these adjustments.\nA reconciliation of loss from continuing operations to adjusted loss from continuing operations is as follows:\nTable 103: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Fiscal Year\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loss from continuing operations\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(44,361 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(24,849 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(33,382 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Adjustments - continuing operations:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Transaction costs </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>627 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>510 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Costs related to conversions, remodels and closures </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,037 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,954 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>127 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Write-off of debt issuance costs and debt discount </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>266 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>962 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,241 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Asset impairments </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>26,237 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9,409 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,770 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Loss (gain) on insurance settlements </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(755 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>428 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(89 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Income tax effect of adjustments above </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Current benefit </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(59 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(119 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(979 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Deferred benefit </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(12,031 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(4,856 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(817 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Valuation allowance </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17,781 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12,807 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>25,632 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Adjusted loss from continuing operations\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(7,258 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(4,264 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(4,987 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Weighted average shares outstanding\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Basic </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>25,834 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>25,731 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>25,659 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Diluted </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>25,834 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>25,731 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>25,659 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loss from continuing operations per share\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Basic and diluted </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(1.72 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(0.97 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(1.30 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Adjusted loss from continuing operations per share\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Basic and diluted </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(0.28 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(0.17 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(0.19 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n</table>\nRestaurant-level Profit and Restaurant-level Profit Margin\nAs used herein, restaurant-level profit represents revenues less (i) licensing and franchising revenues not attributable to core company-owned restaurant operations, (ii) cost of sales, (iii) labor expenses, (iv) occupancy expenses, and (v) other operating expenses (vi) plus non-cash rent related to restaurant operations. Restaurant-level profit margin is calculated as restaurant-level profit divided by restaurant sales. Restaurant-level profit and restaurant-level profit margin are a supplemental measure of operating performance of our restaurants that do not represent and should not be considered as an alternative to net income or revenues as determined by GAAP, and our calculation thereof may not be comparable to that reported by other companies. Restaurant-level profit and restaurant-level profit margin have limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider them in isolation, or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Management believes restaurant-level profit and restaurant-level profit margin are an important component of financial results because they are a widely used metric within the restaurant industry to evaluate restaurant-level productivity, efficiency and performance. Management uses restaurant-level profit and restaurant-level profit margin as key metrics to evaluate our financial performance compared with our competitors, to evaluate the profitability of incremental sales and to evaluate our performance across periods.\nTable 104: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Fiscal Year\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (in thousands, except percentages)\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revenues\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>450,279 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>492,044 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>503,508 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Less: Other revenues\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>414 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>295 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>179 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Restaurant sales(A)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>449,865 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>491,749 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>503,329 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Restaurant operating costs and expenses\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cost of sales\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>147,036 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>154,270 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>163,407 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Labor expenses\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>134,048 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>142,209 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>142,662 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Occupancy expenses\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>38,312 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>40,890 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>39,401 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other operating expenses\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>83,582 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>95,384 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>94,086 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Deferred rent\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,130 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,692 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,580 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Restaurant-level profit(B)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>48,017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>60,688 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>65,353 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Restaurant-level profit margin (B \u00f7 A)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10.7 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12.3 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nDisclosure regarding recent accounting pronouncements can be found in Note 2 of our consolidated financial statements contained in this Form 10-K.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nWe prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Critical accounting policies are those that management believes are both most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and operating results, and require management's most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. We base our estimates on historical experience, outside advice from parties believed to be experts in such matters, and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of those policies may result in materially different amounts being reported under different conditions or using different assumptions. Our significant accounting policies can be found in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements. We consider the following policies to be the most critical in understanding the judgments that are involved in preparing our consolidated financial statements.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets and Disposal of Property and Equipment\nWe evaluate the recoverability of the carrying amount of long-lived assets, including property and equipment, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be fully recoverable. Our review for impairment of these long-lived assets takes into account estimates of future undiscounted cash flows. Factors considered include, but are not limited to, significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results, significant changes in the manner of use of the acquired assets or the strategy for the overall business, and significant negative industry or economic trends. Our asset group for impairment testing is comprised of the assets and liabilities of each of our individual restaurants, since this is the lowest level of identifiable cash flows. We estimate the future cash flows expected to result from the use of the long-lived assets and their eventual disposition. An impairment loss may be recognized if the future undiscounted cash flows associated with the assets are less than their carrying value. Impairment losses are measured as the amount by which the carrying values of the assets exceed their fair values. We estimate fair value by discounting the expected future cash flows of our restaurants over their remaining lease terms.\nThe following estimates and assumptions used in the discounted cash flow analysis impact the fair value of restaurant long-lived assets:\nTable 105: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> discount rate based on our weighted average cost of capital and the risk-free rate of return;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 106: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> sales growth rates and cash operating margins over the expected remaining lease terms;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 107: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> strategic plans, including projected capital spending and intent to exercise renewal options, for the restaurant;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 108: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> other risks and qualitative factors specific to the asset or conditions in the market in which the asset is located at the time the assessment was made.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nDuring Fiscal 2016, the average discount rate, average sales growth rate and average cash operating margin rate used were 9.2%, (0.6)% and 2.5%, respectively. We believe our assumptions in calculating the fair value of our long-lived assets are similar to those used by other marketplace participants.\nWe recorded impairment charges of $26.2 million in fiscal year 2016, $9.4 million in fiscal year 2015 and $1.8 million in fiscal year 2014, which is included in asset impairments and closures in our consolidated statements of operations, related to our long-lived assets. If we are unable to improve the performance of our restaurants or if we experience deteriorating results at some of our restaurants, we could recognize additional impairment charges.\nFrom time to time, we have decided to close or dispose of restaurants. Typically, such decisions are made based on operating performance or strategic considerations and must be made before the actual costs or proceeds of disposition are known, and management must make estimates of these outcomes. Such outcomes could include the sale of a leasehold, mitigating costs through a tenant or subtenant, or negotiating a buyout of a remaining lease term. In these instances, management evaluates possible outcomes, frequently using outside real estate and legal advice, and records provisions for the effect of such outcomes. The accuracy of such provisions can vary materially from original estimates, and management regularly monitors the adequacy of the provisions until final disposition occurs.\nLeases\nWe currently lease all of our restaurant locations under leases classified as operating leases. Minimum base rent for our operating leases, which generally have escalating rentals over the term of the lease, is recorded on a straight-line basis over the lease term. As such, an equal amount of rent expense is attributed to each period during the term of the lease regardless of when actual payments occur. Lease terms begin on the date we take possession under the lease and include cancelable option periods where failure to exercise such options would result in an economic penalty. The difference between rent expense and actual cash payments is classified as deferred rent in our consolidated balance sheets.\nSome of our leases provide for contingent rent, which is determined as a percentage of sales in excess of specified minimum sales levels. We recognize contingent rent expense prior to the achievement of the specified sales target that triggers the contingent rent, provided achievement of the sales target is considered probable.\nInsurance Reserves\nWe maintain large deductibles on workers' compensation, general liability, property, and business interruption insurance coverage. These policies have been structured to limit our per-occurrence exposure. We record a liability for workers' compensation and general liability for all unresolved claims based on actuarial information provided by our insurance brokers and insurers, combined with management judgments regarding economic conditions, including future medical and indemnity costs, the frequency and severity of claims and claim development history, case jurisdiction, applicable legislation and settlement practices. Changes in any of these factors in the future may produce materially different amounts of expense than otherwise would be reported under these insurance programs.\nIncome Taxes\nWe are subject to U.S. federal income tax and income taxes imposed in the state and local jurisdictions where we operate our restaurants. Deferred income taxes are provided on temporary differences between financial statement and income tax reporting. Temporary differences are differences between the amounts of assets and liabilities reported for financial statement purposes and their tax bases. Deferred tax assets are recognized for temporary differences that will be deductible in future years' tax returns and for operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. We evaluate our deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis to determine whether a valuation allowance is required. We assess whether a valuation allowance should be established based on our determination of whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. We consider the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. Deferred tax liabilities are recognized for temporary differences that will be taxable in future years' tax returns.\nWe account for uncertain tax positions using a minimum probability threshold that a tax position must meet before a financial statement benefit is recognized. The minimum threshold is defined as a tax position that is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by tax authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefit to be recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. See Note 10 for information regarding changes in our unrecognized tax benefits.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis annual report on Form 10-K includes forward-looking statements\u201d within the meaning of the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

"Item 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nYou should read the following discussion together with Selected Financial Data,\u201d and the historical financial statements and related notes included in this annual report on Form 10-K. The statements in this discussion regarding industry outlook, our expectations regarding our future performance, liquidity and capital resources and other non-historical statements in this discussion are forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, the risks and uncertainties described in Risk Factors\u201d and Forward-Looking Statements\u201d included in this report. Our actual results may differ materially from those contained in or implied by any forward-looking statements.\nOur fiscal year ends on the Monday nearest to December 31 of each year. Fiscal year 2016 was a 53-week year and ended on January 2, 2017. Fiscal years 2015 and 2014 were 52-week years. References to fiscal years 2015 and 2014 are references to fiscal years ended December 28, 2015 and December 29, 2014, respectively.\nOverview\nIgnite Restaurant Group, Inc. operates two restaurant brands in the casual dining segment, Joe's Crab Shack ( Joe's\u201d) and Brick House Tavern + Tap ( Brick House\u201d). Each of our restaurant brands offers a variety of high-quality food in a distinctive, casual, high-energy atmosphere. Joe's and Brick House operate in a diverse set of markets across the United States and internationally. As of January 2, 2017, we operated 112 Joe's and 25 Brick House restaurants in 32 states and franchised three Joe's restaurants in Dubai, U.A.E.\nJoe's is an established, national chain of casual dining seafood restaurants. Joe's serves a variety of high-quality seafood items, with an emphasis on crab. Joe's is a high-energy, family-friendly restaurant that encourages guests to roll up your sleeves and crack into some crab.\u201d Brick House is a casual restaurant brand that provides guests an elevated experience appropriate for every day usage.\nIn fiscal year 2016, we opened three new Brick House restaurants, all of which were conversions from Joe's restaurants. We also closed 18 Joe's restaurants and one Brick House restaurant during 2016.\nOutlook\nWe have experienced a decline in the operating performance at Joe's. During fiscal year 2016, the comparable restaurant sales of Joe's declined by 7.3% which contributed to a decrease in income from operations from the prior year. The largest impact on the decline in comparable restaurant sales is from our Northeast and Texas markets. We are also experiencing sales declines in other geographic regions primarily due to decreased guest traffic. In order to reverse these negative trends, we have deployed many different operational strategies, but so far none have had a meaningful impact on sales or guest traffic. The biggest declines in sales and guest traffic continue to be on weekends. We have started introducing new menu items at both brands to enhance the current offerings as well as to improve the value proposition for our guests. We will continue to evaluate our menu offerings and look for other value offerings that could increase sales and traffic.\nWe have also experienced a decline in operating performance at Brick House. During fiscal year 2016, the comparable restaurant sales of Brick House decreased by 7.7%, which contributed to a $0.6 million decrease in income from operations from the prior year, excluding the $2.7 million non-cash impairment charge in 2016. We are continuing to evaluate our menu to ensure we are offering items that are consistent with the expectations of our guests.\nWe are continuing to evaluate our underperforming restaurants. During 2016, we closed 18 Joe's and one Brick House restaurant. Additional declines in the operating performance at Joe's or Brick House could cause us to close or sell more restaurants which may require us to recognize additional asset impairment or closure-related expenses and increase our valuation allowance during 2017 against some or all of our deferred tax assets.\nThe Board of Directors, working together with our management team and our financial advisor, has commenced a process to pursue the sale of our business, which could be sold as an entirety or through the separate sales of our two restaurant brands, Joe's and Brick House. There can be no assurance that the process that we are undertaking will be successful. In addition, we cannot predict the terms or timing of any transaction that we may undertake or whether any such transaction will result in any proceeds for the holders of our common stock. We are also exploring a variety of strategic alternatives to strengthen our capital structure. For the remainder of 2017, we are committed to preserving liquidity and improving our capital structure. Our capital expenditures will remain at maintenance levels and we will continue to manage working capital and restaurant-level operating expenses. However, there can be no assurance regarding these matters. Further deterioration would negatively impact our anticipated revenues, profitability and cash flows from operations. Our expectations with respect to our performance over the remainder of 2017 are subject to a number of assumptions, many of which are outside of our control.\nWe are currently in discussions with our lenders in connection with our pursuit of various strategic alternatives. We can give no assurance that we will successfully execute any strategic alternatives we are currently pursuing or any others, and our ability to do so could be adversely affected by numerous factors, including changes in the economic or business environment, financial market volatility, the performance of our business, and the terms and conditions of the 2014 Credit Facility. See Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d below for further discussion of our operational plan to preserve liquidity.\nRecent Developments\nAsset Impairment and Closures\nWe evaluate the recoverability of the carrying amount of long-lived assets, which include property and equipment and intangible assets, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be fully recoverable. Due to continued declines in operating performance at certain Joe's and Brick House restaurants in 2016 we recorded impairment charges of $26.2 million related to Joe's and Brick House's long-lived assets. In 2015 and 2014 we recorded impairment charges of $9.4 and $1.8 million, respectively, related to Joe's long-lived assets. Additionally, in 2016, 2015 and 2014 we recorded restaurant closure expenses of $5.1 million, $1.1 million and $210 thousand, respectively.\nValuation Allowance\nWe evaluate our deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis to determine whether a valuation allowance is required. We assess whether a valuation allowance should be established based on our determination of whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible and prior to the expiration of our credit carryforwards which begin to expire in 2031. We consider the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. Due to continued operating losses and asset impairments we are in a three-year cumulative loss position. According to ASC Topic No. 740, Income Taxes, cumulative losses in recent years represent significant negative evidence in considering whether deferred tax assets are realizable. During fiscal year 2016, 2015 and 2014 we recorded a valuation allowance of $17.8 million, $12.8 million and $25.6 million, respectively in continuing operations.\nWe excluded the deferred tax liabilities related to certain indefinite lived intangibles when calculating the amount of valuation allowance needed as these liabilities cannot be considered as a source of income when determining the realizability of the net deferred tax assets. The valuation allowance was recorded as a reduction to our income tax benefit in our consolidated statement of operations. If we are able to generate sufficient taxable income in the future such that it becomes more likely than not that we will be able to fully utilize the net deferred tax assets on which a valuation allowance was recorded, our effective tax rate may decrease if the valuation allowance is reversed.\nKey Performance Indicators\nIn assessing the performance of our business, we consider a variety of performance and financial measures. The key measures for determining how our business is performing are comparable restaurant sales growth, average weekly sales, restaurant operating weeks, average check, average unit volume and number of restaurant openings.\nComparable Restaurant Sales Growth\nComparable restaurant sales growth reflects the change in year-over-year sales for the comparable restaurant base. We define the comparable restaurant base to include those restaurants open for at least 104 weeks, or approximately 24 months. As of January 2, 2017, December 28, 2015 and December 29, 2014 there were 132, 147 and 142, respectively, in our comparable restaurant base. Comparable restaurant sales growth can be generated by an increase in guest counts and/or by increases in the average check amount resulting from a shift in menu mix and/or increase in price. This measure highlights performance of existing restaurants as the impact of new restaurant openings is excluded.\nAverage Weekly Sales\nAverage weekly sales is a key measure of individual restaurant economic performance of new and existing restaurants. Average weekly sales reflects total sales of all restaurants divided by restaurant operating weeks (see below). This measure is subject to seasonality for periods less than one year.\nRestaurant Operating Weeks\nRestaurant operating weeks is the aggregate number of weeks that our restaurants are in operation over a specific period of time.\nAverage Check\nAverage check is calculated for Joe's by dividing net sales by guest counts for a given time period. Management uses this indicator to analyze the dollars spent in our Joe's restaurants per guest. This measure aids management in identifying trends in guest preferences, as well as the effectiveness of menu price increases and other menu changes.\nGuest counts represent the estimated number of guests served in our restaurants. The count is estimated based on the number of entr\u00e9es sold. Our estimates may vary from actual guest counts due to the variability in the level of sharing of certain entr\u00e9e items on our menu. Given the significant level of alcohol sales and appetizer sales at Brick House, guest count is more difficult to quantify and therefore, we do not currently calculate average check as a key performance indicator for that brand.\nAverage Unit Volume\nAverage unit volume represents the average sales for restaurants included in the comparable restaurant base for a given time period, typically annually. Average unit volume reflects total sales for restaurants in our comparable restaurant base divided by the number of restaurants in our comparable restaurant base. This measure is subject to seasonality for periods less than one year.\nNumber of Restaurant Openings\nNumber of restaurant openings reflects the number of restaurants opened or converted during a particular reporting period. Before we open new restaurants or convert existing restaurants, we incur pre-opening costs. Typically, new restaurants open with an initial start-up period of higher than normalized sales volumes, which subsequently decrease to stabilized levels. While sales volumes are generally higher during the initial opening period, new restaurants typically experience normal inefficiencies in the form of higher cost of sales, labor and other direct operating expenses for several months and as a result, restaurant operating margins are generally lower during the start-up period of operation. The number and timing of restaurant openings has had an impact on our results of operations.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table presents the consolidated statement of operations for the past three fiscal years expressed as a percentage of revenues.\n\n__________________________\n * The percentages reflected are subject to rounding adjustments. They may not foot due to rounding. \nThe following table sets forth additional operating information for the periods indicated that we use in assessing our performance:\n\n__________________________\n (1) See the definitions of key performance indicators beginning on page 32. \n (2) Reconciliation and discussion of non-GAAP financial measures are included under Non-GAAP Financial Measures.\u201d These measures should be considered in addition to, rather than as a substitute for, U.S. GAAP measures. \nFiscal Year 2016 (53 Weeks) Compared to Fiscal Year 2015 (52 Weeks)\nRevenues\nRevenues were $450.3 million for fiscal year 2016, a decrease of $41.8 million, or 8.5%, compared to revenues of $492.0 million for fiscal year 2015. The decrease is primarily due to a decrease of 7.3% in comparable restaurant sales and the closure of 19 restaurants.\nRevenues at Joe's decreased 11.5% to $366.6 million in fiscal year 2016 compared to $414.3 million in fiscal year 2015. The decrease is primarily caused by a 7.3% decrease in comparable restaurant sales and the closure of 18 restaurants. The comparable restaurant sales decrease is comprised of 8.4% decrease in guest count partially offset by a 1.1% increase in pricing. Joe's average weekly sales decreased to $55 thousand from $59 thousand in the prior year. Restaurant operating weeks decreased to 6,605 in 2016 from 7,058 in 2015 due to restaurant closures. We believe the decline in comparable restaurant sales is primarily due to a decrease in guest traffic and continued sales declines at restaurants in our Northeast and Texas markets.\nBrick House revenues increased 7.7% to $83.7 million in fiscal year 2016 versus $77.7 million in fiscal year 2015 due to three new restaurant openings in the first quarter of 2016, partially offset by the closing of one restaurant and a 7.7% decrease in comparable restaurant sales. The comparable restaurant sales decrease was comprised of an 8.1% decrease from traffic and mix and a 0.4% increase in pricing. Brick House's average weekly sales decreased to $62 thousand from $66 thousand in prior year. Restaurant operating weeks increased to 1,341 in 2016 from 1,176 in 2015 due to new restaurant openings.\nCosts of Sales\nCost of sales decreased by $7.2 million, or 4.7%, to $147.0 million in 2016 versus $154.3 million in 2015 mainly due to the decrease in sales volume and restaurant closures, partially offset by increased commodity pricing during 2016. As a percent of revenue, cost of sales increased to 32.7% from 31.4% primarily due to commodity price inflation.\nLabor Expenses\nLabor expenses decreased by $8.2 million, or 5.7%, to $134.0 million in 2016 versus $142.2 million in 2015. The decrease is mainly due to the closure of 19 restaurants in 2016 partially offset by the opening of three new Brick House restaurants. As a percent of revenue, labor expenses increased to 29.8% in fiscal year 2016 from 28.9% in fiscal year 2015 due to increases in minimum wage and deleverage from lower sales.\nOccupancy Expenses\nOccupancy expenses decreased by $2.6 million, or 6.3%, to $38.3 million in 2016 compared to $40.9 million in 2015. The decrease is primarily caused by the closure of 19 restaurants. As a percentage of revenue, occupancy expenses increased to 8.5% from 8.3% primarily due to deleveraging of fixed rent expense from the decrease in comparable restaurant sales.\nOther Operating Expenses\nOther operating expenses decreased by $11.8 million, or 12.4%, to $83.6 million in 2016 versus $95.4 million in 2015. The decrease is primarily caused by the closure of 19 restaurants and the decrease in advertising costs partially offset by higher insurance costs and operating supplies. As a percent of revenue, other operating expenses decreased to 18.6% in 2016 from 19.4% in 2015 primarily due to decreased advertising costs.\nGeneral and Administrative\nGeneral and administrative expenses decreased by $7.0 million, or 23.1%, to $23.5 million in 2016 compared to $30.5 million in 2015. As a percent of revenue, general and administrative expenses decreased to 5.2% in fiscal year 2016 from 6.2% in fiscal year 2015 due to decreased personnel costs, including a reduction of $1.6 million in severance costs, and professional fees.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nDepreciation and amortization expense decreased by $2.6 million, or 10.1%, to $23.2 million in 2016 versus $25.8 million in 2015. This decrease is primarily due to the closure of 19 restaurants during 2016. As a percentage of revenue, depreciation and amortization remained constant at 5.2% in fiscal year 2016 and 2015.\nPre-Opening Costs\nPre-opening costs decreased by $51 thousand, or 5.5%, to $0.9 million in 2016 from $0.9 million in 2015. This decrease is mainly due to the timing of scheduled restaurant openings. We converted three restaurants in 2016 and converted two restaurants in 2015.\nAsset Impairments and Closures\nAsset impairments and closures increased to $31.4 million for fiscal year 2016 from $10.5 million for fiscal year 2015. The $20.9 million increase is mainly due to the impairment charges on long-lived assets of $26.2 million and $9.4 million in 2016 and 2015, respectively. We also closed 19 restaurants in the current year versus nine in the prior year and recorded $5.1 million and $1.1 million, respectively, in closure-related expenses, primarily comprised of future minimum lease obligations. If we are unable to improve the performance of our restaurants or if we experience deteriorating results at some of our restaurants, we could recognize additional impairment charges or closure related expenses.\nLoss (Gain) on Disposal of Assets\nLoss on disposal of assets increased by $0.7 million, to a $0.6 million loss in fiscal year 2016. The loss in fiscal year 2016 was primarily due to asset retirement losses for closed and converted restaurants, partially offset by gains on the sale of the leasehold interest for two locations. The gain in fiscal year 2015 included a $2.0 million net gain on restaurants sold, offset by the impact of writing off $0.6 million in book value of replaced restaurant equipment and facilities improvements, and $1.3 million in asset retirement losses for closed, converted and remodeled restaurants.\nIncome (Loss) from Operations\nAs a result of the foregoing, consolidated loss from operations increased by $23.9 million, to a $32.3 million loss in fiscal year 2016 from an $8.4 million loss in fiscal year 2015.\nJoe's income from operations decreased by $26.1 million, to a $16.6 million loss in fiscal year 2016 from $9.5 million in income in fiscal year 2015. As a percent of revenue, excluding the impact of non-cash impairment charges, accelerated depreciation, pre-opening costs, severance and other costs related to conversions, remodels and closures, income from operations for Joe's decreased to 3.2% in the current year from 5.2% in the prior year. This decrease is primarily attributable to lower comparable restaurant sales and deleveraging of fixed costs against lower sales volume and increases in commodity pricing.\nIncome from operations for Brick House decreased by $3.4 million, to $2.2 million in fiscal year 2016 from $5.5 million in fiscal year 2015. As a percent of revenue, excluding the impact of non-cash impairment charges, pre-opening costs, severance and other costs related to conversions, remodels and closures, Brick House's income from operations decreased to 7.6% in the current year from 8.3% in the prior year. The decrease is primarily due to lower comparable restaurant sales and increases in cost of sales.\nInterest Expense, Net\nInterest expense, net decreased by $3.8 million, or 23.0%, to $12.6 million in 2016 from $16.4 million in 2015. The decrease is due to lower average debt balance in 2016 due to voluntary prepayments of $46.5 million since the end of fiscal year 2015. The fiscal 2016 balance includes a $0.3 million write-off of debt issuance costs and debt discount compared to a $1.0 million write-off of debt issuance costs in 2015.\nIncome Tax Expense (Benefit)\nThe income tax expense increased by $0.5 million, to a $0.2 million expense in fiscal year 2016 from a $0.3 million benefit in fiscal year 2015 mainly due to an increase of $17.8 million in valuation allowance in 2016 compared to an increase of $12.8 million in 2015. Excluding the impact of the valuation allowance, the effective income tax rate decreased to 39.8% in fiscal year 2016 from 52.1% in fiscal year 2015 primarily due to the impact of the tax credit carryforwards.\nFiscal Year 2015 (52 Weeks) Compared to Fiscal Year 2014 (52 Weeks)\nRevenues\nRevenues were $492.0 million for fiscal year 2015, a decrease of $11.5 million, or 2.3%, compared to revenues of $503.5 million for fiscal year 2014. The decrease is primarily due to a decrease of 3.9% in comparable restaurant sales, partially offset by higher operating weeks caused by the timing of restaurant opening and closure activities.\nRevenues at Joe's decreased 4.3% to $414.3 million in fiscal year 2015 compared to $433.0 million in fiscal year 2014. The decrease is primarily caused by a 4.5% decrease in comparable restaurant sales. The comparable restaurant sales decrease is comprised of 5.1% decrease in guest count and a 1.0% decrease in mix, partially offset by a 1.6% increase in pricing. Joe's average weekly sales decreased to $59 thousand from $61 thousand in the prior year. Restaurant operating weeks decreased to 7,058 in 2015 from 7,107 in 2014 due to restaurant closures. We believe the decline in comparable restaurant sales is primarily due to a decrease in guest traffic and continued sales declines at restaurants in the Northeast region.\nBrick House revenues increased 10.2% to $77.7 million in fiscal year 2015 versus $70.5 million in fiscal year 2014. The increase was the result of a 1.0% increase in comparable restaurant sales and new restaurant openings. The comparable restaurant sales increase is comprised of a 2.8% increase in pricing, partially offset by a 1.8% decrease in combined guest count and mix benefits. Brick House's average weekly sales were at $66 thousand for both fiscal years 2015 and 2014. Restaurant operating weeks increased to 1,176 in 2015 from 1,062 in 2014 due to new restaurant openings.\nCosts of Sales\nCost of sales decreased by $9.1 million, or 5.6%, to $154.3 million in 2015 versus $163.4 million in 2014 mainly due to the decrease in sales volume. As a percent of revenue, cost of sales decreased to 31.4% from 32.5% primarily due to improvement in seafood pricing at Joe's and reduced discounting at Brick House.\nLabor Expenses\nLabor expenses decreased by $0.5 million, or 0.3%, to $142.2 million in 2015 versus $142.7 million in 2014. The decrease is mainly due to lower restaurant management bonuses caused by lower sales, partially offset by decreased productivity in hourly labor at Joe's. As a percent of revenue, labor expenses increased to 28.9% in fiscal year 2015 from 28.3% in fiscal year 2014 due to decreased productivity, increases in minimum wage, and deleverage from lower sales.\nOccupancy Expenses\nOccupancy expenses increased by $1.5 million, or 3.8%, to $40.9 million in 2015 compared to $39.4 million in 2014. The increase is primarily caused by the increase in operating weeks. As a percentage of revenue, occupancy expenses increased to 8.3% from 7.8% primarily due to deleveraging of fixed rent expense from the decrease in comparable restaurant sales.\nOther Operating Expenses\nOther operating expenses increased by $1.3 million, or 1.4%, to $95.4 million in 2015 versus $94.1 million in 2014. This is mainly due to increased insurance costs and building expenses, partially offset by lower credit card fees attributable to lower sales in the current year. As a percent of revenue, other operating expenses increased to 19.4% in 2015 from 18.7% in 2014 due to increased insurance costs and deleverage from lower sales.\nGeneral and Administrative\nGeneral and administrative expenses decreased by $8.1 million, or 21.1%, to $30.5 million in 2015 compared to $38.7 million in 2014. As a percent of revenue, excluding the items mentioned above, general and administrative expenses decreased to 6.2% in fiscal year 2015 from 7.6% in fiscal year 2014 due to reduction of professional fees and personnel costs, partially offset by an increase of $1.7 million in severance costs.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nDepreciation and amortization expense increased by $1.9 million, or 8.1%, to $25.8 million in 2015 versus $23.9 million in 2014. This increase is primarily due to a higher depreciable base from newly opened restaurants and accelerated depreciation on closed restaurants. As a percentage of revenue, depreciation and amortization increased to 5.2% in fiscal year 2015 from 4.7% in fiscal year 2014 due to deleveraging from negative same-restaurant sales.\nPre-Opening Costs\nPre-opening costs decreased by $1.9 million, or 66.9%, to $0.9 million in 2015 from $2.8 million in 2014. This decrease is mainly due to the timing of scheduled restaurant openings. We opened two converted restaurants in 2015 and opened four new restaurants, including one conversion, in 2014. We also incurred pre-opening costs in both years for restaurants opened in the subsequent fiscal year.\nAsset Impairments and Closures\nAsset impairments and closures increased to $10.5 million for fiscal year 2015 from $2.0 million for fiscal year 2014. The $8.5 million increase is mainly due to the impairment charges on long-lived assets of $9.4 million and $1.8 million in 2015 and 2014, respectively. We also closed nine restaurants in the current year versus none in the prior year. The closure-related expenses for fiscal year 2015 were primarily comprised of future minimum lease obligations. If we are unable to improve the performance of our restaurants or if we experience deteriorating results at some of our restaurants, we could recognize additional impairment charges.\nLoss (Gain) on Disposal of Assets\nLoss on disposal of assets decreased by $1.5 million, or 109.0%, to a $0.1 million gain in fiscal year 2015 from a $1.3 million loss in fiscal year 2014. The gain in fiscal year 2015 included a $2.0 million net gain on restaurants sold, offset by the impact of writing off $0.6 million in book value of replaced restaurant equipment and facilities improvements, and $1.3 million in asset retirement losses for closed, converted and remodeled restaurants. The loss in fiscal year 2014 was primarily from the impact of writing off the book value of replaced restaurant equipment and facilities improvements offset by any related sales proceeds.\nIncome (Loss) from Operations\nAs a result of the foregoing, consolidated loss from operations increased by $3.6 million, or 76.6%, to $8.4 million in fiscal year 2015 from $4.7 million in fiscal year 2014.\nJoe's income from operations decreased by $11.9 million, or 55.5%, to $9.5 million in fiscal year 2015 from $21.5 million in fiscal year 2014. As a percent of revenue, excluding the impact of non-cash impairment charges, accelerated depreciation, pre-opening costs, severance and other costs related to conversions, remodels and closures, income from operations for Joe's decreased to 5.2% in the current year from 5.9% in the prior year. This decrease is primarily attributable to lower comparable restaurant sales and deleveraging of fixed costs against lower sales volume, partially offset by improvement in seafood pricing.\nIncome from operations for Brick House increased by $1.7 million, or 44.7%, to $5.5 million in fiscal year 2015 from $3.8 million in fiscal year 2014. As a percent of revenue, Brick House's income from operations increased to 7.1% in the current year from 5.4% in the prior year. This margin improvement is primarily due to the increase in comparable restaurant sales, reduced discounting, and lower general and administrative expenses.\nInterest Expense, Net\nInterest expense, net increased by $3.8 million, or 30.7%, to $16.4 million in 2015 from $12.5 million in 2014, primarily due to the higher average debt balances and interest rates in the current year, partially offset by higher write-offs of debt issuance costs in the prior year. The fiscal 2015 balance includes $1.0 million write-off of debt issuance costs and debt discount compared to $2.2 million write-off of debt issuance costs in 2014.\nIncome Tax Expense (Benefit)\nThe income tax expense decreased by $16.5 million, or 101.9%, to a $0.3 million benefit in fiscal year 2015 from a $16.2 million expense in fiscal year 2014 mainly due to an increase of $12.8 million in valuation allowance in 2015 compared to an increase of $25.6 million in 2014. The decrease is also attributable to a higher loss before income taxes in the current year. Excluding the impact of the valuation allowance, the effective income tax rate decreased to 52.1% in fiscal year 2015 from 54.9% in fiscal year 2014 primarily due to the impact of the tax credit carryforwards.\nDiscontinued Operations, net\nLoss from discontinued operations was $21.5 million for fiscal 2015 compared to $20.2 million for fiscal year 2014. In April 2015, we completed the sale of Macaroni Grill. We recorded a $22.4 million impairment charge during the first quarter of 2015 to write down the net assets of Macaroni Grill to their estimated fair value less cost to sell. During the first quarter of 2015, we also recorded a net gain of $2.1 million on the sale of certain assets of Macaroni Grill and a $1.0 million gain on insurance settlements. During the second quarter of 2015, we recorded a $6.1 million loss on disposal of the Macaroni Grill, which was partially offset by the related tax benefit. The loss from discontinued operations in 2014 relates to the full year operating loss of Macaroni Grill, net of related tax expense, which included impairment charges of $6.3 million for Macaroni Grill's goodwill and $0.7 million related to Macaroni Grill's long-lived and intangible assets.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nGeneral\nOur primary sources of liquidity and capital resources are cash provided from operating activities, cash and cash equivalents, and our senior secured credit facility. Our primary requirements for liquidity and capital are restaurant development, working capital and general corporate needs. Additionally since December 2015, we have repaid $46.5 million of our 2014 Term Loan in an effort to reduce our leverage. Our operations have not required significant working capital and, like many restaurant companies, we have been able to operate, and will continue to operate, with negative working capital. Our requirement for working capital is not significant since our restaurant guests pay for their food and beverage purchases in cash or payment cards (credit or debit) at the time of sale. Thus, we are able to sell and collect payment for many of our inventory items before we have to pay our suppliers for such items. Our restaurants do not require significant inventories or receivables.\nGoing Concern\nWe have continued to experience declines in comparable restaurant sales and income from operations at Joe's and Brick House. We have closed underperforming restaurants and implemented cost reduction measures to help mitigate the effect of these declines and improve our financial position and liquidity. In late 2016, we engaged a financial advisor to assist us in evaluating various strategic alternatives potentially available to us. As part of this ongoing evaluation of strategic alternatives, on April 3, 2017, we announced that our Board of Directors, working together with our management team and our financial advisor, has commenced a process to pursue the sale of our business, which could be sold as an entirety or through the separate sales of Joe's or Brick House.\nAs of January 2, 2017, we were in compliance with all of our debt covenants. However, we are forecasting in 2017 that we may no longer be in compliance with the financial covenant ratios in our 2014 Credit Agreement. In an event of default, our lenders may accelerate the maturity of all of our indebtedness. If our lenders accelerate the maturity of our indebtedness, we will not have sufficient liquidity to repay the entire balance of our outstanding borrowings. The uncertainty associated with our ability to repay our outstanding debt obligations as they become due raises substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern for one year after the issuance date of the financial statements. The report of our independent registered public accounting firm that accompanies our audited consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended January 2, 2017 also contains an explanatory paragraph regarding our ability to continue as a going concern.\nOn March 31, 2017, we entered into a forbearance agreement with certain of the lenders and the Administrative Agent (collectively, the Forbearing Lenders\u201d) under the 2014 Credit Facility, whereby the Forbearing Lenders agreed to, among other things, forbear from taking any action to enforce certain of their rights or remedies under the 2014 Credit Agreement with respect to certain defaults, events of default, and anticipated events of default (the Forbearance Agreement\u201d). The Forbearance Agreement is effective until the earliest of (i) May 9, 2017, and (ii) the occurrence or existence of any default or event of default other than defaults, events of default and anticipated events of default that are subject to the Forbearance Agreement. Should we be in default of the Forbearance Agreement or should the required lenders and the Administrative Agent not agree to further extend such Forbearance Agreement, the Administrative Agent and lenders would be free to exercise any rights and remedies with respect to such defaults and events of defaults pursuant to the terms of the 2014 Credit Facility. which could include accelerating the maturity of all our indebtedness.\nWe are currently in discussions with our lenders in connection with our pursuit of various strategic alternatives to improve our capital structure. While we pursue these strategic alternatives, we are operating under a cash management strategy to enhance and preserve liquidity. This ongoing cash management strategy limits many of our operational and strategic initiatives designed to grow our business over the long term. We have successfully completed certain elements of our cash management strategy, including, among other things:\n \u25cf Closed 28 underperforming restaurants in the last two years \n \u25cf Reduced inventory levels in the restaurants \n \u25cf Sold non-core assets \n \u25cf Reduced annual marketing spend by $5.6 million with a focus on more cost-effective marketing strategies \n \u25cf Reduced and maintained restaurant-level labor and operating expenses \n \u25cf Reduced selling, general, and administrative expenses by over $9.0 million in 2016 through lower personnel costs and professional fees \n \u25cf Eliminated new restaurant development and reduced capital expenditures to maintenance levels \nBased on our current internal forecasts, our cash flows will be sufficient to fund anticipated cash requirements over the next 12 months for minimum capital expenditures, working capital purposes, and scheduled payments of principal and interest required pursuant to the terms of the 2014 Credit Facility. Increased competition and uncertainty in the casual dining industry continue to make it more difficult to accurately forecast our results of operations and cash position, so our revenues may deteriorate beyond what we anticipate. Our current plan for the remainder of 2017 contemplates a comparable restaurant sales decline in the high-single digits. A greater sales decline than reflected in our plan would negatively impact our results of operations and cash flows. If we cannot meet our capital needs using cash on hand and cash from operations as our current forecasts suggest, are not in compliance with the covenants in our debt agreement, and are unable to improve our capital structure, we may have to take other actions such as modify our business plan to close additional restaurants, pursue additional external liquidity generating events, seek additional financing to the extent available, further reduce or delay capital expenditures or file for protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. We can give no assurance that we will successfully execute the strategic transactions we are currently pursuing or any others, and our ability to do so could be adversely affected by numerous factors, including changes in the economic or business environment, financial market volatility, the performance of our business, and the terms and conditions of our debt agreement. It is possible that even a successful and efficient implementation of the recapitalization initiatives we are pursuing will require us to make a filing for protection under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.\nWe rely upon vendor financing in managing our liquidity. As a result, if our trade creditors were to impose unfavorable terms on us, it would negatively impact our ability to obtain products and services on acceptable terms and operate our business. In such event, our ability to maintain optimal inventory and service levels would be adversely affected, and our results of operations and financial performance would suffer.\nCash Flow\nThe following table shows summary cash flows information for fiscal years 2016, 2015 and 2014 (in thousands):\n\nOperating Activities\nNet cash provided by operating activities - continuing operations decreased to $6.2 million for fiscal year 2016 from $25.4 million for fiscal year 2015. The decrease was primarily due to lower sales and changes in working capital including the timing of rent payments and collection of accounts receivable, partially offset by lower general and administrative expenses.\nNet cash provided by operating activities - continuing operations increased to $25.4 million for fiscal year 2015 from $18.4 million for fiscal year 2014. This increase was primarily due to lower general and administrative expenses and changes in working capital including the timing of rent payments and collection of accounts receivable, offset by higher interest payments.\nNet cash provided by operating activities - discontinued operations was $2.7 million in fiscal year 2015 versus net cash used of $1.4 million in fiscal year 2014 due to decrease in marketing expenses and costs related to restaurant closures.\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities - continuing operations was $6.9 million, $13.9 million and $25.9 million in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The net cash used was primarily attributable to capital expenditures for fiscal years 2016, 2015 and 2014 of $9.4 million, $16.6 million and $25.9 million, respectively. Variances in capital expenditures are primarily due to the number and timing of new or converted locations under construction. We also received $1.8 million and $2.0 million of proceeds from disposal of assets, respectively, in 2016 and 2015 primarily related to the closure of Joe's restaurants.\nNet cash provided by investing activities - discontinued operations was $0.2 million, $11.6 million and $0.6 million in 2016, 2015 and 2014, were primarily caused by the sale of Macaroni Grill in 2015.\nWe estimate that total capital expenditures for fiscal year 2017 will be approximately $5.0 million to $10.0 million.\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash used in financing activities was $6.9 million for fiscal year 2016, $36.2 million for fiscal year 2015, while net cash provided by financing activities was $25.6 million for fiscal year 2014. The 2016 balance reflects scheduled quarterly payments on the term loan plus $11.5 million in voluntary prepayments, partially offset by a net $6.0 million borrowing on the revolver. The 2015 balance reflects scheduled quarterly payments on the term loan plus a $35.0 million voluntary prepayment in December 2015. The 2014 balance reflects net borrowings of $25.8 million on our credit facility in fiscal year 2014, representing $41.8 million in net proceeds from our August 2014 refinancing, before accrued interest and fees and net of $4.8 million debt issuance cost payment, and $16.4 million in net repayments from our previous senior secured credit facility.\nSenior Secured Credit Facility\nOn August 13, 2014, we entered into a new senior secured credit facility ( 2014 Credit Agreement\u201d), which consists of a $30.0 million revolving credit facility ( 2014 Revolving Credit Facility\u201d) and a $165.0 million term loan ( 2014 Term Loan\u201d), which both mature on February 13, 2019. The 2014 Term Loan was issued at 98.5% of par. The principal amount of the 2014 Term Loan was payable in consecutive quarterly installments of $412,500, commencing on December 31, 2014, with the balance payable in full at maturity. Since December 2015, we have made $46.5 million in voluntary prepayments on our 2014 Term Loan, which reduced our quarterly installment payments to $294,886.\nInterest rates for borrowings under the 2014 Credit Agreement for the revolver and the term loan are equal to, at our option, either LIBOR (subject to a 1% floor) or the base rate as defined in the agreement, plus a margin of 7.0% for LIBOR loans and 6.0% for base rate loans. The interest rate for the 2014 Term Loan and the 2014 Revolving Credit Facility was 8.0% as of January 2, 2017. In addition, we are required to pay commitment fees on the unused portion of the 2014 Revolving Credit Facility. The commitment fee rate is currently at 0.5%. The commitment fee is subject to adjustment on a quarterly basis based on our leverage ratio as defined by the credit agreement.\nThe 2014 Credit Agreement is guaranteed by each of our subsidiaries and secured by substantially all of our present and future assets and a lien on the capital stock or other equity interests of our direct and indirect subsidiaries. The 2014 Credit Agreement contains covenants which, among other things, limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness, create liens on our assets, make certain investments or loans, merge or otherwise dispose of assets other than in the ordinary course of business, make acquisitions, and pay dividends or make other restricted payments. The 2014 Credit Agreement also contains customary covenants regarding, among other matters, the maintenance of insurance, the preservation and maintenance of our corporate existence, material compliance with laws, and the payment of taxes and other material obligations.\nThe 2014 Credit Agreement provides that (a) the leverage ratio shall not exceed (i) 5.75x through December 29, 2014, (ii) 5.5x from December 30, 2014 through June 29, 2015, (iii) 5.25x from June 30, 2015 through December 28, 2015, (iv) 5.0x from December 29, 2015 through March 28, 2016, (v) 4.75x from March 29, 2016 through June 27, 2016, (vi) 4.25x from June 28, 2016 through September 26, 2016, (vii) 4.0x from September 27, 2016 through April 3, 2017, (viii) 3.75x from April 4, 2017 through October 2, 2017, (ix) 3.5x from October 3, 2017 through April 2, 2018, (x) 3.25x from April 3, 2018 through December 31, 2018, and (xi) 3.0x from January 1, 2019 through maturity date; and requires (b) an interest coverage ratio of at least (i) 2.0x through June 29, 2015, (ii) 2.25x from June 30, 2015 through March 28, 2016, (iii) 2.5x from March 29, 2016 through June 27, 2016, (iv) 2.75x from June 28, 2016 through January 2, 2017, (v) 3.0x from January 3, 2017 through July 3, 2017, (vi) 3.25x from July 4, 2017 through April 2, 2018, (vii) 3.5x from April 3, 2018 through December 31, 2018, and (viii) 3.75x from January 1, 2019 through maturity date. The 2014 Credit Agreement limits capital expenditures to an amount in respect of any period not to exceed (i) $29.5 million from the closing date through December 29, 2014, (ii) $45.5 million for fiscal 2015, (iii) $45.8 million for fiscal 2016, (iv) $52.5 million for fiscal 2017, (v) $53.7 million for fiscal 2018, and (vi) $58.6 million from January 1, 2019 through maturity date, provided that the amount of permitted capital expenditures in any period can be increased by the unused permitted capital expenditures from the immediately preceding period, subject to certain limitations as defined by the agreement. We were in compliance with these covenants as of January 2, 2017.\nIn December 2015, we made a $35.0 million voluntary prepayment of our 2014 Term Loan and wrote off $0.6 million of debt issuance costs and $0.4 million of debt discount, which are included in interest expense. In 2016, we made $11.5 million in voluntary prepayments of our 2014 Term Loan and wrote off $161 thousand of debt issuance costs and $105 thousand of debt discount, which are included in interest expense.\nAs of January 2, 2017, we had letters of credit of approximately $10.1 million outstanding under the 2014 Revolving Credit Facility and had available borrowing capacity of approximately $13.9 million.\nNASDAQ Delisting\nOn March 10, 2017, we received a notice (the Notice\u201d) from the Office of General Counsel of NASDAQ indicating that the NASDAQ Hearings Panel (the Panel\u201d) has determined that our securities would be delisted from The NASDAQ Global Select Market. Accordingly, trading of our common stock was suspended at the opening of business on March 14, 2017, and a Form 25-Notification of Delisting will be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which will remove our securities from listing and registration on NASDAQ.\nThe Notice indicated that the Panel's determination was based on concerns about our ability to sustain compliance with all requirements for continued listing on The NASDAQ Stock Market. Specifically, on July 28, 2016, NASDAQ Listing Qualifications Staff (the Staff\u201d) notified us that we were no longer in compliance with NASDAQ Marketplace Rule 5450(b)(3)(C) since the market value of our publicly held shares closed below the required minimum of $15,000,000 for the previous 30 consecutive business days. In accordance with NASDAQ Marketplace Rule 5810(c) (3)(D), the Staff granted us a 180-day period, or until January 24, 2017, to regain compliance. We were unable to regain compliance with Rule 5450(b)(2)(C) by January 24, 2017. Accordingly, on January 25, 2017, we received a letter from Staff notifying us that our common stock would be delisted from The NASDAQ Global Select Market on February 3, 2017 unless we timely requested a hearing before the Panel. We appealed the Staff's determination by requesting a hearing before the Panel to seek continued listing. On March 10, 2017, the Panel determined that our shares would be delisted from The NASDAQ Stock Market effective at the open of business on March 14, 2017. Since March 15, 2017, our common stock has traded in the OTC market under the symbol IRGT.\nThe OTC market is a significantly more limited market than the NASDAQ Global Select Market and the quotation of our common stock on the OTC market has resulted in a less liquid market available for existing and potential stockholders to trade shares of our common stock. This could further depress the trading price of our common stock and could also have a long-term adverse effect on our ability to raise capital. We cannot provide any assurances as to if or when we will be in a position to relist our common stock on a nationally-recognized securities exchange. See Item 1A. Risk Factors-Our common stock is no longer listed on a national securities exchange and is quoted only on the over-the-counter ( OTC\u201d) market, which could negatively affect our stock price and liquidity.\u201d\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nExcept for restaurant operating leases, we have no material off-balance sheet arrangements.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table sets forth our contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of January 2, 2017 (in thousands):\n\n__________________________\n (a) We estimate future interest payments on our long-term debt using interest rates and applicable margin in effect at January 2, 2017. (b) We have $0.4 million of uncertain tax positions, including interest and penalties, recorded in other long-term liabilities or as a reduction to net operating loss carryforwards. It is not reasonably possible to predict at this time when (or if) any of these assessments will be settled. \nImpact of Inflation\nOur profitability is dependent, among other things, on our ability to anticipate and react to changes in the costs of key operating resources, including food and beverages, labor, energy and other services. Substantial increases in costs and expenses, including the cost of crab and other shellfish, could impact our operating results to the extent such increases cannot be passed along to our guests. We have been able to substantially offset restaurant and operating cost increases resulting from inflation by altering our menu items, increasing menu prices, making productivity improvements or other adjustments. However, certain areas of costs, notably labor and utilities, can be significantly volatile or subject to significant changes due to changes in laws or regulations, such as the minimum wage laws. There can be no assurance that we will generate increases in comparable restaurant sales in amounts sufficient to offset inflationary or other cost pressures.\nNon-GAAP Financial", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nYou should read the following discussion together with Selected Financial Data,\u201d and the historical financial statements and related notes included in this annual report on Form 10-K. The statements in this discussion regarding industry outlook, our expectations regarding our future performance, liquidity and capital resources and other non-historical statements in this discussion are forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, the risks and uncertainties described in Risk Factors\u201d and Forward-Looking Statements\u201d included in this report. Our actual results may differ materially from those contained in or implied by any forward-looking statements.\nOur fiscal year ends on the Monday nearest to December 31 of each year. Fiscal year 2016 was a 53-week year and ended on January 2, 2017. Fiscal years 2015 and 2014 were 52-week years. References to fiscal years 2015 and 2014 are references to fiscal years ended December 28, 2015 and December 29, 2014, respectively.\nOverview\nIgnite Restaurant Group, Inc. operates two restaurant brands in the casual dining segment, Joe's Crab Shack ( Joe's\u201d) and Brick House Tavern + Tap ( Brick House\u201d). Each of our restaurant brands offers a variety of high-quality food in a distinctive, casual, high-energy atmosphere. Joe's and Brick House operate in a diverse set of markets across the United States and internationally. As of January 2, 2017, we operated 112 Joe's and 25 Brick House restaurants in 32 states and franchised three Joe's restaurants in Dubai, U.A.E.\nJoe's is an established, national chain of casual dining seafood restaurants. Joe's serves a variety of high-quality seafood items, with an emphasis on crab. Joe's is a high-energy, family-friendly restaurant that encourages guests to roll up your sleeves and crack into some crab.\u201d Brick House is a casual restaurant brand that provides guests an elevated experience appropriate for every day usage.\nIn fiscal year 2016, we opened three new Brick House restaurants, all of which were conversions from Joe's restaurants. We also closed 18 Joe's restaurants and one Brick House restaurant during 2016.\nOutlook\nWe have experienced a decline in the operating performance at Joe's. During fiscal year 2016, the comparable restaurant sales of Joe's declined by 7.3% which contributed to a decrease in income from operations from the prior year. The largest impact on the decline in comparable restaurant sales is from our Northeast and Texas markets. We are also experiencing sales declines in other geographic regions primarily due to decreased guest traffic. In order to reverse these negative trends, we have deployed many different operational strategies, but so far none have had a meaningful impact on sales or guest traffic. The biggest declines in sales and guest traffic continue to be on weekends. We have started introducing new menu items at both brands to enhance the current offerings as well as to improve the value proposition for our guests. We will continue to evaluate our menu offerings and look for other value offerings that could increase sales and traffic.\nWe have also experienced a decline in operating performance at Brick House. During fiscal year 2016, the comparable restaurant sales of Brick House decreased by 7.7%, which contributed to a $0.6 million decrease in income from operations from the prior year, excluding the $2.7 million non-cash impairment charge in 2016. We are continuing to evaluate our menu to ensure we are offering items that are consistent with the expectations of our guests.\nWe are continuing to evaluate our underperforming restaurants. During 2016, we closed 18 Joe's and one Brick House restaurant. Additional declines in the operating performance at Joe's or Brick House could cause us to close or sell more restaurants which may require us to recognize additional asset impairment or closure-related expenses and increase our valuation allowance during 2017 against some or all of our deferred tax assets.\nThe Board of Directors, working together with our management team and our financial advisor, has commenced a process to pursue the sale of our business, which could be sold as an entirety or through the separate sales of our two restaurant brands, Joe's and Brick House. There can be no assurance that the process that we are undertaking will be successful. In addition, we cannot predict the terms or timing of any transaction that we may undertake or whether any such transaction will result in any proceeds for the holders of our common stock. We are also exploring a variety of strategic alternatives to strengthen our capital structure. For the remainder of 2017, we are committed to preserving liquidity and improving our capital structure. Our capital expenditures will remain at maintenance levels and we will continue to manage working capital and restaurant-level operating expenses. However, there can be no assurance regarding these matters. Further deterioration would negatively impact our anticipated revenues, profitability and cash flows from operations. Our expectations with respect to our performance over the remainder of 2017 are subject to a number of assumptions, many of which are outside of our control.\nWe are currently in discussions with our lenders in connection with our pursuit of various strategic alternatives. We can give no assurance that we will successfully execute any strategic alternatives we are currently pursuing or any others, and our ability to do so could be adversely affected by numerous factors, including changes in the economic or business environment, financial market volatility, the performance of our business, and the terms and conditions of the 2014 Credit Facility. See Liquidity and Capital Resources\u201d below for further discussion of our operational plan to preserve liquidity.\nRecent Developments\nAsset Impairment and Closures\nWe evaluate the recoverability of the carrying amount of long-lived assets, which include property and equipment and intangible assets, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be fully recoverable. Due to continued declines in operating performance at certain Joe's and Brick House restaurants in 2016 we recorded impairment charges of $26.2 million related to Joe's and Brick House's long-lived assets. In 2015 and 2014 we recorded impairment charges of $9.4 and $1.8 million, respectively, related to Joe's long-lived assets. Additionally, in 2016, 2015 and 2014 we recorded restaurant closure expenses of $5.1 million, $1.1 million and $210 thousand, respectively.\nValuation Allowance\nWe evaluate our deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis to determine whether a valuation allowance is required. We assess whether a valuation allowance should be established based on our determination of whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible and prior to the expiration of our credit carryforwards which begin to expire in 2031. We consider the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, and tax planning strategies in making this assessment. Due to continued operating losses and asset impairments we are in a three-year cumulative loss position. According to ASC Topic No. 740, Income Taxes, cumulative losses in recent years represent significant negative evidence in considering whether deferred tax assets are realizable. During fiscal year 2016, 2015 and 2014 we recorded a valuation allowance of $17.8 million, $12.8 million and $25.6 million, respectively in continuing operations.\nWe excluded the deferred tax liabilities related to certain indefinite lived intangibles when calculating the amount of valuation allowance needed as these liabilities cannot be considered as a source of income when determining the realizability of the net deferred tax assets. The valuation allowance was recorded as a reduction to our income tax benefit in our consolidated statement of operations. If we are able to generate sufficient taxable income in the future such that it becomes more likely than not that we will be able to fully utilize the net deferred tax assets on which a valuation allowance was recorded, our effective tax rate may decrease if the valuation allowance is reversed.\nKey Performance Indicators\nIn assessing the performance of our business, we consider a variety of performance and financial measures. The key measures for determining how our business is performing are comparable restaurant sales growth, average weekly sales, restaurant operating weeks, average check, average unit volume and number of restaurant openings.\nComparable Restaurant Sales Growth\nComparable restaurant sales growth reflects the change in year-over-year sales for the comparable restaurant base. We define the comparable restaurant base to include those restaurants open for at least 104 weeks, or approximately 24 months. As of January 2, 2017, December 28, 2015 and December 29, 2014 there were 132, 147 and 142, respectively, in our comparable restaurant base. Comparable restaurant sales growth can be generated by an increase in guest counts and/or by increases in the average check amount resulting from a shift in menu mix and/or increase in price. This measure highlights performance of existing restaurants as the impact of new restaurant openings is excluded.\nAverage Weekly Sales\nAverage weekly sales is a key measure of individual restaurant economic performance of new and existing restaurants. Average weekly sales reflects total sales of all restaurants divided by restaurant operating weeks (see below). This measure is subject to seasonality for periods less than one year.\nRestaurant Operating Weeks\nRestaurant operating weeks is the aggregate number of weeks that our restaurants are in operation over a specific period of time.\nAverage Check\nAverage check is calculated for Joe's by dividing net sales by guest counts for a given time period. Management uses this indicator to analyze the dollars spent in our Joe's restaurants per guest. This measure aids management in identifying trends in guest preferences, as well as the effectiveness of menu price increases and other menu changes.\nGuest counts represent the estimated number of guests served in our restaurants. The count is estimated based on the number of entr\u00e9es sold. Our estimates may vary from actual guest counts due to the variability in the level of sharing of certain entr\u00e9e items on our menu. Given the significant level of alcohol sales and appetizer sales at Brick House, guest count is more difficult to quantify and therefore, we do not currently calculate average check as a key performance indicator for that brand.\nAverage Unit Volume\nAverage unit volume represents the average sales for restaurants included in the comparable restaurant base for a given time period, typically annually. Average unit volume reflects total sales for restaurants in our comparable restaurant base divided by the number of restaurants in our comparable restaurant base. This measure is subject to seasonality for periods less than one year.\nNumber of Restaurant Openings\nNumber of restaurant openings reflects the number of restaurants opened or converted during a particular reporting period. Before we open new restaurants or convert existing restaurants, we incur pre-opening costs. Typically, new restaurants open with an initial start-up period of higher than normalized sales volumes, which subsequently decrease to stabilized levels. While sales volumes are generally higher during the initial opening period, new restaurants typically experience normal inefficiencies in the form of higher cost of sales, labor and other direct operating expenses for several months and as a result, restaurant operating margins are generally lower during the start-up period of operation. The number and timing of restaurant openings has had an impact on our results of operations.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table presents the consolidated statement of operations for the past three fiscal years expressed as a percentage of revenues.\nTable 88: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Fiscal Year\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revenues\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td> %\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td> %\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Costs and expenses\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Restaurant operating costs and expenses\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cost of sales\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>32.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>31.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>32.5 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Labor expenses\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>29.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>28.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>28.3 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Occupancy expenses\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7.8 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other operating expenses\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>19.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18.7 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> General and administrative\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7.7 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.7 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Pre-opening costs\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.6 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Asset impairments and closures\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.4 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loss (gain) on disposal of assets\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.0 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.3 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total costs and expenses\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>107.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>101.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.9 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loss from operations\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(7.2 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1.7 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.9 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest expense, net\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2.8 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(3.3 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2.5 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gain (loss) on insurance settlements\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.1 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.0 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loss from continuing operations before income taxes\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(9.8 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(5.1 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(3.4 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income tax expense (benefit)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.1 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.2 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loss from continuing operations\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(9.9 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(5.1 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(6.6 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loss from discontinued operations, net of tax\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(4.4 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(4.0 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net loss\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(9.9 </td> <td> )%\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(9.4 </td> <td> )%\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(10.6 </td> <td> )%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n__________________________\n * The percentages reflected are subject to rounding adjustments.

Fiscal Year 2015 (52 Weeks)\nRevenues\nRevenues were $450.3 million for fiscal year 2016, a decrease of $41.8 million, or 8.5%, compared to revenues of $492.0 million for fiscal year 2015. The decrease is primarily due to a decrease of 7.3% in comparable restaurant sales and the closure of 19 restaurants.\nRevenues at Joe's decreased 11.5% to $366.6 million in fiscal year 2016 compared to $414.3 million in fiscal year 2015. The decrease is primarily caused by a 7.3% decrease in comparable restaurant sales and the closure of 18 restaurants. The comparable restaurant sales decrease is comprised of 8.4% decrease in guest count partially offset by a 1.1% increase in pricing. Joe's average weekly sales decreased to $55 thousand from $59 thousand in the prior year. Restaurant operating weeks decreased to 6,605 in 2016 from 7,058 in 2015 due to restaurant closures. We believe the decline in comparable restaurant sales is primarily due to a decrease in guest traffic and continued sales declines at restaurants in our Northeast and Texas markets.\nBrick House revenues increased 7.7% to $83.7 million in fiscal year 2016 versus $77.7 million in fiscal year 2015 due to three new restaurant openings in the first quarter of 2016, partially offset by the closing of one restaurant and a 7.7% decrease in comparable restaurant sales. The comparable restaurant sales decrease was comprised of an 8.1% decrease from traffic and mix and a 0.4% increase in pricing. Brick House's average weekly sales decreased to $62 thousand from $66 thousand in prior year. Restaurant operating weeks increased to 1,341 in 2016 from 1,176 in 2015 due to new restaurant openings.\nCosts of Sales\nCost of sales decreased by $7.2 million, or 4.7%, to $147.0 million in 2016 versus $154.3 million in 2015 mainly due to the decrease in sales volume and restaurant closures, partially offset by increased commodity pricing during 2016. As a percent of revenue, cost of sales increased to 32.7% from 31.4% primarily due to commodity price inflation.\nLabor Expenses\nLabor expenses decreased by $8.2 million, or 5.7%, to $134.0 million in 2016 versus $142.2 million in 2015. The decrease is mainly due to the closure of 19 restaurants in 2016 partially offset by the opening of three new Brick House restaurants. As a percent of revenue, labor expenses increased to 29.8% in fiscal year 2016 from 28.9% in fiscal year 2015 due to increases in minimum wage and deleverage from lower sales.\nOccupancy Expenses\nOccupancy expenses decreased by $2.6 million, or 6.3%, to $38.3 million in 2016 compared to $40.9 million in 2015. The decrease is primarily caused by the closure of 19 restaurants. As a percentage of revenue, occupancy expenses increased to 8.5% from 8.3% primarily due to deleveraging of fixed rent expense from the decrease in comparable restaurant sales.\nOther Operating Expenses\nOther operating expenses decreased by $11.8 million, or 12.4%, to $83.6 million in 2016 versus $95.4 million in 2015. The decrease is primarily caused by the closure of 19 restaurants and the decrease in advertising costs partially offset by higher insurance costs and operating supplies. As a percent of revenue, other operating expenses decreased to 18.6% in 2016 from 19.4% in 2015 primarily due to decreased advertising costs.\nGeneral and Administrative\nGeneral and administrative expenses decreased by $7.0 million, or 23.1%, to $23.5 million in 2016 compared to $30.5 million in 2015. As a percent of revenue, general and administrative expenses decreased to 5.2% in fiscal year 2016 from 6.2% in fiscal year 2015 due to decreased personnel costs, including a reduction of $1.6 million in severance costs, and professional fees.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nDepreciation and amortization expense decreased by $2.6 million, or 10.1%, to $23.2 million in 2016 versus $25.8 million in 2015. This decrease is primarily due to the closure of 19 restaurants during 2016. As a percentage of revenue, depreciation and amortization remained constant at 5.2% in fiscal year 2016 and 2015.\nPre-Opening Costs\nPre-opening costs decreased by $51 thousand, or 5.5%, to $0.9 million in 2016 from $0.9 million in 2015. This decrease is mainly due to the timing of scheduled restaurant openings. We converted three restaurants in 2016 and converted two restaurants in 2015.\nAsset Impairments and Closures\nAsset impairments and closures increased to $31.4 million for fiscal year 2016 from $10.5 million for fiscal year 2015. The $20.9 million increase is mainly due to the impairment charges on long-lived assets of $26.2 million and $9.4 million in 2016 and 2015, respectively. We also closed 19 restaurants in the current year versus nine in the prior year and recorded $5.1 million and $1.1 million, respectively, in closure-related expenses, primarily comprised of future minimum lease obligations. If we are unable to improve the performance of our restaurants or if we experience deteriorating results at some of our restaurants, we could recognize additional impairment charges or closure related expenses.\nLoss (Gain) on Disposal of Assets\nLoss on disposal of assets increased by $0.7 million, to a $0.6 million loss in fiscal year 2016. The loss in fiscal year 2016 was primarily due to asset retirement losses for closed and converted restaurants, partially offset by gains on the sale of the leasehold interest for two locations. The gain in fiscal year 2015 included a $2.0 million net gain on restaurants sold, offset by the impact of writing off $0.6 million in book value of replaced restaurant equipment and facilities improvements, and $1.3 million in asset retirement losses for closed, converted and remodeled restaurants.\nIncome (Loss) from Operations\nAs a result of the foregoing, consolidated loss from operations increased by $23.9 million, to a $32.3 million loss in fiscal year 2016 from an $8.4 million loss in fiscal year 2015.\nJoe's income from operations decreased by $26.1 million, to a $16.6 million loss in fiscal year 2016 from $9.5 million in income in fiscal year 2015. As a percent of revenue, excluding the impact of non-cash impairment charges, accelerated depreciation, pre-opening costs, severance and other costs related to conversions, remodels and closures, income from operations for Joe's decreased to 3.2% in the current year from 5.2% in the prior year. This decrease is primarily attributable to lower comparable restaurant sales and deleveraging of fixed costs against lower sales volume and increases in commodity pricing.\nIncome from operations for Brick House decreased by $3.4 million, to $2.2 million in fiscal year 2016 from $5.5 million in fiscal year 2015. As a percent of revenue, excluding the impact of non-cash impairment charges, pre-opening costs, severance and other costs related to conversions, remodels and closures, Brick House's income from operations decreased to 7.6% in the current year from 8.3% in the prior year. The decrease is primarily due to lower comparable restaurant sales and increases in cost of sales.\nInterest Expense, Net\nInterest expense, net decreased by $3.8 million, or 23.0%, to $12.6 million in 2016 from $16.4 million in 2015. The decrease is due to lower average debt balance in 2016 due to voluntary prepayments of $46.5 million since the end of fiscal year 2015. The fiscal 2016 balance includes a $0.3 million write-off of debt issuance costs and debt discount compared to a $1.0 million write-off of debt issuance costs in 2015.\nIncome Tax Expense (Benefit)\nThe income tax expense increased by $0.5 million, to a $0.2 million expense in fiscal year 2016 from a $0.3 million benefit in fiscal year 2015 mainly due to an increase of $17.8 million in valuation allowance in 2016 compared to an increase of $12.8 million in 2015. Excluding the impact of the valuation allowance, the effective income tax rate decreased to 39.8% in fiscal year 2016 from 52.1% in fiscal year 2015 primarily due to the impact of the tax credit carryforwards.\nFiscal Year 2015 (52 Weeks) Compared to Fiscal Year 2014 (52 Weeks)\nRevenues\nRevenues were $492.0 million for fiscal year 2015, a decrease of $11.5 million, or 2.3%, compared to revenues of $503.5 million for fiscal year 2014. The decrease is primarily due to a decrease of 3.9% in comparable restaurant sales, partially offset by higher operating weeks caused by the timing of restaurant opening and closure activities.\nRevenues at Joe's decreased 4.3% to $414.3 million in fiscal year 2015 compared to $433.0 million in fiscal year 2014. The decrease is primarily caused by a 4.5% decrease in comparable restaurant sales. The comparable restaurant sales decrease is comprised of 5.1% decrease in guest count and a 1.0% decrease in mix, partially offset by a 1.6% increase in pricing. Joe's average weekly sales decreased to $59 thousand from $61 thousand in the prior year. Restaurant operating weeks decreased to 7,058 in 2015 from 7,107 in 2014 due to restaurant closures. We believe the decline in comparable restaurant sales is primarily due to a decrease in guest traffic and continued sales declines at restaurants in the Northeast region.\nBrick House revenues increased 10.2% to $77.7 million in fiscal year 2015 versus $70.5 million in fiscal year 2014. The increase was the result of a 1.0% increase in comparable restaurant sales and new restaurant openings. The comparable restaurant sales increase is comprised of a 2.8% increase in pricing, partially offset by a 1.8% decrease in combined guest count and mix benefits. Brick House's average weekly sales were at $66 thousand for both fiscal years 2015 and 2014. Restaurant operating weeks increased to 1,176 in 2015 from 1,062 in 2014 due to new restaurant openings.\nCosts of Sales\nCost of sales decreased by $9.1 million, or 5.6%, to $154.3 million in 2015 versus $163.4 million in 2014 mainly due to the decrease in sales volume. As a percent of revenue, cost of sales decreased to 31.4% from 32.5% primarily due to improvement in seafood pricing at Joe's and reduced discounting at Brick House.\nLabor Expenses\nLabor expenses decreased by $0.5 million, or 0.3%, to $142.2 million in 2015 versus $142.7 million in 2014. The decrease is mainly due to lower restaurant management bonuses caused by lower sales, partially offset by decreased productivity in hourly labor at Joe's. As a percent of revenue, labor expenses increased to 28.9% in fiscal year 2015 from 28.3% in fiscal year 2014 due to decreased productivity, increases in minimum wage, and deleverage from lower sales.\nOccupancy Expenses\nOccupancy expenses increased by $1.5 million, or 3.8%, to $40.9 million in 2015 compared to $39.4 million in 2014. The increase is primarily caused by the increase in operating weeks. As a percentage of revenue, occupancy expenses increased to 8.3% from 7.8% primarily due to deleveraging of fixed rent expense from the decrease in comparable restaurant sales.\nOther Operating Expenses\nOther operating expenses increased by $1.3 million, or 1.4%, to $95.4 million in 2015 versus $94.1 million in 2014. This is mainly due to increased insurance costs and building expenses, partially offset by lower credit card fees attributable to lower sales in the current year. As a percent of revenue, other operating expenses increased to 19.4% in 2015 from 18.7% in 2014 due to increased insurance costs and deleverage from lower sales.\nGeneral and Administrative\nGeneral and administrative expenses decreased by $8.1 million, or 21.1%, to $30.5 million in 2015 compared to $38.7 million in 2014. As a percent of revenue, excluding the items mentioned above, general and administrative expenses decreased to 6.2% in fiscal year 2015 from 7.6% in fiscal year 2014 due to reduction of professional fees and personnel costs, partially offset by an increase of $1.7 million in severance costs.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nDepreciation and amortization expense increased by $1.9 million, or 8.1%, to $25.8 million in 2015 versus $23.9 million in 2014. This increase is primarily due to a higher depreciable base from newly opened restaurants and accelerated depreciation on closed restaurants. As a percentage of revenue, depreciation and amortization increased to 5.2% in fiscal year 2015 from 4.7% in fiscal year 2014 due to deleveraging from negative same-restaurant sales.\nPre-Opening Costs\nPre-opening costs decreased by $1.9 million, or 66.9%, to $0.9 million in 2015 from $2.8 million in 2014. This decrease is mainly due to the timing of scheduled restaurant openings. We opened two converted restaurants in 2015 and opened four new restaurants, including one conversion, in 2014. We also incurred pre-opening costs in both years for restaurants opened in the subsequent fiscal year.\nAsset Impairments and Closures\nAsset impairments and closures increased to $10.5 million for fiscal year 2015 from $2.0 million for fiscal year 2014. The $8.5 million increase is mainly due to the impairment charges on long-lived assets of $9.4 million and $1.8 million in 2015 and 2014, respectively. We also closed nine restaurants in the current year versus none in the prior year. The closure-related expenses for fiscal year 2015 were primarily comprised of future minimum lease obligations. If we are unable to improve the performance of our restaurants or if we experience deteriorating results at some of our restaurants, we could recognize additional impairment charges.\nLoss (Gain) on Disposal of Assets\nLoss on disposal of assets decreased by $1.5 million, or 109.0%, to a $0.1 million gain in fiscal year 2015 from a $1.3 million loss in fiscal year 2014. The gain in fiscal year 2015 included a $2.0 million net gain on restaurants sold, offset by the impact of writing off $0.6 million in book value of replaced restaurant equipment and facilities improvements, and $1.3 million in asset retirement losses for closed, converted and remodeled restaurants. The loss in fiscal year 2014 was primarily from the impact of writing off the book value of replaced restaurant equipment and facilities improvements offset by any related sales proceeds.\nIncome (Loss) from Operations\nAs a result of the foregoing, consolidated loss from operations increased by $3.6 million, or 76.6%, to $8.4 million in fiscal year 2015 from $4.7 million in fiscal year 2014.\nJoe's income from operations decreased by $11.9 million, or 55.5%, to $9.5 million in fiscal year 2015 from $21.5 million in fiscal year 2014. As a percent of revenue, excluding the impact of non-cash impairment charges, accelerated depreciation, pre-opening costs, severance and other costs related to conversions, remodels and closures, income from operations for Joe's decreased to 5.2% in the current year from 5.9% in the prior year. This decrease is primarily attributable to lower comparable restaurant sales and deleveraging of fixed costs against lower sales volume, partially offset by improvement in seafood pricing.\nIncome from operations for Brick House increased by $1.7 million, or 44.7%, to $5.5 million in fiscal year 2015 from $3.8 million in fiscal year 2014. As a percent of revenue, Brick House's income from operations increased to 7.1% in the current year from 5.4% in the prior year. This margin improvement is primarily due to the increase in comparable restaurant sales, reduced discounting, and lower general and administrative expenses.\nInterest Expense, Net\nInterest expense, net increased by $3.8 million, or 30.7%, to $16.4 million in 2015 from $12.5 million in 2014, primarily due to the higher average debt balances and interest rates in the current year, partially offset by higher write-offs of debt issuance costs in the prior year. The fiscal 2015 balance includes $1.0 million write-off of debt issuance costs and debt discount compared to $2.2 million write-off of debt issuance costs in 2014.\nIncome Tax Expense (Benefit)\nThe income tax expense decreased by $16.5 million, or 101.9%, to a $0.3 million benefit in fiscal year 2015 from a $16.2 million expense in fiscal year 2014 mainly due to an increase of $12.8 million in valuation allowance in 2015 compared to an increase of $25.6 million in 2014. The decrease is also attributable to a higher loss before income taxes in the current year. Excluding the impact of the valuation allowance, the effective income tax rate decreased to 52.1% in fiscal year 2015 from 54.9% in fiscal year 2014 primarily due to the impact of the tax credit carryforwards.\nDiscontinued Operations, net\nLoss from discontinued operations was $21.5 million for fiscal 2015 compared to $20.2 million for fiscal year 2014. In April 2015, we completed the sale of Macaroni Grill. We recorded a $22.4 million impairment charge during the first quarter of 2015 to write down the net assets of Macaroni Grill to their estimated fair value less cost to sell. During the first quarter of 2015, we also recorded a net gain of $2.1 million on the sale of certain assets of Macaroni Grill and a $1.0 million gain on insurance settlements. During the second quarter of 2015, we recorded a $6.1 million loss on disposal of the Macaroni Grill, which was partially offset by the related tax benefit. The loss from discontinued operations in 2014 relates to the full year operating loss of Macaroni Grill, net of related tax expense, which included impairment charges of $6.3 million for Macaroni Grill's goodwill and $0.7 million related to Macaroni Grill's long-lived and intangible assets.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nGeneral\nOur primary sources of liquidity and capital resources are cash provided from operating activities, cash and cash equivalents, and our senior secured credit facility. Our primary requirements for liquidity and capital are restaurant development, working capital and general corporate needs. Additionally since December 2015, we have repaid $46.5 million of our 2014 Term Loan in an effort to reduce our leverage. Our operations have not required significant working capital and, like many restaurant companies, we have been able to operate, and will continue to operate, with negative working capital. Our requirement for working capital is not significant since our restaurant guests pay for their food and beverage purchases in cash or payment cards (credit or debit) at the time of sale. Thus, we are able to sell and collect payment for many of our inventory items before we have to pay our suppliers for such items. Our restaurants do not require significant inventories or receivables.\nGoing Concern\nWe have continued to experience declines in comparable restaurant sales and income from operations at Joe's and Brick House. We have closed underperforming restaurants and implemented cost reduction measures to help mitigate the effect of these declines and improve our financial position and liquidity. In late 2016, we engaged a financial advisor to assist us in evaluating various strategic alternatives potentially available to us. As part of this ongoing evaluation of strategic alternatives, on April 3, 2017, we announced that our Board of Directors, working together with our management team and our financial advisor, has commenced a process to pursue the sale of our business, which could be sold as an entirety or through the separate sales of Joe's or Brick House.\nAs of January 2, 2017, we were in compliance with all of our debt covenants. However, we are forecasting in 2017 that we may no longer be in compliance with the financial covenant ratios in our 2014 Credit Agreement. In an event of default, our lenders may accelerate the maturity of all of our indebtedness. If our lenders accelerate the maturity of our indebtedness, we will not have sufficient liquidity to repay the entire balance of our outstanding borrowings. The uncertainty associated with our ability to repay our outstanding debt obligations as they become due raises substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern for one year after the issuance date of the financial statements. The report of our independent registered public accounting firm that accompanies our audited consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended January 2, 2017 also contains an explanatory paragraph regarding our ability to continue as a going concern.\nOn March 31, 2017, we entered into a forbearance agreement with certain of the lenders and the Administrative Agent (collectively, the Forbearing Lenders\u201d) under the 2014 Credit Facility, whereby the Forbearing Lenders agreed to, among other things, forbear from taking any action to enforce certain of their rights or remedies under the 2014 Credit Agreement with respect to certain defaults, events of default, and anticipated events of default (the Forbearance Agreement\u201d). The Forbearance Agreement is effective until the earliest of (i) May 9, 2017, and (ii) the occurrence or existence of any default or event of default other than defaults, events of default and anticipated events of default that are subject to the Forbearance Agreement. Should we be in default of the Forbearance Agreement or should the required lenders and the Administrative Agent not agree to further extend such Forbearance Agreement, the Administrative Agent and lenders would be free to exercise any rights and remedies with respect to such defaults and events of defaults pursuant to the terms of the 2014 Credit Facility. which could include accelerating the maturity of all our indebtedness.\nWe are currently in discussions with our lenders in connection with our pursuit of various strategic alternatives to improve our capital structure. While we pursue these strategic alternatives, we are operating under a cash management strategy to enhance and preserve liquidity. This ongoing cash management strategy limits many of our operational and strategic initiatives designed to grow our business over the long term. We have successfully completed certain elements of our cash management strategy, including, among other things:\n \u25cf Closed 28 underperforming restaurants in the last two years \n \u25cf Reduced inventory levels in the restaurants \n \u25cf Sold non-core assets \n \u25cf Reduced annual marketing spend by $5.6 million with a focus on more cost-effective marketing strategies \n \u25cf Reduced and maintained restaurant-level labor and operating expenses \n \u25cf Reduced selling, general, and administrative expenses by over $9.0 million in 2016 through lower personnel costs and professional fees \n \u25cf Eliminated new restaurant development and reduced capital expenditures to maintenance levels \nBased on our current internal forecasts, our cash flows will be sufficient to fund anticipated cash requirements over the next 12 months for minimum capital expenditures, working capital purposes, and scheduled payments of principal and interest required pursuant to the terms of the 2014 Credit Facility. Increased competition and uncertainty in the casual dining industry continue to make it more difficult to accurately forecast our results of operations and cash position, so our revenues may deteriorate beyond what we anticipate. Our current plan for the remainder of 2017 contemplates a comparable restaurant sales decline in the high-single digits. A greater sales decline than reflected in our plan would negatively impact our results of operations and cash flows. If we cannot meet our capital needs using cash on hand and cash from operations as our current forecasts suggest, are not in compliance with the covenants in our debt agreement, and are unable to improve our capital structure, we may have to take other actions such as modify our business plan to close additional restaurants, pursue additional external liquidity generating events, seek additional financing to the extent available, further reduce or delay capital expenditures or file for protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. We can give no assurance that we will successfully execute the strategic transactions we are currently pursuing or any others, and our ability to do so could be adversely affected by numerous factors, including changes in the economic or business environment, financial market volatility, the performance of our business, and the terms and conditions of our debt agreement. It is possible that even a successful and efficient implementation of the recapitalization initiatives we are pursuing will require us to make a filing for protection under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.\nWe rely upon vendor financing in managing our liquidity. As a result, if our trade creditors were to impose unfavorable terms on us, it would negatively impact our ability to obtain products and services on acceptable terms and operate our business. In such event, our ability to maintain optimal inventory and service levels would be adversely affected, and our results of operations and financial performance would suffer.\nCash Flow\nThe following table shows summary cash flows information for fiscal years 2016, 2015 and 2014 (in thousands):\nTable 100: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Fiscal Year\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash provided by (used in):\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating activities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Continuing operations\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>6,150 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>25,379 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>18,392 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Discontinued operations\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,668 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,432 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Investing activities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Continuing operations\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(6,896 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(13,908 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(25,879 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Discontinued operations\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>240 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11,639 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>585 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Financing activities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(6,881 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(36,234 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>25,635 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(7,387 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(10,456 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17,301 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Increase in cash and cash equivalents - discontinued operations\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2,291 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(573 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents - continuing operations\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(7,387 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(12,747 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>16,728 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating Activities\nNet cash provided by operating activities - continuing operations decreased to $6.2 million for fiscal year 2016 from $25.4 million for fiscal year 2015. The decrease was primarily due to lower sales and changes in working capital including the timing of rent payments and collection of accounts receivable, partially offset by lower general and administrative expenses.\nNet cash provided by operating activities - continuing operations increased to $25.4 million for fiscal year 2015 from $18.4 million for fiscal year 2014. This increase was primarily due to lower general and administrative expenses and changes in working capital including the timing of rent payments and collection of accounts receivable, offset by higher interest payments.\nNet cash provided by operating activities - discontinued operations was $2.7 million in fiscal year 2015 versus net cash used of $1.4 million in fiscal year 2014 due to decrease in marketing expenses and costs related to restaurant closures.\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities - continuing operations was $6.9 million, $13.9 million and $25.9 million in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The net cash used was primarily attributable to capital expenditures for fiscal years 2016, 2015 and 2014 of $9.4 million, $16.6 million and $25.9 million, respectively. Variances in capital expenditures are primarily due to the number and timing of new or converted locations under construction. We also received $1.8 million and $2.0 million of proceeds from disposal of assets, respectively, in 2016 and 2015 primarily related to the closure of Joe's restaurants.\nNet cash provided by investing activities - discontinued operations was $0.2 million, $11.6 million and $0.6 million in 2016, 2015 and 2014, were primarily caused by the sale of Macaroni Grill in 2015.\nWe estimate that total capital expenditures for fiscal year 2017 will be approximately $5.0 million to $10.0 million.\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash used in financing activities was $6.9 million for fiscal year 2016, $36.2 million for fiscal year 2015, while net cash provided by financing activities was $25.6 million for fiscal year 2014. The 2016 balance reflects scheduled quarterly payments on the term loan plus $11.5 million in voluntary prepayments, partially offset by a net $6.0 million borrowing on the revolver. The 2015 balance reflects scheduled quarterly payments on the term loan plus a $35.0 million voluntary prepayment in December 2015. The 2014 balance reflects net borrowings of $25.8 million on our credit facility in fiscal year 2014, representing $41.8 million in net proceeds from our August 2014 refinancing, before accrued interest and fees and net of $4.8 million debt issuance cost payment, and $16.4 million in net repayments from our previous senior secured credit facility.\nSenior Secured Credit Facility\nOn August 13, 2014, we entered into a new senior secured credit facility ( 2014 Credit Agreement\u201d), which consists of a $30.0 million revolving credit facility ( 2014 Revolving Credit Facility\u201d) and a $165.0 million term loan ( 2014 Term Loan\u201d), which both mature on February 13, 2019. The 2014 Term Loan was issued at 98.5% of par. The principal amount of the 2014 Term Loan was payable in consecutive quarterly installments of $412,500, commencing on December 31, 2014, with the balance payable in full at maturity. Since December 2015, we have made $46.5 million in voluntary prepayments on our 2014 Term Loan, which reduced our quarterly installment payments to $294,886.\nInterest rates for borrowings under the 2014 Credit Agreement for the revolver and the term loan are equal to, at our option, either LIBOR (subject to a 1% floor) or the base rate as defined in the agreement, plus a margin of 7.0% for LIBOR loans and 6.0% for base rate loans. The interest rate for the 2014 Term Loan and the 2014 Revolving Credit Facility was 8.0% as of January 2, 2017. In addition, we are required to pay commitment fees on the unused portion of the 2014 Revolving Credit Facility. The commitment fee rate is currently at 0.5%. The commitment fee is subject to adjustment on a quarterly basis based on our leverage ratio as defined by the credit agreement.\nThe 2014 Credit Agreement is guaranteed by each of our subsidiaries and secured by substantially all of our present and future assets and a lien on the capital stock or other equity interests of our direct and indirect subsidiaries. The 2014 Credit Agreement contains covenants which, among other things, limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness, create liens on our assets, make certain investments or loans, merge or otherwise dispose of assets other than in the ordinary course of business, make acquisitions, and pay dividends or make other restricted payments. The 2014 Credit Agreement also contains customary covenants regarding, among other matters, the maintenance of insurance, the preservation and maintenance of our corporate existence, material compliance with laws, and the payment of taxes and other material obligations.\nThe 2014 Credit Agreement provides that (a) the leverage ratio shall not exceed (i) 5.75x through December 29, 2014, (ii) 5.5x from December 30, 2014 through June 29, 2015, (iii) 5.25x from June 30, 2015 through December 28, 2015, (iv) 5.0x from December 29, 2015 through March 28, 2016, (v) 4.75x from March 29, 2016 through June 27, 2016, (vi) 4.25x from June 28, 2016 through September 26, 2016, (vii) 4.0x from September 27, 2016 through April 3, 2017, (viii) 3.75x from April 4, 2017 through October 2, 2017, (ix) 3.5x from October 3, 2017 through April 2, 2018, (x) 3.25x from April 3, 2018 through December 31, 2018, and (xi) 3.0x from January 1, 2019 through maturity date; and requires (b) an interest coverage ratio of at least (i) 2.0x through June 29, 2015, (ii) 2.25x from June 30, 2015 through March 28, 2016, (iii) 2.5x from March 29, 2016 through June 27, 2016, (iv) 2.75x from June 28, 2016 through January 2, 2017, (v) 3.0x from January 3, 2017 through July 3, 2017, (vi) 3.25x from July 4, 2017 through April 2, 2018, (vii) 3.5x from April 3, 2018 through December 31, 2018, and (viii) 3.75x from January 1, 2019 through maturity date. The 2014 Credit Agreement limits capital expenditures to an amount in respect of any period not to exceed (i) $29.5 million from the closing date through December 29, 2014, (ii) $45.5 million for fiscal 2015, (iii) $45.8 million for fiscal 2016, (iv) $52.5 million for fiscal 2017, (v) $53.7 million for fiscal 2018, and (vi) $58.6 million from January 1, 2019 through maturity date, provided that the amount of permitted capital expenditures in any period can be increased by the unused permitted capital expenditures from the immediately preceding period, subject to certain limitations as defined by the agreement. We were in compliance with these covenants as of January 2, 2017.\nIn December 2015, we made a $35.0 million voluntary prepayment of our 2014 Term Loan and wrote off $0.6 million of debt issuance costs and $0.4 million of debt discount, which are included in interest expense. In 2016, we made $11.5 million in voluntary prepayments of our 2014 Term Loan and wrote off $161 thousand of debt issuance costs and $105 thousand of debt discount, which are included in interest expense.\nAs of January 2, 2017, we had letters of credit of approximately $10.1 million outstanding under the 2014 Revolving Credit Facility and had available borrowing capacity of approximately $13.9 million.\nNASDAQ Delisting\nOn March 10, 2017, we received a notice (the Notice\u201d) from the Office of General Counsel of NASDAQ indicating that the NASDAQ Hearings Panel (the Panel\u201d) has determined that our securities would be delisted from The NASDAQ Global Select Market. Accordingly, trading of our common stock was suspended at the opening of business on March 14, 2017, and a Form 25-Notification of Delisting will be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which will remove our securities from listing and registration on NASDAQ.\nThe Notice indicated that the Panel's determination was based on concerns about our ability to sustain compliance with all requirements for continued listing on The NASDAQ Stock Market. Specifically, on July 28, 2016, NASDAQ Listing Qualifications Staff (the Staff\u201d) notified us that we were no longer in compliance with NASDAQ Marketplace Rule 5450(b)(3)(C) since the market value of our publicly held shares closed below the required minimum of $15,000,000 for the previous 30 consecutive business days. In accordance with NASDAQ Marketplace Rule 5810(c) (3)(D), the Staff granted us a 180-day period, or until January 24, 2017, to regain compliance. We were unable to regain compliance with Rule 5450(b)(2)(C) by January 24, 2017. Accordingly, on January 25, 2017, we received a letter from Staff notifying us that our common stock would be delisted from The NASDAQ Global Select Market on February 3, 2017 unless we timely requested a hearing before the Panel. We appealed the Staff's determination by requesting a hearing before the Panel to seek continued listing. On March 10, 2017, the Panel determined that our shares would be delisted from The NASDAQ Stock Market effective at the open of business on March 14, 2017. Since March 15, 2017, our common stock has traded in the OTC market under the symbol IRGT.\nThe OTC market is a significantly more limited market than the NASDAQ Global Select Market and the quotation of our common stock on the OTC market has resulted in a less liquid market available for existing and potential stockholders to trade shares of our common stock. This could further depress the trading price of our common stock and could also have a long-term adverse effect on our ability to raise capital. We cannot provide any assurances as to if or when we will be in a position to relist our common stock on a nationally-recognized securities exchange. See Item 1A. Risk Factors-Our common stock is no longer listed on a national securities exchange and is quoted only on the over-the-counter ( OTC\u201d) market, which could negatively affect our stock price and liquidity.\u201d\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nExcept for restaurant operating leases, we have no material off-balance sheet arrangements.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table sets forth our contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of January 2, 2017 (in thousands):\nTable 101: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Payments Due by Period in Years\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Less than 1\nyear\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1 - 3 years\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 3 - 5 years\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> More than 5\nyears\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Long-term debt\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>121,301 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,180 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>120,121 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating leases\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>230,737 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>29,655 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>56,091 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>48,172 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>96,819 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest payments(a)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>24,447 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11,547 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12,900 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Uncertain tax positions(b)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>376,485 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>42,382 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>189,112 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>48,172 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>96,819 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n__________________________\n (a) We estimate future interest payments on our long-term debt using interest rates and applicable margin in effect at January 2, 2017. (b) We have $0.4 million of uncertain tax positions, including interest and penalties, recorded in other long-term liabilities or as a reduction to net operating loss carryforwards. It is not reasonably possible to predict at this time when (or if) any of these assessments will be settled. \nImpact of Inflation\nOur profitability is dependent, among other things, on our ability to anticipate and react to changes in the costs of key operating resources, including food and beverages, labor, energy and other services. Substantial increases in costs and expenses, including the cost of crab and other shellfish, could impact our operating results to the extent such increases cannot be passed along to our guests. We have been able to substantially offset restaurant and operating cost increases resulting from inflation by altering our menu items, increasing menu prices, making productivity improvements or other adjustments. However, certain areas of costs, notably labor and utilities, can be significantly volatile or subject to significant changes due to changes in laws or regulations, such as the minimum wage laws. There can be no assurance that we will generate increases in comparable restaurant sales in amounts sufficient to offset inflationary or other cost pressures.\nNon-GAAP Financial"}
