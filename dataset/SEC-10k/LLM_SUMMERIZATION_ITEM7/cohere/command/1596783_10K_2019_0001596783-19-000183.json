MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with Item 6. Selected Financial Data\u201d and our Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes, which appear elsewhere in this Annual Report. In addition to historical consolidated financial information, the following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates, and beliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. You should carefully read Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d in this Annual Report. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those discussed below and elsewhere in this Annual Report, particularly in Item 1A. Risk Factors.\u201d\nOverview\nWe are the leading global provider of advanced delivery technologies and development solutions for drugs, biologics, and consumer health products. Our oral, injectable, and respiratory delivery technologies provide delivery solutions across the full diversity of the pharmaceutical industry, including small molecules, protein and gene therapy biologics, and consumer health products. Through our extensive capabilities and deep expertise in product development, we help our customers take products to market faster, including nearly half of new drug products approved by the FDA in the last decade. Our advanced delivery technology platforms, which include those in our Softgel Technologies, Biologics and Specialty Drug Delivery, and Oral Drug Delivery segments, our proven formulation, manufacturing, and regulatory expertise, and our broad and deep intellectual property enable our customers to develop more products and better treatments for patients and consumers. Across both development and delivery, our commitment to reliably supply our customers' and their patients' needs is the foundation for the value we provide; annually, we produce approximately 73 billion doses for nearly 7,000 customer products, or approximately 1 in every 20 doses of such products taken each year by patients and consumers around the world. We believe that, through our investments in growth-enabling capacity and capabilities, our ongoing focus on operational and quality excellence, the sales of existing customer products, the introduction of new customer products, our innovation activities and patents, and our entry into new markets, we will continue to benefit from attractive and differentiated margins and realize the growth potential from these areas.\nOur Reportable Segments\nWe currently operate in four operating segments, which also constitute our four reporting segments: Softgel Technologies, Biologics and Specialty Drug Delivery, Oral Drug Delivery, and Clinical Supply Services.\nEach of our segments reports through a separate management team. Our offerings and services are summarized below by reporting segment.\nSoftgel Technologies\nThrough our Softgel Technologies segment, we provide formulation, development, and manufacturing services for soft capsules, or softgels,\u201d which our predecessor first commercialized in the 1930s and which we have continually enhanced. We are the market leader in overall softgel development and manufacturing and hold the leading market position in the prescription arena. Our principal softgel technologies include traditional softgel capsules, in which the shell is made of animal-derived gelatin, and Vegicaps and OptiShell capsules, in which the shell is made from plant-derived materials. Softgel capsules are used in a broad range of customer products, including prescription drugs, over-the-counter medications, dietary supplements, unit-dose cosmetics, and animal health medicinal preparations. Softgel capsules encapsulate liquid, paste, or oil-based active compounds in solution or suspension within an outer shell. In the manufacturing process, the capsules are formed, filled, and sealed simultaneously. We typically perform encapsulation for a product within one of our softgel facilities, with active ingredients provided by customers or sourced directly by us. Softgels have historically been used to solve formulation challenges or technical issues for a specific drug, to help improve the clinical performance of compounds, to provide important market differentiation, particularly for over-the-counter medications, and to provide safe handling of hormonal, potent, and cytotoxic drugs. We also participate in the softgel vitamin, mineral, and supplement business in selected regions around the world. With the 2001 introduction of our plant-derived softgel shell, Vegicaps capsules, consumer health customers have been able to extend the softgel dose form to a broader range of active ingredients and serve patient/consumer populations that were previously inaccessible due to religious, dietary, or cultural preferences. In recent years, we have extended this platform to pharmaceutical products via our OptiShell capsule offering. Our Vegicaps and OptiShell capsules are protected by patents in most major global markets. Physician and patient studies we have conducted have demonstrated a preference for softgels versus traditional tablet and hard capsule dose forms in terms of ease of swallowing, real or perceived speed of delivery, ability to remove or eliminate unpleasant odor or taste, and, for physicians, perceived improved patient adherence with dosing regimens. Representative customers of Softgel Technologies include Pfizer, Novartis, Bayer, GlaxoSmithKline, Teva, Johnson & Johnson, Procter & Gamble, and Allergan.\nAs of June 30, 2019, we had eleven Softgel Technologies manufacturing facilities in nine countries, including three in North America, three in Europe, three in South America, and two in the Asia-Pacific region, as well as additional sales offices. Our Softgel Technologies segment represents 34% of our aggregate revenue for fiscal 2019 before inter-segment eliminations.\nBiologics and Specialty Drug Delivery\nOur Biologics and Specialty Drug Delivery segment provides drug substance development and manufacturing, drug product clinical and commercial manufacturing, integrated clinical and commercial supply solutions for protein and gene therapy biologics, and specialty small molecules administered via injection, inhalation, and ophthalmic routes, using both traditional and advanced delivery technologies. The business has extensive expertise in development, scale up, and commercial manufacturing. Representative customers of Biologics and Specialty Drug Delivery include Eli Lilly, Teva, Mylan, Roche, Novartis, Sarepta, and Genentech, along with multiple innovative small and mid-tier pharmaceutical and biologics customers.\nOur growing biologics offering includes cell-line development based on our advanced and patented GPEx technology, which is used to develop stable, high-yielding mammalian cell lines for both innovator and biosimilar biologic compounds. GPEx technology can provide rapid cell-line development, high biologics production yields, flexibility, and versatility. Our development and manufacturing facility in Madison, Wisconsin has the capability and capacity to produce cGMP quality biologics drug substance from 250L to 4000L scale using single-use technology to provide maximum efficiency and flexibility. Our fiscal 2018 acquisition of Catalent Indiana added a biologics-focused contract development and manufacturing organization with capabilities across biologics development, clinical, and commercial drug substance manufacturing, formulation, finished-dose drug product manufacturing, and packaging. In fiscal 2019, we continued to expand production capacity in both Madison and Bloomington, Indiana, starting construction on fourth and fifth drug substance suites in Madison and new drug product manufacturing and packaging capacity in Bloomington. Our SMARTag next-generation antibody-drug conjugate technology enables development of antibody-drug conjugates and other protein conjugates with improved efficacy, safety, and manufacturability. In fiscal 2019, we launched our OneBio Suite, which provides customers the potential to seamlessly integrate drug substance, drug product, and clinical supply management for products in development, and for integrated commercial supply across both drug substance and product. We provide the broadest range of technologies and services supporting the development and launch of new biologic entities, biosimilars, and biobetters to bring a product from gene to commercialization, faster.\nOn May 17, 2019, we acquired Paragon, which is focused on the development and manufacture of cutting-edge biopharmaceuticals, including viral vectors used in gene therapies. For over 25 years, Paragon has partnered with some of the world's leading biotech and pharma companies to develop and manufacture products based on transformative technologies, including gene therapies based on AAV and other modalities, next-generation vaccines, oncology immunotherapies (oncolytic viruses and CAR-T cell therapies), therapeutic proteins, and other complex biologics. Paragon brings specialized expertise in AAV vectors, the most commonly used delivery system for gene therapy, as well as capabilities in plasmids and lentivirus vectors manufactured using cGMP. By adding Paragon's specialized expertise in AAV vectors, we believe we are positioned to capitalize on strong industry tailwinds in the market for gene therapies. Paragon also brings to Catalent its differentiated scientific, development, and manufacturing capabilities, which we believe will fundamentally enhance our biologics business and end-to-end integrated biopharmaceutical solutions for customers. In June 2019, Paragon agreed to acquire two additional laboratory and manufacturing facilities located in southern Maryland from Novavax, Inc. The Novavax transaction closed in late July 2019.\nOur range of injectable manufacturing offerings includes filling small molecules or biologics into pre-filled syringes, cartridges, and vials, with flexibility to accommodate other formats within our existing network, increasingly focused on complex pharmaceuticals and biologics. With our range of technologies, we are able to meet a wide range of specifications, timelines, and budgets. We believe that the complexity of the manufacturing process, the importance of experience and know-how, regulatory compliance, and high start-up capital requirements provide us with a substantial competitive advantage in the market. For example, blow-fill-seal is an advanced aseptic processing technology, which uses a continuous process to form, fill with drug or biologic, and seal a plastic container in a sterile environment. Blow-fill-seal units are currently used for a variety of pharmaceuticals in liquid form, such as respiratory, ophthalmic, and otic products. Our sterile blow-fill-seal manufacturing has significant capacity and flexibility in manufacturing configurations. This business provides flexible and scalable solutions for unit-dose delivery of complex formulations such as suspensions and emulsions. Further, the business provides engineering and manufacturing solutions related to complex containers. Our regulatory expertise can lead to decreased time to commercialization, and our dedicated development production lines support feasibility, stability, and clinical runs. We plan to continue to expand our product line in existing and new markets, and in higher margin specialty products with additional respiratory, ophthalmic, injectable, and nasal applications.\nWe also offer bioanalytical development and testing services for large molecules, including cGMP release and stability testing. Our respiratory product capabilities include development and manufacturing services for inhaled products for delivery\nvia metered dose inhalers, dry powder inhalers, and intra-nasal sprays. Across multiple complex dosage forms, the segment provides drug and biologic solutions from early-stage development and clinical support all the way through to scale up and commercialization.\nAs of June 30, 2019, we had ten BSDD manufacturing facilities, including eight in North America and two in Europe. Our BSDD segment represents 29% of our aggregate revenue for fiscal 2019 before inter-segment eliminations.\nOral Drug Delivery\nOur Oral Drug Delivery segment provides various advanced formulation development and manufacturing technologies, and related integrated solutions including: clinical development and commercial manufacturing of a broad range of oral dose forms, including our proprietary fast-dissolve Zydis tablets and both conventional immediate and controlled-release tablets, capsules, and sachet products. Representative customers of Oral Drug Delivery include Pfizer, Johnson & Johnson, Bayer, Novartis, and Perrigo.\nWe provide comprehensive pre-formulation, development, and cGMP manufacturing at both clinical and commercial scales for traditional and advanced complex oral solid-dose formats, including coated and uncoated tablets, pellet/bead/powder-filled two-piece hard capsules, granulated powders, and other forms of immediate and modified release branded prescription, generic, and consumer products. We have substantial experience developing and scaling up products requiring accelerated development timelines, solubility enhancement, specialized handling (e.g., potent or DEA-regulated materials), complex technology transfers, and specialized manufacturing processes. We also provide micronization and particle engineering services, which may enhance a drug's manufacturability or clinical performance. We offer comprehensive analytical testing and scientific services and stability testing for small molecules, both to support integrated development programs and on a fee-for-service basis. We provide global regulatory and support services for our customers' clinical strategies during all stages of development. In recent years, we have expanded our network of development sites focused on earlier phase compounds, to engage with more customer molecules, earlier, with the intent to provide later stage manufacturing and supporting services as those molecules progress towards commercial approval and beyond. Demand for our offerings is driven by the need for scientific expertise and depth and breadth of services offered, as well as by the reliability of our supply, including quality, execution, and performance.\nWe launched our orally dissolving tablet business in 1986 with the introduction of Zydis tablets, a unique proprietary freeze-dried tablet that typically dissolves in the mouth, without water, in less than three seconds. Most often used for drugs and patient groups that can benefit from rapid oral disintegration, we can adapt the Zydis technology to a wide range of products and indications, including treatments for a variety of central nervous system-related conditions such as migraines, Parkinson's disease, and schizophrenia, and consumer healthcare products targeting indications such as pain and allergy relief. We continue to develop Zydis tablets in different formats with our customers as we extend the application of the technology to new therapeutic categories, including immunotherapy, vaccines, and biologic molecule delivery.\nAs of June 30, 2019, we had nine ODD manufacturing facilities, including four in North America and five in Europe. Our ODD segment represents 24% of our aggregate revenue for fiscal 2019 before inter-segment eliminations.\nClinical Supply Services\nOur Clinical Supply Services segment provides manufacturing, packaging, storage, distribution, project management, and inventory management for drugs and biologics in clinical trials. We offer customers flexible solutions for clinical supplies production and provide distribution and inventory management support for both simple and complex clinical trials. This includes over-encapsulation where needed; supplying placebos, comparator drug procurement, and clinical packages and kits for physicians and patients; inventory management; investigator kit ordering and fulfillment; and return supply reconciliation and reporting. We support trials in all regions of the world through our facilities and distribution network. In fiscal 2018, we completed the second phase of our expansion program in our Kansas City, Missouri facility. Further, in fiscal 2016 and again in fiscal 2018, we expanded our Singapore facility by building additional flexible cGMP space, and we introduced clinical supply services at our existing 100,000 square foot facility in Japan, expanding our Asia-Pacific capabilities. Additionally, in fiscal 2013, we established our first clinical supply services facility in China as a joint venture, assumed full ownership in fiscal 2015, and opened a second facility in China in fiscal 2019. We are the leading provider of integrated development solutions and one of the leading providers of clinical trial supplies. Representative customers of Clinical Supply Services include Merck KGaA, IQVIA, Eli Lilly, AbbVie, and Incyte Corporation.\nAs of June 30, 2019, we had nine Clinical Supply Service facilities, including two in North America, three in Europe, and four in the Asia-Pacific region. Our Clinical Supply Services segment represents 13% of our aggregate revenue for fiscal 2019 before inter-segment eliminations.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Recent Accounting Pronouncements\nThe following disclosure supplements the descriptions of our accounting policies contained in Note 1 to our Consolidated Financial Statements in regard to significant areas of judgment. Management made certain estimates and assumptions during the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities in the Consolidated Financial Statements. These estimates also affect the reported amount of net earnings during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Because of the size of the financial statement elements to which they relate, some of our accounting policies and estimates have a more significant impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements than others.\nManagement has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors. A discussion of some of our more significant accounting policies and estimates follows.\nRevenue\nWe sell products and services directly to our pharmaceutical, biotechnology, and consumer health customers. The majority of our business is conducted through manufacturing and commercial product supply, development services, and clinical supply services. On July 1, 2018, we adopted Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), codified as Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC\u201d) 606, using the modified retrospective method of adoption. Prior period amounts have not been restated and continue to be reported in accordance with our historical accounting policies. For discussion on the impact of adopting ASC 606 on our accounting, refer to Note 1 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nOur contracts with customers often include promises to transfer multiple products and services to a customer. Determining whether products and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately versus together may require judgment. For our manufacturing and commercial product supply revenue, the contract generally includes the terms of the manufacturing services and related product quality assurance procedures to comply with regulatory requirements. Due to the regulated nature of our business, these contract terms are highly interdependent and, therefore, are considered to be a single combined performance obligation. For our development services and clinical supply services revenue, our performance obligations vary per contract and are accounted for as separate performance obligations. If a contract contains a single performance obligation, we allocate the entire transaction price to the single performance obligation. If a contract contains multiple performance obligations, we allocate consideration to each performance obligation using the relative standalone selling price\u201d as defined under ASC 606. Generally, we utilize observable standalone selling prices in our allocations of consideration. If observable standalone selling prices are not available, we estimate the applicable standalone selling price using an adjusted market assessment approach, representing the amount that we believe the market is willing to pay for the applicable service. Revenue is recognized over time using an appropriate method of measuring progress towards fulfilling our performance obligation for the respective arrangement. Determining the measure of progress that consistently depicts our satisfaction of performance obligations within each of our revenue streams across similar arrangements requires judgment.\nLicensing revenue\nWe occasionally enter into arrangements with customers that include licensing of functional intellectual property, including drug formulae, or other intangible property ( out-licensing\u201d). We do not have any material license arrangement that contains more than one performance obligation. Our out-licensing generally entitles us to nonrefundable, up-front fees or royalties. Nonrefundable, up-front license fees are recognized as revenue when the licensed property is made available for the customer's use and benefit, provided there is no unsatisfied performance obligation included in the arrangement. Royalty payments from such arrangements are recognized when subsequent sale or usage of an item subject to the royalty occurs and the performance obligation to which royalty relates is satisfied.\nLong-lived and Other Definite-Lived Intangible Assets\nWe allocate the cost of an acquired company to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets and liabilities acquired, with the remaining amount being recorded as goodwill. Intangible assets primarily include customer relationships and trademarks. Valuing the identifiable intangible assets requires judgment. We applied a discounted cash flow model in measuring the customer relationships in relation to the Paragon acquisition, which included certain assumptions such as revenue growth, forecasted revenue and related margin, and customer contract attrition and renewal rates. Intangibles assets are generally amortized on a straight-line basis, reflecting the pattern in which the economic benefits are consumed, and are amortized over their estimated useful lives.\nWe assess the impairment of identifiable intangibles if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying values of the assets may not be recoverable. Factors that we consider important that could trigger an impairment review include the following:\n\u2022significant under-performance relative to historical or projected future operating results;\n\u2022significant changes in the manner of use of the acquired assets or the strategy of the overall business;\n\u2022significant negative industry or economic trends; and\n\u2022recognition of goodwill impairment charges.\nIf we determine that the carrying value of intangibles and/or long-lived assets may not be recoverable based on the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment, we measure recoverability of assets by comparing the respective carrying values of the assets to the current and expected future cash flows, on an un-discounted basis, to be generated from such assets. If such analysis indicates that the carrying value of these assets is not recoverable, we measure any impairment based on the amount in which the net carrying amounts of the assets exceed the fair values of the assets. See Notes 5 and 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nGoodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets\nWe account for purchased goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives in accordance with ASC 350, Intangible and Other Assets. Under ASC 350, goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized, but instead are tested for impairment at least annually. We perform an impairment evaluation of goodwill annually during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year or when circumstances otherwise indicate an evaluation should be performed. The evaluation may begin with a qualitative assessment for each reporting unit to determine whether it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value. If the qualitative assessment does not generate a positive response, or if no qualitative assessment is performed, a quantitative assessment, based upon discounted cash flows, is performed and requires management to estimate future cash flows, growth rates, and economic and market conditions. In fiscal 2017 and 2018, we proceeded immediately to the quantitative assessment, but in fiscal 2019 we began with the qualitative assessment, which was sufficient to find no impairment. The 2018 and 2017 evaluations also resulted in no impairment charge.\nSee Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nSeries A Preferred Stock Dividend Adjustment Feature\nThe terms of the Series A Preferred Stock include a dividend adjustment feature to provide the holder with certain protections against a decline in the trading price of our Common Stock. Because this adjustment feature depends in part on the value of external metrics at future dates, over which we have no control, this feature is accounted for separately from the Series A Preferred Stock. The derivative instrument is measured at fair value, as of the valuation date, using a combination of (i) a Monte Carlo simulation and (ii) a binomial lattice model, which incorporates the terms and conditions of the Series A Preferred Stock and is based on changes in the market prices of shares of our Common Stock over successive periods. Key assumptions used in both models include the current market price of one share of the Common Stock and its historical and expected volatility, risk-neutral interest rates, and the remaining term of the adjustment feature. These assumptions require significant management judgment and are considered Level 3 inputs. We recognize the derivative as either an asset or liability in the consolidated balance sheets at its fair value and revalue it as of the end of each quarterly reporting period; changes in the fair value are recognized in the consolidated statements of operations.\nIncome Taxes\nIn accordance with ASC 740 Income Taxes, we account for income taxes using the asset and liability method. The asset and liability method requires recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for expected future tax consequences of temporary differences that currently exist between tax bases and financial reporting bases of our assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in the respective jurisdictions in which we operate. Deferred taxes are not provided on the undistributed earnings of subsidiaries outside of the United States when it is expected that these earnings will be permanently reinvested. In fiscal 2018, we recorded a provision for U.S. income taxes and foreign withholding taxes in relation to expected repatriations as a result of the 2017 Tax Act, but we have not made any provision for U.S. income taxes on the remaining undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries as those earnings are considered permanently reinvested in the operations of those foreign subsidiaries in fiscal 2019.\nThe 2017 Tax Act imposed taxes with respect to so-called global intangible low-taxed income\u201d ( GILTI\u201d) earned by certain foreign subsidiaries of a U.S. company. In accordance with ASC 740, we made an accounting policy election to treat taxes due on future U.S. inclusions in taxable income related to GILTI as a current-period expense when incurred.\nWe had valuation allowances of $76.3 million and $86.2 million as of June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively, against our deferred tax assets. We considered all available evidence, both positive and negative, in assessing the need for a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets. We evaluated four possible sources of taxable income when assessing the realization of deferred tax assets:\n\u2022carrybacks of existing net operating losses (if permitted by tax law);\n\u2022future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences;\n\u2022tax planning strategies; and\n\u2022future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards.\nWe considered the need to maintain a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets based on management's assessment of whether it is more likely than not that we would realize those deferred tax assets based on future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences and the ability to generate sufficient taxable income within the carryforward period available under the applicable tax law. During the year ended June 30, 2019 we released $12.1 million of the valuation allowance related to certain U.S. combined states. Of the $12.1 million released, $0.5 million relates to state net operating loss ( NOLs\u201d) carryforwards, which expire over a number of years beginning in 2028, and $11.6 million relates to other state deferred tax temporary differences that will reduce income for state tax purposes in the future.\nWhile the valuation allowance related to certain U.S. combined states was partially released in the year ended June 30, 2019, a state valuation allowance of $35.1 million is maintained on state NOLs and deductible temporary differences for the separate and remaining combined states. The remaining state valuation allowance is due to our history of tax losses and anticipated loss utilization rates in separate filing status states as well as the difference in the rules related to allocated and apportioned income for separate filing status states versus combined filing status states.\nUnrecognized tax benefits are generated when there are differences between tax positions taken in a tax return and amounts recognized in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Tax benefits are recognized in the Consolidated Financial Statements when it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination. To the extent we prevail in matters for which liabilities have been established or are required to pay amounts in excess of our liabilities, our effective income tax rate in a given period could be materially affected. An unfavorable income tax settlement may require the use of cash and result in an increase in our effective income tax rate in the year it is resolved. A favorable income tax settlement would be recognized as a reduction in the effective income tax rate in the year of resolution. At June 30, 2019 and 2018, we recorded unrecognized tax benefits and related interest and penalties of $5.2 million and $4.1 million, respectively. We recognized no material adjustment in the liability for unrecognized income tax benefits during fiscal 2019.\nOur accounting for income taxes involves the application of complex tax regulations in the U.S. and in each of the non-US jurisdictions in which we operate. The determination of income subject to taxation in each tax paying jurisdiction requires us to review reported book income and the events occurring during the year in each jurisdiction in which we operate. In addition, the application of deferred tax assets and liabilities will have an effect on the tax expense in each jurisdiction. For those entities engaging in transactions with affiliates, we apply transfer pricing guidelines relevant in many jurisdictions in which we operate and make certain informed and reasonable assumptions and estimates about the relative value of contributions by affiliates when assessing the allocation of income and deductions between consolidated entities in different jurisdictions. Additionally, for taxes incurred outside the U.S., we are entitled, under the Internal Revenue Code as amended by the 2017 Tax Act and regulations promulgated thereunder, to claim U.S. foreign tax credits to offset certain tax liabilities arising in the U.S. Certain of the assumptions and allocations used in the determination of the key inputs underlying the foreign tax credits, particularly as they relate to the calculation of U.S. income taxes owed on GILTI, are based on recently issued regulatory guidance that does not necessarily address all elements needed to prepare the calculations and is therefore subject to considerable judgment.\nFactors Affecting our Performance\nFluctuations in Operating Results\nOur annual financial reporting periods end on June 30. Our revenue and net earnings are generally higher in the third and fourth quarters of each fiscal year, with our first fiscal quarter typically generating our lowest revenue of any quarter, and our last fiscal quarter typically generating our highest revenue. These fluctuations are primarily the result of the timing of our, and our customers', annual operational maintenance periods at locations in continental Europe and the U.K., the seasonality associated with pharmaceutical and biotechnology budgetary spending decisions, clinical trial and research and development schedules, the timing of new product launches and length of time needed to obtain full market penetration, and, to a lesser extent, the time of the year some of our customers' products are in higher demand.\nAcquisition and Related Integration Efforts\nOur growth and profitability are affected by the acquisitions we complete and the speed at which we integrate those acquisitions into our existing operating platforms. In fiscal 2018, we acquired Catalent Indiana in order to enhance our biologics capabilities, and it has been integrated into our Biologics and Specialty Drug Delivery segment. In fiscal 2019, we completed the acquisitions of Juniper, based in the U.K., in August 2018 and Paragon, based in the U.S., in May 2019, which have been integrated into our Oral Drug Delivery and Biologics and Specialty Drug Delivery segments, respectively.\nForeign Exchange Rates\nOur operating network is global, and, as a result, we have substantial revenues and operating expenses that are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, the currency in which we report our financial results, and are therefore influenced by changes in currency exchange rates. In fiscal 2019, approximately 48% of our revenue was generated from our operations outside the United States. Significant foreign currencies for our operations include the British pound, the euro, the Brazilian real, the Argentine peso, the Japanese yen, the Canadian dollar, and the Australian dollar.\nTrends Affecting Our Business\nIndustry\nWe participate in nearly every sector of the global pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry, which has been estimated to generate $1 trillion in annual revenue, including, but not limited to, the prescription drug and biologic sectors as well as consumer health, which includes the over-the-counter and vitamins and nutritional supplement sectors. Innovative pharmaceuticals continue to play a critical role in the global market, while the share of revenue due to generic drugs and biosimilars is increasing in both developed and developing markets. Sustained developed market demand and rapid growth in emerging economies is driving the consumer health product growth rate to more than double that for pharmaceuticals. Payors, both public and private, have sought to limit the economic impact of pharmaceutical and biologics product demand through greater use of generic and biosimilar drugs, access and spending controls, and health technology assessment techniques, favoring products that deliver truly differentiated outcomes.\nNew Molecule Development and R&D Sourcing\nContinued strengthening in early-stage development pipelines for drugs and biologics, compounded by increasing clinical trial breadth and complexity, support our belief in the attractive growth prospects for development solutions. Large companies are in many cases reconfiguring their R&D resources, increasingly involving the use of strategic partners for important outsourced functions. Additionally, an increasing portion of compounds in development are from companies that do not have a full research and development infrastructure, and thus are more likely to need strategic development solutions partners.\nDemographics\nAging population demographics in developed countries, combined with health care reforms in many global markets that are expanding access to treatments to a greater proportion of their populations, will continue to drive increases in demand for pharmaceuticals, biologics, and consumer health products. Increasing economic affluence in developing regions will further increase demand for healthcare treatments, and we are taking active steps to allow us to participate effectively in these growth regions and product categories.\nFinally, we believe the market access and payor pressures our customers face, global supply chain complexity, and the increasing demand for improved treatments will continue to escalate the need for product differentiation, improved outcomes, and treatment cost reduction, all of which can often be addressed using our advanced delivery technologies.\nNon-GAAP Performance Metrics\nAs described in this section, management uses various financial metrics, including certain metrics that are not based on concepts defined in U.S. GAAP, to measure and assess the performance of our business and to make critical business decisions. We therefore, believe that presentation of certain of these non-GAAP metrics in this Annual Report will aid investors in understanding our business performance.\nUse of EBITDA from operations\nManagement measures operating performance based on consolidated earnings from operations before interest expense, expense/(benefit) for income taxes and depreciation and amortization, adjusted for the income or loss attributable to non-controlling interests ( EBITDA from operations\u201d). EBITDA from operations is not defined under U.S. GAAP, is not a measure\nof operating income, operating performance, or liquidity presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and is subject to important limitations.\nWe believe that the presentation of EBITDA from operations enhances an investor's understanding of our financial performance. We believe this measure is a useful financial metric to assess our operating performance across periods and use this measure for business planning purposes. In addition, given the significant investments that we have made in the past in property, plant and equipment, depreciation and amortization expenses represent a meaningful portion of our cost structure. We believe that disclosing EBITDA from operations will provide investors with a useful tool for assessing the comparability between periods of our ability to generate cash from operations sufficient to pay taxes, to service debt, and to undertake capital expenditures without consideration of non-cash depreciation and amortization expense. We present EBITDA from operations in order to provide supplemental information that we consider relevant for the readers of the Consolidated Financial Statements, and such information is not meant to replace or supersede U.S. GAAP measures. Our definition of EBITDA from operations may not be the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies. The most directly comparable measure to EBITDA from operations defined under U.S. GAAP is earnings/(loss) from operations. Included in this Management's Discussion and Analysis is a reconciliation of earnings/(loss) from operations to EBITDA from operations.\nIn addition, we evaluate the performance of our segments based on segment earnings before non-controlling interest, other (income)/expense, impairments, restructuring costs, interest expense, income tax expense/(benefit), and depreciation and amortization ( Segment EBITDA\u201d).\nUse of Constant Currency\nAs exchange rates are an important factor in understanding period-to-period comparisons, we believe the presentation of results on a constant currency basis in addition to reported results helps improve investors' ability to understand our operating results and evaluate our performance in comparison to prior periods. Constant currency information compares results between periods as if exchange rates had remained constant period-over-period. We use results on a constant currency basis as one measure to evaluate our performance. In this Annual Report, we calculate constant currency by calculating current-year results using prior-year foreign currency exchange rates. We generally refer to such amounts calculated on a constant currency basis as excluding the impact of foreign exchange.

We acquired Paragon in May 2019, Juniper in August 2018, and Catalent Indiana in October 2017, which increased revenue by 7%, but the increase was partially offset by a reduction in revenue from comparator sourcing arrangements within our Clinical Supply Services segment of 4%. As a result of the adoption of ASC 606, we recorded comparator sourcing arrangements on a net basis versus a gross basis, resulting in a decrease in net revenue with no corresponding decrease to EBITDA. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, divestitures, and the change in accounting for comparator sourcing arrangements, revenue increased 2% primarily driven by increased net revenue within our Biologics and Specialty Drug Delivery segment.\nGross Margin\nGross margin increased by $68.4 million, or 9%, in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018, excluding the impact of foreign exchange, primarily due to increased sales volumes as a result of acquisitions discussed above. On a constant currency basis, gross margin, as a percentage of revenue, was 31.9% in the twelve months ended June 30, 2019, an increase from the prior year of 133 basis points, primarily as a result of the adoption of ASC 606, pursuant to which we record comparator sourcing arrangements on a net basis versus the former gross basis, which increased gross margin percentage by 127 basis points.\nSelling, General, and Administrative Expense\nSelling, general, and administrative expense increased by $52.3 million, or 11%, in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018, excluding the impact of foreign exchange, primarily driven by acquisition-related expenses during the year, including transaction fees of $19.7 million related to the acquisitions of Paragon, Juniper, and the two advanced biologics clinical development and manufacturing sites in southern Maryland from Novavax, Inc. and the expected acquisition of the oral solids, biologics, and sterile product manufacturing and packaging facility in Anagni, Italy. Additionally, there were incremental selling, general, and additional administrative expenses from the acquired companies of $28.4 million, primarily driven by $19.9 million of incremental depreciation and amortization expense and $3.0 million of employee-related costs. Selling, general, and administrative expenses further increased approximately $4.4 million for non-cash equity-based compensation driven by the achievement of certain performance-based metrics during the fiscal year.\nImpairment Charges and Loss on Sale of Assets\nImpairment charges for the twelve months ended June 30, 2019 and June 30, 2018 were $5.1 million and $8.7 million, respectively. Impairment charges in the current year were driven by a software related intangible asset in our Clinical Supply Services segment that was not implemented and whose value therefore was not fully recoverable. The prior year included losses on the sales of two Asia-Pacific manufacturing sites in the Softgel Technologies segment. The site divestitures were not material, either individually or in the aggregate, to the segment or our business as a whole.\nRestructuring and Other\nRestructuring and other charges of $14.1 million in fiscal 2019 increased by $4.3 million, excluding the impact of foreign exchange, compared to the amounts in fiscal 2018 and were driven by increases in employee-related actions. Restructuring expenses varies period-to-period based on site consolidation efforts and other efforts to further streamline the business.\nInterest Expense, net\nInterest expense, net, of $110.9 million in fiscal 2019 was in line with interest expense incurred during fiscal 2018. The interest expense during fiscal 2019 was primarily driven by outstanding debt associated with the financing of the Catalent Indiana acquisition in October 2017, the financing of the Paragon acquisition in May 2019, and the offering of the USD 2027 Notes in June 2019. The principal balance of our debt obligation increased during the fiscal year; however, our interest expense remained in line with the prior fiscal year since we were able to reduce the higher interest rates applicable to certain of our debt and pay down some of our debt with the net proceeds of a July 2018 public offering of our Common Stock (the 2018 Equity Offering\u201d).\nFor additional information concerning our debt and financing arrangements, including the changing mix of debt and equity in our capital structure, see -Liquidity and Capital Resources-Debt and Financing Arrangements\u201d and Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report.\nA component of the purchase price for the Catalent Indiana acquisition consisted of $200.0 million in deferred purchase consideration payable in four annual $50.0 million installments, the first of which was paid in October 2018. The present value of the unpaid portion of the deferred consideration is accounted for as debt, with the difference between the nominal value of such portion and such present value considered imputed interest expense.\nOther Expense, net\nOther expense, net of $2.7 million for fiscal 2019 was primarily driven by financing charges of $15.8 million related to the offering of the USD 2027 Notes and was partially offset by a gain of $12.9 million related to the change in the fair value of the derivative liability arising from the dividend adjustment mechanism of the Series A Preferred Stock and $0.5 million of unrealized foreign currency gains in the year. See Notes 9 and 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statement for more details on the Series A Preferred Stock dividend adjustment.\nOther expense, net for fiscal 2018 of $5.5 million was primarily driven by financing charges of $11.8 million related to the offering of the USD 2026 Notes and an amendment to the Credit Agreement, which included a $6.1 million charge for commitment fees paid during the first quarter of fiscal 2018, partially offset by $4.6 million of foreign currency gains in the fiscal year.\nProvision/(Benefit) for Income Taxes\nOur provision for income taxes for the twelve months ended June 30, 2019 was $22.9 million relative to earnings from operations before income taxes of $160.3 million. Our provision for income taxes for the twelve months ended June 30, 2018 was $68.4 million relative to earnings from operations before income taxes of $152.0 million. The income tax provision for the current period is not comparable to the same period of the prior year primarily due to the impact of the 2017 Tax Act, changes in pretax income over many jurisdictions, and the impact of discrete items, including equity compensation. Generally, fluctuations in our effective tax rate are due to changes in the geographic distribution of our pretax income resulting from our business mix and changes in the tax impact of permanent differences, restructuring, other special items, and other discrete tax items, including the reversal portion of the state valuation allowance, which may have unique tax implications depending on the nature of the item.\nSegment Review\nThe below charts depict the percentage of revenue from each of our four reporting segments for the previous two years.

Net revenue remained consistent to the twelve months ended June 30, 2018, excluding the impact of divestitures. Volume increases across our consumer health portfolio within Europe were offset by strong price competition across the generic portion of our prescription product business in North America. Revenue in our consumer health business also decreased by 1%, across North America and Latin America, resulting from a shortage in our ibuprofen active pharmaceutical ingredient supply during the first 9 months of 2019, which was partially resolved in the fourth fiscal quarter.\nSoftgel Technologies' Segment EBITDA increased by $2.1 million, or 1%, compared to the twelve months ended June 30, 2018, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. Excluding the reduction of licensing revenue profit of 2%, segment EBITDA without divestitures increased 3%. The increase was primarily related to increased volume in the consumer health portfolio across Europe, offset by a shortage in our supply of ibuprofen active pharmaceutical ingredient during the first 9 months of 2019, which was partially resolved in the fourth fiscal quarter, which reduced Segment EBITDA by 3%.\nIn December 2017, we divested two manufacturing sites in Asia-Pacific in the Softgel Technologies segment in order to better streamline our global operations. The site divestitures resulted in a decrease to net revenue of 1% with no impact to segment EBITDA in the twelve months ended June 30, 2019 compared to the twelve months ended June 30, 2018.\nBiologics and Specialty Drug Delivery segment\nTable 19: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2019 vs. 2018 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Fiscal Year Ended\nJune 30, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Net Revenue </td> <td> </td> <td>Segment EBITDA </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenue / Segment EBITDA without acquisitions </td> <td>7 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impact of acquisitions </td> <td>17 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>24 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Constant currency change </td> <td>24 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>24 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Foreign exchange fluctuation </td> <td>(1) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>(1) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total % change </td> <td>23 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>23 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet revenue in our Biologics and Specialty Drug Delivery segment increased by $146.7 million, or 24%, compared to the twelve months ended June 30, 2018, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. Net revenue without acquisitions increased by 7%, driven primarily by increased end-market demand for our drug product offerings offset slightly by decreased volume demand related to our U.S. drug substance product offering due to the fiscal 2019 completion of a limited duration customer contract for non-cell line clinical manufacturing services.\nBiologics and Specialty Drug Delivery segment EBITDA increased by $35.0 million, or 24%, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. Segment EBITDA without acquisitions was in line with prior year, primarily due to strong U.S drug product and drug-substance end-market demand offset by the fiscal 2019 completion of a limited duration customer contract for non-cell line clinical manufacturing services in our U.S. drug substance platform as well as unfavorable product mix in our European specialty drug product platform.\nOn October 23, 2017, we acquired Catalent Indiana, which increased net revenue and Segment EBITDA on an inorganic basis in our Biologics and Specialty Drug Delivery segment by 12% and 17%, respectively, in the twelve months ended June 30, 2019 compared to the corresponding prior-year period.\nOn May 17, 2019, we acquired Paragon, which increased net revenue and Segment EBITDA on an inorganic basis in our Biologics and Specialty Drug Delivery segment by 5% and 7%, respectively, in the twelve months ended June 30, 2019 compared to the corresponding prior-year period.\nOral Drug Delivery segment\nTable 20: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2019 vs. 2018 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Fiscal Year Ended\nJune 30, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Net Revenue </td> <td> </td> <td>Segment EBITDA </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenue / Segment EBITDA without acquisitions </td> <td>(1) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>(5) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impact of acquisitions </td> <td>11 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>15 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Constant currency change </td> <td>10 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>10 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Foreign exchange fluctuation </td> <td>(2) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>(2) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total % Change </td> <td>8 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>8 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet revenue in our Oral Drug Delivery segment increased by $67.7 million, or 10%, compared to the twelve months ended June 30, 2018, excluding the impact of foreign exchange, primarily resulting from our Juniper acquisition. Revenue without acquisitions decreased 1%, primarily driven by decreased end-market demand for a key product within our U.S.-based commercial oral delivery solutions platform, partially offset by an increase related to the intake of new molecules within our development and analytical services platform, the completion of a commercially ready process for a key product within our U.S.-based oral delivery solutions platform and a favorable impact from licensing revenue recorded during the third quarter. The favorable impact of licensing revenue in the third quarter was attributable to a single transaction, which consisted of a grant to a third party of the Company's right to participate in an arrangement that resulted in a stream of revenue over time in exchange for a one-time up-front license fee.\nOral Drug Delivery's Segment EBITDA increased by $2.3 million, or 10%, compared to the twelve months ended June 30, 2018, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. Segment EBITDA without acquisitions decreased 5%, primarily driven by decreased end-market demand for a key product within our U.S.-based commercial oral delivery solutions platform, partially offset by an increase in volume related to the intake of new molecules within our development and analytical services platform, the completion of a commercially ready process for a key product within our U.S.-based oral delivery solutions platform and a\nfavorable impact from licensing profit recorded during the third quarter. The favorable impact of licensing revenue in the third quarter was attributable to a single transaction, which consisted of a grant to a third party of the Company's right to participate in an arrangement that resulted in a stream of revenue over time in exchange for a one-time up-front license fee.\nOn August 14, 2018, we acquired Juniper, which increased inorganic net revenue and Segment EBITDA in our Oral Drug Delivery segment for the twelve months ended June 30, 2019 by 11% and 15%, respectively, compared to the prior-year period.\nClinical Supply Services segment\nTable 21: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2019 vs. 2018 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Fiscal Year Ended\nJune 30, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Net Revenue </td> <td> </td> <td>Segment EBITDA </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenue / Segment EBITDA without acquisitions </td> <td>1 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>14 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Comparator revenue recognition adoption impact </td> <td>(25) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Constant currency change </td> <td>(24) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>14 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Foreign exchange fluctuation </td> <td>(2) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>(3) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total % Change </td> <td>(26) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>11 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nClinical Supply Services' net revenue decreased by $102.7 million, or 24%, compared to the twelve months ended June 30, 2018, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. As a result of the adoption of ASC 606, the Company recorded comparator sourcing arrangements on a net basis versus a gross basis resulting in a decrease to net revenue of 25%, partially offset by an increase in revenue primarily due to higher comparator sourcing volume and profitability as well as storage and distribution and manufacturing and packaging business volume.\nClinical Supply Services' Segment EBITDA increased by $10.9 million, or 14%, excluding the impact of foreign exchange, as compared to the twelve months ended June 30, 2018, primarily due to a favorable shift within the storage and distribution business, increased growth in project management revenue, and improved capacity utilization across the network based on prior strategic investments.\nFiscal Year Ended June 30, 2018 Compared to the Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2017\nManagement's discussion and analysis of our results of operations for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017 may be found in the Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2018 Compared to the Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2017\u201d section of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018, filed with the SEC on August 28, 2018.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nSources and use of Cash\nOur principal source of liquidity has been cash flow generated from operations and the net proceeds of financing activities. The principal uses of cash are to fund operating and capital expenditures, business or asset acquisitions, interest payments on debt, the payment of deferred purchase consideration from the Catalent Indiana acquisition, the payment of the quarterly dividend on the Series A Preferred Stock, and any mandatory or discretionary principal payment on our debt. At the current stated value of the Series A Preferred Stock outstanding as of June 30, 2019, the aggregate amount of each regular quarterly dividend, if paid in cash, is $8.125 million. Because the shares of Series A Preferred Stock were first issued on May 17, 2019, the aggregate amount of the first regular dividend payment for the period ended June 30, 2019, which was paid in cash, was $4.0 million. As of June 30, 2019, Operating Company had available a $550.0 million revolving credit facility that matures in May 2024 (following the execution of the fourth amendment (the Fourth Amendment\u201d) to Operating Company's Credit Agreement in May 2019), the capacity of which is reduced by the amount of all outstanding letters of credit issued under the senior secured credit facilities and those short-term borrowings referred to as swing-line borrowings. At June 30, 2019, we had $6.6 million of outstanding letters of credit and no outstanding borrowing under our revolving credit facility.\nWe believe that our cash on hand, cash from operations, and available borrowings under our revolving credit facility will be adequate to meet our future liquidity needs for at least the next twelve months, including with respect to payment of our quarterly regular dividend on the Series A Preferred Stock, if paid in cash, and the amounts expected to become due with respect to our pending capital projects. We have no significant maturity under any of our bank or note debt until the euro-denominated term loans in our senior secured credit facility mature in May 2024. We have three remaining annual payments of\n$50.0 million each with respect to the previously described deferred purchase consideration, the first of which is due in October 2019.\nCash Flows\nFiscal Year Ended June 30, 2019 Compared to the Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2018\nThe following table summarizes our consolidated statements of cash flows from operations for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019 compared with the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018:\nTable 22: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Fiscal Year Ended\nJune 30, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Dollars in millions) </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td>Change $\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by/(used in): </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating activities </td> <td>$ </td> <td>247.7 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>374.5 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(126.8) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investing activities </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(1,510.4) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(919.3) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(591.1) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Financing activities </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,201.4 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>669.1 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>532.3 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating Activities\nFor the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019, cash provided by operating activities was $247.7 million, a decrease of $126.8 million compared to $374.5 million for the comparable prior-year period. The decrease was due to a higher collection of receivables during the corresponding prior-year period and higher inventory levels during fiscal 2019 compared to the prior-year period. Also, we had a higher accounts receivable balance at the end of the current-year period as a result of higher days sales outstanding during fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018. The increase in day sales outstanding is primarily driven by the adoption of ASC 606. Upon adoption of ASC 606, the time for recognizing revenue for commercial product supply arrangements changed from delivery to when control is transferred to the customer, which occurs over time as units of product successfully complete the contractually required quality assurance process; however, we continued to invoice upon shipment of the product, which generally added one to two weeks to our days sales outstanding. In addition, certain customers adopted digital payment processing systems, which resulted in further delays in receiving payments and ultimately led to increased days sales outstanding.\nInvesting Activities\nFor the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019, cash used in investing activities was $1,510.4 million compared to $919.3 million during fiscal 2018. Fiscal 2019 cash used in investing activities primarily consists of $1,291.0 million of payments for business acquisition, net of cash acquired. Of this amount, $1,163.5 million was paid for the acquisition of Paragon in the fourth quarter and the remaining $127.5 million was paid for the acquisition of Juniper in the first quarter. In fiscal 2018, $748.0 million of cash was paid for the acquisition of Catalent Indiana. Other uses of cash in investing activities included cash used in acquisitions of property, plant, and equipment, which totaled $218.1 million in fiscal 2019 compared to $176.5 million in fiscal 2018.\nFinancing Activities\nFor the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019, cash provided by financing activities was $1,201.4 million compared to cash provided by financing activities of $669.1 million during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018. The fiscal 2019 cash provided by financing activities consists of net proceeds of $1,447.6 million from borrowings, $646.3 million of net proceeds from the issuance of shares of our Series A Preferred Stock, and $445.5 million of net proceeds from the issuance of shares of our Common Stock, partially offset by $1,290.3 million of payments against long-term obligations. The fiscal 2018 balance primarily consists of $442.6 million of net proceeds from borrowing and $227.8 million of net proceeds from the issuance of shares of our Common Stock. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019, pursuant to the Fourth Amendment, we borrowed $950.0 million aggregate principal amount through new incremental term B loans under our existing senior secured credit facilities, the net proceeds of which were used to pay a portion of the fees and expenses related to the Fourth Amendment, a voluntary prepayment of $300.0 million on the outstanding principal amount of existing U.S. dollar-denominated term loans under the Credit Agreement, and a portion of the consideration for the Paragon acquisition. In addition, the Company raised $500.0 million, before fees and expenses, through the offering of the USD 2027 Notes, and the net proceeds were primarily used to repay in full the remaining outstanding borrowings under the U.S. dollar-denominated term loans that mature in May 2024 under the Credit Agreement. In connection with the USD 2027 Notes offering and the Fourth Amendment, we incurred $27.0 million of debt discount and third-party financing costs, of which $5.4 million was expensed and recorded in other expense, net in the consolidated statements of operations. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019, we sold 650,000 shares of our Series A\nPreferred Stock for an aggregate purchase price of $650.0 million, or $1,000 per share. In the first quarter of fiscal 2019, we raised net proceeds of $445.3 million as part of the 2018 Equity Offering. In the 2018 Equity Offering, we sold 11.4 million shares, including the underwriters' over-allotment, of our Common Stock at a price to the public of $40.24 per share, before underwriting discounts and commissions. The net proceeds of $445.3 million include the effect of discounts and commissions and other offering expenses. We used the net proceeds in addition to cash on hand to repay $450.0 million of outstanding borrowings under the U.S. dollar-denominated term loans outstanding under our senior secured credit facilities. During the second quarter of fiscal 2019, we paid the first installment on the deferred purchase consideration for the acquisition of Catalent Indiana, of which $44.0 million represents the deemed principal portion of the debt.\nFiscal Year Ended June 30, 2018 Compared to the Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2017\nManagement's discussion and analysis of our cash flows for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017 may be found in the Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Cash Flows-Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2018 Compared to the Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2017\u201d section of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018, filed with the SEC on August 28, 2018.\nDebt and Financing Arrangements\nSenior Secured Credit Facilities and Fourth Amendment\nIn May 2019, Operating Company completed the Fourth Amendment. As part of the Fourth Amendment, Operating Company borrowed $950.0 million aggregate principal amount through incremental term B loans ( Incremental Dollar Term B-2 Loans\u201d) and replaced the existing revolving credit commitments of $200.0 million in its senior secured credit facilities with new revolving credit commitments of $550.0 million ( Incremental Revolving Credit Commitments\u201d). The Incremental Dollar Term B-2 Loans constitute a new class of U.S. dollar-denominated term loans under the Credit Agreement with the same principal terms as the then existing U.S. dollar-denominated term loans. The proceeds of the Incremental Dollar Term B-2 Loans were used to pay a portion of the fees and expenses related to the Fourth Amendment, a voluntary prepayment of $300.0 million on the outstanding principal amount of existing U.S. dollar-denominated term loans under the Credit Agreement, and a portion was used to fund a portion of the consideration for the Paragon acquisition. The Incremental Dollar Term B-2 Loans will mature at the earlier of (1) May 17, 2026 and (2) the 91st day prior to the maturity of the Euro Notes or a permitted refinancing thereof, if on such 91st day any of the Euro Notes remains outstanding. The Incremental Revolving Credit Commitments constitute revolving credit commitments under the Credit Agreement with the same principal terms as the previously existing revolving credit commitments under the Credit Agreement. The maturity date for the Revolving Credit Facility is now the earlier of (1) May 17, 2024 and (2) the 91st day prior to the maturity of any dollar term loans or euro term loans under the Credit Agreement, or any permitted refinancing thereof, if on such 91st day any of such dollar term loans or euro term loans remain outstanding. Under the Credit Agreement, the applicable rate for U.S. dollar-denominated term loans, including the Incremental Dollar Term B-2 Loans is LIBOR (the London Interbank Offered Rate, subject to a floor of 1.00%) plus 2.25%, and the applicable rate for euro-denominated term loans is Euribor (the Euro Interbank Offered Rate published by the European Money Markets Institute, subject to a floor of 1.00%) plus 1.75%. The applicable rate for the Incremental Revolving Credit Commitments is initially LIBOR plus 2.25%, and such rate can additionally be reduced to LIBOR plus 2.00% in future periods based on a measure of Operating Company's total leverage ratio. The euro-denominated term loans will mature in May 2024.\nIn July 2018, we completed the 2018 Equity Offering and used the net proceeds of $445.2 million and cash on hand to repay $450.0 million of the then-outstanding borrowings under our U.S. dollar-denominated term loans.\nEuro-denominated 4.75% Senior Notes due 2024\nIn December 2016, Operating Company completed a private offering of the Euro Notes. The Euro Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed, jointly and severally, by all of the wholly owned U.S. subsidiaries of Operating Company that guarantee its senior secured credit facilities. The Euro Notes were offered in the United States to qualified institutional buyers in reliance on Rule 144A under the Securities Act and outside the United States only to non-U.S. investors pursuant to Regulation S under the Securities Act. The Euro Notes will mature on December 15, 2024, bear interest at the rate of 4.75% per annum and are payable semi-annually in arrears on June 15 and December 15 of each year.\nU.S. dollar-denominated 4.875% Senior Notes due 2026\nIn October 2017, Operating Company completed a private offering of the USD 2026 Notes. The USD 2026 Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed, jointly and severally, by all of the wholly owned U.S. subsidiaries of Operating Company that guarantee its senior secured credit facilities. The USD 2026 Notes were offered in the United States to qualified institutional buyers in reliance on Rule 144A under the Securities Act and outside the United States only to non-U.S. investors pursuant to Regulation S under the Securities Act. The USD 2026 Notes will mature on January 15, 2026, bear interest at the rate of 4.875% per annum, and are payable semi-annually in arrears on January 15 and July 15 of each year, beginning on July 15, 2018. The net proceeds of the USD 2026 Notes, after payment of the initial purchasers' discount and related fees and expenses, were used to fund a portion of the consideration for the Catalent Indiana acquisition due at its closing.\nU.S. dollar-denominated 5.00% Senior Notes due 2027\nIn June 2019, Operating Company completed a private offering of the USD 2027 Notes. The USD 2027 Notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed, jointly and severally, by all of the wholly owned U.S. subsidiaries of Operating Company that guarantee its senior secured credit facilities. The USD 2027 Notes were offered in the United States to qualified institutional buyers in reliance on Rule 144A under the Securities Act and outside the United States only to non-U.S. investors pursuant to Regulation S under the Securities Act. The USD 2027 Notes will mature on July 15, 2027, bear interest at the rate of 5.00% per annum, and are payable semi-annually in arrears on January 15 and July 15 of each year, beginning on January 15, 2020. The net proceeds of the USD 2027 Notes, after payment of the initial purchasers' discount and related fees and expenses, were used to repay in full the outstanding borrowings under Operating Company's then-outstanding U.S. dollar-denominated term loans that mature in May 2024 under its senior secured credit facilities, plus any accrued and unpaid interest thereon and provide cash on its balance sheet for general corporate purposes.\nDeferred Purchase Consideration\nIn connection with the acquisition of Catalent Indiana in October 2017, $200.0 million of the $950.0 million aggregate nominal purchase price was payable in four annual $50.0 million installments. We paid the first annual installment in October 2018. The remainder of the deferred purchase consideration is recorded at fair value, with the difference between the remaining nominal amount and the fair value balance deemed to be imputed interest.\nBridge Loan Facility\nIn September 2017, contemporaneous with execution of the agreement to acquire Catalent Indiana, Operating Company entered into a debt commitment letter with several financial institutions as commitment parties. Pursuant to the debt commitment letter and subject to its terms and conditions, the commitment parties agreed to provide a senior unsecured bridge loan facility of up to $700.0 million in the aggregate for the purpose of providing any back-up financing necessary to fund a portion of the consideration to be paid in the acquisition and related fees, costs, and expenses (the Bridge Loan Commitment\u201d). In connection with entering into the Bridge Loan Commitment, Operating Company incurred $6.1 million of associated fees, which was recorded in prepaid expenses and other in the consolidated balance sheet as of the end of first quarter of fiscal 2018. Operating Company did not draw on the facility contemplated by the Bridge Loan Commitment to fund the acquisition, and the facility was closed. We expensed the $6.1 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 as part of other income, net.\nDebt Covenants\nSenior Secured Credit Facilities\nThe Credit Agreement contains a number of covenants that, among other things, restrict, subject to certain exceptions, Operating Company's (and Operating Company's restricted subsidiaries') ability to incur additional indebtedness or issue certain preferred shares; create liens on assets; engage in mergers and consolidations; sell assets; pay dividends and distributions or repurchase capital stock; repay subordinated indebtedness; engage in certain transactions with affiliates; make investments, loans, or advances; make certain acquisitions; enter into sale and leaseback transactions; amend material agreements governing Operating Company's subordinated indebtedness; and change Operating Company's lines of business.\nThe Credit Agreement also contains change-of-control provisions and certain customary affirmative covenants and events of default. The Revolving Credit Facility requires compliance with a net leverage covenant when there is a 30% or more draw outstanding at a period end. As of June 30, 2019, Operating Company was in compliance with all material covenants under the Credit Agreement.\nSubject to certain exceptions, the Credit Agreement permits Operating Company and its restricted subsidiaries to incur certain additional indebtedness, including secured indebtedness. None of Operating Company's non-U.S. subsidiaries or Puerto Rico subsidiaries is a guarantor of the loans.\nUnder the Credit Agreement, Operating Company's ability to engage in certain activities such as incurring certain additional indebtedness, making certain investments, and paying certain dividends is tied to ratios based on Adjusted EBITDA (which is defined as Consolidated EBITDA\u201d in the Credit Agreement). Adjusted EBITDA is based on the definitions in the Credit Agreement, is not defined under U.S. GAAP, and is subject to important limitations.\nThe Euro Notes and the USD Notes\nThe several indentures governing each of the Euro Notes, the USD 2026 Notes and the USD 2027 Notes (collectively, the Indentures\u201d) contain certain covenants that, among other things, limit the ability of Operating Company and its restricted subsidiaries to incur or guarantee more debt or issue certain preferred shares; pay dividends on, repurchase, or make distributions in respect of their capital stock or make other restricted payments; make certain investments; sell certain assets; create liens; consolidate, merge, sell; or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of their assets; enter into certain transactions with their affiliates, and designate their subsidiaries as unrestricted subsidiaries. These covenants are subject to a number of exceptions, limitations, and qualifications as set forth in the Indentures. The Indentures also contain customary events of default including, but not limited to, nonpayment, breach of covenants, and payment or acceleration defaults in certain other indebtedness of Operating Company or certain of its subsidiaries. Upon an event of default, either the holders of at least 30% in principal amount of each of the then-outstanding Euro Notes, USD 2026 Notes, and the USD 2027 Notes, or the applicable Trustee under the Indentures, may declare the applicable Senior Notes immediately due and payable; or in certain circumstances, the applicable Senior Notes will become automatically immediately due and payable. As of June 30, 2019, Operating Company was in compliance with all material covenants under the Indentures.\nLiquidity in Foreign Subsidiaries\nAs of June 30, 2019 and June 30, 2018, the amounts of cash and cash equivalents held by foreign subsidiaries were $203.9 million and $124.7 million, respectively, out of the total consolidated cash and cash equivalents of $345.4 million and $410.2 million, respectively. These balances are dispersed across many international locations around the world.\nAdjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income per share\nThe below tables summarize our fiscal 2019 and 2018 results on several financial metrics we use to measure performance. Refer to the discussions below regarding performance and use of key financial metrics and to Non-GAAP Performance Metrics.\u201d\nAdjusted EBITDA\nUnder the Credit Agreement, the ability of Operating Company to engage in certain activities such as incurring certain additional indebtedness, making certain investments and paying certain dividends is tied to ratios based on Adjusted EBITDA (which is defined as Consolidated EBITDA\u201d in the Credit Agreement). Adjusted EBITDA is a covenant compliance measure in our Credit Agreement, particularly those covenants governing debt incurrence and restricted payments. Adjusted EBITDA is not defined under U.S. GAAP and is subject to important limitations. Because not all companies use identical calculations, our presentation of Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies.\nThe measure under U.S. GAAP most directly comparable to EBITDA from operations and Adjusted EBITDA is earnings/(loss) from operations. In calculating Adjusted EBITDA, we add back certain non-cash, non-recurring and other items that are\nincluded in the definitions of EBITDA from operations and consolidated net income, as required in the Credit Agreement. Adjusted EBITDA, among other things:\n\u2022does not include non-cash stock-based employee compensation expense and certain other non-cash charges;\n\u2022does not include cash and non-cash restructuring, severance and relocation costs incurred to realize future cost savings and enhance our operations;\n\u2022adds back non-controlling interest expense, which represents minority investors' ownership of certain of our consolidated subsidiaries and is, therefore, not available to us; and\n\u2022includes estimated cost savings that have not yet been fully reflected in our results.\nA reconciliation between net earnings and Adjusted EBITDA, which also shows the adjustments from EBITDA from operations, follows:\nTable 23: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Twelve Months Ended </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In millions) </td> <td>June 30, 2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>June 30, 2018 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net earnings </td> <td>$ </td> <td>137.4 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>83.6 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense, net </td> <td>110.9 </td> <td> </td> <td>111.4 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax expense (1)\n</td> <td>22.9 </td> <td> </td> <td>68.4 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization </td> <td>228.6 </td> <td> </td> <td>190.1 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>EBITDA from operations </td> <td>499.8 </td> <td> </td> <td>453.5 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Equity compensation </td> <td>33.3 </td> <td> </td> <td>27.2 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impairment charges and (gain)/loss on sale of assets </td> <td>5.1 </td> <td> </td> <td>8.7 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Financing-related expenses and other </td> <td>15.9 </td> <td> </td> <td>11.8 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>U.S. GAAP restructuring and other </td> <td>14.1 </td> <td> </td> <td>10.2 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Acquisition, integration, and other special items </td> <td>43.6 </td> <td> </td> <td>44.1 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Foreign exchange loss/(gain) (included in other, net) (2)\n</td> <td>0.5 </td> <td> </td> <td>(5.0) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other adjustments (3)\n</td> <td>(12.7) </td> <td> </td> <td>0.2 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted EBITDA (4)\n</td> <td>$ </td> <td>599.6 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>550.7 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>FX impact (unfavorable) </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(10.2) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted EBITDA - constant currency </td> <td>$ </td> <td>609.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) Represents the amount of income tax-related expense recorded within our net earnings/(loss) that may not result in cash payment or receipt.\n(2) Foreign exchange loss of $0.5 million for the twelve months ended June 30, 2019 includes: (a) $5.4 million of unrealized losses related to foreign trade receivables and payables, (b) $3.4 million of unrealized losses on the unhedged portion of the euro-denominated debt, and (c) $17.9 million of unrealized losses on inter-company loans. The foreign exchange adjustment was also affected by the exclusion of realized foreign currency exchange rate gains from the settlement of inter-company loans of $21.5 million. Inter-company loans are between our subsidiaries and do not reflect the ongoing results of our trade operations.\nForeign exchange gain of $5.0 million for the twelve months ended June 30, 2018 includes: (a) $2.9 million of unrealized gains related to foreign trade receivables and payables, (b) $11.9 million of unrealized losses on the unhedged portion of the euro-denominated debt, and (c) $10.7 million of unrealized losses on inter-company loans. The foreign exchange adjustment was also affected by the exclusion of realized foreign currency exchange rate gains from the settlement of inter-company loans of $24.7 million. Inter-company loans are between our subsidiaries and do not reflect the ongoing results of our trade operations.\n(3) Represents primarily the $12.9 million gain recorded on the change in the estimated fair value of the derivative liability from issuance through June 30, 2019.\n(4) In our earnings releases for the quarters ended September 30, 2018, December 31, 2018, and March 31, 2019, we included an adjustment in the three months ended September 30, 2018 relating to a cumulative effect of change in accounting for ASC 606. We are no longer making this adjustment in our presentation of Adjusted EBITDA.\nAdjusted Net Income and Adjusted Net Income per share\nWe use Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Net Income per share (which we sometimes refer to as Adjusted EPS\u201d) as performance metrics. Adjusted Net Income is not defined under U.S. GAAP, is not a measure of operating income, operating performance, or liquidity presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP and is subject to important limitations. We believe that the presentations of Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Net Income per share enhance an investor's understanding of our financial performance. We believe this measure is a useful financial metric to assess our operating performance from period to period by excluding certain items that we believe are not representative of our core business, and we use this measure for business planning and executive compensation purposes. We define Adjusted Net Income as net earnings/(loss) adjusted for (1) earnings or loss from discontinued operations, net of tax, (2) amortization attributable to purchase accounting, and (3) income or loss from non-controlling interest in majority-owned operations. We also make adjustments for other cash and non-cash items included in the table below, partially offset by our estimate of the tax effects as a result of such cash and non-cash items. Our definition of Adjusted Net Income may not be the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies. Adjusted Net Income per share is computed by dividing Adjusted Net Income by the weighted average diluted shares outstanding.\nTable 24: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Twelve Months Ended </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In millions, except per share data) </td> <td>June 30, 2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>June 30, 2018 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net earnings </td> <td>$ </td> <td>137.4 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>83.6 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization (1)\n</td> <td>88.2 </td> <td> </td> <td>62.6 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Equity compensation </td> <td>33.3 </td> <td> </td> <td>27.2 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impairment charges and (gain)/loss on sale of assets </td> <td>5.1 </td> <td> </td> <td>8.7 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Financing-related expenses </td> <td>15.9 </td> <td> </td> <td>11.8 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>U.S. GAAP restructuring and other </td> <td>14.1 </td> <td> </td> <td>10.2 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Acquisition, integration, and other special items </td> <td>43.6 </td> <td> </td> <td>44.1 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Foreign exchange loss/(gain) (included in other, net) (2)\n</td> <td>0.5 </td> <td> </td> <td>(5.0) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other adjustments </td> <td>(12.7) </td> <td> </td> <td>0.2 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Estimated tax effect of adjustments (3)\n</td> <td>(42.5) </td> <td> </td> <td>(43.5) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Discrete income tax (benefit)/expense items (4)\n</td> <td>(14.5) </td> <td> </td> <td>(9.4) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Tax law changes provision (5)\n</td> <td>(3.5) </td> <td> </td> <td>42.5 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted net income (ANI) (6)\n</td> <td>$ </td> <td>264.9 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>233.0 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Weighted average shares outstanding </td> <td>144.2 </td> <td> </td> <td>131.2 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Weighted average diluted shares outstanding </td> <td>146.0 </td> <td> </td> <td>133.2 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>ANI per share: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>ANI per basic share </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1.84 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1.78 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>ANI per diluted share </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1.81 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1.75 </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) Represents the amortization attributable to purchase accounting for previously completed business combinations.\n(2) Foreign exchange gain of $0.5 million for the twelve months ended June 30, 2019 includes: (a) $5.4 million of unrealized losses related to foreign trade receivables and payables, (b) $3.4 million of unrealized losses on the unhedged portion of the euro-denominated debt, and (c) $17.9 million of unrealized losses on inter-company loans. The foreign exchange adjustment was also affected by the exclusion of realized foreign currency exchange rate gains from the settlement of inter-company loans of $21.5 million. Inter-company loans are between our subsidiaries and do not reflect the ongoing results of our trade operations.\nForeign exchange loss for the twelve months ended June 30, 2018 includes: (a) $2.9 million of unrealized gains related to foreign trade receivables and payables, (b) $11.9 million of unrealized losses on the unhedged portion of the euro-denominated debt, and (c) $10.7 million of unrealized gains on inter-company loans. The foreign exchange adjustment was also affected by the exclusion of realized foreign currency exchange rate losses from the settlement of inter-company loans of $1.8 million. Inter-company loans are between our subsidiaries and do not reflect the ongoing results of our trade operations.\n(3) We computed the tax effect of adjustments to Adjusted Net Income by applying the statutory tax rate in the jurisdictions to the income or expense items that are adjusted in the period presented; if a valuation allowance exists, the rate applied is zero.\n(4) Discrete period income tax expense/(benefit) items are unusual or infrequently occurring items primarily including: changes in judgment related to the realizability of deferred tax assets in future years, changes in measurement of a prior year tax position, deferred tax impact of changes in tax law, and purchase accounting.\n(5) During fiscal 2018, we recorded a net tax charge of $42.5 million as a provisional estimate of the net accounting impact of the 2017 Tax Act. In fiscal 2019, we completed our analysis, as permitted by Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118, and recorded a reduction of $3.5 million.\n(6) In our earnings releases for the quarters ended September 30, 2018, December 31, 2018, and March 31, 2019, we included an adjustment in the three months ended September 30, 2018 relating to a cumulative effect of change in accounting for ASC 606. We are no longer making this adjustment in our presentation of Adjusted Net Income.\nInterest Rate Risk Management\nA portion of the debt used to finance our operations is exposed to interest-rate fluctuations. We may use various hedging strategies and derivative financial instruments to create an appropriate mix of fixed-and floating-rate assets and liabilities. Historically, we have used interest-rate swaps to manage the economic effect of variable rate interest obligations associated with our floating-rate term loans so that the interest payable on the term loans effectively becomes fixed at a certain rate, thereby reducing the impact of future interest-rate changes on our future interest expense. As of June 30, 2019, we did not have any interest-rate swap agreement in place that would have the economic effect of modifying the variable interest obligations associated with our floating-rate term loans.\nCurrency Risk Management\nWe are exposed to fluctuations in the euro-U.S. dollar exchange rate on our investments in our foreign operations in Europe. While we do not actively hedge against changes in foreign currency, we have mitigated the exposure of our investments in our European operations by denominating a portion of our debt in euros. At June 30, 2019, we had $775.1 million of euro-denominated debt outstanding that qualifies as a hedge of a net investment in foreign operations. Refer to Note 9 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of net investment hedge activity in the period.\nFrom time to time, we may use forward currency exchange contracts to manage our exposure to the variability of cash flows primarily related to the foreign exchange rate changes of future foreign currency transaction costs. In addition, we may use foreign currency forward contracts to protect the value of existing foreign currency assets and liabilities. Currently, we do not use foreign currency exchange contracts. We expect to continue to evaluate hedging opportunities for foreign currency in the future.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations as of June 30, 2019:\nTable 25: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Dollars in millions)(1)\n</td> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>Fiscal 2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>Fiscal 2021 - Fiscal 2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>Fiscal 2023 - Fiscal 2024 </td> <td> </td> <td>Thereafter </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long-term debt obligations (2)\n</td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,823.6 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>59.7 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>123.9 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>357.2 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,282.8 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest on long-term obligations (3)\n</td> <td>897.8 </td> <td> </td> <td>133.4 </td> <td> </td> <td>252.6 </td> <td> </td> <td>246.8 </td> <td> </td> <td>265.0 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capital lease obligations (4)\n</td> <td>167.3 </td> <td> </td> <td>5.3 </td> <td> </td> <td>10.4 </td> <td> </td> <td>13.4 </td> <td> </td> <td>138.2 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating lease obligations (5)\n</td> <td>58.2 </td> <td> </td> <td>12.2 </td> <td> </td> <td>19.2 </td> <td> </td> <td>15.9 </td> <td> </td> <td>10.9 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Purchase obligations (6)\n</td> <td>79.4 </td> <td> </td> <td>67.1 </td> <td> </td> <td>10.0 </td> <td> </td> <td>2.3 </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other long-term liabilities (7)\n</td> <td>64.2 </td> <td> </td> <td>5.7 </td> <td> </td> <td>8.7 </td> <td> </td> <td>7.7 </td> <td> </td> <td>42.1 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,090.5 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>283.4 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>424.8 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>643.3 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,739.0 </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) Estimated future payments with respect to our obligations and other liabilities denominated in a currency other than the U.S. dollar were calculated using the currency exchange rates in effect as of June 30, 2019.\n(2) Represents gross maturities of our long-term debt obligations, excluding capital lease obligations as of June 30, 2019.\n(3) Represents estimated interest payments relating to our long-term obligations, including our capital lease obligations.

Purchase obligations disclosed above may include estimates of the period in which cash outflows will occur. Purchase orders entered into in the normal course of business and authorizations to purchase that involve no firm commitment from either party are excluded from the above table. In addition, contracts that can be unilaterally canceled with no termination fee or with proper notice are excluded from our total purchase obligations except for the amount of the termination fee or the minimum amount of goods that must be purchased during the requisite notice period.\n(7) Primarily relates to certain long-term employee-related liabilities for operations under programs that we have discontinued.\nThe table excludes our retirement and other post-employment benefits ( OPEB\u201d) obligations. The timing and amount of payments for these obligations may be affected by a number of factors, including the funded status of the plans. In fiscal 2020, we are not required to make contributions to our plans to satisfy regulatory funding standards. Beyond fiscal 2020, the actual amounts required to be contributed are dependent upon, among other things, interest rates, underlying asset returns, and the impact of legislative or regulatory actions related to pension funding obligations. Payments due under our OPEB plans are not required to be funded in advance but are generally paid as medical costs are incurred by covered retiree populations and principally depend on the future cost of retiree medical benefits under our plans. Refer to Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.\nThe table also excludes $22.6 million of funded deferred compensation payments owed as of June 30, 2019 to certain employees participating in our deferred compensation plan. The timing and amount of payments for these obligations depend on participant-directed distributions, withdrawals, and status. As part of the deferred compensation plan, we have a corresponding $21.9 million of deferred compensation investments as of June 30, 2019, which will be used to fund future obligations to the participants.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nOther than operating leases and outstanding letters of credit as discussed above, we do not have any material off-balance sheet arrangement as of June 30, 2019.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with Item 6. Selected Financial Data\u201d and our Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes, which appear elsewhere in this Annual Report. In addition to historical consolidated financial information, the following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates, and beliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. You should carefully read Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d in this Annual Report. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those discussed below and elsewhere in this Annual Report, particularly in Item 1A. Risk Factors.\u201d\nOverview\nWe are the leading global provider of advanced delivery technologies and development solutions for drugs, biologics, and consumer health products. Our oral, injectable, and respiratory delivery technologies provide delivery solutions across the full diversity of the pharmaceutical industry, including small molecules, protein and gene therapy biologics, and consumer health products. Through our extensive capabilities and deep expertise in product development, we help our customers take products to market faster, including nearly half of new drug products approved by the FDA in the last decade. Our advanced delivery technology platforms, which include those in our Softgel Technologies, Biologics and Specialty Drug Delivery, and Oral Drug Delivery segments, our proven formulation, manufacturing, and regulatory expertise, and our broad and deep intellectual property enable our customers to develop more products and better treatments for patients and consumers. Across both development and delivery, our commitment to reliably supply our customers' and their patients' needs is the foundation for the value we provide; annually, we produce approximately 73 billion doses for nearly 7,000 customer products, or approximately 1 in every 20 doses of such products taken each year by patients and consumers around the world. We believe that, through our investments in growth-enabling capacity and capabilities, our ongoing focus on operational and quality excellence, the sales of existing customer products, the introduction of new customer products, our innovation activities and patents, and our entry into new markets, we will continue to benefit from attractive and differentiated margins and realize the growth potential from these areas.\nOur Reportable Segments\nWe currently operate in four operating segments, which also constitute our four reporting segments: Softgel Technologies, Biologics and Specialty Drug Delivery, Oral Drug Delivery, and Clinical Supply Services.\nEach of our segments reports through a separate management team. Our offerings and services are summarized below by reporting segment.\nSoftgel Technologies\nThrough our Softgel Technologies segment, we provide formulation, development, and manufacturing services for soft capsules, or softgels,\u201d which our predecessor first commercialized in the 1930s and which we have continually enhanced. We are the market leader in overall softgel development and manufacturing and hold the leading market position in the prescription arena. Our principal softgel technologies include traditional softgel capsules, in which the shell is made of animal-derived gelatin, and Vegicaps and OptiShell capsules, in which the shell is made from plant-derived materials. Softgel capsules are used in a broad range of customer products, including prescription drugs, over-the-counter medications, dietary supplements, unit-dose cosmetics, and animal health medicinal preparations. Softgel capsules encapsulate liquid, paste, or oil-based active compounds in solution or suspension within an outer shell. In the manufacturing process, the capsules are formed, filled, and sealed simultaneously. We typically perform encapsulation for a product within one of our softgel facilities, with active ingredients provided by customers or sourced directly by us. Softgels have historically been used to solve formulation challenges or technical issues for a specific drug, to help improve the clinical performance of compounds, to provide important market differentiation, particularly for over-the-counter medications, and to provide safe handling of hormonal, potent, and cytotoxic drugs. We also participate in the softgel vitamin, mineral, and supplement business in selected regions around the world. With the 2001 introduction of our plant-derived softgel shell, Vegicaps capsules, consumer health customers have been able to extend the softgel dose form to a broader range of active ingredients and serve patient/consumer populations that were previously inaccessible due to religious, dietary, or cultural preferences. In recent years, we have extended this platform to pharmaceutical products via our OptiShell capsule offering. Our Vegicaps and OptiShell capsules are protected by patents in most major global markets. Physician and patient studies we have conducted have demonstrated a preference for softgels versus traditional tablet and hard capsule dose forms in terms of ease of swallowing, real or perceived speed of delivery, ability to remove or eliminate unpleasant odor or taste, and, for physicians, perceived improved patient adherence with dosing regimens. Representative customers of Softgel Technologies include Pfizer, Novartis, Bayer, GlaxoSmithKline, Teva, Johnson & Johnson, Procter & Gamble, and Allergan.\nAs of June 30, 2019, we had eleven Softgel Technologies manufacturing facilities in nine countries, including three in North America, three in Europe, three in South America, and two in the Asia-Pacific region, as well as additional sales offices. Our Softgel Technologies segment represents 34% of our aggregate revenue for fiscal 2019 before inter-segment eliminations.\nBiologics and Specialty Drug Delivery\nOur Biologics and Specialty Drug Delivery segment provides drug substance development and manufacturing, drug product clinical and commercial manufacturing, integrated clinical and commercial supply solutions for protein and gene therapy biologics, and specialty small molecules administered via injection, inhalation, and ophthalmic routes, using both traditional and advanced delivery technologies. The business has extensive expertise in development, scale up, and commercial manufacturing. Representative customers of Biologics and Specialty Drug Delivery include Eli Lilly, Teva, Mylan, Roche, Novartis, Sarepta, and Genentech, along with multiple innovative small and mid-tier pharmaceutical and biologics customers.\nOur growing biologics offering includes cell-line development based on our advanced and patented GPEx technology, which is used to develop stable, high-yielding mammalian cell lines for both innovator and biosimilar biologic compounds. GPEx technology can provide rapid cell-line development, high biologics production yields, flexibility, and versatility. Our development and manufacturing facility in Madison, Wisconsin has the capability and capacity to produce cGMP quality biologics drug substance from 250L to 4000L scale using single-use technology to provide maximum efficiency and flexibility. Our fiscal 2018 acquisition of Catalent Indiana added a biologics-focused contract development and manufacturing organization with capabilities across biologics development, clinical, and commercial drug substance manufacturing, formulation, finished-dose drug product manufacturing, and packaging. In fiscal 2019, we continued to expand production capacity in both Madison and Bloomington, Indiana, starting construction on fourth and fifth drug substance suites in Madison and new drug product manufacturing and packaging capacity in Bloomington. Our SMARTag next-generation antibody-drug conjugate technology enables development of antibody-drug conjugates and other protein conjugates with improved efficacy, safety, and manufacturability. In fiscal 2019, we launched our OneBio Suite, which provides customers the potential to seamlessly integrate drug substance, drug product, and clinical supply management for products in development, and for integrated commercial supply across both drug substance and product. We provide the broadest range of technologies and services supporting the development and launch of new biologic entities, biosimilars, and biobetters to bring a product from gene to commercialization, faster.\nOn May 17, 2019, we acquired Paragon, which is focused on the development and manufacture of cutting-edge biopharmaceuticals, including viral vectors used in gene therapies. For over 25 years, Paragon has partnered with some of the world's leading biotech and pharma companies to develop and manufacture products based on transformative technologies, including gene therapies based on AAV and other modalities, next-generation vaccines, oncology immunotherapies (oncolytic viruses and CAR-T cell therapies), therapeutic proteins, and other complex biologics. Paragon brings specialized expertise in AAV vectors, the most commonly used delivery system for gene therapy, as well as capabilities in plasmids and lentivirus vectors manufactured using cGMP. By adding Paragon's specialized expertise in AAV vectors, we believe we are positioned to capitalize on strong industry tailwinds in the market for gene therapies. Paragon also brings to Catalent its differentiated scientific, development, and manufacturing capabilities, which we believe will fundamentally enhance our biologics business and end-to-end integrated biopharmaceutical solutions for customers. In June 2019, Paragon agreed to acquire two additional laboratory and manufacturing facilities located in southern Maryland from Novavax, Inc. The Novavax transaction closed in late July 2019.\nOur range of injectable manufacturing offerings includes filling small molecules or biologics into pre-filled syringes, cartridges, and vials, with flexibility to accommodate other formats within our existing network, increasingly focused on complex pharmaceuticals and biologics. With our range of technologies, we are able to meet a wide range of specifications, timelines, and budgets. We believe that the complexity of the manufacturing process, the importance of experience and know-how, regulatory compliance, and high start-up capital requirements provide us with a substantial competitive advantage in the market. For example, blow-fill-seal is an advanced aseptic processing technology, which uses a continuous process to form, fill with drug or biologic, and seal a plastic container in a sterile environment. Blow-fill-seal units are currently used for a variety of pharmaceuticals in liquid form, such as respiratory, ophthalmic, and otic products. Our sterile blow-fill-seal manufacturing has significant capacity and flexibility in manufacturing configurations. This business provides flexible and scalable solutions for unit-dose delivery of complex formulations such as suspensions and emulsions. Further, the business provides engineering and manufacturing solutions related to complex containers. Our regulatory expertise can lead to decreased time to commercialization, and our dedicated development production lines support feasibility, stability, and clinical runs. We plan to continue to expand our product line in existing and new markets, and in higher margin specialty products with additional respiratory, ophthalmic, injectable, and nasal applications.\nWe also offer bioanalytical development and testing services for large molecules, including cGMP release and stability testing. Our respiratory product capabilities include development and manufacturing services for inhaled products for delivery\nvia metered dose inhalers, dry powder inhalers, and intra-nasal sprays. Across multiple complex dosage forms, the segment provides drug and biologic solutions from early-stage development and clinical support all the way through to scale up and commercialization.\nAs of June 30, 2019, we had ten BSDD manufacturing facilities, including eight in North America and two in Europe. Our BSDD segment represents 29% of our aggregate revenue for fiscal 2019 before inter-segment eliminations.\nOral Drug Delivery\nOur Oral Drug Delivery segment provides various advanced formulation development and manufacturing technologies, and related integrated solutions including: clinical development and commercial manufacturing of a broad range of oral dose forms, including our proprietary fast-dissolve Zydis tablets and both conventional immediate and controlled-release tablets, capsules, and sachet products. Representative customers of Oral Drug Delivery include Pfizer, Johnson & Johnson, Bayer, Novartis, and Perrigo.\nWe provide comprehensive pre-formulation, development, and cGMP manufacturing at both clinical and commercial scales for traditional and advanced complex oral solid-dose formats, including coated and uncoated tablets, pellet/bead/powder-filled two-piece hard capsules, granulated powders, and other forms of immediate and modified release branded prescription, generic, and consumer products. We have substantial experience developing and scaling up products requiring accelerated development timelines, solubility enhancement, specialized handling (e.g., potent or DEA-regulated materials), complex technology transfers, and specialized manufacturing processes. We also provide micronization and particle engineering services, which may enhance a drug's manufacturability or clinical performance. We offer comprehensive analytical testing and scientific services and stability testing for small molecules, both to support integrated development programs and on a fee-for-service basis. We provide global regulatory and support services for our customers' clinical strategies during all stages of development. In recent years, we have expanded our network of development sites focused on earlier phase compounds, to engage with more customer molecules, earlier, with the intent to provide later stage manufacturing and supporting services as those molecules progress towards commercial approval and beyond. Demand for our offerings is driven by the need for scientific expertise and depth and breadth of services offered, as well as by the reliability of our supply, including quality, execution, and performance.\nWe launched our orally dissolving tablet business in 1986 with the introduction of Zydis tablets, a unique proprietary freeze-dried tablet that typically dissolves in the mouth, without water, in less than three seconds. Most often used for drugs and patient groups that can benefit from rapid oral disintegration, we can adapt the Zydis technology to a wide range of products and indications, including treatments for a variety of central nervous system-related conditions such as migraines, Parkinson's disease, and schizophrenia, and consumer healthcare products targeting indications such as pain and allergy relief. We continue to develop Zydis tablets in different formats with our customers as we extend the application of the technology to new therapeutic categories, including immunotherapy, vaccines, and biologic molecule delivery.\nAs of June 30, 2019, we had nine ODD manufacturing facilities, including four in North America and five in Europe. Our ODD segment represents 24% of our aggregate revenue for fiscal 2019 before inter-segment eliminations.\nClinical Supply Services\nOur Clinical Supply Services segment provides manufacturing, packaging, storage, distribution, project management, and inventory management for drugs and biologics in clinical trials. We offer customers flexible solutions for clinical supplies production and provide distribution and inventory management support for both simple and complex clinical trials. This includes over-encapsulation where needed; supplying placebos, comparator drug procurement, and clinical packages and kits for physicians and patients; inventory management; investigator kit ordering and fulfillment; and return supply reconciliation and reporting. We support trials in all regions of the world through our facilities and distribution network. In fiscal 2018, we completed the second phase of our expansion program in our Kansas City, Missouri facility. Further, in fiscal 2016 and again in fiscal 2018, we expanded our Singapore facility by building additional flexible cGMP space, and we introduced clinical supply services at our existing 100,000 square foot facility in Japan, expanding our Asia-Pacific capabilities. Additionally, in fiscal 2013, we established our first clinical supply services facility in China as a joint venture, assumed full ownership in fiscal 2015, and opened a second facility in China in fiscal 2019. We are the leading provider of integrated development solutions and one of the leading providers of clinical trial supplies. Representative customers of Clinical Supply Services include Merck KGaA, IQVIA, Eli Lilly, AbbVie, and Incyte Corporation.\nAs of June 30, 2019, we had nine Clinical Supply Service facilities, including two in North America, three in Europe, and four in the Asia-Pacific region. Our Clinical Supply Services segment represents 13% of our aggregate revenue for fiscal 2019 before inter-segment eliminations.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Recent Accounting Pronouncements\nThe following disclosure supplements the descriptions of our accounting policies contained in Note 1 to our Consolidated Financial Statements in regard to significant areas of judgment. Management made certain estimates and assumptions during the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities in the Consolidated Financial Statements. These estimates also affect the reported amount of net earnings during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Because of the size of the financial statement elements to which they relate, some of our accounting policies and estimates have a more significant impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements than others.\nManagement has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors. A discussion of some of our more significant accounting policies and estimates follows.\nRevenue\nWe sell products and services directly to our pharmaceutical, biotechnology, and consumer health customers. The majority of our business is conducted through manufacturing and commercial product supply, development services, and clinical supply services. On July 1, 2018, we adopted Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), codified as Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC\u201d) 606, using the modified retrospective method of adoption. Prior period amounts have not been restated and continue to be reported in accordance with our historical accounting policies. For discussion on the impact of adopting ASC 606 on our accounting, refer to Note 1 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nOur contracts with customers often include promises to transfer multiple products and services to a customer. Determining whether products and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately versus together may require judgment. For our manufacturing and commercial product supply revenue, the contract generally includes the terms of the manufacturing services and related product quality assurance procedures to comply with regulatory requirements. Due to the regulated nature of our business, these contract terms are highly interdependent and, therefore, are considered to be a single combined performance obligation. For our development services and clinical supply services revenue, our performance obligations vary per contract and are accounted for as separate performance obligations. If a contract contains a single performance obligation, we allocate the entire transaction price to the single performance obligation. If a contract contains multiple performance obligations, we allocate consideration to each performance obligation using the relative standalone selling price\u201d as defined under ASC 606. Generally, we utilize observable standalone selling prices in our allocations of consideration. If observable standalone selling prices are not available, we estimate the applicable standalone selling price using an adjusted market assessment approach, representing the amount that we believe the market is willing to pay for the applicable service. Revenue is recognized over time using an appropriate method of measuring progress towards fulfilling our performance obligation for the respective arrangement. Determining the measure of progress that consistently depicts our satisfaction of performance obligations within each of our revenue streams across similar arrangements requires judgment.\nLicensing revenue\nWe occasionally enter into arrangements with customers that include licensing of functional intellectual property, including drug formulae, or other intangible property ( out-licensing\u201d). We do not have any material license arrangement that contains more than one performance obligation. Our out-licensing generally entitles us to nonrefundable, up-front fees or royalties. Nonrefundable, up-front license fees are recognized as revenue when the licensed property is made available for the customer's use and benefit, provided there is no unsatisfied performance obligation included in the arrangement. Royalty payments from such arrangements are recognized when subsequent sale or usage of an item subject to the royalty occurs and the performance obligation to which royalty relates is satisfied.\nLong-lived and Other Definite-Lived Intangible Assets\nWe allocate the cost of an acquired company to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets and liabilities acquired, with the remaining amount being recorded as goodwill. Intangible assets primarily include customer relationships and trademarks. Valuing the identifiable intangible assets requires judgment. We applied a discounted cash flow model in measuring the customer relationships in relation to the Paragon acquisition, which included certain assumptions such as revenue growth, forecasted revenue and related margin, and customer contract attrition and renewal rates. Intangibles assets are generally amortized on a straight-line basis, reflecting the pattern in which the economic benefits are consumed, and are amortized over their estimated useful lives.\nWe assess the impairment of identifiable intangibles if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying values of the assets may not be recoverable. Factors that we consider important that could trigger an impairment review include the following:\n\u2022significant under-performance relative to historical or projected future operating results;\n\u2022significant changes in the manner of use of the acquired assets or the strategy of the overall business;\n\u2022significant negative industry or economic trends; and\n\u2022recognition of goodwill impairment charges.\nIf we determine that the carrying value of intangibles and/or long-lived assets may not be recoverable based on the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment, we measure recoverability of assets by comparing the respective carrying values of the assets to the current and expected future cash flows, on an un-discounted basis, to be generated from such assets. If such analysis indicates that the carrying value of these assets is not recoverable, we measure any impairment based on the amount in which the net carrying amounts of the assets exceed the fair values of the assets. See Notes 5 and 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nGoodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets\nWe account for purchased goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives in accordance with ASC 350, Intangible and Other Assets. Under ASC 350, goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized, but instead are tested for impairment at least annually. We perform an impairment evaluation of goodwill annually during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year or when circumstances otherwise indicate an evaluation should be performed. The evaluation may begin with a qualitative assessment for each reporting unit to determine whether it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value. If the qualitative assessment does not generate a positive response, or if no qualitative assessment is performed, a quantitative assessment, based upon discounted cash flows, is performed and requires management to estimate future cash flows, growth rates, and economic and market conditions. In fiscal 2017 and 2018, we proceeded immediately to the quantitative assessment, but in fiscal 2019 we began with the qualitative assessment, which was sufficient to find no impairment. The 2018 and 2017 evaluations also resulted in no impairment charge.\nSee Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nSeries A Preferred Stock Dividend Adjustment Feature\nThe terms of the Series A Preferred Stock include a dividend adjustment feature to provide the holder with certain protections against a decline in the trading price of our Common Stock. Because this adjustment feature depends in part on the value of external metrics at future dates, over which we have no control, this feature is accounted for separately from the Series A Preferred Stock. The derivative instrument is measured at fair value, as of the valuation date, using a combination of (i) a Monte Carlo simulation and (ii) a binomial lattice model, which incorporates the terms and conditions of the Series A Preferred Stock and is based on changes in the market prices of shares of our Common Stock over successive periods. Key assumptions used in both models include the current market price of one share of the Common Stock and its historical and expected volatility, risk-neutral interest rates, and the remaining term of the adjustment feature. These assumptions require significant management judgment and are considered Level 3 inputs. We recognize the derivative as either an asset or liability in the consolidated balance sheets at its fair value and revalue it as of the end of each quarterly reporting period; changes in the fair value are recognized in the consolidated statements of operations.\nIncome Taxes\nIn accordance with ASC 740 Income Taxes, we account for income taxes using the asset and liability method. The asset and liability method requires recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for expected future tax consequences of temporary differences that currently exist between tax bases and financial reporting bases of our assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in the respective jurisdictions in which we operate. Deferred taxes are not provided on the undistributed earnings of subsidiaries outside of the United States when it is expected that these earnings will be permanently reinvested. In fiscal 2018, we recorded a provision for U.S. income taxes and foreign withholding taxes in relation to expected repatriations as a result of the 2017 Tax Act, but we have not made any provision for U.S. income taxes on the remaining undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries as those earnings are considered permanently reinvested in the operations of those foreign subsidiaries in fiscal 2019.\nThe 2017 Tax Act imposed taxes with respect to so-called global intangible low-taxed income\u201d ( GILTI\u201d) earned by certain foreign subsidiaries of a U.S. company. In accordance with ASC 740, we made an accounting policy election to treat taxes due on future U.S. inclusions in taxable income related to GILTI as a current-period expense when incurred.\nWe had valuation allowances of $76.3 million and $86.2 million as of June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively, against our deferred tax assets. We considered all available evidence, both positive and negative, in assessing the need for a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets. We evaluated four possible sources of taxable income when assessing the realization of deferred tax assets:\n\u2022carrybacks of existing net operating losses (if permitted by tax law);\n\u2022future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences;\n\u2022tax planning strategies; and\n\u2022future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards.\nWe considered the need to maintain a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets based on management's assessment of whether it is more likely than not that we would realize those deferred tax assets based on future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences and the ability to generate sufficient taxable income within the carryforward period available under the applicable tax law. During the year ended June 30, 2019 we released $12.1 million of the valuation allowance related to certain U.S. combined states. Of the $12.1 million released, $0.5 million relates to state net operating loss ( NOLs\u201d) carryforwards, which expire over a number of years beginning in 2028, and $11.6 million relates to other state deferred tax temporary differences that will reduce income for state tax purposes in the future.\nWhile the valuation allowance related to certain U.S. combined states was partially released in the year ended June 30, 2019, a state valuation allowance of $35.1 million is maintained on state NOLs and deductible temporary differences for the separate and remaining combined states. The remaining state valuation allowance is due to our history of tax losses and anticipated loss utilization rates in separate filing status states as well as the difference in the rules related to allocated and apportioned income for separate filing status states versus combined filing status states.\nUnrecognized tax benefits are generated when there are differences between tax positions taken in a tax return and amounts recognized in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Tax benefits are recognized in the Consolidated Financial Statements when it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination. To the extent we prevail in matters for which liabilities have been established or are required to pay amounts in excess of our liabilities, our effective income tax rate in a given period could be materially affected. An unfavorable income tax settlement may require the use of cash and result in an increase in our effective income tax rate in the year it is resolved. A favorable income tax settlement would be recognized as a reduction in the effective income tax rate in the year of resolution. At June 30, 2019 and 2018, we recorded unrecognized tax benefits and related interest and penalties of $5.2 million and $4.1 million, respectively. We recognized no material adjustment in the liability for unrecognized income tax benefits during fiscal 2019.\nOur accounting for income taxes involves the application of complex tax regulations in the U.S. and in each of the non-US jurisdictions in which we operate. The determination of income subject to taxation in each tax paying jurisdiction requires us to review reported book income and the events occurring during the year in each jurisdiction in which we operate. In addition, the application of deferred tax assets and liabilities will have an effect on the tax expense in each jurisdiction. For those entities engaging in transactions with affiliates, we apply transfer pricing guidelines relevant in many jurisdictions in which we operate and make certain informed and reasonable assumptions and estimates about the relative value of contributions by affiliates when assessing the allocation of income and deductions between consolidated entities in different jurisdictions. Additionally, for taxes incurred outside the U.S., we are entitled, under the Internal Revenue Code as amended by the 2017 Tax Act and regulations promulgated thereunder, to claim U.S. foreign tax credits to offset certain tax liabilities arising in the U.S. Certain of the assumptions and allocations used in the determination of the key inputs underlying the foreign tax credits, particularly as they relate to the calculation of U.S. income taxes owed on GILTI, are based on recently issued regulatory guidance that does not necessarily address all elements needed to prepare the calculations and is therefore subject to considerable judgment.\nFactors Affecting our Performance\nFluctuations in Operating Results\nOur annual financial reporting periods end on June 30. Our revenue and net earnings are generally higher in the third and fourth quarters of each fiscal year, with our first fiscal quarter typically generating our lowest revenue of any quarter, and our last fiscal quarter typically generating our highest revenue. These fluctuations are primarily the result of the timing of our, and our customers', annual operational maintenance periods at locations in continental Europe and the U.K., the seasonality associated with pharmaceutical and biotechnology budgetary spending decisions, clinical trial and research and development schedules, the timing of new product launches and length of time needed to obtain full market penetration, and, to a lesser extent, the time of the year some of our customers' products are in higher demand.\nAcquisition and Related Integration Efforts\nOur growth and profitability are affected by the acquisitions we complete and the speed at which we integrate those acquisitions into our existing operating platforms. In fiscal 2018, we acquired Catalent Indiana in order to enhance our biologics capabilities, and it has been integrated into our Biologics and Specialty Drug Delivery segment. In fiscal 2019, we completed the acquisitions of Juniper, based in the U.K., in August 2018 and Paragon, based in the U.S., in May 2019, which have been integrated into our Oral Drug Delivery and Biologics and Specialty Drug Delivery segments, respectively.\nForeign Exchange Rates\nOur operating network is global, and, as a result, we have substantial revenues and operating expenses that are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, the currency in which we report our financial results, and are therefore influenced by changes in currency exchange rates. In fiscal 2019, approximately 48% of our revenue was generated from our operations outside the United States. Significant foreign currencies for our operations include the British pound, the euro, the Brazilian real, the Argentine peso, the Japanese yen, the Canadian dollar, and the Australian dollar.\nTrends Affecting Our Business\nIndustry\nWe participate in nearly every sector of the global pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry, which has been estimated to generate $1 trillion in annual revenue, including, but not limited to, the prescription drug and biologic sectors as well as consumer health, which includes the over-the-counter and vitamins and nutritional supplement sectors. Innovative pharmaceuticals continue to play a critical role in the global market, while the share of revenue due to generic drugs and biosimilars is increasing in both developed and developing markets. Sustained developed market demand and rapid growth in emerging economies is driving the consumer health product growth rate to more than double that for pharmaceuticals. Payors, both public and private, have sought to limit the economic impact of pharmaceutical and biologics product demand through greater use of generic and biosimilar drugs, access and spending controls, and health technology assessment techniques, favoring products that deliver truly differentiated outcomes.\nNew Molecule Development and R&D Sourcing\nContinued strengthening in early-stage development pipelines for drugs and biologics, compounded by increasing clinical trial breadth and complexity, support our belief in the attractive growth prospects for development solutions. Large companies are in many cases reconfiguring their R&D resources, increasingly involving the use of strategic partners for important outsourced functions. Additionally, an increasing portion of compounds in development are from companies that do not have a full research and development infrastructure, and thus are more likely to need strategic development solutions partners.\nDemographics\nAging population demographics in developed countries, combined with health care reforms in many global markets that are expanding access to treatments to a greater proportion of their populations, will continue to drive increases in demand for pharmaceuticals, biologics, and consumer health products. Increasing economic affluence in developing regions will further increase demand for healthcare treatments, and we are taking active steps to allow us to participate effectively in these growth regions and product categories.\nFinally, we believe the market access and payor pressures our customers face, global supply chain complexity, and the increasing demand for improved treatments will continue to escalate the need for product differentiation, improved outcomes, and treatment cost reduction, all of which can often be addressed using our advanced delivery technologies.\nNon-GAAP Performance Metrics\nAs described in this section, management uses various financial metrics, including certain metrics that are not based on concepts defined in U.S. GAAP, to measure and assess the performance of our business and to make critical business decisions. We therefore, believe that presentation of certain of these non-GAAP metrics in this Annual Report will aid investors in understanding our business performance.\nUse of EBITDA from operations\nManagement measures operating performance based on consolidated earnings from operations before interest expense, expense/(benefit) for income taxes and depreciation and amortization, adjusted for the income or loss attributable to non-controlling interests ( EBITDA from operations\u201d). EBITDA from operations is not defined under U.S. GAAP, is not a measure\nof operating income, operating performance, or liquidity presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and is subject to important limitations.\nWe believe that the presentation of EBITDA from operations enhances an investor's understanding of our financial performance. We believe this measure is a useful financial metric to assess our operating performance across periods and use this measure for business planning purposes. In addition, given the significant investments that we have made in the past in property, plant and equipment, depreciation and amortization expenses represent a meaningful portion of our cost structure. We believe that disclosing EBITDA from operations will provide investors with a useful tool for assessing the comparability between periods of our ability to generate cash from operations sufficient to pay taxes, to service debt, and to undertake capital expenditures without consideration of non-cash depreciation and amortization expense. We present EBITDA from operations in order to provide supplemental information that we consider relevant for the readers of the Consolidated Financial Statements, and such information is not meant to replace or supersede U.S. GAAP measures. Our definition of EBITDA from operations may not be the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies. The most directly comparable measure to EBITDA from operations defined under U.S. GAAP is earnings/(loss) from operations. Included in this Management's Discussion and Analysis is a reconciliation of earnings/(loss) from operations to EBITDA from operations.\nIn addition, we evaluate the performance of our segments based on segment earnings before non-controlling interest, other (income)/expense, impairments, restructuring costs, interest expense, income tax expense/(benefit), and depreciation and amortization ( Segment EBITDA\u201d).\nUse of Constant Currency\nAs exchange rates are an important factor in understanding period-to-period comparisons, we believe the presentation of results on a constant currency basis in addition to reported results helps improve investors' ability to understand our operating results and evaluate our performance in comparison to prior periods. Constant currency information compares results between periods as if exchange rates had remained constant period-over-period. We use results on a constant currency basis as one measure to evaluate our performance. In this Annual Report, we calculate constant currency by calculating current-year results using prior-year foreign currency exchange rates. We generally refer to such amounts calculated on a constant currency basis as excluding the impact of foreign exchange. These results should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, results reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Results on a constant currency basis, as we present them, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies and are not measures of performance presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\nSummary Two-Year Key Financial Performance Metrics\nThe below tables summarize our results in fiscal 2019 and 2018 on several financial metrics we use to measure performance. Refer to the discussions below regarding performance and the use of key financial metrics and -Non-GAAP Performance Metrics\u201d concerning the measurement of revenue at constant currency.\u201d\nFiscal Year Ended June 30, 2019 compared to the Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2018\nResults for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018 were as follows:\n\n*Percentage not meaningful\nNet Revenue\nNet revenue increased by $111.6 million, or 5%, in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018, excluding the impact of foreign exchange, primarily due to acquisitions. We acquired Paragon in May 2019, Juniper in August 2018, and Catalent Indiana in October 2017, which increased revenue by 7%, but the increase was partially offset by a reduction in revenue from comparator sourcing arrangements within our Clinical Supply Services segment of 4%. As a result of the adoption of ASC 606, we recorded comparator sourcing arrangements on a net basis versus a gross basis, resulting in a decrease in net revenue with no corresponding decrease to EBITDA. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, divestitures, and the change in accounting for comparator sourcing arrangements, revenue increased 2% primarily driven by increased net revenue within our Biologics and Specialty Drug Delivery segment.\nGross Margin\nGross margin increased by $68.4 million, or 9%, in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018, excluding the impact of foreign exchange, primarily due to increased sales volumes as a result of acquisitions discussed above. On a constant currency basis, gross margin, as a percentage of revenue, was 31.9% in the twelve months ended June 30, 2019, an increase from the prior year of 133 basis points, primarily as a result of the adoption of ASC 606, pursuant to which we record comparator sourcing arrangements on a net basis versus the former gross basis, which increased gross margin percentage by 127 basis points.\nSelling, General, and Administrative Expense\nSelling, general, and administrative expense increased by $52.3 million, or 11%, in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018, excluding the impact of foreign exchange, primarily driven by acquisition-related expenses during the year, including transaction fees of $19.7 million related to the acquisitions of Paragon, Juniper, and the two advanced biologics clinical development and manufacturing sites in southern Maryland from Novavax, Inc. and the expected acquisition of the oral solids, biologics, and sterile product manufacturing and packaging facility in Anagni, Italy. Additionally, there were incremental selling, general, and additional administrative expenses from the acquired companies of $28.4 million, primarily driven by $19.9 million of incremental depreciation and amortization expense and $3.0 million of employee-related costs. Selling, general, and administrative expenses further increased approximately $4.4 million for non-cash equity-based compensation driven by the achievement of certain performance-based metrics during the fiscal year.\nImpairment Charges and Loss on Sale of Assets\nImpairment charges for the twelve months ended June 30, 2019 and June 30, 2018 were $5.1 million and $8.7 million, respectively. Impairment charges in the current year were driven by a software related intangible asset in our Clinical Supply Services segment that was not implemented and whose value therefore was not fully recoverable. The prior year included losses on the sales of two Asia-Pacific manufacturing sites in the Softgel Technologies segment. The site divestitures were not material, either individually or in the aggregate, to the segment or our business as a whole.\nRestructuring and Other\nRestructuring and other charges of $14.1 million in fiscal 2019 increased by $4.3 million, excluding the impact of foreign exchange, compared to the amounts in fiscal 2018 and were driven by increases in employee-related actions. Restructuring expenses varies period-to-period based on site consolidation efforts and other efforts to further streamline the business.\nInterest Expense, net\nInterest expense, net, of $110.9 million in fiscal 2019 was in line with interest expense incurred during fiscal 2018. The interest expense during fiscal 2019 was primarily driven by outstanding debt associated with the financing of the Catalent Indiana acquisition in October 2017, the financing of the Paragon acquisition in May 2019, and the offering of the USD 2027 Notes in June 2019. The principal balance of our debt obligation increased during the fiscal year; however, our interest expense remained in line with the prior fiscal year since we were able to reduce the higher interest rates applicable to certain of our debt and pay down some of our debt with the net proceeds of a July 2018 public offering of our Common Stock (the 2018 Equity Offering\u201d).\nFor additional information concerning our debt and financing arrangements, including the changing mix of debt and equity in our capital structure, see -Liquidity and Capital Resources-Debt and Financing Arrangements\u201d and Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report.\nA component of the purchase price for the Catalent Indiana acquisition consisted of $200.0 million in deferred purchase consideration payable in four annual $50.0 million installments, the first of which was paid in October 2018. The present value of the unpaid portion of the deferred consideration is accounted for as debt, with the difference between the nominal value of such portion and such present value considered imputed interest expense.\nOther Expense, net\nOther expense, net of $2.7 million for fiscal 2019 was primarily driven by financing charges of $15.8 million related to the offering of the USD 2027 Notes and was partially offset by a gain of $12.9 million related to the change in the fair value of the derivative liability arising from the dividend adjustment mechanism of the Series A Preferred Stock and $0.5 million of unrealized foreign currency gains in the year. See Notes 9 and 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statement for more details on the Series A Preferred Stock dividend adjustment.\nOther expense, net for fiscal 2018 of $5.5 million was primarily driven by financing charges of $11.8 million related to the offering of the USD 2026 Notes and an amendment to the Credit Agreement, which included a $6.1 million charge for commitment fees paid during the first quarter of fiscal 2018, partially offset by $4.6 million of foreign currency gains in the fiscal year.\nProvision/(Benefit) for Income Taxes\nOur provision for income taxes for the twelve months ended June 30, 2019 was $22.9 million relative to earnings from operations before income taxes of $160.3 million. Our provision for income taxes for the twelve months ended June 30, 2018 was $68.4 million relative to earnings from operations before income taxes of $152.0 million. The income tax provision for the current period is not comparable to the same period of the prior year primarily due to the impact of the 2017 Tax Act, changes in pretax income over many jurisdictions, and the impact of discrete items, including equity compensation. Generally, fluctuations in our effective tax rate are due to changes in the geographic distribution of our pretax income resulting from our business mix and changes in the tax impact of permanent differences, restructuring, other special items, and other discrete tax items, including the reversal portion of the state valuation allowance, which may have unique tax implications depending on the nature of the item.\nSegment Review\nThe below charts depict the percentage of revenue from each of our four reporting segments for the previous two years. Refer below for discussions regarding the segments' revenue and EBITDA performance and to Non-GAAP Performance Metrics\u201d.\nOur results on a segment basis for the twelve months ended June 30, 2019 compared to the twelve months ended June 30, 2018 were as follows:\n\n(1) Unallocated costs include restructuring and special items, equity-based compensation, impairment charges, certain other corporate-directed costs, and other costs that are not allocated to the segments as follows:\n\n(a) Restructuring and other special items include fiscal 2019 transaction and integration costs associated with the acquisition of Paragon.\n(b) Other (expense), net of $2.7 million for the twelve months ended June 30, 2019 was primarily driven by financing charges of $15.8 million related to the offering of the USD 2027 Notes, partially offset by (i) a gain of $12.9 million related to the fair value of the derivative liability arising from the dividend adjustment mechanism of the Series A Preferred Stock and (ii) $0.5 million of unrealized foreign currency gains in the year. See Notes 9 and 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statement for more details on the Series A Preferred Stock dividend adjustment.\nProvided below is a reconciliation of earnings from operations to EBITDA from operations:\n\nSoftgel Technologies segment\n\nSoftgel Technologies' net revenue decreased $10.3 million, or 1%, excluding the impact of foreign exchange, as compared to the twelve months ended June 30, 2018. Net revenue remained consistent to the twelve months ended June 30, 2018, excluding the impact of divestitures. Volume increases across our consumer health portfolio within Europe were offset by strong price competition across the generic portion of our prescription product business in North America. Revenue in our consumer health business also decreased by 1%, across North America and Latin America, resulting from a shortage in our ibuprofen active pharmaceutical ingredient supply during the first 9 months of 2019, which was partially resolved in the fourth fiscal quarter.\nSoftgel Technologies' Segment EBITDA increased by $2.1 million, or 1%, compared to the twelve months ended June 30, 2018, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. Excluding the reduction of licensing revenue profit of 2%, segment EBITDA without divestitures increased 3%. The increase was primarily related to increased volume in the consumer health portfolio across Europe, offset by a shortage in our supply of ibuprofen active pharmaceutical ingredient during the first 9 months of 2019, which was partially resolved in the fourth fiscal quarter, which reduced Segment EBITDA by 3%.\nIn December 2017, we divested two manufacturing sites in Asia-Pacific in the Softgel Technologies segment in order to better streamline our global operations. The site divestitures resulted in a decrease to net revenue of 1% with no impact to segment EBITDA in the twelve months ended June 30, 2019 compared to the twelve months ended June 30, 2018.\nBiologics and Specialty Drug Delivery segment\n\nNet revenue in our Biologics and Specialty Drug Delivery segment increased by $146.7 million, or 24%, compared to the twelve months ended June 30, 2018, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. Net revenue without acquisitions increased by 7%, driven primarily by increased end-market demand for our drug product offerings offset slightly by decreased volume demand related to our U.S. drug substance product offering due to the fiscal 2019 completion of a limited duration customer contract for non-cell line clinical manufacturing services.\nBiologics and Specialty Drug Delivery segment EBITDA increased by $35.0 million, or 24%, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. Segment EBITDA without acquisitions was in line with prior year, primarily due to strong U.S drug product and drug-substance end-market demand offset by the fiscal 2019 completion of a limited duration customer contract for non-cell line clinical manufacturing services in our U.S. drug substance platform as well as unfavorable product mix in our European specialty drug product platform.\nOn October 23, 2017, we acquired Catalent Indiana, which increased net revenue and Segment EBITDA on an inorganic basis in our Biologics and Specialty Drug Delivery segment by 12% and 17%, respectively, in the twelve months ended June 30, 2019 compared to the corresponding prior-year period.\nOn May 17, 2019, we acquired Paragon, which increased net revenue and Segment EBITDA on an inorganic basis in our Biologics and Specialty Drug Delivery segment by 5% and 7%, respectively, in the twelve months ended June 30, 2019 compared to the corresponding prior-year period.\nOral Drug Delivery segment\n\nNet revenue in our Oral Drug Delivery segment increased by $67.7 million, or 10%, compared to the twelve months ended June 30, 2018, excluding the impact of foreign exchange, primarily resulting from our Juniper acquisition. Revenue without acquisitions decreased 1%, primarily driven by decreased end-market demand for a key product within our U.S.-based commercial oral delivery solutions platform, partially offset by an increase related to the intake of new molecules within our development and analytical services platform, the completion of a commercially ready process for a key product within our U.S.-based oral delivery solutions platform and a favorable impact from licensing revenue recorded during the third quarter. The favorable impact of licensing revenue in the third quarter was attributable to a single transaction, which consisted of a grant to a third party of the Company's right to participate in an arrangement that resulted in a stream of revenue over time in exchange for a one-time up-front license fee.\nOral Drug Delivery's Segment EBITDA increased by $2.3 million, or 10%, compared to the twelve months ended June 30, 2018, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. Segment EBITDA without acquisitions decreased 5%, primarily driven by decreased end-market demand for a key product within our U.S.-based commercial oral delivery solutions platform, partially offset by an increase in volume related to the intake of new molecules within our development and analytical services platform, the completion of a commercially ready process for a key product within our U.S.-based oral delivery solutions platform and a\nfavorable impact from licensing profit recorded during the third quarter. The favorable impact of licensing revenue in the third quarter was attributable to a single transaction, which consisted of a grant to a third party of the Company's right to participate in an arrangement that resulted in a stream of revenue over time in exchange for a one-time up-front license fee.\nOn August 14, 2018, we acquired Juniper, which increased inorganic net revenue and Segment EBITDA in our Oral Drug Delivery segment for the twelve months ended June 30, 2019 by 11% and 15%, respectively, compared to the prior-year period.\nClinical Supply Services segment\n\nClinical Supply Services' net revenue decreased by $102.7 million, or 24%,", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with Item 6. Selected Financial Data\u201d and our Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes, which appear elsewhere in this Annual Report. In addition to historical consolidated financial information, the following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates, and beliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. You should carefully read Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d in this Annual Report. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those discussed below and elsewhere in this Annual Report, particularly in Item 1A. Risk Factors.\u201d\nOverview\nWe are the leading global provider of advanced delivery technologies and development solutions for drugs, biologics, and consumer health products. Our oral, injectable, and respiratory delivery technologies provide delivery solutions across the full diversity of the pharmaceutical industry, including small molecules, protein and gene therapy biologics, and consumer health products. Through our extensive capabilities and deep expertise in product development, we help our customers take products to market faster, including nearly half of new drug products approved by the FDA in the last decade. Our advanced delivery technology platforms, which include those in our Softgel Technologies, Biologics and Specialty Drug Delivery, and Oral Drug Delivery segments, our proven formulation, manufacturing, and regulatory expertise, and our broad and deep intellectual property enable our customers to develop more products and better treatments for patients and consumers. Across both development and delivery, our commitment to reliably supply our customers' and their patients' needs is the foundation for the value we provide; annually, we produce approximately 73 billion doses for nearly 7,000 customer products, or approximately 1 in every 20 doses of such products taken each year by patients and consumers around the world. We believe that, through our investments in growth-enabling capacity and capabilities, our ongoing focus on operational and quality excellence, the sales of existing customer products, the introduction of new customer products, our innovation activities and patents, and our entry into new markets, we will continue to benefit from attractive and differentiated margins and realize the growth potential from these areas.\nOur Reportable Segments\nWe currently operate in four operating segments, which also constitute our four reporting segments: Softgel Technologies, Biologics and Specialty Drug Delivery, Oral Drug Delivery, and Clinical Supply Services.\nEach of our segments reports through a separate management team. Our offerings and services are summarized below by reporting segment.\nSoftgel Technologies\nThrough our Softgel Technologies segment, we provide formulation, development, and manufacturing services for soft capsules, or softgels,\u201d which our predecessor first commercialized in the 1930s and which we have continually enhanced. We are the market leader in overall softgel development and manufacturing and hold the leading market position in the prescription arena. Our principal softgel technologies include traditional softgel capsules, in which the shell is made of animal-derived gelatin, and Vegicaps and OptiShell capsules, in which the shell is made from plant-derived materials. Softgel capsules are used in a broad range of customer products, including prescription drugs, over-the-counter medications, dietary supplements, unit-dose cosmetics, and animal health medicinal preparations. Softgel capsules encapsulate liquid, paste, or oil-based active compounds in solution or suspension within an outer shell. In the manufacturing process, the capsules are formed, filled, and sealed simultaneously. We typically perform encapsulation for a product within one of our softgel facilities, with active ingredients provided by customers or sourced directly by us. Softgels have historically been used to solve formulation challenges or technical issues for a specific drug, to help improve the clinical performance of compounds, to provide important market differentiation, particularly for over-the-counter medications, and to provide safe handling of hormonal, potent, and cytotoxic drugs. We also participate in the softgel vitamin, mineral, and supplement business in selected regions around the world. With the 2001 introduction of our plant-derived softgel shell, Vegicaps capsules, consumer health customers have been able to extend the softgel dose form to a broader range of active ingredients and serve patient/consumer populations that were previously inaccessible due to religious, dietary, or cultural preferences. In recent years, we have extended this platform to pharmaceutical products via our OptiShell capsule offering. Our Vegicaps and OptiShell capsules are protected by patents in most major global markets. Physician and patient studies we have conducted have demonstrated a preference for softgels versus traditional tablet and hard capsule dose forms in terms of ease of swallowing, real or perceived speed of delivery, ability to remove or eliminate unpleasant odor or taste, and, for physicians, perceived improved patient adherence with dosing regimens. Representative customers of Softgel Technologies include Pfizer, Novartis, Bayer, GlaxoSmithKline, Teva, Johnson & Johnson, Procter & Gamble, and Allergan.\nAs of June 30, 2019, we had eleven Softgel Technologies manufacturing facilities in nine countries, including three in North America, three in Europe, three in South America, and two in the Asia-Pacific region, as well as additional sales offices. Our Softgel Technologies segment represents 34% of our aggregate revenue for fiscal 2019 before inter-segment eliminations.\nBiologics and Specialty Drug Delivery\nOur Biologics and Specialty Drug Delivery segment provides drug substance development and manufacturing, drug product clinical and commercial manufacturing, integrated clinical and commercial supply solutions for protein and gene therapy biologics, and specialty small molecules administered via injection, inhalation, and ophthalmic routes, using both traditional and advanced delivery technologies. The business has extensive expertise in development, scale up, and commercial manufacturing. Representative customers of Biologics and Specialty Drug Delivery include Eli Lilly, Teva, Mylan, Roche, Novartis, Sarepta, and Genentech, along with multiple innovative small and mid-tier pharmaceutical and biologics customers.\nOur growing biologics offering includes cell-line development based on our advanced and patented GPEx technology, which is used to develop stable, high-yielding mammalian cell lines for both innovator and biosimilar biologic compounds. GPEx technology can provide rapid cell-line development, high biologics production yields, flexibility, and versatility. Our development and manufacturing facility in Madison, Wisconsin has the capability and capacity to produce cGMP quality biologics drug substance from 250L to 4000L scale using single-use technology to provide maximum efficiency and flexibility. Our fiscal 2018 acquisition of Catalent Indiana added a biologics-focused contract development and manufacturing organization with capabilities across biologics development, clinical, and commercial drug substance manufacturing, formulation, finished-dose drug product manufacturing, and packaging. In fiscal 2019, we continued to expand production capacity in both Madison and Bloomington, Indiana, starting construction on fourth and fifth drug substance suites in Madison and new drug product manufacturing and packaging capacity in Bloomington. Our SMARTag next-generation antibody-drug conjugate technology enables development of antibody-drug conjugates and other protein conjugates with improved efficacy, safety, and manufacturability. In fiscal 2019, we launched our OneBio Suite, which provides customers the potential to seamlessly integrate drug substance, drug product, and clinical supply management for products in development, and for integrated commercial supply across both drug substance and product. We provide the broadest range of technologies and services supporting the development and launch of new biologic entities, biosimilars, and biobetters to bring a product from gene to commercialization, faster.\nOn May 17, 2019, we acquired Paragon, which is focused on the development and manufacture of cutting-edge biopharmaceuticals, including viral vectors used in gene therapies. For over 25 years, Paragon has partnered with some of the world's leading biotech and pharma companies to develop and manufacture products based on transformative technologies, including gene therapies based on AAV and other modalities, next-generation vaccines, oncology immunotherapies (oncolytic viruses and CAR-T cell therapies), therapeutic proteins, and other complex biologics. Paragon brings specialized expertise in AAV vectors, the most commonly used delivery system for gene therapy, as well as capabilities in plasmids and lentivirus vectors manufactured using cGMP. By adding Paragon's specialized expertise in AAV vectors, we believe we are positioned to capitalize on strong industry tailwinds in the market for gene therapies. Paragon also brings to Catalent its differentiated scientific, development, and manufacturing capabilities, which we believe will fundamentally enhance our biologics business and end-to-end integrated biopharmaceutical solutions for customers. In June 2019, Paragon agreed to acquire two additional laboratory and manufacturing facilities located in southern Maryland from Novavax, Inc. The Novavax transaction closed in late July 2019.\nOur range of injectable manufacturing offerings includes filling small molecules or biologics into pre-filled syringes, cartridges, and vials, with flexibility to accommodate other formats within our existing network, increasingly focused on complex pharmaceuticals and biologics. With our range of technologies, we are able to meet a wide range of specifications, timelines, and budgets. We believe that the complexity of the manufacturing process, the importance of experience and know-how, regulatory compliance, and high start-up capital requirements provide us with a substantial competitive advantage in the market. For example, blow-fill-seal is an advanced aseptic processing technology, which uses a continuous process to form, fill with drug or biologic, and seal a plastic container in a sterile environment. Blow-fill-seal units are currently used for a variety of pharmaceuticals in liquid form, such as respiratory, ophthalmic, and otic products. Our sterile blow-fill-seal manufacturing has significant capacity and flexibility in manufacturing configurations. This business provides flexible and scalable solutions for unit-dose delivery of complex formulations such as suspensions and emulsions. Further, the business provides engineering and manufacturing solutions related to complex containers. Our regulatory expertise can lead to decreased time to commercialization, and our dedicated development production lines support feasibility, stability, and clinical runs. We plan to continue to expand our product line in existing and new markets, and in higher margin specialty products with additional respiratory, ophthalmic, injectable, and nasal applications.\nWe also offer bioanalytical development and testing services for large molecules, including cGMP release and stability testing. Our respiratory product capabilities include development and manufacturing services for inhaled products for delivery\nvia metered dose inhalers, dry powder inhalers, and intra-nasal sprays. Across multiple complex dosage forms, the segment provides drug and biologic solutions from early-stage development and clinical support all the way through to scale up and commercialization.\nAs of June 30, 2019, we had ten BSDD manufacturing facilities, including eight in North America and two in Europe. Our BSDD segment represents 29% of our aggregate revenue for fiscal 2019 before inter-segment eliminations.\nOral Drug Delivery\nOur Oral Drug Delivery segment provides various advanced formulation development and manufacturing technologies, and related integrated solutions including: clinical development and commercial manufacturing of a broad range of oral dose forms, including our proprietary fast-dissolve Zydis tablets and both conventional immediate and controlled-release tablets, capsules, and sachet products. Representative customers of Oral Drug Delivery include Pfizer, Johnson & Johnson, Bayer, Novartis, and Perrigo.\nWe provide comprehensive pre-formulation, development, and cGMP manufacturing at both clinical and commercial scales for traditional and advanced complex oral solid-dose formats, including coated and uncoated tablets, pellet/bead/powder-filled two-piece hard capsules, granulated powders, and other forms of immediate and modified release branded prescription, generic, and consumer products. We have substantial experience developing and scaling up products requiring accelerated development timelines, solubility enhancement, specialized handling (e.g., potent or DEA-regulated materials), complex technology transfers, and specialized manufacturing processes. We also provide micronization and particle engineering services, which may enhance a drug's manufacturability or clinical performance. We offer comprehensive analytical testing and scientific services and stability testing for small molecules, both to support integrated development programs and on a fee-for-service basis. We provide global regulatory and support services for our customers' clinical strategies during all stages of development. In recent years, we have expanded our network of development sites focused on earlier phase compounds, to engage with more customer molecules, earlier, with the intent to provide later stage manufacturing and supporting services as those molecules progress towards commercial approval and beyond. Demand for our offerings is driven by the need for scientific expertise and depth and breadth of services offered, as well as by the reliability of our supply, including quality, execution, and performance.\nWe launched our orally dissolving tablet business in 1986 with the introduction of Zydis tablets, a unique proprietary freeze-dried tablet that typically dissolves in the mouth, without water, in less than three seconds. Most often used for drugs and patient groups that can benefit from rapid oral disintegration, we can adapt the Zydis technology to a wide range of products and indications, including treatments for a variety of central nervous system-related conditions such as migraines, Parkinson's disease, and schizophrenia, and consumer healthcare products targeting indications such as pain and allergy relief. We continue to develop Zydis tablets in different formats with our customers as we extend the application of the technology to new therapeutic categories, including immunotherapy, vaccines, and biologic molecule delivery.\nAs of June 30, 2019, we had nine ODD manufacturing facilities, including four in North America and five in Europe. Our ODD segment represents 24% of our aggregate revenue for fiscal 2019 before inter-segment eliminations.\nClinical Supply Services\nOur Clinical Supply Services segment provides manufacturing, packaging, storage, distribution, project management, and inventory management for drugs and biologics in clinical trials. We offer customers flexible solutions for clinical supplies production and provide distribution and inventory management support for both simple and complex clinical trials. This includes over-encapsulation where needed; supplying placebos, comparator drug procurement, and clinical packages and kits for physicians and patients; inventory management; investigator kit ordering and fulfillment; and return supply reconciliation and reporting. We support trials in all regions of the world through our facilities and distribution network. In fiscal 2018, we completed the second phase of our expansion program in our Kansas City, Missouri facility. Further, in fiscal 2016 and again in fiscal 2018, we expanded our Singapore facility by building additional flexible cGMP space, and we introduced clinical supply services at our existing 100,000 square foot facility in Japan, expanding our Asia-Pacific capabilities. Additionally, in fiscal 2013, we established our first clinical supply services facility in China as a joint venture, assumed full ownership in fiscal 2015, and opened a second facility in China in fiscal 2019. We are the leading provider of integrated development solutions and one of the leading providers of clinical trial supplies. Representative customers of Clinical Supply Services include Merck KGaA, IQVIA, Eli Lilly, AbbVie, and Incyte Corporation.\nAs of June 30, 2019, we had nine Clinical Supply Service facilities, including two in North America, three in Europe, and four in the Asia-Pacific region. Our Clinical Supply Services segment represents 13% of our aggregate revenue for fiscal 2019 before inter-segment eliminations.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Recent Accounting Pronouncements\nThe following disclosure supplements the descriptions of our accounting policies contained in Note 1 to our Consolidated Financial Statements in regard to significant areas of judgment. Management made certain estimates and assumptions during the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities in the Consolidated Financial Statements. These estimates also affect the reported amount of net earnings during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Because of the size of the financial statement elements to which they relate, some of our accounting policies and estimates have a more significant impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements than others.\nManagement has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors. A discussion of some of our more significant accounting policies and estimates follows.\nRevenue\nWe sell products and services directly to our pharmaceutical, biotechnology, and consumer health customers. The majority of our business is conducted through manufacturing and commercial product supply, development services, and clinical supply services. On July 1, 2018, we adopted Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), codified as Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC\u201d) 606, using the modified retrospective method of adoption. Prior period amounts have not been restated and continue to be reported in accordance with our historical accounting policies. For discussion on the impact of adopting ASC 606 on our accounting, refer to Note 1 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nOur contracts with customers often include promises to transfer multiple products and services to a customer. Determining whether products and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately versus together may require judgment. For our manufacturing and commercial product supply revenue, the contract generally includes the terms of the manufacturing services and related product quality assurance procedures to comply with regulatory requirements. Due to the regulated nature of our business, these contract terms are highly interdependent and, therefore, are considered to be a single combined performance obligation. For our development services and clinical supply services revenue, our performance obligations vary per contract and are accounted for as separate performance obligations. If a contract contains a single performance obligation, we allocate the entire transaction price to the single performance obligation. If a contract contains multiple performance obligations, we allocate consideration to each performance obligation using the relative standalone selling price\u201d as defined under ASC 606. Generally, we utilize observable standalone selling prices in our allocations of consideration. If observable standalone selling prices are not available, we estimate the applicable standalone selling price using an adjusted market assessment approach, representing the amount that we believe the market is willing to pay for the applicable service. Revenue is recognized over time using an appropriate method of measuring progress towards fulfilling our performance obligation for the respective arrangement. Determining the measure of progress that consistently depicts our satisfaction of performance obligations within each of our revenue streams across similar arrangements requires judgment.\nLicensing revenue\nWe occasionally enter into arrangements with customers that include licensing of functional intellectual property, including drug formulae, or other intangible property ( out-licensing\u201d). We do not have any material license arrangement that contains more than one performance obligation. Our out-licensing generally entitles us to nonrefundable, up-front fees or royalties. Nonrefundable, up-front license fees are recognized as revenue when the licensed property is made available for the customer's use and benefit, provided there is no unsatisfied performance obligation included in the arrangement. Royalty payments from such arrangements are recognized when subsequent sale or usage of an item subject to the royalty occurs and the performance obligation to which royalty relates is satisfied.\nLong-lived and Other Definite-Lived Intangible Assets\nWe allocate the cost of an acquired company to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets and liabilities acquired, with the remaining amount being recorded as goodwill. Intangible assets primarily include customer relationships and trademarks. Valuing the identifiable intangible assets requires judgment. We applied a discounted cash flow model in measuring the customer relationships in relation to the Paragon acquisition, which included certain assumptions such as revenue growth, forecasted revenue and related margin, and customer contract attrition and renewal rates. Intangibles assets are generally amortized on a straight-line basis, reflecting the pattern in which the economic benefits are consumed, and are amortized over their estimated useful lives.\nWe assess the impairment of identifiable intangibles if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying values of the assets may not be recoverable. Factors that we consider important that could trigger an impairment review include the following:\n\u2022significant under-performance relative to historical or projected future operating results;\n\u2022significant changes in the manner of use of the acquired assets or the strategy of the overall business;\n\u2022significant negative industry or economic trends; and\n\u2022recognition of goodwill impairment charges.\nIf we determine that the carrying value of intangibles and/or long-lived assets may not be recoverable based on the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment, we measure recoverability of assets by comparing the respective carrying values of the assets to the current and expected future cash flows, on an un-discounted basis, to be generated from such assets. If such analysis indicates that the carrying value of these assets is not recoverable, we measure any impairment based on the amount in which the net carrying amounts of the assets exceed the fair values of the assets. See Notes 5 and 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nGoodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets\nWe account for purchased goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives in accordance with ASC 350, Intangible and Other Assets. Under ASC 350, goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized, but instead are tested for impairment at least annually. We perform an impairment evaluation of goodwill annually during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year or when circumstances otherwise indicate an evaluation should be performed. The evaluation may begin with a qualitative assessment for each reporting unit to determine whether it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value. If the qualitative assessment does not generate a positive response, or if no qualitative assessment is performed, a quantitative assessment, based upon discounted cash flows, is performed and requires management to estimate future cash flows, growth rates, and economic and market conditions. In fiscal 2017 and 2018, we proceeded immediately to the quantitative assessment, but in fiscal 2019 we began with the qualitative assessment, which was sufficient to find no impairment. The 2018 and 2017 evaluations also resulted in no impairment charge.\nSee Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nSeries A Preferred Stock Dividend Adjustment Feature\nThe terms of the Series A Preferred Stock include a dividend adjustment feature to provide the holder with certain protections against a decline in the trading price of our Common Stock. Because this adjustment feature depends in part on the value of external metrics at future dates, over which we have no control, this feature is accounted for separately from the Series A Preferred Stock. The derivative instrument is measured at fair value, as of the valuation date, using a combination of (i) a Monte Carlo simulation and (ii) a binomial lattice model, which incorporates the terms and conditions of the Series A Preferred Stock and is based on changes in the market prices of shares of our Common Stock over successive periods. Key assumptions used in both models include the current market price of one share of the Common Stock and its historical and expected volatility, risk-neutral interest rates, and the remaining term of the adjustment feature. These assumptions require significant management judgment and are considered Level 3 inputs. We recognize the derivative as either an asset or liability in the consolidated balance sheets at its fair value and revalue it as of the end of each quarterly reporting period; changes in the fair value are recognized in the consolidated statements of operations.\nIncome Taxes\nIn accordance with ASC 740 Income Taxes, we account for income taxes using the asset and liability method. The asset and liability method requires recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for expected future tax consequences of temporary differences that currently exist between tax bases and financial reporting bases of our assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in the respective jurisdictions in which we operate. Deferred taxes are not provided on the undistributed earnings of subsidiaries outside of the United States when it is expected that these earnings will be permanently reinvested. In fiscal 2018, we recorded a provision for U.S. income taxes and foreign withholding taxes in relation to expected repatriations as a result of the 2017 Tax Act, but we have not made any provision for U.S. income taxes on the remaining undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries as those earnings are considered permanently reinvested in the operations of those foreign subsidiaries in fiscal 2019.\nThe 2017 Tax Act imposed taxes with respect to so-called global intangible low-taxed income\u201d ( GILTI\u201d) earned by certain foreign subsidiaries of a U.S. company. In accordance with ASC 740, we made an accounting policy election to treat taxes due on future U.S. inclusions in taxable income related to GILTI as a current-period expense when incurred.\nWe had valuation allowances of $76.3 million and $86.2 million as of June 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively, against our deferred tax assets. We considered all available evidence, both positive and negative, in assessing the need for a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets. We evaluated four possible sources of taxable income when assessing the realization of deferred tax assets:\n\u2022carrybacks of existing net operating losses (if permitted by tax law);\n\u2022future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences;\n\u2022tax planning strategies; and\n\u2022future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards.\nWe considered the need to maintain a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets based on management's assessment of whether it is more likely than not that we would realize those deferred tax assets based on future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences and the ability to generate sufficient taxable income within the carryforward period available under the applicable tax law. During the year ended June 30, 2019 we released $12.1 million of the valuation allowance related to certain U.S. combined states. Of the $12.1 million released, $0.5 million relates to state net operating loss ( NOLs\u201d) carryforwards, which expire over a number of years beginning in 2028, and $11.6 million relates to other state deferred tax temporary differences that will reduce income for state tax purposes in the future.\nWhile the valuation allowance related to certain U.S. combined states was partially released in the year ended June 30, 2019, a state valuation allowance of $35.1 million is maintained on state NOLs and deductible temporary differences for the separate and remaining combined states. The remaining state valuation allowance is due to our history of tax losses and anticipated loss utilization rates in separate filing status states as well as the difference in the rules related to allocated and apportioned income for separate filing status states versus combined filing status states.\nUnrecognized tax benefits are generated when there are differences between tax positions taken in a tax return and amounts recognized in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Tax benefits are recognized in the Consolidated Financial Statements when it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination. To the extent we prevail in matters for which liabilities have been established or are required to pay amounts in excess of our liabilities, our effective income tax rate in a given period could be materially affected. An unfavorable income tax settlement may require the use of cash and result in an increase in our effective income tax rate in the year it is resolved. A favorable income tax settlement would be recognized as a reduction in the effective income tax rate in the year of resolution. At June 30, 2019 and 2018, we recorded unrecognized tax benefits and related interest and penalties of $5.2 million and $4.1 million, respectively. We recognized no material adjustment in the liability for unrecognized income tax benefits during fiscal 2019.\nOur accounting for income taxes involves the application of complex tax regulations in the U.S. and in each of the non-US jurisdictions in which we operate. The determination of income subject to taxation in each tax paying jurisdiction requires us to review reported book income and the events occurring during the year in each jurisdiction in which we operate. In addition, the application of deferred tax assets and liabilities will have an effect on the tax expense in each jurisdiction. For those entities engaging in transactions with affiliates, we apply transfer pricing guidelines relevant in many jurisdictions in which we operate and make certain informed and reasonable assumptions and estimates about the relative value of contributions by affiliates when assessing the allocation of income and deductions between consolidated entities in different jurisdictions. Additionally, for taxes incurred outside the U.S., we are entitled, under the Internal Revenue Code as amended by the 2017 Tax Act and regulations promulgated thereunder, to claim U.S. foreign tax credits to offset certain tax liabilities arising in the U.S. Certain of the assumptions and allocations used in the determination of the key inputs underlying the foreign tax credits, particularly as they relate to the calculation of U.S. income taxes owed on GILTI, are based on recently issued regulatory guidance that does not necessarily address all elements needed to prepare the calculations and is therefore subject to considerable judgment.\nFactors Affecting our Performance\nFluctuations in Operating Results\nOur annual financial reporting periods end on June 30. Our revenue and net earnings are generally higher in the third and fourth quarters of each fiscal year, with our first fiscal quarter typically generating our lowest revenue of any quarter, and our last fiscal quarter typically generating our highest revenue. These fluctuations are primarily the result of the timing of our, and our customers', annual operational maintenance periods at locations in continental Europe and the U.K., the seasonality associated with pharmaceutical and biotechnology budgetary spending decisions, clinical trial and research and development schedules, the timing of new product launches and length of time needed to obtain full market penetration, and, to a lesser extent, the time of the year some of our customers' products are in higher demand.\nAcquisition and Related Integration Efforts\nOur growth and profitability are affected by the acquisitions we complete and the speed at which we integrate those acquisitions into our existing operating platforms. In fiscal 2018, we acquired Catalent Indiana in order to enhance our biologics capabilities, and it has been integrated into our Biologics and Specialty Drug Delivery segment. In fiscal 2019, we completed the acquisitions of Juniper, based in the U.K., in August 2018 and Paragon, based in the U.S., in May 2019, which have been integrated into our Oral Drug Delivery and Biologics and Specialty Drug Delivery segments, respectively.\nForeign Exchange Rates\nOur operating network is global, and, as a result, we have substantial revenues and operating expenses that are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, the currency in which we report our financial results, and are therefore influenced by changes in currency exchange rates. In fiscal 2019, approximately 48% of our revenue was generated from our operations outside the United States. Significant foreign currencies for our operations include the British pound, the euro, the Brazilian real, the Argentine peso, the Japanese yen, the Canadian dollar, and the Australian dollar.\nTrends Affecting Our Business\nIndustry\nWe participate in nearly every sector of the global pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry, which has been estimated to generate $1 trillion in annual revenue, including, but not limited to, the prescription drug and biologic sectors as well as consumer health, which includes the over-the-counter and vitamins and nutritional supplement sectors. Innovative pharmaceuticals continue to play a critical role in the global market, while the share of revenue due to generic drugs and biosimilars is increasing in both developed and developing markets. Sustained developed market demand and rapid growth in emerging economies is driving the consumer health product growth rate to more than double that for pharmaceuticals. Payors, both public and private, have sought to limit the economic impact of pharmaceutical and biologics product demand through greater use of generic and biosimilar drugs, access and spending controls, and health technology assessment techniques, favoring products that deliver truly differentiated outcomes.\nNew Molecule Development and R&D Sourcing\nContinued strengthening in early-stage development pipelines for drugs and biologics, compounded by increasing clinical trial breadth and complexity, support our belief in the attractive growth prospects for development solutions. Large companies are in many cases reconfiguring their R&D resources, increasingly involving the use of strategic partners for important outsourced functions. Additionally, an increasing portion of compounds in development are from companies that do not have a full research and development infrastructure, and thus are more likely to need strategic development solutions partners.\nDemographics\nAging population demographics in developed countries, combined with health care reforms in many global markets that are expanding access to treatments to a greater proportion of their populations, will continue to drive increases in demand for pharmaceuticals, biologics, and consumer health products. Increasing economic affluence in developing regions will further increase demand for healthcare treatments, and we are taking active steps to allow us to participate effectively in these growth regions and product categories.\nFinally, we believe the market access and payor pressures our customers face, global supply chain complexity, and the increasing demand for improved treatments will continue to escalate the need for product differentiation, improved outcomes, and treatment cost reduction, all of which can often be addressed using our advanced delivery technologies.\nNon-GAAP Performance Metrics\nAs described in this section, management uses various financial metrics, including certain metrics that are not based on concepts defined in U.S. GAAP, to measure and assess the performance of our business and to make critical business decisions. We therefore, believe that presentation of certain of these non-GAAP metrics in this Annual Report will aid investors in understanding our business performance.\nUse of EBITDA from operations\nManagement measures operating performance based on consolidated earnings from operations before interest expense, expense/(benefit) for income taxes and depreciation and amortization, adjusted for the income or loss attributable to non-controlling interests ( EBITDA from operations\u201d). EBITDA from operations is not defined under U.S. GAAP, is not a measure\nof operating income, operating performance, or liquidity presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and is subject to important limitations.\nWe believe that the presentation of EBITDA from operations enhances an investor's understanding of our financial performance. We believe this measure is a useful financial metric to assess our operating performance across periods and use this measure for business planning purposes. In addition, given the significant investments that we have made in the past in property, plant and equipment, depreciation and amortization expenses represent a meaningful portion of our cost structure. We believe that disclosing EBITDA from operations will provide investors with a useful tool for assessing the comparability between periods of our ability to generate cash from operations sufficient to pay taxes, to service debt, and to undertake capital expenditures without consideration of non-cash depreciation and amortization expense. We present EBITDA from operations in order to provide supplemental information that we consider relevant for the readers of the Consolidated Financial Statements, and such information is not meant to replace or supersede U.S. GAAP measures. Our definition of EBITDA from operations may not be the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies. The most directly comparable measure to EBITDA from operations defined under U.S. GAAP is earnings/(loss) from operations. Included in this Management's Discussion and Analysis is a reconciliation of earnings/(loss) from operations to EBITDA from operations.\nIn addition, we evaluate the performance of our segments based on segment earnings before non-controlling interest, other (income)/expense, impairments, restructuring costs, interest expense, income tax expense/(benefit), and depreciation and amortization ( Segment EBITDA\u201d).\nUse of Constant Currency\nAs exchange rates are an important factor in understanding period-to-period comparisons, we believe the presentation of results on a constant currency basis in addition to reported results helps improve investors' ability to understand our operating results and evaluate our performance in comparison to prior periods. Constant currency information compares results between periods as if exchange rates had remained constant period-over-period. We use results on a constant currency basis as one measure to evaluate our performance. In this Annual Report, we calculate constant currency by calculating current-year results using prior-year foreign currency exchange rates. We generally refer to such amounts calculated on a constant currency basis as excluding the impact of foreign exchange. These results should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, results reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Results on a constant currency basis, as we present them, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies and are not measures of performance presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\nSummary Two-Year Key Financial Performance Metrics\nThe below tables summarize our results in fiscal 2019 and 2018 on several financial metrics we use to measure performance. Refer to the discussions below regarding performance and the use of key financial metrics and -Non-GAAP Performance Metrics\u201d concerning the measurement of revenue at constant currency.\u201d\nFiscal Year Ended June 30, 2019 compared to the Fiscal Year Ended June 30, 2018\nResults for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018 were as follows:\nTable 14: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Dollars in millions) </td> <td>Fiscal Year Ended\nJune 30, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>FX Impact </td> <td> </td> <td>Constant Currency Increase/(Decrease) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Change $ </td> <td> </td> <td>Change % </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net revenue </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,518.0 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,463.4 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(57.0) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>111.6 </td> <td> </td> <td>5 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of sales </td> <td>1,712.9 </td> <td> </td> <td>1,710.8 </td> <td> </td> <td>(41.1) </td> <td> </td> <td>43.2 </td> <td> </td> <td>3 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross margin </td> <td>805.1 </td> <td> </td> <td>752.6 </td> <td> </td> <td>(15.9) </td> <td> </td> <td>68.4 </td> <td> </td> <td>9 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling, general and administrative expenses </td> <td>512.0 </td> <td> </td> <td>464.8 </td> <td> </td> <td>(5.1) </td> <td> </td> <td>52.3 </td> <td> </td> <td>11 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impairment charges and (gain)/loss on sale of assets </td> <td>5.1 </td> <td> </td> <td>8.7 </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.1) </td> <td> </td> <td>(3.5) </td> <td> </td> <td>(40) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Restructuring and other </td> <td>14.1 </td> <td> </td> <td>10.2 </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.4) </td> <td> </td> <td>4.3 </td> <td> </td> <td>42 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating earnings </td> <td>273.9 </td> <td> </td> <td>268.9 </td> <td> </td> <td>(10.3) </td> <td> </td> <td>15.3 </td> <td> </td> <td>6 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense, net </td> <td>110.9 </td> <td> </td> <td>111.4 </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.7) </td> <td> </td> <td>0.2 </td> <td> </td> <td>* </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other (income)/expense, net </td> <td>2.7 </td> <td> </td> <td>5.5 </td> <td> </td> <td>(2.9) </td> <td> </td> <td>0.1 </td> <td> </td> <td>2 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Earnings from operations, before income taxes </td> <td>160.3 </td> <td> </td> <td>152.0 </td> <td> </td> <td>(6.7) </td> <td> </td> <td>15.0 </td> <td> </td> <td>10 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax expense/(benefit) </td> <td>22.9 </td> <td> </td> <td>68.4 </td> <td> </td> <td>(1.4) </td> <td> </td> <td>(44.1) </td> <td> </td> <td>(64) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net earnings </td> <td>$ </td> <td>137.4 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>83.6 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(5.4) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>59.2 </td> <td> </td> <td>71 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n*Percentage not meaningful\nNet Revenue\nNet revenue increased by $111.6 million, or 5%, in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018, excluding the impact of foreign exchange, primarily due to acquisitions. We acquired Paragon in May 2019, Juniper in August 2018, and Catalent Indiana in October 2017, which increased revenue by 7%, but the increase was partially offset by a reduction in revenue from comparator sourcing arrangements within our Clinical Supply Services segment of 4%. As a result of the adoption of ASC 606, we recorded comparator sourcing arrangements on a net basis versus a gross basis, resulting in a decrease in net revenue with no corresponding decrease to EBITDA. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, divestitures, and the change in accounting for comparator sourcing arrangements, revenue increased 2% primarily driven by increased net revenue within our Biologics and Specialty Drug Delivery segment.\nGross Margin\nGross margin increased by $68.4 million, or 9%, in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018, excluding the impact of foreign exchange, primarily due to increased sales volumes as a result of acquisitions discussed above. On a constant currency basis, gross margin, as a percentage of revenue, was 31.9% in the twelve months ended June 30, 2019, an increase from the prior year of 133 basis points, primarily as a result of the adoption of ASC 606, pursuant to which we record comparator sourcing arrangements on a net basis versus the former gross basis, which increased gross margin percentage by 127 basis points.\nSelling, General, and Administrative Expense\nSelling, general, and administrative expense increased by $52.3 million, or 11%, in fiscal 2019 compared to fiscal 2018, excluding the impact of foreign exchange, primarily driven by acquisition-related expenses during the year, including transaction fees of $19.7 million related to the acquisitions of Paragon, Juniper, and the two advanced biologics clinical development and manufacturing sites in southern Maryland from Novavax, Inc. and the expected acquisition of the oral solids, biologics, and sterile product manufacturing and packaging facility in Anagni, Italy. Additionally, there were incremental selling, general, and additional administrative expenses from the acquired companies of $28.4 million, primarily driven by $19.9 million of incremental depreciation and amortization expense and $3.0 million of employee-related costs. Selling, general, and administrative expenses further increased approximately $4.4 million for non-cash equity-based compensation driven by the achievement of certain performance-based metrics during the fiscal year.\nImpairment Charges and Loss on Sale of Assets\nImpairment charges for the twelve months ended June 30, 2019 and June 30, 2018 were $5.1 million and $8.7 million, respectively. Impairment charges in the current year were driven by a software related intangible asset in our Clinical Supply Services segment that was not implemented and whose value therefore was not fully recoverable. The prior year included losses on the sales of two Asia-Pacific manufacturing sites in the Softgel Technologies segment. The site divestitures were not material, either individually or in the aggregate, to the segment or our business as a whole.\nRestructuring and Other\nRestructuring and other charges of $14.1 million in fiscal 2019 increased by $4.3 million, excluding the impact of foreign exchange, compared to the amounts in fiscal 2018 and were driven by increases in employee-related actions. Restructuring expenses varies period-to-period based on site consolidation efforts and other efforts to further streamline the business.\nInterest Expense, net\nInterest expense, net, of $110.9 million in fiscal 2019 was in line with interest expense incurred during fiscal 2018. The interest expense during fiscal 2019 was primarily driven by outstanding debt associated with the financing of the Catalent Indiana acquisition in October 2017, the financing of the Paragon acquisition in May 2019, and the offering of the USD 2027 Notes in June 2019. The principal balance of our debt obligation increased during the fiscal year; however, our interest expense remained in line with the prior fiscal year since we were able to reduce the higher interest rates applicable to certain of our debt and pay down some of our debt with the net proceeds of a July 2018 public offering of our Common Stock (the 2018 Equity Offering\u201d).\nFor additional information concerning our debt and financing arrangements, including the changing mix of debt and equity in our capital structure, see -Liquidity and Capital Resources-Debt and Financing Arrangements\u201d and Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report.\nA component of the purchase price for the Catalent Indiana acquisition consisted of $200.0 million in deferred purchase consideration payable in four annual $50.0 million installments, the first of which was paid in October 2018. The present value of the unpaid portion of the deferred consideration is accounted for as debt, with the difference between the nominal value of such portion and such present value considered imputed interest expense.\nOther Expense, net\nOther expense, net of $2.7 million for fiscal 2019 was primarily driven by financing charges of $15.8 million related to the offering of the USD 2027 Notes and was partially offset by a gain of $12.9 million related to the change in the fair value of the derivative liability arising from the dividend adjustment mechanism of the Series A Preferred Stock and $0.5 million of unrealized foreign currency gains in the year. See Notes 9 and 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statement for more details on the Series A Preferred Stock dividend adjustment.\nOther expense, net for fiscal 2018 of $5.5 million was primarily driven by financing charges of $11.8 million related to the offering of the USD 2026 Notes and an amendment to the Credit Agreement, which included a $6.1 million charge for commitment fees paid during the first quarter of fiscal 2018, partially offset by $4.6 million of foreign currency gains in the fiscal year.\nProvision/(Benefit) for Income Taxes\nOur provision for income taxes for the twelve months ended June 30, 2019 was $22.9 million relative to earnings from operations before income taxes of $160.3 million. Our provision for income taxes for the twelve months ended June 30, 2018 was $68.4 million relative to earnings from operations before income taxes of $152.0 million. The income tax provision for the current period is not comparable to the same period of the prior year primarily due to the impact of the 2017 Tax Act, changes in pretax income over many jurisdictions, and the impact of discrete items, including equity compensation. Generally, fluctuations in our effective tax rate are due to changes in the geographic distribution of our pretax income resulting from our business mix and changes in the tax impact of permanent differences, restructuring, other special items, and other discrete tax items, including the reversal portion of the state valuation allowance, which may have unique tax implications depending on the nature of the item.\nSegment Review\nThe below charts depict the percentage of revenue from each of our four reporting segments for the previous two years. Refer below for discussions regarding the segments' revenue and EBITDA performance and to Non-GAAP Performance Metrics\u201d.\nOur results on a segment basis for the twelve months ended June 30, 2019

Net revenue remained consistent to the twelve months ended June 30, 2018, excluding the impact of divestitures. Volume increases across our consumer health portfolio within Europe were offset by strong price competition across the generic portion of our prescription product business in North America. Revenue in our consumer health business also decreased by 1%, across North America and Latin America, resulting from a shortage in our ibuprofen active pharmaceutical ingredient supply during the first 9 months of 2019, which was partially resolved in the fourth fiscal quarter.\nSoftgel Technologies' Segment EBITDA increased by $2.1 million, or 1%, compared to the twelve months ended June 30, 2018, excluding the impact of foreign exchange. Excluding the reduction of licensing revenue profit of 2%, segment EBITDA without divestitures increased 3%. The increase was primarily related to increased volume in the consumer health portfolio across Europe, offset by a shortage in our supply of ibuprofen active pharmaceutical ingredient during the first 9 months of 2019, which was partially resolved in the fourth fiscal quarter, which reduced Segment EBITDA by 3%.\nIn December 2017, we divested two manufacturing sites in Asia-Pacific in the Softgel Technologies segment in order to better streamline our global operations. The site divestitures resulted in a decrease to net revenue of 1% with no impact to segment EBITDA in the twelve months ended June 30, 2019 compared to the twelve months ended June 30, 2018.\nBiologics and Specialty Drug Delivery segment\nTable 19: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2019 vs. 2018 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Fiscal Year Ended\nJune 30, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Net Revenue </td> <td> </td> <td>Segment EBITDA </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenue / Segment EBITDA without acquisitions </td> <td>7 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impact of acquisitions </td> <td>17 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>24 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Constant currency change </td> <td>24 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>24 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Foreign exchange fluctuation </td> <td>(1) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>(1) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total % change </td> <td>23 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>23 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet revenue in our Biologics and Specialty Drug Delivery segment increased by $146.7 million, or 24%, compared to the twelve months ended June 30, 2018, excluding the impact of foreign exchange.

Segment EBITDA without acquisitions was in line with prior year, primarily due to strong U.S drug product and drug-substance end-market demand offset by the fiscal 2019 completion of a limited duration customer contract for non-cell line clinical manufacturing services in our U.S. drug substance platform as well as unfavorable product mix in our European specialty drug product platform.\nOn October 23, 2017, we acquired Catalent Indiana, which increased net revenue and Segment EBITDA on an inorganic basis in our Biologics and Specialty Drug Delivery segment by 12% and 17%, respectively, in the twelve months ended June 30, 2019 compared to the corresponding prior-year period.\nOn May 17, 2019, we acquired Paragon, which increased net revenue and Segment EBITDA on an inorganic basis in our Biologics and Specialty Drug Delivery segment by 5% and 7%, respectively, in the twelve months ended June 30, 2019 compared to the corresponding prior-year period.\nOral Drug Delivery segment\nTable 20: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2019 vs. 2018 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Fiscal Year Ended\nJune 30, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Net Revenue </td> <td> </td> <td>Segment EBITDA </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenue / Segment EBITDA without acquisitions </td> <td>(1) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>(5) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impact of acquisitions </td> <td>11 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>15 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Constant currency change </td> <td>10 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>10 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Foreign exchange fluctuation </td> <td>(2) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>(2) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total % Change </td> <td>8 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>8 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet revenue in our Oral Drug Delivery segment increased by $67.7 million, or 10%, compared to the twelve months ended June 30, 2018, excluding the impact of foreign exchange, primarily resulting from our Juniper acquisition. Revenue without acquisitions decreased 1%, primarily driven by decreased end-market demand for a key product within our U.S.-based commercial oral delivery solutions platform, partially offset by an increase related to the intake of new molecules within our development and analytical services platform, the completion of a commercially ready process for a key product within our U.S.-based oral delivery solutions platform and a favorable impact from licensing revenue recorded during the third quarter. The favorable impact of licensing revenue in the third quarter was attributable to a single transaction, which consisted of a grant to a third party of the Company's right to participate in an arrangement that resulted in a stream of revenue over time in exchange for a one-time up-front license fee.\nOral Drug Delivery's Segment EBITDA increased by $2.3 million, or 10%, compared to the twelve months ended June 30, 2018, excluding the impact of foreign exchange.
