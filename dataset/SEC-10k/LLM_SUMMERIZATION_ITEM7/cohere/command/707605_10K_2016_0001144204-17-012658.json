MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (MD&A) The following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of the Company should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of the Company including the related notes thereto, included elsewhere herein.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2016, 2015, AND 2014 2016 SUMMARY OVERVIEW: AmeriServ closed 2016 with its third consecutive profitable quarter while it continued to recover from the net loss of the first quarter. The Company reported net income for the fourth quarter of $1,150,000 or $0.06 earnings per share. When consolidated with the previous quarters of 2016, net income for the year was $2,310,000 or $0.12 per share. The fourth quarter was $85,000 above the third quarter of 2016, but $224,000 below the fourth quarter of 2015. These results reflect the continuing impact of the net loss recorded in the first quarter. We continue to take full responsibility for putting the expenses related to the Trust Company trading error, and our only loan to the energy industry, behind us immediately. AmeriServ's quick return to profitability tells us that these were self-contained events and therefore do not indicate any continuing risk to the Company.\nWe believe the marketplace agrees, net loans have begun to increase again and deposits closed the quarter at an all-time high and very near the $1 billion mark. However, even more encouraging was that the total revenue of the Trust Company was at an all-time high in the fourth quarter of 2016. It is also important to note that as 2016 ended, the level of non-performing assets was at the lowest level ever reported. We believe that our present balance sheet is well positioned for the higher level of interest rates which have developed since the November election. It is a fact that it was necessary to take corrective actions and such actions take time and money. Therefore, the fourth quarter level of operating expenses were $339,000 higher than the same period in 2015. As those expenses disappear, our focus on increasing revenues should show a very positive trend line.\nLooking to that speedy return to profitability, AmeriServ requested and received from the regulators their non-objection to implement a common stock repurchase program. This program could reduce the outstanding shares by almost one million, thus increasing the value of any continuing shares. This action following so soon after the cash dividend increase, announced in August, indicates our commitment to improving the return to our shareholders.\nYou may also recall that the Pennsylvania State Education Association has named AmeriServ as its preferred residential mortgage and consumer lender. Their 190,000 members can accomplish an entire residential mortgage transaction through a dedicated and centralized application center at AmeriServ. Since this program is functioning so well with Pennsylvania's schoolteachers, we are approaching other similar associations in the Keystone State. This effort combines our new proven procedures with our traditional personal service.\nAs you know this management team began its tour of duty in March of 2015. In the fourth quarter of 2016 they completed a three-year Strategic Plan to take AmeriServ to 2020. We believe that AmeriServ is an exceptionally clean franchise, a community bank with assets approaching one and one-quarter billion dollars, with a freestanding trust and wealth management subsidiary. The goal of this Board and this Management team is to build this franchise in both profitability and asset size. This new Strategic Plan is the road map that will be used in this effort. We intend to maintain our tradition of personal service while incorporating the best in new technology. The University Heights and State College locations are being updated for a better customer experience. These community bank offices will be equipped to accommodate the growing cohort of millennials, while maintaining the time-tested personal service our senior citizens expect and value. It is indeed an exciting time to be a community bank whose mission is to provide \u201cBanking for Life\u201d.\nA comment about the national and regional scene is warranted. The contentious national election is now behind us, but the road ahead is unclear. The Federal Reserve policies in recent years have not created a positive economic environment for community banks. The interest rate policies have lessened the support costs of the enormous national debt, but have created tremendous burdens for pensions, for savers and for\ncommunity banks. It is good that the existing Federal Reserve policies are beginning to be discussed, but thus far, there has been little tangible action to alleviate these difficult conditions. We decided some time ago on our preferred course of action. It is simply to maintain a conservative balance sheet with strong capital and deep liquidity. Also, we will strive for better than industry measures in our loan and securities portfolios. We think these guidelines, and the counter cyclical nature of our Trust Company, adds up to a strong Company in a struggling economy. There will be no \u201cbet the bank\u201d strategies at AmeriServ and we will remain poised for signs of an upturn in 2017.\nPERFORMANCE OVERVIEW... The following table summarizes some of the Company's key profitability performance indicators for each of the past three years.\nTable 20: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td>2014 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT\nPER SHARE DATA AND RATIOS) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net income </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> 2,310 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> 5,997 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> 3,023 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net income available to common shareholders </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,295 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,787 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,813 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Diluted earnings per share </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.12 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.31 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.15 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Return on average assets </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.20 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.54 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.29 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Return on average equity </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.30 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.10 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.61 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Company reported net income available to common shareholders of $2.3 million, or $0.12 per diluted common share, for 2016. This represented a 61% decrease in earnings per share from 2015 where net income available to common shareholders totaled $5.8 million, or $0.31 per diluted share. This reduction reflects, 1.) a substantially higher than typical provision for loan losses and net loan charge offs that were recorded in the first quarter of 2016 to resolve the Company's only meaningful direct loan exposure to the energy industry, 2.) a reduced level of net interest income that results from net interest margin compression, which is prevalent in the banking industry, as well as a lower level of loan prepayment fee income and additional interest expense related to the issuance of subordinated debt, and 3.) operating expenses increasing by $577,000, or 1.4% due to non-recurring costs for legal and accounting services that were necessary to address a trust operations trading error.\nThe Company reported net income available to common shareholders of $5.8 million, or $0.31 per diluted common share, for 2015. This represented a 107% increase in earnings per share from 2014 where net income available to common shareholders totalled $2.8 million, or $0.15 per diluted share. Factors causing this increase in earnings were solid loan and deposit growth in our community banking business which contributed to an increase of $1.3 million, or 3.9%, in net interest income while increasing revenue from our trust and wealth management business contributed to 6.6% growth in non-interest income in 2015. Additionally, operating expenses declined by $2.3 million, or 5.4%, as we improved the ongoing efficiency of the Company by successfully executing several profitability improvement initiatives.\nThe Company reported net income available to common shareholders of $2.8 million, or $0.15 per diluted common share, for 2014. This represented a 42.3% decrease in earnings per share from 2013 where net income available to common shareholders totalled $5.0 million, or $0.26 per diluted share. Factors contributing to this reduction in earnings were a $1.5 million unfavorable swing in the provision for loan losses, a $1.4 million reduction in non-interest revenue, and a $1.1 million increase in non-interest expense. The non-interest expense increase included a $669,000 goodwill impairment charge and a $376,000 fourth quarter pension charge related to 25 employees who elected to participate in an early retirement incentive program. These negative items were partially offset by a $1.2 million increase in net interest income due to continued growth of our loan portfolio while maintaining excellent asset quality.\nNET INTEREST INCOME AND MARGIN... The Company's net interest income represents the amount by which interest income on earning assets exceeds interest paid on interest bearing liabilities. Net interest income is a primary source of the Company's earnings; it is affected by interest rate fluctuations as well as changes in the amount and mix of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities. The following table summarizes the Company's net interest income performance for each of the past three years:\nTable 21: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td>2014 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT RATIOS) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Interest income </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> 41,869 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> 41,881 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> 40,441 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Interest expense </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,735 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,520 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,397 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net interest income </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>34,134 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>35,361 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>34,044 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net interest margin </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.26 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.49 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.52 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\n2016 NET INTEREST PERFORMANCE OVERVIEW... The Company's net interest income for the full year of 2016 decreased by $1,227,000, or 3.5%, when compared to the full year of 2015. The Company's net interest margin of 3.26% for the full year of 2016 was 23 basis points lower than the net interest margin of 3.49% for the full year of 2015. The 2016 reduction in net interest income has been significantly impacted by the following three factors: 1.) net interest margin compression that results from the prolonged low interest rate environment that exists in the economy and is pressuring community bank net interest margins, 2.) additional interest expense that was associated with the Company's late fourth quarter 2015 issuance of subordinated debt, and 3.) a significantly lower level of loan prepayment fee income, which decreased by approximately $300,000 for full year of 2016. These factors more than offset the Company's continued growth in earning assets and control of its cost of funds through disciplined deposit pricing. Specifically, the earning asset growth occurred in the loan portfolio as total loans averaged $888 million for the full year of 2016, which is $31 million, or 3.6%, higher than the $857 million average for the full year of 2015. This loan growth reflects the successful results of the Company's business development efforts, with an emphasis on generating commercial loans and owner occupied commercial real estate loans particularly through its loan production offices. However, loan interest income is $134,000, or 0.4%, lower for the full year of 2016 when compared to the full year of 2015 due primarily to the previously mentioned decline in loan prepayment fees between years. Interest income on short-term investments and investment securities grew by $122,000 or 3.1% for the full year as the Company benefited from a higher balance of investment securities in 2016. Overall, total interest income decreased by $12,000, or 0.03%, in 2016.\nThe Company experienced significant growth in deposits between years which is a reflection of the loyalty and stability of our core deposit base that provides a strong foundation upon which this growth builds. Management's ability to acquire new core deposit funding from outside of our traditional market areas as well as our ongoing efforts to offer new loan customers deposit products were the primary reasons for this growth. Specifically, total deposits averaged $956 million for the full year of 2016 which is $63 million, or 7.0%, higher than the $893 million average for the full year of 2015. The Company is also pleased that a meaningful portion of this deposit growth occurred in non-interest bearing demand deposit accounts. Deposit interest expense for the full year of 2016 increased by $648,000, or 13.6%, due to the higher balance of deposits along with certain money market accounts repricing upward after Federal Reserve fed funds interest rate increases. As a result of this strong deposit growth, the Company's loan to deposit ratio ended the year at 91.6% which indicates that the Company has ample room to further grow its loan portfolio in 2017.\nTotal interest expense increased for the full year of 2016 by $1,215,000, or 18.6%, as compared to 2015 due to higher levels of both borrowings and deposit interest expense. The Company experienced a $567,000 increase in the interest cost for borrowings in 2016, with $515,000 of this increase attributable to the Company's subordinated debt issuance which occurred late in December of 2015. Specifically, the Company issued $7.65 million of subordinated debt which has a 6.50% fixed interest rate. The proceeds from the subordinated debt issuance, along with other cash on hand, was used to redeem all $21 million of our outstanding SBLF preferred stock on January 27, 2016. The remainder of the increase in borrowings interest expense was due to a greater utilization of FHLB term advances to extend borrowings for interest rate risk management purposes.\nCOMPONENT CHANGES IN NET INTEREST INCOME: 2016 VERSUS 2015... Regarding the separate components of net interest income, the Company's total interest income in 2016 decreased by $12,000 when compared to 2015. This decrease was due to 1.) net interest margin compression that results from the prolonged low interest rate environment that exists in the economy and is pressuring community bank net interest margins, 2.) additional interest expense that was associated with the Company's late fourth quarter 2015 issuance of subordinated debt, and 3.) a significantly lower level of loan prepayment fee income, which decreased by approximately $300,000 for full year of 2016. This is evidenced by a $36.9 million increase in average earning assets due to increases in both average loans and average securities, which was more than offset by a 15 basis point decline in the earning asset yield from 4.14% to 3.99%. Within the earning asset base, total loan interest income decreased by $134,000 as the yield on the total loan portfolio decreased by 17 basis points from 4.44% to 4.27%. The greater level of total average loans in 2016 was more than offset by the impact of new loans having yields that are below the rate on the maturing instruments that they are replacing. Also negatively impacting loan interest income in 2016 was the reduced level of loan prepayment fee income. Investment securities interest revenue increased by $47,000 in 2016 due to a $2.3 million increase in the average investment securities portfolio. However, the yield on total investment securities decreased by one basis points from 2.67% to 2.66% due to net interest margin compression as well as an increase in premium amortization on mortgage backed securities, which resulted from an increase in mortgage prepayment speeds in 2016.\nThe Company's total interest expense for 2016 increased by $1.2 million, or 18.6%, when compared to 2015. Total interest bearing deposits increased by $51.2 million or 7.1% due to management's ability to acquire new core deposit funding from outside our traditional market areas as well as our ongoing efforts to offer new loan customers deposit products. The growth is also a reflection of the loyalty and stability of our core deposit base. Total interest bearing deposit interest expense increased by $648,000 in 2016 due to the higher volume of interest bearing deposits and an increase of four basis points in the cost of interest bearing deposits to 0.70%. Management continues to carefully price interest rates paid on all deposit categories. The Company experienced a $567,000 increase in the interest cost for borrowings in 2016, with $515,000 of this increase attributable to the Company's subordinated debt issuance which occurred late in December of 2015. The increase in borrowings interest expense is also reflective of a greater usage total average FHLB term advances. The Company has utilized term advances from the FHLB, with maturities ranging between three and five years, to help fund its earning asset growth and manage interest rate risk. The average balance of FHLB term advances has increased by $2.6 million while the average cost of these advances has increased by 11 basis point to 1.32%. Total FHLB borrowings, including overnight borrowed funds, averaged $57.8 million or 5.1% of total assets during 2016. Overall, total interest bearing funding costs increased by 10 basis points to 0.91%.\nOverall, the Company expects that it will need to continue to grow the earning assets to achieve net interest income growth in 2017 as net interest margin compression is expected to slow or bottom. Solid commercial pipelines suggest that the Company should be able to grow the loan portfolio in 2017 although we expect the pricing pressures on new commercial loans to continue to be intense.\n2015 NET INTEREST PERFORMANCE OVERVIEW... The Company's net interest income increased by $1.3 million, or 3.9%, for the full year of 2015 when compared to the full year 2014 as net interest margin compression was more than fully mitigated by earning asset growth, a greater level of prepayment fees on early loan payoffs and an increased dividend from the FHLB of Pittsburgh. The Company's net interest margin of 3.49% for the full year 2015 was three basis points lower than the net interest margin of 3.52% for the full year 2014. The earning asset growth occurred in the loan portfolio as total loans averaged $857 million for the full year of 2015 which is $52 million, or 6.5%, higher than the $805 million average for the full year of 2014. This loan growth reflects the successful results of the Company's sales calling efforts, with an emphasis on generating commercial loans and owner occupied commercial real estate loans particularly through its loan production offices in the stronger growth markets of Pittsburgh and Altoona in Pennsylvania, Hagerstown, Maryland. Overall, total interest income increased by $1.4 million, or 3.6%, for the full year 2015.\nTotal interest expense was well controlled in 2015 as it increased by $123,000, or 1.9%, for the full year of 2015 due to tight control of our cost of funds through disciplined deposit pricing. Total deposit interest expense decreased by $137,000, or 2.8%, in 2015 when compared to 2014. Even with this reduction in deposit costs, the Company continues to have a strong loyal core deposit base and success in cross-selling new loan customers into deposit products. Specifically, total deposits averaged $893 million for full year of 2015 which is $21 million, or 2.4%, higher than the $872 million average in 2014. The Company is pleased that a meaningful portion of this deposit growth occurred in non-interest bearing demand deposit accounts. This decreased interest expense for deposits has been more than offset by a $260,000 increase in the interest cost for borrowings as the Company has utilized more FHLB term advances to extend borrowings and provide protection against rising interest rates.\nCOMPONENT CHANGES IN NET INTEREST INCOME: 2015 VERSUS 2014... Regarding the separate components of net interest income, the Company's total interest income in 2015 increased by $1.4 million, or 3.6%, when compared to 2014. This increase was due to a $44.4 million increase in average earning assets due to an increase in average loans, partially offset by a four basis point decline in the earning asset yield from 4.18% to 4.14%. Within the earning asset base, the yield on the total loan portfolio decreased by eight basis points from 4.52% to 4.44% as a greater level of prepayment fees on early loan payoffs was more than offset by the impact from new loans having yields that are below the rate on the maturing instruments that they are replacing. However, the yield on total investment securities increased by seven basis points from 2.60% to 2.67% due to an increased dividend from the FHLB of Pittsburgh and a reduction in premium amortization on mortgage backed securities which resulted from a slowdown in mortgage prepayment speeds in 2015. Investment securities interest revenue declined by $223,000 in 2015 due to a $12 million decrease in the average investment securities portfolio as the Company has utilized cash flow from securities to help fund the previously mentioned loan growth.\nThe Company's total interest expense for 2015 increased by $123,000, or 1.9%, when compared to 2014. This increase in interest expense was due to an increased level of average FHLB borrowed funds which more than offset a lower cost of funds as the cost of interest bearing liabilities declined by one basis point to 0.81%. Management's strategy to carefully price interest rates paid on all deposit categories has not had a negative impact on deposit growth and reflects the loyalty of the bank's core deposit base. The overall cost of interest bearing deposits decreased by two basis points to 0.66% in spite of a $5.4 million increase in the total average volume. The Company utilized term advances from the FHLB, with maturities ranging between three and five years, to help fund its earning asset growth and manage interest rate risk. The average balance of FHLB term advances increased by $13 million while the average cost of these advances increased by 20 basis points to 1.21%. Overall, total FHLB borrowings averaged $71 million or 6.4% of total assets during 2015.\nThe table that follows provides an analysis of net interest income on a tax-equivalent basis setting forth (i) average assets, liabilities, and stockholders' equity, (ii) interest income earned on interest earning assets and interest expense paid on interest bearing liabilities, (iii) average yields earned on interest earning assets and average rates paid on interest bearing liabilities, (iv) interest rate spread (the difference between the average yield earned on interest earning assets and the average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities), and (v) net interest margin (net interest income as a percentage of average total interest earning assets). For purposes of these tables loan balances include non-accrual loans, and interest income on loans includes loan fees or amortization of such fees which have been deferred, as well as interest recorded on certain non-accrual loans as cash is received. Regulatory stock is included within available for sale investment securities for this analysis. Additionally, a tax rate of approximately 34% is used to compute tax-equivalent yields.\nTable 22: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>

The table below sets forth an analysis of volume and rate changes in net interest income on a tax-equivalent basis. For purposes of this table, changes in interest income and interest expense are allocated to volume and rate categories based upon the respective percentage changes in average balances and average rates. Changes in net interest income that could not be specifically identified as either a rate or volume change were allocated proportionately to changes in volume and changes in rate.\nTable 23: <table>

The Company's written lending policies require underwriting, loan documentation, and credit analysis standards to be met prior to funding any loan. After the loan has been approved and funded, continued periodic credit review is required. The Company's policy is to individually review, as circumstances warrant, each of its commercial and commercial mortgage loans to determine if a loan is impaired. At a minimum, credit reviews are mandatory for all commercial and commercial mortgage loan relationships with aggregate balances in excess of $250,000 within a 12-month period. The Company has also identified three pools of small dollar value homogeneous loans which are evaluated collectively for impairment. These separate pools are for small business relationships with aggregate balances of $250,000 or less, residential mortgage loans and consumer loans. Individual loans within these pools are reviewed and removed from the pool if factors such as significant delinquency in payments of 90 days or more, bankruptcy, or other negative economic concerns indicate impairment. The following table sets forth information concerning the Company's loan delinquency and other non-performing assets.\nTable 24: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>AT DECEMBER 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td>2014 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT PERCENTAGES) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total accruing loans past due 30 to 89 days </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> 3,278 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> 4,396 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> 2,643 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total non-accrual loans </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,603 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,066 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,195 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total non-performing assets including TDRs(1) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,624 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,297 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,917 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Loan delinquency as a percentage of total loans, net of unearned income </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.37 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.50 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.32 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Non-accrual loans as a percentage of total loans, net of unearned income </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.18 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.69 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.27 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Non-performing assets as a percentage of total loans, net of unearned income, and other real estate owned </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.18 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.71 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.35 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Non-performing assets as a percentage of total assets </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.14 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.55 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.27 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total classified loans (loans rated substandard or doubtful) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>6,039 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>8,566 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>11,229 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 25: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>(1) </td> <td>Non-performing assets are comprised of (i) loans that are on a non-accrual basis, (ii) loans that are contractually past due 90 days or more as to interest and principal payments, (iii) performing loans classified as troubled debt restructuring and (iv) other real estate owned. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Company continues to maintain excellent asset quality. Non-performing assets declined by $4.7 million since the prior year-end with the early in the year resolution of the Company's largest energy sector loan and now total $1.6 million, one of the lowest levels reported by the Company. The continued successful ongoing problem credit resolution efforts of the Company is demonstrated in the table above as levels of non-accrual loans, non-performing assets, classified loans and low loan delinquency levels are well below 1% of total loans. We continue to closely monitor the loan portfolio given the uneven recovery in the economy and the number of relatively large-sized commercial and CRE loans within the portfolio. As of December 31, 2016, the 25 largest credits represented 26.8% of total loans outstanding.\nALLOWANCE AND PROVISION FOR LOAN LOSSES... As described in more detail in the Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates section of this MD&A, the Company uses a comprehensive methodology and procedural discipline to maintain an ALL to absorb inherent losses in the loan portfolio. The Company believes this is a critical accounting policy since it involves significant estimates and judgments. The following table sets forth changes in the ALL and certain ratios for the periods ended.\nTable 26: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

$3,950,000 provision for loan losses compared to a $1,250,000 provision for loan losses for the full year of 2015 or an increase of $2.7 million between years. A substantially higher than typical provision and net loan charge-offs were recorded in the first quarter of 2016 and were necessary to resolve the Company's only meaningful direct loan exposure to the energy industry. These loans were related to a single borrower in the fracking industry who had filed for bankruptcy protection in the fourth quarter of 2015. The bankruptcy changed from Chapter 11 (reorganization) to Chapter 7 (liquidation),\nand the Company concluded that its previously established reserves on these non-accrual loans were not sufficient to cover the discounted collateral values that resulted from the liquidation process. As a result of this action, the Company also experienced heightened net loan charge-offs of $3.9 million, or 0.44%, of total loans in 2016, compared to net loan charge-offs of $952,000, or 0.11% of total loans, in 2015. Overall, the Company continued to maintain excellent asset quality. At December 31, 2016, non-performing assets totaled $1.6 million, or only 0.18% of total loans, which is down by $4.7 million from the prior year-end and is one of the lowest levels ever reported by the Company. In summary, the allowance for loan losses provided a strong 612% coverage of non-performing loans, and 1.12% of total loans, at December 31, 2016, compared to 158% coverage of non-performing loans, and 1.13% of total loans, at December 31, 2015. The Company presently expects that it will have a more typical loan loss provision in 2017. The expected lower provision will be necessary to cover loan charge-offs and support the anticipated growth in the loan portfolio.\nFor 2015, the Company recorded a $1,250,000 provision for loan losses which represented an increase of $875,000 when compared to the 2014 full year provision of $375,000. The higher provision that was needed this year was largely due to the transfer into non-accrual status of a $4.1 million loan to a customer in the fracking industry that filed for bankruptcy protection in the fourth quarter. The higher provision recorded in 2015 was also needed to support the continuing growth of the loan portfolio and cover net loan charge-offs. For the full year, there were net loan charge-offs of $952,000, or 0.11% of total loans, in 2015 compared to net loan charge-offs of $856,000, or 0.11% of total loans, in 2014. Overall, even with the fourth quarter increase in non-performing assets, the Company continued to maintain strong asset quality in 2015. At December 31, 2015, non-performing assets totaled $6.3 million, or 0.71% of total loans. When determining the provision for loan losses, the Company considers a number of factors, some of which include periodic credit reviews, non-performing assets, loan delinquency and charge-off trends, concentrations of credit, loan volume trends and broader local and national economic trends. In summary, the allowance for loan losses provided 158% coverage of non-performing loans, and 1.13% of total loans, at December 31, 2015, compared to 400% coverage of non-performing loans, and 1.16% of total loans, at December 31, 2014.\nThe following schedule sets forth the allocation of the ALL among various loan categories. This allocation is determined by using the consistent quarterly procedural discipline that was previously discussed. The entire ALL is available to absorb future loan losses in any loan category.\nTable 27: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>AT DECEMBER 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td>2014 </td> <td> </td> <td>2013 </td> <td> </td> <td>2012 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>AMOUNT </td> <td> </td> <td>PERCENT\nOF LOANS\nIN EACH\nCATEGORY\nTO TOTAL\nLOANS </td> <td> </td> <td>AMOUNT </td> <td> </td> <td>PERCENT\nOF LOANS\nIN EACH\nCATEGORY\nTO TOTAL\nLOANS </td> <td> </td> <td>AMOUNT </td> <td> </td> <td>PERCENT\nOF LOANS\nIN EACH\nCATEGORY\nTO TOTAL\nLOANS </td> <td> </td> <td>AMOUNT </td> <td> </td> <td>PERCENT\nOF LOANS\nIN EACH\nCATEGORY\nTO TOTAL\nLOANS </td> <td> </td> <td>AMOUNT </td> <td> </td> <td>PERCENT\nOF LOANS\nIN EACH\nCATEGORY\nTO TOTAL\nLOANS </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT PERCENTAGES) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Commercial </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> 4,041 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>19.3 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> 4,244 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>20.6 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> 3,262 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16.8 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> 2,844 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15.3 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> 2,596 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14.3 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Commercial loans secured by real estate </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,584 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>50.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,449 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>47.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,902 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>49.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,885 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>52.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,796 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>53.2 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Real estate-mortgage </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,169 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>28.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,173 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>29.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,310 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>31.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,260 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>30.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,269 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>30.2 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Consumer </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>151 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>151 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>190 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>136 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>150 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.3 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Allocation to general risk </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>987 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>904 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>959 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>979 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>760 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> 9,932 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> 9,921 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> 9,623 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> 10,104 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> 12,571 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nEven though residential real estate-mortgage loans comprise 28.1% of the Company's total loan portfolio, only $1.2 million or 11.8% of the total ALL is allocated against this loan category. The residential real estate-mortgage loan allocation is based upon the Company's three-year historical average of actual loan charge-offs experienced in that category and other qualitative factors. The disproportionately higher allocations for commercial loans and commercial loans secured by real estate reflect the increased credit risk associated with this type of lending, the Company's historical loss experience in these categories, and other qualitative factors. The large decline in the part of the allowance allocated to commercial loans secured by real estate reflects the continued asset quality improvements in this sector.\nBased on the Company's ALL methodology and the related assessment of the inherent risk factors contained within the Company's loan portfolio, we believe that the ALL is adequate at December 31, 2016 to cover losses within the Company's loan portfolio.\nNON-INTEREST INCOME... Non-interest income for 2016 totalled $14.6 million, a decrease of $629,000, or 4.1%, from 2015. Factors contributing to this lower level of non-interest income in 2016 included:\nTable 28: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td>a $942,000 decrease in Bank Owned Life Insurance (BOLI) revenue after the Company received four death claims in 2015 and there were no such claims in 2016. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 29: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td>a $201,000, or 8.6%, increase in other income as the Company benefited from additional revenue resulting from a more aggressive business development strategy within its Financial Services Division. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 30: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td>a $106,000 increase in revenue from investment security sale transactions as the Company recognized a higher level of gains on the sale of rapidly prepaying, low balance mortgage backed securities. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 31: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td>a $93,000, or 8.0%, increase in mortgage loan sale gains and mortgage related fees due to increased refinance activity and a comparable level of new mortgage loan originations when compared to 2015. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 32: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td>a $76,000, or 4.3%, decrease in service charges on deposit accounts due to fewer overdraft charges and account analysis fees as customers have generally maintained higher balances in their checking accounts in 2016. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nNon-interest income for 2015 totalled $15.3 million, an increase of $944,000, or 6.6%, from 2014.

The Company recorded income tax expense of $897,000, or an effective tax rate of 28.0%, in 2016 compared to the income tax expense of $2.3 million, or an effective tax rate of 28.1%, for 2015. The lower income tax expense and effective tax rate are due to the first quarter 2016 loss recognized by the Company. The Company's deferred tax asset was $10.7 million at December 31, 2016 and relates primarily to AMT carryforwards and the ALL.\nSEGMENT RESULTS... Retail banking's net income contribution was $3.0 million in 2016 and was comparable to the $3.0 million contribution in 2015 and $2.2 million in 2014. Net interest income was positively impacted by an increased funding benefit from the significant growth in deposits provided by this segment, which more than fully mitigated the ongoing net interest margin pressure from the continued low interest rate environment. The Retail segment also benefitted from increased efficiencies resulting in a lower overall level of non-interest expense. These positive items more than offset a lower level of non-interest income primarily resulting from decreased revenue from BOLI and reduced deposit service charges.\nThe commercial banking segment reported net income of $3.3 million in 2016 compared to net income of $5.4 million in 2015 and $4.2 million in 2014. The net income contribution for 2016 decreased as a result of the increased provision for loan losses due to the first quarter charge-off of the energy sector credit. Overhead expense was higher primarily due to increased incentive compensation and non-interest income was negatively impacted by the lower level of BOLI income. These unfavorable items more than offset strong growth in the commercial and commercial real estate loan portfolios which resulted in a higher level of net interest income.\nThe trust segment's net income contribution was $1.1 million in 2016 compared to $1.3 million in 2015 and $564,000 in 2014. The reduced net income contribution for 2016 was reflective of the non-recurring additional costs for legal and accounting services recognized in 2016 to address a trust operations trading error and resulted in higher professional fees and other expenses. These additional costs along with a lower level of Trust fee income more than offset successful new business development activities as well as effective management of existing customer accounts in this volatile market environment. Overall, the fair market value of trust assets under administration totaled $1.993 billion at December 31, 2016, an increase of $18 million, or 0.9%, from the December 31, 2015 total of $1.975 billion.\nThe investment/parent segment reported a net loss of $5.2 million in 2016, which was higher than the net loss of $3.8 million in 2015 and $3.9 million in 2014. Overall this segment has felt the most earnings pressure from the continued low interest rate environment. The lower level of BOLI income recognized by the Company in 2016 also significantly impacted this segment. Additionally, both the interest expense of the trust preferred securities and subordinated debt interest expense are allocated to this segment. Note that the first full year of interest expense associated with the subordinated debt occurred in 2016. The Company did generate investment security gains of $177,000 in 2016 and $71,000 in 2015 from the sale of certain low balance, rapidly prepaying mortgage backed securities which had a favorable impact on earnings in this segment.\nFor greater discussion on the future strategic direction of the Company's key business segments, see \u201cManagement's Discussion and Analysis - Forward Looking Statements.\u201d For a more detailed analysis of the segment results, see Footnote 21.\nBALANCE SHEET... The Company's total consolidated assets of $1.154 billion at December 31, 2016 grew by $5.3 million or 0.5% from the $1.148 billion level at December 31, 2015. This asset growth was due primarily to a $16.9 million or 12.0% increase in total investment securities in 2016. This investment securities increase was partially offset by a $16.1 million decrease in short term investments and cash used to redeem the SBLF preferred stock. Loan growth during this period was $2.9 million or 0.3%, which is lower than the 2015 level due to lower levels of production in the months leading up to the presidential election that was caused by uncertainty in the market. However, loan production in the first six months of 2016 and after the election was at more typical levels due to continued successful results of the Company's intensive sales calling efforts with an emphasis on generating commercial loans and owner occupied CRE loans particularly through its loan production offices.\nThe Company also funded the previously mentioned asset growth by increasing deposits ($64 million), partially offset by a reduction in FHLB borrowings ($38 million). The FHLB term advances, with maturities between 3 and 5 years, now total $46 million as the Company has utilized these advances to help mitigate interest rate risk. Other liabilities increased by $2.8 million due to an increase in the Company's pension liability. Total stockholders' equity decreased by $23.6 million since year-end 2015 mainly due to the redemption of $21 million of preferred stock from the US Treasury under the SBLF program. The Company continues to be considered well capitalized for regulatory purposes with a risk based capital ratio of 13.15% and an asset leverage ratio of 9.35% at December 31, 2016. The Company's book value per common share was $5.05, its tangible book value per common share was $4.41 and its tangible common equity to tangible assets ratio was 7.31% at December 31, 2016.\nLIQUIDITY... The Company's liquidity position has been strong during the last several years. Our core retail deposit base has grown over the past four years and has been adequate to fund the Company's operations. Cash flow from maturities, prepayments and amortization of securities was also used to help fund loan growth. We strive to operate our loan to deposit ratio in a range of 85% to 100%. At December 31, 2016, the Company's loan to deposit ratio was 91.6%. Given current commercial loan pipelines and the continued development of our four existing loan production offices, we are optimistic that we can grow our loan to deposit ratio and remain within our guideline parameters.\nLiquidity can also be analyzed by utilizing the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. Cash and cash equivalents decreased by $14.4 million from December 31, 2015, to December 31, 2016, due to $25.2 million of cash used in investing activities. This was partially offset by $6.7 million of cash provided by operating activities and $4.1 million provided by financing activities. Within investing activities, cash advanced for new loan fundings and purchases totalled $214.2 million and was $5.8 million higher than the $208.4 million of cash received from loan principal payments and sales. Within financing activities, deposits increased by $64.5 million, which was used to help fund the overall loan growth experienced in 2016. Total FHLB borrowings decreased as advances, both short-term and long term, were reduced by $38.5 million. Early in 2016 the Company redeemed the $21 million preferred stock issued to the US Treasury under the SBLF program.\nThe holding company had a total of $11.5 million of cash, short-term investments, and investment securities at December 31, 2016. Additionally, dividend payments from our subsidiaries can also provide ongoing cash to the holding company. At December 31, 2016, our subsidiary Bank had $3.5 million of cash available for immediate dividends to the holding company under applicable regulatory formulas. As such, the holding company has strong liquidity to meet its trust preferred debt service requirements, its subordinated debt interest payments, its common stock dividends, and support its common stock repurchase program, which in total should approximate $4.9 million over the next twelve months.\nFinancial institutions must maintain liquidity to meet day-to-day requirements of depositors and borrowers, take advantage of market opportunities, and provide a cushion against unforeseen needs. Liquidity needs can be met by either reducing assets or increasing liabilities. Sources of asset liquidity are provided by short-term investment securities, time deposits with banks, federal funds sold, and short-term investments in money market funds. These assets totaled $38 million and $45 million at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Maturing and repaying loans, as well as the monthly cash flow associated with mortgage-backed securities and security maturities are other significant sources of asset liquidity for the Company.\nLiability liquidity can be met by attracting deposits with competitive rates, using repurchase agreements, buying federal funds, or utilizing the facilities of the Federal Reserve or the FHLB systems. The Company utilizes a variety of these methods of liability liquidity. Additionally, the Company's subsidiary bank is a member of the FHLB, which provides the opportunity to obtain short- to longer-term advances based upon the Company's investment in assets secured by one- to four-family residential real estate. At December 31, 2016, the Company had $402 million of overnight borrowing availability at the FHLB, $29 million of short-term borrowing availability at the Federal Reserve Bank and $39 million of unsecured federal funds lines with correspondent banks. The Company believes it has ample liquidity available to fund outstanding loan commitments if they were fully drawn upon.\nCAPITAL RESOURCES... The Company meaningfully exceeds all regulatory capital ratios for each of the periods presented and is considered well capitalized. The asset leverage ratio was 9.35% and the risk based capital ratio was 13.15% at December 31, 2016. We anticipate that we will maintain our strong capital ratios throughout 2017. Capital generated from earnings will be utilized to pay the common stock cash dividend, support the stock repurchase program and will also support anticipated balance sheet growth. Our common dividend payout ratio for the full year 2016 was 41.2%. Late in 2015, the Company issued $7.65 million of subordinated debt which qualifies as Tier 2 capital for regulatory capital calculation purposes. In the first quarter of 2016, we used the net proceeds from the subordinated debt issuance along with a meaningful portion of holding company cash to redeem the SBLF preferred stock prior to the interest rate on the SBLF increasing from 1% to 9%. In the third quarter of 2016, the Company increased its common stock dividend by $0.005 to $0.015 per common share. Total Parent Company cash was $11.5 million at December 31, 2016.\nThe Company's Board of Directors approved a new common stock repurchase program which calls for AmeriServ Financial, Inc. to buy back up to 5% or approximately 945,000 shares of its outstanding common stock during the next 18 months. The shares may be purchased from time to time in open market, privately negotiated, or block transactions. This common stock repurchase program does not obligate the Company to acquire any specific number of shares and may be modified, suspended or discontinued at any time. As of December 31, 2016, the Company had approximately 18.9 million shares of its common stock outstanding.\nOn January 1, 2015, U.S. federal banking agencies implemented the new Basel III capital standards, which establish the minimum capital levels to be considered well-capitalized and revise the prompt corrective action requirements under banking regulations. The revisions from the previous standards include a revised definition of capital, the introduction of a minimum Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio and changed risk weightings for certain assets. The implementation of the new rules will be phased in over a four year period ending January 1, 2019 with minimum capital requirements becoming increasingly more strict each year of the transition. The new minimum capital requirements for each ratio, both, initially on January 1, 2015 and at the end of the transition on January 1, 2019, are as follows: A common equity tier 1 capital ratio of 4.5% initially and 7.0% at January 1, 2019; a tier 1 capital ratio of 6.0% and 8.50%; a total capital ratio of 8.0% and 10.50%; and a tier 1 leverage ratio of 5.00% and 5.00%. Under the new rules, in order to avoid limitations on capital distributions (including dividend payments and certain discretionary bonus payments to executive officers), a banking organization must hold a capital conservation buffer above its minimum risk-based capital requirements, which increases over the transition period, from 0.625% of total risk weighted assets in 2016 to 2.5% in 2019. The Company continues to be committed to maintaining strong capital levels that exceed regulatory requirements while also supporting balance sheet growth and providing a return to our shareholders.\nThe Company's capital position will be more than adequate to meet the revised regulatory capital requirements.\nINTEREST RATE SENSITIVITY... Asset/liability management involves managing the risks associated with changing interest rates and the resulting impact on the Company's net interest income, net income and capital. The management and measurement of interest rate risk at the Company is performed by using the following tools: 1) simulation modeling, which analyzes the impact of interest rate changes on net interest income, net income and capital levels over specific future time periods. The simulation modeling forecasts earnings under a variety of scenarios that incorporate changes in the absolute level of interest rates, the shape\nof the yield curve, prepayments and changes in the volumes and rates of various loan and deposit categories. The simulation modeling incorporates assumptions about reinvestment and the repricing characteristics of certain assets and liabilities without stated contractual maturities; 2) market value of portfolio equity sensitivity analysis, and 3) static GAP analysis, which analyzes the extent to which interest rate sensitive assets and interest rate sensitive liabilities are matched at specific points in time. The overall interest rate risk position and strategies are reviewed by senior management and the Company's Board on an ongoing basis.\nThe following table presents a summary of the Company's static GAP positions at December 31, 2016:\nTable 43: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>INTEREST SENSITIVITY PERIOD </td> <td> </td> <td>3 MONTHS\nOR LESS </td> <td> </td> <td>OVER\n3 MONTHS\nTHROUGH\n6 MONTHS </td> <td> </td> <td>OVER\n6 MONTHS\nTHROUGH\n1 YEAR </td> <td> </td> <td>OVER\n1 YEAR </td> <td> </td> <td>TOTAL </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT RATIOS AND PERCENTAGES) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>RATE SENSITIVE ASSETS:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Loans and loans held for sale </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> 270,021 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> 67,271 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> 97,093 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> 452,473 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> 886,858 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Investment securities </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>35,008 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,920 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9,791 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>108,023 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>157,742 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Short-term assets </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,966 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,966 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Regulatory stock </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,359 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,125 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,484 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Bank owned life insurance </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>37,903 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>37,903 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total rate sensitive assets </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> 317,354 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> 72,191 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> 144,787 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> 562,621 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> 1,096,953 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>RATE SENSITIVE LIABILITIES:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Deposits:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Non-interest bearing deposits </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> -

We continue to see loan customer preference for fixed rate loans given the overall low level of interest rates. Also, we have extended some term advances with the FHLB to help manage our interest rate risk position. Overall, the absolute low level of short interest rates makes this table more difficult to analyze since there is little room for certain deposit liabilities to reprice downward further.\nManagement places primary emphasis on simulation modeling to manage and measure interest rate risk. The Company's asset/liability management policy seeks to limit net interest income variability over the first twelve months of the forecast period to +/-7.5%, which include interest rate movements of 200 basis points. Additionally, the Company also uses market value sensitivity measures to further evaluate the balance sheet exposure to changes in interest rates. The Company monitors the trends in market value of portfolio equity sensitivity analysis on a quarterly basis.\nThe following table presents an analysis of the sensitivity inherent in the Company's net interest income and market value of portfolio equity. The interest rate scenarios in the table compare the Company's base forecast, which was prepared using a flat interest rate scenario, to scenarios that reflect immediate interest rate changes of 100 and 200 basis points. Note that we suspended the 200 basis point downward rate shock since it has little value due to the absolute low level of interest rates. Each rate scenario contains unique prepayment and repricing assumptions that are applied to the Company's existing balance sheet that was developed under the flat interest rate scenario.\nTable 44: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>INTEREST RATE SCENARIO </td> <td> </td> <td>VARIABILITY\nOF NET\nINTEREST\nINCOME </td> <td> </td> <td>CHANGE IN\nMARKET\nVALUE OF\nPORTFOLIO\nEQUITY </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>200 bp increase </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.6 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>20.5 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>100 bp increase </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11.9 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>100 bp decrease </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(3.0 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(16.8 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Company believes that its overall interest rate risk position is well controlled. The variability of net interest income is positive in the upward rate shocks due to the Company's short duration investment securities portfolio and scheduled repricing of loans tied to LIBOR or prime. Also, the Company expects that it will not have to reprice its core deposit accounts up as quickly when interest rates rise. The variability of net interest income is negative in the 100 basis point downward rate scenario as the Company has more exposure to assets repricing downward to a greater extent than liabilities due to the absolute low level of interest rates with the fed funds rate currently at a targeted range of 0.50% to 0.75%. The market value of portfolio equity increases in the upward rate shocks due to the improved value of the Company's core deposit base. Negative variability of market value of portfolio equity occurs in the downward rate shock due to a reduced value for core deposits.\nWithin the investment portfolio at December 31, 2016, 81% of the portfolio is classified as available for sale and 19% as held to maturity. The available for sale classification provides management with greater flexibility to manage the securities portfolio to better achieve overall balance sheet rate sensitivity goals and provide liquidity if needed. The mark to market of the available for sale securities does inject more volatility in the book value of equity, but has no impact on regulatory capital. There are 101 securities that are temporarily impaired at December 31, 2016. The Company reviews its securities quarterly and has asserted that at December 31, 2016, the impaired value of securities represents temporary declines due to movements in interest rates and the Company does have the ability and intent to hold those securities to maturity or to allow a market recovery. Furthermore, it is the Company's intent to manage its long-term interest rate risk by continuing to sell newly originated fixed-rate 30-year mortgage loans into the secondary market (excluding construction and any jumbo loans). The Company also sells 15-year fixed-rate mortgage loans into the secondary market as well, depending on market conditions. For the year 2016, 83% of all residential mortgage loan production was sold into the secondary market.\nThe amount of loans outstanding by category as of December 31, 2016, which are due in (i) one year or less, (ii) more than one year through five years, and (iii) over five years, are shown in the following table. Loan balances are also categorized according to their sensitivity to changes in interest rates.\nTable 45: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>ONE YEAR\nOR LESS </td> <td> </td> <td>MORE THAN\nONE YEAR\nTHROUGH\nFIVE YEARS </td> <td> </td> <td>OVER FIVE\nYEARS </td> <td> </td> <td>TOTAL\nLOANS </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT RATIOS) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Commercial </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> 50,851 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> 75,587 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> 45,091 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> 171,529 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Commercial loans secured by real estate </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>49,262 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>132,941 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>264,395 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>446,598 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Real estate-mortgage </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>23,051 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>58,722 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>167,086 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>248,859 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Consumer </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,546 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,385 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,941 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>19,872 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> 130,710 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> 271,635 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> 484,513 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> 886,858 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Loans with fixed-rate </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> 41,707 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> 123,926 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> 258,286 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> 423,919 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Loans with floating-rate </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>89,003 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>147,709 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>226,227 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>462,939 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> 130,710 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> 271,635 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> 484,513 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> 886,858 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Percent composition of maturity </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14.7 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>30.6 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>54.6 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Fixed-rate loans as a percentage of total\nloans </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>47.8 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Floating-rate loans as a percentage of total loans </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>52.2 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe loan maturity information is based upon original loan terms and is not adjusted for principal paydowns and rollovers.

The Company incurs off-balance sheet risks in the normal course of business in order to meet the financing needs of its customers. These risks derive from commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit. Such commitments and standby letters of credit involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit risk in excess of the amount recognized in the consolidated financial statements. The Company's exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to these commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit is represented by their contractual\namounts. The Company uses the same credit and collateral policies in making commitments and conditional obligations as for all other lending. The Company had various outstanding commitments to extend credit approximating $160.5 million and standby letters of credit of $8.5 million as of December 31, 2016. The Company can also use various interest rate contracts, such as interest rate swaps, caps, floors and swaptions to help manage interest rate and market valuation risk exposure, which is incurred in normal recurrent banking activities. The Company had no interest rate contracts outstanding as of December 31, 2016.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES... The accounting and reporting policies of the Company are in accordance with GAAP and conform to general practices within the banking industry. Accounting and reporting policies for the ALL, goodwill, income taxes, and investment securities are deemed critical because they involve the use of estimates and require significant management judgments. Application of assumptions different than those used by the Company could result in material changes in the Company's financial position or results of operation.\nACCOUNT - Allowance for loan losses\nBALANCE SHEET REFERENCE - Allowance for loan losses\nINCOME STATEMENT REFERENCE - Provision (credit) for loan losses\nDESCRIPTION\nThe allowance for loan losses is calculated with the objective of maintaining reserve levels believed by management to be sufficient to absorb estimated probable credit losses. Management's determination of the adequacy of the allowance is based on periodic evaluations of the credit portfolio and other relevant factors. However, this quarterly evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires material estimates, including, among others, likelihood of customer default, loss given default, exposure at default, the amounts and timing of expected future cash flows on impaired loans, value of collateral, estimated losses on consumer loans and residential mortgages, and general amounts for historical loss experience. This process also considers economic conditions, uncertainties in estimating losses and inherent risks in the various credit portfolios. All of these factors may be susceptible to significant change. Also, the allocation of the allowance for credit losses to specific loan pools is based on historical loss trends and management's judgment concerning those trends.\nCommercial and CRE loans are the largest category of credits and the most sensitive to changes in assumptions and judgments underlying the determination of the ALL. Approximately $7.6 million, or 77%, of the total ALL at December 31, 2016 has been allocated to these two loan categories. This allocation also considers other relevant factors such as actual versus estimated losses, economic trends, delinquencies, levels of non-performing and Troubled Debt Restructured (TDR) loans, concentrations of credit, trends in loan volume, experience and depth of management, examination and audit results, effects of any changes in lending policies and trends in policy, financial information and documentation exceptions. To the extent actual outcomes differ from management estimates, additional provision for loan losses may be required that would adversely impact earnings in future periods.\nACCOUNT - Goodwill\nBALANCE SHEET REFERENCE - Goodwill\nINCOME STATEMENT REFERENCE - Goodwill impairment\nDESCRIPTION\nThe Company considers our accounting policies related to goodwill to be critical because the assumptions or judgment used in determining the fair value of assets and liabilities acquired in past acquisitions are subjective and complex. As a result, changes in these assumptions or judgment could have a significant impact on our financial condition or results of operations.\nThe fair value of acquired assets and liabilities, including the resulting goodwill, was based either on quoted market prices or provided by other third party sources, when available. When third party information was not available, estimates were made in good faith by management primarily through the use of internal cash flow modeling techniques. The assumptions that were used in the cash flow modeling were subjective\nand are susceptible to significant changes. The Company routinely utilizes the services of an independent third party that is regarded within the banking industry as an expert in valuing core deposits to monitor the ongoing value and changes in the Company's core deposit base. These core deposit valuation updates are based upon specific data provided from statistical analysis of the Company's own deposit behavior to estimate the duration of these non-maturity deposits combined with market interest rates and other economic factors.\nGoodwill arising from business combinations represents the value attributable to unidentifiable intangible elements in the business acquired. The Company's goodwill relates to value inherent in the banking and wealth management businesses, and the value is dependent upon the Company's ability to provide quality, cost-effective services in the face of free competition from other market participants on a regional basis. This ability relies upon continuing investments in processing systems, the development of value-added service features and the ease of use of the Company's services. As such, goodwill value is supported ultimately by revenue that is driven by the volume of business transacted and the loyalty of the Company's deposit and customer base over a longer time frame. The quality and value of a Company's assets is also an important factor to consider when performing goodwill impairment testing. A decline in earnings as a result of a lack of growth or the inability to deliver cost-effective value added services over sustained periods can lead to impairment of goodwill.\nGoodwill which has an indefinite useful life is tested for impairment at least annually and written down and charged to results of operations only in periods in which the recorded value is more than the estimated fair value.\nThe Company recorded a $669,000 impairment charge as a result of a goodwill impairment analysis performed in the third quarter of 2014. A qualitative assessment of WCCA indicated that it was more likely than not that the carrying value of WCCA exceeded its fair value. As such, the Company then performed the necessary two-step impairment test. In Step 1, we determined the carrying value of WCCA, including the goodwill, and compared it to the estimated fair value of WCCA. The results of Step 1 indicated that the carrying value of the goodwill exceeded the fair value so it was necessary to move to Step 2 where we measured the amount of the impairment loss. After performing Step 2, we determined that the implied value of the goodwill was less than its carrying costs, which caused us to record an impairment charge of $669,000 in the third quarter of 2014. Overall, the voluntary departure of WCCA's former CEO and the related litigation against him for violations of his employment agreement, caused disruption within the WCCA customer base during 2014. This disruption ultimately led to the loss of certain clients and a reduction in the projected earnings capacity of WCCA. These were the key facts and circumstances that led to the goodwill impairment charge in the third quarter of 2014. The Company utilized a discounted cash flow model along with a valuation technique based upon a multiple of revenues to estimate the fair value of WCCA. In 2015, WCCA returned to profitability, stabilized earnings, and then increased earnings in 2016, which reflected that no impairment charge was necessary.\nACCOUNT - Income Taxes\nBALANCE SHEET REFERENCE - Net deferred tax asset\nINCOME STATEMENT REFERENCE - Provision for income taxes\nDESCRIPTION\nThe provision for income taxes is the sum of income taxes both currently payable and deferred. The changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based upon the changes in differences between the basis of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the basis of assets and liabilities as measured by the enacted tax rates that management estimates will be in effect when the differences reverse. This income tax review is completed on a quarterly basis.\nIn relation to recording the provision for income taxes, management must estimate the future tax rates applicable to the reversal of tax differences, make certain assumptions regarding whether tax differences are permanent or temporary and the related timing of the expected reversal. Also, estimates are made as to whether taxable operating income in future periods will be sufficient to fully recognize any gross deferred tax assets. If recovery is not likely, we must increase our provision for taxes by recording a valuation allowance\nagainst the deferred tax assets that we estimate will not ultimately be recoverable. Alternatively, we may make estimates about the potential usage of deferred tax assets that decrease our valuation allowances. As of December 31, 2016, we believe that all of the deferred tax assets recorded on our balance sheet will ultimately be recovered and that no valuation allowances were needed.\nIn addition, the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations. We recognize liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. If we ultimately determine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary, we reverse the liability and recognize a tax benefit during the period in which we determine that the liability is no longer necessary. We record an additional charge in our provision for taxes in the period in which we determine that the recorded tax liability is less than we expect the ultimate assessment to be.\nACCOUNT - Investment Securities\nBALANCE SHEET REFERENCE - Investment securities\nINCOME STATEMENT REFERENCE - Net realized gains (losses) on investment securities\nDESCRIPTION\nAvailable-for-sale and held-to-maturity securities are reviewed quarterly for possible other-than-temporary impairment. The review includes an analysis of the facts and circumstances of each individual investment such as the severity of loss, the length of time the fair value has been below cost, the expectation for that security's performance, the creditworthiness of the issuer and the Company's intent and ability to hold the security to recovery. A decline in value that is considered to be other-than-temporary is recorded as a loss within non-interest income in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. At December 31, 2016, the unrealized losses in the available-for-sale security portfolio were comprised of securities issued by government agencies or government sponsored agencies and certain high quality corporate securities. The Company believes the unrealized losses are primarily a result of increases in market yields from the time of purchase. In general, as market yields rise, the value of securities will decrease; as market yields fall, the fair value of securities will increase. Management generally views changes in fair value caused by changes in interest rates as temporary; therefore, these securities have not been classified as other-than-temporarily impaired. Management has also concluded that based on current information we expect to continue to receive scheduled interest payments as well as the entire principal balance. Furthermore, management does not intend to sell these securities and does not believe it will be required to sell these securities before they recover in value.\nFORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS... THE STRATEGIC FOCUS:\nThe challenge for the future is to improve earnings performance to peer levels through a disciplined focus on community banking and improving the profitability of our Trust Company. In accordance with our strategic plan, the Company will maintain its focus as a community bank delivering banking and trust services to the best of our ability and focus on further growing revenues by leveraging our strong capital base and infrastructure. This Company will not succumb to the lure of quick fixes and fancy financial gimmicks. It is our plan to continue to build the Company into a potent banking force in this region and in this industry. Our focus encompasses the following:\nTable 48: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td>Customer Service - It is the existing and prospective customer that the Company must satisfy. This means good products and fair prices. But it also means quick response time and professional competence. It means speedy problem resolution and a minimizing of bureaucratic frustrations. The Company is training and motivating its staff to meet these standards while providing customers with more banking options that involve leading technologies such as computers, smartphones, and tablets to conduct business. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 49: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td>Revenue Growth - It is necessary for the Company to focus on growing revenues. This means loan growth, deposit growth and fee growth. It also means close coordination among all customer service areas so our revenue producing products can be tailored to meet the needs of existing and prospective customers. The Company's Strategic Plan contains action plans in each of these areas </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 50: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>particularly on increasing loans through several loan production offices. The Strategic Plan also states that purchases of investment securities will become more diverse and include high quality corporate and taxable municipal securities while continuing to purchase federal agency mortgage backed securities that provide a return consistent with the market as well as asset cash flow liquidity. An examination of the peer bank database provides ample proof that a well-executed community banking business model can generate a reliable and rewarding revenue stream. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 51: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u2022 </td> <td>Expense Rationalization - The Company remains focused on trying to reduce and rationalize expenses. This has not been a program of broad based cuts, but has been targeted so the Company stays strong but spends less. It is critical to be certain that future expenditures are directed to areas that are playing a positive role in the drive to improve revenues. The Company also recently completed three additional initiatives that will further reduce non-interest expenses and improve the Company's future profitability. Specifically, at the end of the first quarter of 2016, the Company had closed its Southern Atherton branch office in the State College market and consolidated the retail customer accounts from this branch into its nearby and newer branch office located on North Atherton Street. The Company remains committed to the State College market, and this change will allow for a more efficient operation that will allow us to better compete in this demographically attractive but highly competitive banking market. The Company also realigned its executive leadership team by eliminating one senior position in its executive office. Finally, the Company recently announced the closure of its Harrisonburg, Virginia loan production office. We anticipate that the combined annual cost savings from these profitability improvement initiatives will approximate $1.2 million. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThis Form 10-K contains various forward-looking statements and includes assumptions concerning the Company's beliefs, plans, objectives, goals, expectations, anticipations, estimates, intentions, operations, future results, and prospects, including statements that include the words \u201cmay,\u201d \u201ccould,\u201d \u201cshould,\u201d \u201cwould,\u201d \u201cbelieve,\u201d \u201cexpect,\u201d \u201canticipate,\u201d \u201cestimate,\u201d \u201cintend,\u201d \u201cproject,\u201d \u201cplan\u201d or similar expressions.

    "item_7_text": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (MD&A) The following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of the Company should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of the Company including the related notes thereto, included elsewhere herein.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2016, 2015, AND 2014 2016 SUMMARY OVERVIEW: AmeriServ closed 2016 with its third consecutive profitable quarter while it continued to recover from the net loss of the first quarter. The Company reported net income for the fourth quarter of $1,150,000 or $0.06 earnings per share. When consolidated with the previous quarters of 2016, net income for the year was $2,310,000 or $0.12 per share. The fourth quarter was $85,000 above the third quarter of 2016, but $224,000 below the fourth quarter of 2015. These results reflect the continuing impact of the net loss recorded in the first quarter. We continue to take full responsibility for putting the expenses related to the Trust Company trading error, and our only loan to the energy industry, behind us immediately. AmeriServ's quick return to profitability tells us that these were self-contained events and therefore do not indicate any continuing risk to the Company.\nWe believe the marketplace agrees, net loans have begun to increase again and deposits closed the quarter at an all-time high and very near the $1 billion mark. However, even more encouraging was that the total revenue of the Trust Company was at an all-time high in the fourth quarter of 2016. It is also important to note that as 2016 ended, the level of non-performing assets was at the lowest level ever reported. We believe that our present balance sheet is well positioned for the higher level of interest rates which have developed since the November election. It is a fact that it was necessary to take corrective actions and such actions take time and money. Therefore, the fourth quarter level of operating expenses were $339,000 higher than the same period in 2015. As those expenses disappear, our focus on increasing revenues should show a very positive trend line.\nLooking to that speedy return to profitability, AmeriServ requested and received from the regulators their non-objection to implement a common stock repurchase program. This program could reduce the outstanding shares by almost one million, thus increasing the value of any continuing shares. This action following so soon after the cash dividend increase, announced in August, indicates our commitment to improving the return to our shareholders.\nYou may also recall that the Pennsylvania State Education Association has named AmeriServ as its preferred residential mortgage and consumer lender. Their 190,000 members can accomplish an entire residential mortgage transaction through a dedicated and centralized application center at AmeriServ. Since this program is functioning so well with Pennsylvania's schoolteachers, we are approaching other similar associations in the Keystone State. This effort combines our new proven procedures with our traditional personal service.\nAs you know this management team began its tour of duty in March of 2015. In the fourth quarter of 2016 they completed a three-year Strategic Plan to take AmeriServ to 2020. We believe that AmeriServ is an exceptionally clean franchise, a community bank with assets approaching one and one-quarter billion dollars, with a freestanding trust and wealth management subsidiary. The goal of this Board and this Management team is to build this franchise in both profitability and asset size. This new Strategic Plan is the road map that will be used in this effort. We intend to maintain our tradition of personal service while incorporating the best in new technology. The University Heights and State College locations are being updated for a better customer experience. These community bank offices will be equipped to accommodate the growing cohort of millennials, while maintaining the time-tested personal service our senior citizens expect and value. It is indeed an exciting time to be a community bank whose mission is to provide \u201cBanking for Life\u201d.\nA comment about the national and regional scene is warranted. The contentious national election is now behind us, but the road ahead is unclear. The Federal Reserve policies in recent years have not created a positive economic environment for community banks. The interest rate policies have lessened the support costs of the enormous national debt, but have created tremendous burdens for pensions, for savers and for\ncommunity banks. It is good that the existing Federal Reserve policies are beginning to be discussed, but thus far, there has been little tangible action to alleviate these difficult conditions. We decided some time ago on our preferred course of action. It is simply to maintain a conservative balance sheet with strong capital and deep liquidity. Also, we will strive for better than industry measures in our loan and securities portfolios. We think these guidelines, and the counter cyclical nature of our Trust Company, adds up to a strong Company in a struggling economy. There will be no \u201cbet the bank\u201d strategies at AmeriServ and we will remain poised for signs of an upturn in 2017.\nPERFORMANCE OVERVIEW... The following table summarizes some of the Company's key profitability performance indicators for each of the past three years.\n\nThe Company reported net income available to common shareholders of $2.3 million, or $0.12 per diluted common share, for 2016. This represented a 61% decrease in earnings per share from 2015 where net income available to common shareholders totaled $5.8 million, or $0.31 per diluted share. This reduction reflects, 1.) a substantially higher than typical provision for loan losses and net loan charge offs that were recorded in the first quarter of 2016 to resolve the Company's only meaningful direct loan exposure to the energy industry, 2.) a reduced level of net interest income that results from net interest margin compression, which is prevalent in the banking industry, as well as a lower level of loan prepayment fee income and additional interest expense related to the issuance of subordinated debt, and 3.) operating expenses increasing by $577,000, or 1.4% due to non-recurring costs for legal and accounting services that were necessary to address a trust operations trading error.\nThe Company reported net income available to common shareholders of $5.8 million, or $0.31 per diluted common share, for 2015. This represented a 107% increase in earnings per share from 2014 where net income available to common shareholders totalled $2.8 million, or $0.15 per diluted share. Factors causing this increase in earnings were solid loan and deposit growth in our community banking business which contributed to an increase of $1.3 million, or 3.9%, in net interest income while increasing revenue from our trust and wealth management business contributed to 6.6% growth in non-interest income in 2015. Additionally, operating expenses declined by $2.3 million, or 5.4%, as we improved the ongoing efficiency of the Company by successfully executing several profitability improvement initiatives.\nThe Company reported net income available to common shareholders of $2.8 million, or $0.15 per diluted common share, for 2014. This represented a 42.3% decrease in earnings per share from 2013 where net income available to common shareholders totalled $5.0 million, or $0.26 per diluted share. Factors contributing to this reduction in earnings were a $1.5 million unfavorable swing in the provision for loan losses, a $1.4 million reduction in non-interest revenue, and a $1.1 million increase in non-interest expense. The non-interest expense increase included a $669,000 goodwill impairment charge and a $376,000 fourth quarter pension charge related to 25 employees who elected to participate in an early retirement incentive program. These negative items were partially offset by a $1.2 million increase in net interest income due to continued growth of our loan portfolio while maintaining excellent asset quality.\nNET INTEREST INCOME AND MARGIN... The Company's net interest income represents the amount by which interest income on earning assets exceeds interest paid on interest bearing liabilities. Net interest income is a primary source of the Company's earnings; it is affected by interest rate fluctuations as well as changes in the amount and mix of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities. The following table summarizes the Company's net interest income performance for each of the past three years:\n\n2016 NET INTEREST PERFORMANCE OVERVIEW... The Company's net interest income for the full year of 2016 decreased by $1,227,000, or 3.5%, when compared to the full year of 2015. The Company's net interest margin of 3.26% for the full year of 2016 was 23 basis points lower than the net interest margin of 3.49% for the full year of 2015. The 2016 reduction in net interest income has been significantly impacted by the following three factors: 1.) net interest margin compression that results from the prolonged low interest rate environment that exists in the economy and is pressuring community bank net interest margins, 2.) additional interest expense that was associated with the Company's late fourth quarter 2015 issuance of subordinated debt, and 3.) a significantly lower level of loan prepayment fee income, which decreased by approximately $300,000 for full year of 2016. These factors more than offset the Company's continued growth in earning assets and control of its cost of funds through disciplined deposit pricing. Specifically, the earning asset growth occurred in the loan portfolio as total loans averaged $888 million for the full year of 2016, which is $31 million, or 3.6%, higher than the $857 million average for the full year of 2015. This loan growth reflects the successful results of the Company's business development efforts, with an emphasis on generating commercial loans and owner occupied commercial real estate loans particularly through its loan production offices. However, loan interest income is $134,000, or 0.4%, lower for the full year of 2016 when compared to the full year of 2015 due primarily to the previously mentioned decline in loan prepayment fees between years. Interest income on short-term investments and investment securities grew by $122,000 or 3.1% for the full year as the Company benefited from a higher balance of investment securities in 2016. Overall, total interest income decreased by $12,000, or 0.03%, in 2016.\nThe Company experienced significant growth in deposits between years which is a reflection of the loyalty and stability of our core deposit base that provides a strong foundation upon which this growth builds. Management's ability to acquire new core deposit funding from outside of our traditional market areas as well as our ongoing efforts to offer new loan customers deposit products were the primary reasons for this growth. Specifically, total deposits averaged $956 million for the full year of 2016 which is $63 million, or 7.0%, higher than the $893 million average for the full year of 2015. The Company is also pleased that a meaningful portion of this deposit growth occurred in non-interest bearing demand deposit accounts. Deposit interest expense for the full year of 2016 increased by $648,000, or 13.6%, due to the higher balance of deposits along with certain money market accounts repricing upward after Federal Reserve fed funds interest rate increases. As a result of this strong deposit growth, the Company's loan to deposit ratio ended the year at 91.6% which indicates that the Company has ample room to further grow its loan portfolio in 2017.\nTotal interest expense increased for the full year of 2016 by $1,215,000, or 18.6%, as compared to 2015 due to higher levels of both borrowings and deposit interest expense. The Company experienced a $567,000 increase in the interest cost for borrowings in 2016, with $515,000 of this increase attributable to the Company's subordinated debt issuance which occurred late in December of 2015. Specifically, the Company issued $7.65 million of subordinated debt which has a 6.50% fixed interest rate. The proceeds from the subordinated debt issuance, along with other cash on hand, was used to redeem all $21 million of our outstanding SBLF preferred stock on January 27, 2016. The remainder of the increase in borrowings interest expense was due to a greater utilization of FHLB term advances to extend borrowings for interest rate risk management purposes.\nCOMPONENT CHANGES IN NET INTEREST INCOME: 2016 VERSUS 2015... Regarding the separate components of net interest income, the Company's total interest income in 2016 decreased by $12,000 when compared to 2015. This decrease was due to 1.) net interest margin compression that results from the prolonged low interest rate environment that exists in the economy and is pressuring community bank net interest margins, 2.) additional interest expense that was associated with the Company's late fourth quarter 2015 issuance of subordinated debt, and 3.) a significantly lower level of loan prepayment fee income, which decreased by approximately $300,000 for full year of 2016. This is evidenced by a $36.9 million increase in average earning assets due to increases in both average loans and average securities, which was more than offset by a 15 basis point decline in the earning asset yield from 4.14% to 3.99%. Within the earning asset base, total loan interest income decreased by $134,000 as the yield on the total loan portfolio decreased by 17 basis points from 4.44% to 4.27%. The greater level of total average loans in 2016 was more than offset by the impact of new loans having yields that are below the rate on the maturing instruments that they are replacing. Also negatively impacting loan interest income in 2016 was the reduced level of loan prepayment fee income. Investment securities interest revenue increased by $47,000 in 2016 due to a $2.3 million increase in the average investment securities portfolio. However, the yield on total investment securities decreased by one basis points from 2.67% to 2.66% due to net interest margin compression as well as an increase in premium amortization on mortgage backed securities, which resulted from an increase in mortgage prepayment speeds in 2016.\nThe Company's total interest expense for 2016 increased by $1.2 million, or 18.6%, when compared to 2015. Total interest bearing deposits increased by $51.2 million or 7.1% due to management's ability to acquire new core deposit funding from outside our traditional market areas as well as our ongoing efforts to offer new loan customers deposit products. The growth is also a reflection of the loyalty and stability of our core deposit base. Total interest bearing deposit interest expense increased by $648,000 in 2016 due to the higher volume of interest bearing deposits and an increase of four basis points in the cost of interest bearing deposits to 0.70%. Management continues to carefully price interest rates paid on all deposit categories. The Company experienced a $567,000 increase in the interest cost for borrowings in 2016, with $515,000 of this increase attributable to the Company's subordinated debt issuance which occurred late in December of 2015. The increase in borrowings interest expense is also reflective of a greater usage total average FHLB term advances. The Company has utilized term advances from the FHLB, with maturities ranging between three and five years, to help fund its earning asset growth and manage interest rate risk. The average balance of FHLB term advances has increased by $2.6 million while the average cost of these advances has increased by 11 basis point to 1.32%. Total FHLB borrowings, including overnight borrowed funds, averaged $57.8 million or 5.1% of total assets during 2016. Overall, total interest bearing funding costs increased by 10 basis points to 0.91%.\nOverall, the Company expects that it will need to continue to grow the earning assets to achieve net interest income growth in 2017 as net interest margin compression is expected to slow or bottom. Solid commercial pipelines suggest that the Company should be able to grow the loan portfolio in 2017 although we expect the pricing pressures on new commercial loans to continue to be intense.\n2015 NET INTEREST PERFORMANCE OVERVIEW... The Company's net interest income increased by $1.3 million, or 3.9%, for the full year of 2015 when compared to the full year 2014 as net interest margin compression was more than fully mitigated by earning asset growth, a greater level of prepayment fees on early loan payoffs and an increased dividend from the FHLB of Pittsburgh. The Company's net interest margin of 3.49% for the full year 2015 was three basis points lower than the net interest margin of 3.52% for the full year 2014. The earning asset growth occurred in the loan portfolio as total loans averaged $857 million for the full year of 2015 which is $52 million, or 6.5%, higher than the $805 million average for the full year of 2014. This loan growth reflects the successful results of the Company's sales calling efforts, with an emphasis on generating commercial loans and owner occupied commercial real estate loans particularly through its loan production offices in the stronger growth markets of Pittsburgh and Altoona in Pennsylvania, Hagerstown, Maryland. Overall, total interest income increased by $1.4 million, or 3.6%, for the full year 2015.\nTotal interest expense was well controlled in 2015 as it increased by $123,000, or 1.9%, for the full year of 2015 due to tight control of our cost of funds through disciplined deposit pricing. Total deposit interest expense decreased by $137,000, or 2.8%, in 2015 when compared to 2014. Even with this reduction in deposit costs, the Company continues to have a strong loyal core deposit base and success in cross-selling new loan customers into deposit products. Specifically, total deposits averaged $893 million for full year of 2015 which is $21 million, or 2.4%, higher than the $872 million average in 2014. The Company is pleased that a meaningful portion of this deposit growth occurred in non-interest bearing demand deposit accounts. This decreased interest expense for deposits has been more than offset by a $260,000 increase in the interest cost for borrowings as the Company has utilized more FHLB term advances to extend borrowings and provide protection against rising interest rates.\nCOMPONENT CHANGES IN NET INTEREST INCOME: 2015 VERSUS 2014... Regarding the separate components of net interest income, the Company's total interest income in 2015 increased by $1.4 million, or 3.6%, when compared to 2014. This increase was due to a $44.4 million increase in average earning assets due to an increase in average loans, partially offset by a four basis point decline in the earning asset yield from 4.18% to 4.14%. Within the earning asset base, the yield on the total loan portfolio decreased by eight basis points from 4.52% to 4.44% as a greater level of prepayment fees on early loan payoffs was more than offset by the impact from new loans having yields that are below the rate on the maturing instruments that they are replacing. However, the yield on total investment securities increased by seven basis points from 2.60% to 2.67% due to an increased dividend from the FHLB of Pittsburgh and a reduction in premium amortization on mortgage backed securities which resulted from a slowdown in mortgage prepayment speeds in 2015. Investment securities interest revenue declined by $223,000 in 2015 due to a $12 million decrease in the average investment securities portfolio as the Company has utilized cash flow from securities to help fund the previously mentioned loan growth.\nThe Company's total interest expense for 2015 increased by $123,000, or 1.9%, when compared to 2014. This increase in interest expense was due to an increased level of average FHLB borrowed funds which more than offset a lower cost of funds as the cost of interest bearing liabilities declined by one basis point to 0.81%. Management's strategy to carefully price interest rates paid on all deposit categories has not had a negative impact on deposit growth and reflects the loyalty of the bank's core deposit base. The overall cost of interest bearing deposits decreased by two basis points to 0.66% in spite of a $5.4 million increase in the total average volume. The Company utilized term advances from the FHLB, with maturities ranging between three and five years, to help fund its earning asset growth and manage interest rate risk. The average balance of FHLB term advances increased by $13 million while the average cost of these advances increased by 20 basis points to 1.21%. Overall, total FHLB borrowings averaged $71 million or 6.4% of total assets during 2015.\nThe table that follows provides an analysis of net interest income on a tax-equivalent basis setting forth (i) average assets, liabilities, and stockholders' equity, (ii) interest income earned on interest earning assets and interest expense paid on interest bearing liabilities, (iii) average yields earned on interest earning assets and average rates paid on interest bearing liabilities, (iv) interest rate spread (the difference between the average yield earned on interest earning assets and the average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities), and (v) net interest margin (net interest income as a percentage of average total interest earning assets). For purposes of these tables loan balances include non-accrual loans, and interest income on loans includes loan fees or amortization of such fees which have been deferred, as well as interest recorded on certain non-accrual loans as cash is received. Regulatory stock is included within available for sale investment securities for this analysis. Additionally, a tax rate of approximately 34% is used to compute tax-equivalent yields.\n\nNet interest income may also be analyzed by segregating the volume and rate components of interest income and interest expense. The table below sets forth an analysis of volume and rate changes in net interest income on a tax-equivalent basis. For purposes of this table, changes in interest income and interest expense are allocated to volume and rate categories based upon the respective percentage changes in average balances and average rates. Changes in net interest income that could not be specifically identified as either a rate or volume change were allocated proportionately to changes in volume and changes in rate.\n\nLOAN QUALITY... The Company's written lending policies require underwriting, loan documentation, and credit analysis standards to be met prior to funding any loan. After the loan has been approved and funded, continued periodic credit review is required. The Company's policy is to individually review, as circumstances warrant, each of its commercial and commercial mortgage loans to determine if a loan is impaired. At a minimum, credit reviews are mandatory for all commercial and commercial mortgage loan relationships with aggregate balances in excess of $250,000 within a 12-month period. The Company has also identified three pools of small dollar value homogeneous loans which are evaluated collectively for impairment. These separate pools are for small business relationships with aggregate balances of $250,000 or less, residential mortgage loans and consumer loans. Individual loans within these pools are reviewed and removed from the pool if factors such as significant delinquency in payments of 90 days or more, bankruptcy, or other negative economic concerns indicate impairment. The following table sets forth information concerning the Company's loan delinquency and other non-performing assets.\n\n (1) Non-performing assets are comprised of (i) loans that are on a non-accrual basis, (ii) loans that are contractually past due 90 days or more as to interest and principal payments, (iii) performing loans classified as troubled debt restructuring and (iv) other real estate owned. \nThe Company continues to maintain excellent asset quality. Non-performing assets declined by $4.7 million since the prior year-end with the early in the year resolution of the Company's largest energy sector loan and now total $1.6 million, one of the lowest levels reported by the Company. The continued successful ongoing problem credit resolution efforts of the Company is demonstrated in the table above as levels of non-accrual loans, non-performing assets, classified loans and low loan delinquency levels are well below 1% of total loans. We continue to closely monitor the loan portfolio given the uneven recovery in the economy and the number of relatively large-sized commercial and CRE loans within the portfolio. As of December 31, 2016, the 25 largest credits represented 26.8% of total loans outstanding.\nALLOWANCE AND PROVISION FOR LOAN LOSSES... As described in more detail in the Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates section of this MD&A, the Company uses a comprehensive methodology and procedural discipline to maintain an ALL to absorb inherent losses in the loan portfolio. The Company believes this is a critical accounting policy since it involves significant estimates and judgments. The following table sets forth changes in the ALL and certain ratios for the periods ended.\n",
    "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (MD&A) The following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of the Company should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of the Company including the related notes thereto, included elsewhere herein.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2016, 2015, AND 2014 2016 SUMMARY OVERVIEW: AmeriServ closed 2016 with its third consecutive profitable quarter while it continued to recover from the net loss of the first quarter. The Company reported net income for the fourth quarter of $1,150,000 or $0.06 earnings per share. When consolidated with the previous quarters of 2016, net income for the year was $2,310,000 or $0.12 per share. The fourth quarter was $85,000 above the third quarter of 2016, but $224,000 below the fourth quarter of 2015. These results reflect the continuing impact of the net loss recorded in the first quarter. We continue to take full responsibility for putting the expenses related to the Trust Company trading error, and our only loan to the energy industry, behind us immediately. AmeriServ's quick return to profitability tells us that these were self-contained events and therefore do not indicate any continuing risk to the Company.\nWe believe the marketplace agrees, net loans have begun to increase again and deposits closed the quarter at an all-time high and very near the $1 billion mark. However, even more encouraging was that the total revenue of the Trust Company was at an all-time high in the fourth quarter of 2016. It is also important to note that as 2016 ended, the level of non-performing assets was at the lowest level ever reported. We believe that our present balance sheet is well positioned for the higher level of interest rates which have developed since the November election. It is a fact that it was necessary to take corrective actions and such actions take time and money. Therefore, the fourth quarter level of operating expenses were $339,000 higher than the same period in 2015. As those expenses disappear, our focus on increasing revenues should show a very positive trend line.\nLooking to that speedy return to profitability, AmeriServ requested and received from the regulators their non-objection to implement a common stock repurchase program. This program could reduce the outstanding shares by almost one million, thus increasing the value of any continuing shares. This action following so soon after the cash dividend increase, announced in August, indicates our commitment to improving the return to our shareholders.\nYou may also recall that the Pennsylvania State Education Association has named AmeriServ as its preferred residential mortgage and consumer lender. Their 190,000 members can accomplish an entire residential mortgage transaction through a dedicated and centralized application center at AmeriServ. Since this program is functioning so well with Pennsylvania's schoolteachers, we are approaching other similar associations in the Keystone State. This effort combines our new proven procedures with our traditional personal service.\nAs you know this management team began its tour of duty in March of 2015. In the fourth quarter of 2016 they completed a three-year Strategic Plan to take AmeriServ to 2020. We believe that AmeriServ is an exceptionally clean franchise, a community bank with assets approaching one and one-quarter billion dollars, with a freestanding trust and wealth management subsidiary. The goal of this Board and this Management team is to build this franchise in both profitability and asset size. This new Strategic Plan is the road map that will be used in this effort. We intend to maintain our tradition of personal service while incorporating the best in new technology. The University Heights and State College locations are being updated for a better customer experience. These community bank offices will be equipped to accommodate the growing cohort of millennials, while maintaining the time-tested personal service our senior citizens expect and value. It is indeed an exciting time to be a community bank whose mission is to provide \u201cBanking for Life\u201d.\nA comment about the national and regional scene is warranted. The contentious national election is now behind us, but the road ahead is unclear. The Federal Reserve policies in recent years have not created a positive economic environment for community banks. The interest rate policies have lessened the support costs of the enormous national debt, but have created tremendous burdens for pensions, for savers and for\ncommunity banks. It is good that the existing Federal Reserve policies are beginning to be discussed, but thus far, there has been little tangible action to alleviate these difficult conditions. We decided some time ago on our preferred course of action. It is simply to maintain a conservative balance sheet with strong capital and deep liquidity. Also, we will strive for better than industry measures in our loan and securities portfolios. We think these guidelines, and the counter cyclical nature of our Trust Company, adds up to a strong Company in a struggling economy. There will be no \u201cbet the bank\u201d strategies at AmeriServ and we will remain poised for signs of an upturn in 2017.\nPERFORMANCE OVERVIEW... The following table summarizes some of the Company's key profitability performance indicators for each of the past three years.\nTable 20: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td>2014 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT\nPER SHARE DATA AND RATIOS) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net income </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> 2,310 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> 5,997 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> 3,023 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net income available to common shareholders </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,295 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,787 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,813 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Diluted earnings per share </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.12 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.31 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.15 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Return on average assets </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.20 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.54 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.29 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Return on average equity </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.30 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.10 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.61 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Company reported net income available to common shareholders of $2.3 million, or $0.12 per diluted common share, for 2016. This represented a 61% decrease in earnings per share from 2015 where net income available to common shareholders totaled $5.8 million, or $0.31 per diluted share. This reduction reflects, 1.) a substantially higher than typical provision for loan losses and net loan charge offs that were recorded in the first quarter of 2016 to resolve the Company's only meaningful direct loan exposure to the energy industry, 2.) a reduced level of net interest income that results from net interest margin compression, which is prevalent in the banking industry, as well as a lower level of loan prepayment fee income and additional interest expense related to the issuance of subordinated debt, and 3.) operating expenses increasing by $577,000, or 1.4% due to non-recurring costs for legal and accounting services that were necessary to address a trust operations trading error.\nThe Company reported net income available to common shareholders of $5.8 million, or $0.31 per diluted common share, for 2015. This represented a 107% increase in earnings per share from 2014 where net income available to common shareholders totalled $2.8 million, or $0.15 per diluted share. Factors causing this increase in earnings were solid loan and deposit growth in our community banking business which contributed to an increase of $1.3 million, or 3.9%, in net interest income while increasing revenue from our trust and wealth management business contributed to 6.6% growth in non-interest income in 2015. Additionally, operating expenses declined by $2.3 million, or 5.4%, as we improved the ongoing efficiency of the Company by successfully executing several profitability improvement initiatives.\nThe Company reported net income available to common shareholders of $2.8 million, or $0.15 per diluted common share, for 2014. This represented a 42.3% decrease in earnings per share from 2013 where net income available to common shareholders totalled $5.0 million, or $0.26 per diluted share. Factors contributing to this reduction in earnings were a $1.5 million unfavorable swing in the provision for loan losses, a $1.4 million reduction in non-interest revenue, and a $1.1 million increase in non-interest expense. The non-interest expense increase included a $669,000 goodwill impairment charge and a $376,000 fourth quarter pension charge related to 25 employees who elected to participate in an early retirement incentive program. These negative items were partially offset by a $1.2 million increase in net interest income due to continued growth of our loan portfolio while maintaining excellent asset quality.\nNET INTEREST INCOME AND MARGIN... The Company's net interest income represents the amount by which interest income on earning assets exceeds interest paid on interest bearing liabilities. Net interest income is a primary source of the Company's earnings; it is affected by interest rate fluctuations as well as changes in the amount and mix of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities. The following table summarizes the Company's net interest income performance for each of the past three years:\nTable 21: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td>2014 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT RATIOS) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Interest income </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> 41,869 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> 41,881 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> 40,441 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Interest expense </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,735 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,520 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,397 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net interest income </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>34,134 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>35,361 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>34,044 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net interest margin </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.26 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.49 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.52 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\n2016 NET INTEREST PERFORMANCE OVERVIEW... The Company's net interest income for the full year of 2016 decreased by $1,227,000, or 3.5%, when compared to the full year of 2015. The Company's net interest margin of 3.26% for the full year of 2016 was 23 basis points lower than the net interest margin of 3.49% for the full year of 2015. The 2016 reduction in net interest income has been significantly impacted by the following three factors: 1.) net interest margin compression that results from the prolonged low interest rate environment that exists in the economy and is pressuring community bank net interest margins, 2.) additional interest expense that was associated with the Company's late fourth quarter 2015 issuance of subordinated debt, and 3.) a significantly lower level of loan prepayment fee income, which decreased by approximately $300,000 for full year of 2016. These factors more than offset the Company's continued growth in earning assets and control of its cost of funds through disciplined deposit pricing. Specifically, the earning asset growth occurred in the loan portfolio as total loans averaged $888 million for the full year of 2016, which is $31 million, or 3.6%, higher than the $857 million average for the full year of 2015. This loan growth reflects the successful results of the Company's business development efforts, with an emphasis on generating commercial loans and owner occupied commercial real estate loans particularly through its loan production offices. However, loan interest income is $134,000, or 0.4%, lower for the full year of 2016 when compared to the full year of 2015 due primarily to the previously mentioned decline in loan prepayment fees between years. Interest income on short-term investments and investment securities grew by $122,000 or 3.1% for the full year as the Company benefited from a higher balance of investment securities in 2016. Overall, total interest income decreased by $12,000, or 0.03%, in 2016.\nThe Company experienced significant growth in deposits between years which is a reflection of the loyalty and stability of our core deposit base that provides a strong foundation upon which this growth builds. Management's ability to acquire new core deposit funding from outside of our traditional market areas as well as our ongoing efforts to offer new loan customers deposit products were the primary reasons for this growth. Specifically, total deposits averaged $956 million for the full year of 2016 which is $63 million, or 7.0%, higher than the $893 million average for the full year of 2015. The Company is also pleased that a meaningful portion of this deposit growth occurred in non-interest bearing demand deposit accounts. Deposit interest expense for the full year of 2016 increased by $648,000, or 13.6%, due to the higher balance of deposits along with certain money market accounts repricing upward after Federal Reserve fed funds interest rate increases. As a result of this strong deposit growth, the Company's loan to deposit ratio ended the year at 91.6% which indicates that the Company has ample room to further grow its loan portfolio in 2017.\nTotal interest expense increased for the full year of 2016 by $1,215,000, or 18.6%, as compared to 2015 due to higher levels of both borrowings and deposit interest expense. The Company experienced a $567,000 increase in the interest cost for borrowings in 2016, with $515,000 of this increase attributable to the Company's subordinated debt issuance which occurred late in December of 2015. Specifically, the Company issued $7.65 million of subordinated debt which has a 6.50% fixed interest rate. The proceeds from the subordinated debt issuance, along with other cash on hand, was used to redeem all $21 million of our outstanding SBLF preferred stock on January 27, 2016. The remainder of the increase in borrowings interest expense was due to a greater utilization of FHLB term advances to extend borrowings for interest rate risk management purposes.\nCOMPONENT CHANGES IN NET INTEREST INCOME: 2016 VERSUS 2015... Regarding the separate components of net interest income, the Company's total interest income in 2016 decreased by $12,000 when compared to 2015. This decrease was due to 1.) net interest margin compression that results from the prolonged low interest rate environment that exists in the economy and is pressuring community bank net interest margins, 2.) additional interest expense that was associated with the Company's late fourth quarter 2015 issuance of subordinated debt, and 3.) a significantly lower level of loan prepayment fee income, which decreased by approximately $300,000 for full year of 2016. This is evidenced by a $36.9 million increase in average earning assets due to increases in both average loans and average securities, which was more than offset by a 15 basis point decline in the earning asset yield from 4.14% to 3.99%. Within the earning asset base, total loan interest income decreased by $134,000 as the yield on the total loan portfolio decreased by 17 basis points from 4.44% to 4.27%. The greater level of total average loans in 2016 was more than offset by the impact of new loans having yields that are below the rate on the maturing instruments that they are replacing. Also negatively impacting loan interest income in 2016 was the reduced level of loan prepayment fee income. Investment securities interest revenue increased by $47,000 in 2016 due to a $2.3 million increase in the average investment securities portfolio. However, the yield on total investment securities decreased by one basis points from 2.67% to 2.66% due to net interest margin compression as well as an increase in premium amortization on mortgage backed securities, which resulted from an increase in mortgage prepayment speeds in 2016.\nThe Company's total interest expense for 2016 increased by $1.2 million, or 18.6%, when compared to 2015. Total interest bearing deposits increased by $51.2 million or 7.1% due to management's ability to acquire new core deposit funding from outside our traditional market areas as well as our ongoing efforts to offer new loan customers deposit products. The growth is also a reflection of the loyalty and stability of our core deposit base. Total interest bearing deposit interest expense increased by $648,000 in 2016 due to the higher volume of interest bearing deposits and an increase of four basis points in the cost of interest bearing deposits to 0.70%. Management continues to carefully price interest rates paid on all deposit categories. The Company experienced a $567,000 increase in the interest cost for borrowings in 2016, with $515,000 of this increase attributable to the Company's subordinated debt issuance which occurred late in December of 2015. The increase in borrowings interest expense is also reflective of a greater usage total average FHLB term advances. The Company has utilized term advances from the FHLB, with maturities ranging between three and five years, to help fund its earning asset growth and manage interest rate risk. The average balance of FHLB term advances has increased by $2.6 million while the average cost of these advances has increased by 11 basis point to 1.32%. Total FHLB borrowings, including overnight borrowed funds, averaged $57.8 million or 5.1% of total assets during 2016. Overall, total interest bearing funding costs increased by 10 basis points to 0.91%.\nOverall, the Company expects that it will need to continue to grow the earning assets to achieve net interest income growth in 2017 as net interest margin compression is expected to slow or bottom. Solid commercial pipelines suggest that the Company should be able to grow the loan portfolio in 2017 although we expect the pricing pressures on new commercial loans to continue to be intense.\n2015 NET INTEREST PERFORMANCE OVERVIEW... The Company's net interest income increased by $1.3 million, or 3.9%, for the full year of 2015 when compared to the full year 2014 as net interest margin compression was more than fully mitigated by earning asset growth, a greater level of prepayment fees on early loan payoffs and an increased dividend from the FHLB of Pittsburgh. The Company's net interest margin of 3.49% for the full year 2015 was three basis points lower than the net interest margin of 3.52% for the full year 2014. The earning asset growth occurred in the loan portfolio as total loans averaged $857 million for the full year of 2015 which is $52 million, or 6.5%, higher than the $805 million average for the full year of 2014. This loan growth reflects the successful results of the Company's sales calling efforts, with an emphasis on generating commercial loans and owner occupied commercial real estate loans particularly through its loan production offices in the stronger growth markets of Pittsburgh and Altoona in Pennsylvania, Hagerstown, Maryland. Overall, total interest income increased by $1.4 million, or 3.6%, for the full year 2015.\nTotal interest expense was well controlled in 2015 as it increased by $123,000, or 1.9%, for the full year of 2015 due to tight control of our cost of funds through disciplined deposit pricing. Total deposit interest expense decreased by $137,000, or 2.8%, in 2015 when compared to 2014. Even with this reduction in deposit costs, the Company continues to have a strong loyal core deposit base and success in cross-selling new loan customers into deposit products. Specifically, total deposits averaged $893 million for full year of 2015 which is $21 million, or 2.4%, higher than the $872 million average in 2014. The Company is pleased that a meaningful portion of this deposit growth occurred in non-interest bearing demand deposit accounts. This decreased interest expense for deposits has been more than offset by a $260,000 increase in the interest cost for borrowings as the Company has utilized more FHLB term advances to extend borrowings and provide protection against rising interest rates.\nCOMPONENT CHANGES IN NET INTEREST INCOME: 2015 VERSUS 2014... Regarding the separate components of net interest income, the Company's total interest income in 2015 increased by $1.4 million, or 3.6%, when compared to 2014. This increase was due to a $44.4 million increase in average earning assets due to an increase in average loans, partially offset by a four basis point decline in the earning asset yield from 4.18% to 4.14%. Within the earning asset base, the yield on the total loan portfolio decreased by eight basis points from 4.52% to 4.44% as a greater level of prepayment fees on early loan payoffs was more than offset by the impact from new loans having yields that are below the rate on the maturing instruments that they are replacing. However, the yield on total investment securities increased by seven basis points from 2.60% to 2.67% due to an increased dividend from the FHLB of Pittsburgh and a reduction in premium amortization on mortgage backed securities which resulted from a slowdown in mortgage prepayment speeds in 2015. Investment securities interest revenue declined by $223,000 in 2015 due to a $12 million decrease in the average investment securities portfolio as the Company has utilized cash flow from securities to help fund the previously mentioned loan growth.\nThe Company's total interest expense for 2015 increased by $123,000, or 1.9%, when compared to 2014. This increase in interest expense was due to an increased level of average FHLB borrowed funds which more than offset a lower cost of funds as the cost of interest bearing liabilities declined by one basis point to 0.81%. Management's strategy to carefully price interest rates paid on all deposit categories has not had a negative impact on deposit growth and reflects the loyalty of the bank's core deposit base. The overall cost of interest bearing deposits decreased by two basis points to 0.66% in spite of a $5.4 million increase in the total average volume. The Company utilized term advances from the FHLB, with maturities ranging between three and five years, to help fund its earning asset growth and manage interest rate risk. The average balance of FHLB term advances increased by $13 million while the average cost of these advances increased by 20 basis points to 1.21%. Overall, total FHLB borrowings averaged $71 million or 6.4% of total assets during 2015.\nThe table that follows provides an analysis of net interest income on a tax-equivalent basis setting forth (i) average assets, liabilities, and stockholders' equity, (ii) interest income earned on interest earning assets and interest expense paid on interest bearing liabilities, (iii) average yields earned on interest earning assets and average rates paid on interest bearing liabilities, (iv) interest rate spread (the difference between the average yield earned on interest earning assets and the average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities), and (v) net interest margin (net interest income as a percentage of average total interest earning assets). For purposes of these tables loan balances include non-accrual loans, and interest income on loans includes loan fees or amortization of such fees which have been deferred, as well as interest recorded on certain non-accrual loans as cash is received. Regulatory stock is included within available for sale investment securities for this analysis. Additionally, a tax rate of approximately 34% is used to compute tax-equivalent yields.\nTable 22: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>

The table below sets forth an analysis of volume and rate changes in net interest income on a tax-equivalent basis. For purposes of this table, changes in interest income and interest expense are allocated to volume and rate categories based upon the respective percentage changes in average balances and average rates. Changes in net interest income that could not be specifically identified as either a rate or volume change were allocated proportionately to changes in volume and changes in rate.\nTable 23: <table>

The Company's written lending policies require underwriting, loan documentation, and credit analysis standards to be met prior to funding any loan. After the loan has been approved and funded, continued periodic credit review is required. The Company's policy is to individually review, as circumstances warrant, each of its commercial and commercial mortgage loans to determine if a loan is impaired. At a minimum, credit reviews are mandatory for all commercial and commercial mortgage loan relationships with aggregate balances in excess of $250,000 within a 12-month period. The Company has also identified three pools of small dollar value homogeneous loans which are evaluated collectively for impairment. These separate pools are for small business relationships with aggregate balances of $250,000 or less, residential mortgage loans and consumer loans. Individual loans within these pools are reviewed and removed from the pool if factors such as significant delinquency in payments of 90 days or more, bankruptcy, or other negative economic concerns indicate impairment. The following table sets forth information concerning the Company's loan delinquency and other non-performing assets.\nTable 24: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>AT DECEMBER 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td>2014 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(IN THOUSANDS, EXCEPT PERCENTAGES) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total accruing loans past due 30 to 89 days </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> 3,278 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> 4,396 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> 2,643 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total non-accrual loans </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,603 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,066 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,195 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total non-performing assets including TDRs(1) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,624 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,297 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,917 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Loan delinquency as a percentage of total loans, net of unearned income </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.37 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.50 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.32 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Non-accrual loans as a percentage of total loans, net of unearned income </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.18 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.69 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.27 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Non-performing assets as a percentage of total loans, net of unearned income, and other real estate owned </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.18 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.71 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.35 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Non-performing assets as a percentage of total assets </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.14 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.55 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.27 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total classified loans (loans rated substandard or doubtful) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>6,039 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>8,566 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>11,229 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) Non-performing assets are comprised of (i) loans that are on a non-accrual basis, (ii) loans that are contractually past due 90 days or more as to interest and principal payments, (iii) performing loans classified as troubled debt restructuring and (iv) other real estate owned. \nThe Company continues to maintain excellent asset quality. Non-performing assets declined by $4.7 million since the prior year-end with the early in the year resolution of the Company's largest energy sector loan and now total $1.6 million, one of the lowest levels reported by the Company. The continued successful ongoing problem credit resolution efforts of the Company is demonstrated in the table above as levels of non-accrual loans, non-performing assets, classified loans and low loan delinquency levels are well below 1% of total loans. We continue to closely monitor the loan portfolio given the uneven recovery in the economy and the number of relatively large-sized commercial and CRE loans within the portfolio. As of December 31, 2016, the 25 largest credits represented 26.8% of total loans outstanding.\nALLOWANCE AND PROVISION FOR LOAN LOSSES... As described in more detail in the Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates section of this MD&A, the Company uses a comprehensive methodology and procedural discipline to maintain an ALL to absorb inherent losses in the loan portfolio. The Company believes this is a critical accounting policy since it involves significant estimates and judgments. The following table sets forth changes in the ALL and certain ratios for the periods ended.\nTable 26: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>
