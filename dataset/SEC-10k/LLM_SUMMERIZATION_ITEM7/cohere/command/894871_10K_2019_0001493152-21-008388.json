Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThis Annual Report includes, in one comprehensive filing, the business and financial information for the Fiscal Year Period (i.e., the year ended December 31, 2019), as well as for the Interim Periods (i.e., the three months ended March 31, 2019, the three and six months ended June 30, 2019, and the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019). Therefore, this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations provides an analysis of the financial condition and results of operations for the Fiscal Year Period and the Interim Periods. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes to those statements that are included elsewhere in this Annual Report. Our discussion includes forward-looking statements based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties, such as our plans, objectives, expectations, and intentions. Actual results and the timing of events could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of a number of factors. We use words such as anticipate,\u201d estimate,\u201d plan,\u201d project,\u201d continuing,\u201d ongoing,\u201d expect,\u201d believe,\u201d intend,\u201d may,\u201d will,\u201d should,\u201d could,\u201d and similar expressions to identify forward-looking statements.\nPlease see Our Future Business\u201d and Future Liquidity\u201d for additional important information.\nOverview\nWe operate a best-in-class technology platform empowering premium publishers who impact, inform, educate and entertain. We operate the media businesses for Sports Illustrated and TheStreet, and power more than 250 independent brands including History, Maxim, and Biography. The Maven Platform provides digital publishing, distribution and monetization capabilities to our own Sports Illustrated and TheStreet media businesses as well as to the Channel Partners. Generally, the Channel Partners are independently owned strategic partners who receive a share of revenue from the interaction with their content. They also benefit from our membership marketing and management systems to further enhance their revenue.\nOur growth strategy is to continue to expand by adding new premium publishers with high quality brands and content either as independent Channel Partners or by acquiring publishers as owned and operated entities. By adding premium content brands, we will further expand the scale of the Maven Platform, improve monetization effectiveness in both advertising and subscription revenues, and enhance the attractiveness to consumers and advertisers.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAs of December 31, 2019, our principal sources of liquidity consisted of cash of approximately $8.9 million. As of the issuance date of our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2019, we had also received funds from loan proceeds of approximately $17.6 million from additional resources, including proceeds under our working capital facility with FPP Finance LLC ( FastPay\u201d), a delayed draw loan, and payroll protection program loan, all of which are discussed in greater detail below in the section entitled Future Liquidity.\u201d\nWe continued to be focused on growing our existing operations and seeking accretive and complementary strategic acquisitions as part of our growth strategy. We believed, that with additional sources of liquidity and the ability to raise additional capital or incur additional indebtedness to supplement our then internal projections, we would be able to execute our growth plan and finance our working capital requirements.\nTable 42: <table><tr><td>27 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe have financed our working capital requirements since inception through issuances of equity securities and various debt financings.

On June 28, 2019, we issued shares of our Series I Preferred Stock pursuant to a securities purchase agreement entered into with certain accredited investors. In accordance with the securities purchase agreement, we issued an aggregate of 23,100 shares of Series I Preferred Stock at a stated value of $1,000, initially convertible into 46,200,000 shares of our common stock at a conversion rate equal to the stated value divided by the conversion price of $0.50 per share, for aggregate gross proceeds of $23.1 million used for working capital and general corporate purposes. Each share of Series I Preferred Stock is entitled to vote on an as-if-converted to common stock basis, subject to certain conditions.\nThe shares of Series I Preferred Stock were subject to limitations on conversion into shares of our common stock until the date an amendment to our certificate of incorporation was filed and accepted with the State of Delaware that increased the number of authorized shares of our common stock to at least a number permitting all the Series H Preferred Stock and Series I Preferred Stock to be converted in full. On December 18, 2020, we filed a Certificate of Amendment to our Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as amended (the Certificate of Amendment\u201d), to increase the number of authorized shares of our common stock. Accordingly, we do not have any shares of our Series I Preferred Stock currently outstanding. Please see Note 20, Stockholders' Equity, in our accompanying consolidated financial statements for addition information.\nSeries J Preferred Stock. On October 7, 2019, we issued shares of our Series J Preferred Stock pursuant to a securities purchase agreement with certain accredited investors. In accordance with the securities purchase agreement, we issued an aggregate of 20,000 shares of Series J Preferred Stock at a stated value of $1,000, initially convertible into 28,571,428 shares of our common stock at a conversion rate equal to the stated value divided by the conversion price of $0.70 per share, for aggregate gross proceeds of $20.0 million, and after principal and interest of $5.0 million from the 12% senior secured notes were converted into shares of our Series J Preferred Stock, we received net proceeds of $15.0 million, which we used for working capital and general corporate purposes. Each share of Series J Preferred Stock is entitled to vote on an as-if-converted to common stock basis, subject to certain conditions.\nThe shares of Series J Preferred Stock were subject to limitations on conversion into shares of our common stock until the date an amendment to our certificate of incorporation was filed and accepted with the State of Delaware that increases the number of authorized shares of our common stock to at least a number permitting all the Series H Preferred Stock, Series I Preferred Stock and Series J Preferred Stock to be converted in full. On December 18, 2020, in connection with the filing of a Certificate of Amendment, we increased the number of authorized shares of our common stock. Accordingly, we do not have any shares of our Series J Preferred Stock currently outstanding. Please see Note 20, Stockholders' Equity, in our accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information.\nTable 46: <table><tr><td>29 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur consolidated financial statements have been presented on the basis that we are a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. We had revenues of approximately $53.2 million during fiscal 2019, and have experienced recurring net losses from operations and negative operating cash flows. Consequently, we were dependent upon continued access to funding and capital resources from both new investors and related parties. If continued funding and capital resources are unavailable at reasonable terms, we may not be able to implement our growth plan and plan of operations. These financings may include terms that may be highly dilutive to existing stockholders.\nFuture Liquidity\nFrom January 1, 2020 to the issuance date of our accompanying consolidated financial statements for the Fiscal Year Period and the Interim Periods, we continued to incur operating losses and negative cash flow from operating and investing activities. We have raised $23.7 million in net proceeds pursuant to the sale and issuances of Series H Preferred Stock, Series I Preferred Stock, Series J Preferred Stock, and Series K Convertible Preferred Stock (the Series K Preferred Stock\u201d) and $17.6 million in various debt financings. Noteholders also converted our 12% convertible debentures representing an aggregate of approximately $18.1 million of the then-outstanding principal and accrued but unpaid interest, with the remaining noteholders holding our 12 convertible debentures representing an aggregate of approximately $1.1 million of outstanding principal and accrued interest were not converted and, instead, such amounts were repaid in cash to such noteholders. We also entered into an Exchange Agreement with a former officer pursuant to which, the parties agreed that in exchange of $0.4 million of outstanding principal and accrued but unpaid interest under certain officer promissory notes we would issue to him shares of our Series H Preferred Stock. Our cash balance as of the date our accompanying consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2019 were issued or were available to be issued was approximately $5.1 million. Summarized below are the additional debt financings and/or issued equity securities through the issuance of our consolidated financial statements.\nEquity Financings\nIncluded in the $23.7 million of equity financings (see Note 28, Subsequent Events, in our accompanying consolidated financial statements for further details) are the following:\nSeries H Preferred Stock. Between August 14, 2020 and August 20, 2020, we entered into several securities purchase agreements for the sale of Series H Preferred Stock with certain accredited investors, pursuant to which we issued an aggregate of 108 shares (after we rescinded the issuance of 2,145 shares that were deemed null and void and repaid to certain holders on October 28, 2020), at a stated value of $1,000 per share, initially convertible into 327,273shares of our common stock at a conversion rate equal to the stated value divided by the conversion price of $0.33 per share, for aggregate gross proceeds of approximately $130,000 for working capital and general corporate purposes. The number of shares issuable upon conversion of the Series H Preferred Stock will be adjusted in the event of stock splits, stock dividends, combinations of shares and similar transactions. Each share of Series H Preferred Stock is entitled to vote on an as-if-converted to common stock basis, subject to beneficial ownership blocker provisions and other certain conditions.\nThe shares of Series H Preferred Stock were subject to limitations on conversion into shares of our common stock until the date an amendment to our certificate of incorporation was filed and accepted with the State of Delaware that increases the number of authorized shares of our common stock to at least a number permitting all the Series H Preferred Stock to be converted in full. On December 18, 2020, we filed the Certificate of Amendment to increase the number of authorized shares of our common stock.\nSeries J Preferred Stock. On September 4, 2020, we closed on a Series J Preferred Stock issuance with two accredited investors, pursuant to which we issued an aggregate of 10,500 shares of Series J Preferred Stock at a stated value of $1,000 per share, initially convertible into 15,000,000 shares of our common stock at a conversion rate equal to the stated value divided by the conversion price of $0.70, for aggregate gross proceeds of $6.0 million for working capital and general corporate purposes.\nOn December 18, 2020, in connection with the filing of the Certificate of Amendment to increase the number of authorized shares of our common stock, the then-outstanding shares of Series J Preferred Stock automatically converted into shares of our common stock. Accordingly, we do not have any shares of our Series J Preferred Stock currently outstanding.\nTable 47: <table><tr><td>30 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nSeries K Preferred Stock. On October 22, 2020, 20,000 shares of our preferred stock were designated by our Board as Series K Preferred Stock. Between October 23, 2020 and November 11, 2020, we entered into several securities purchase agreements with accredited investors, pursuant to which we issued an aggregate of 18,042 shares of Series K Preferred Stock at a stated value of $1,000 per share, initially convertible into 45,105,000 shares of our common stock at a conversion rate equal to the stated value divided by the conversion price of $0.40 per share, for aggregate gross proceeds of approximately $18.0 million. The number of shares issuable upon conversion of the Series K Preferred Stock will be adjusted in the event of stock splits, stock dividends, combinations of shares and similar transactions. Each share of Series K Preferred Stock is entitled to vote on an as-if-converted to common stock basis, subject to other certain conditions.\nIn consideration for its services as placement agent, we paid B. Riley FBR, Inc. ( B. Riley FBR\u201d) a cash fee of $400,500. We used approximately $3.4 million of the net proceeds from the financing to partially repay the Term Note (as defined below) and used approximately $2.6 million for payment on a prior investment, with the remainder of approximately $12.0 million for working capital and general corporate purposes.\nOn December 18, 2020, in connection with the filing of the Certificate of Amendment to increase the number of authorized shares of our common stock, the then-outstanding shares of Series K Preferred Stock automatically converted into shares of our common stock. Accordingly, we do not have any shares of our Series K Preferred Stock currently outstanding.\nDebt Financings\nIncluded in the $16.8 million of debt financings (see Note 28, Subsequent Events, in our accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information) are the following:\nAmended and Restated 12% Senior Secured Notes. On February 27, 2020, we entered into a second amendment to the amended and restated note purchase agreement (the Second Amendment to A&R NPA\u201d), which further amended the amended and restated note purchase agreement, dated as of June 14, 2019 (the A&R NPA\u201d), with one accredited investor, BRF Finance Co., LLC ( BRF Finance\u201d), an affiliated entity of B. Riley Financial, Inc. ( B. Riley\u201d). The Second Amendment to A&R NPA further amended the amended and restated 12% senior secured note due June 14, 2022. Pursuant to the Second Amendment to A&R NPA, we replaced our previous $3.5 million working capital facility with Sallyport with a new $15.0 million working capital facility with FastPay; and (ii) BRF Finance issued a letter of credit in the amount of approximately $3.0 million to our landlord for our lease of the premises located at 225 Liberty Street, 27th Floor, New York, New York 10281. All borrowings under the amended and restated 12% senior secured notes are collateralized by substantially all assets of the Company.\nOn March 24, 2020, we entered into a second amended and restated note purchase agreement (the Second A&R NPA\u201d) with BRF Finance, an affiliated entity of B. Riley, in its capacity as agent for the purchasers, which further amended and restated the Second Amendment to A&R NPA. Pursuant to the Second A&R NPA, interest on amounts outstanding under the existing 12% senior secured notes with respect to (i) interest that was payable on such notes on March 31, 2020 and June 30, 2020, and (ii) at our option, with the consent of requisite purchasers, interest that was payable on such on September 30, 2020 and December 31, 2020, in lieu of the payment in cash of all or any portion of the interest due on such dates, would be payable in-kind in arrears on the last day of such applicable fiscal quarter.\nOn October 23, 2020, we entered into Amendment No. 1 to the Second A&R NPA with BRF Finance ( Amendment 1\u201d), pursuant to which the maturity date of the 12% senior secured notes was changed to December 31, 2022 or an earlier date if the obligations have been accelerated pursuant to and in accordance with the terms of Amendment 1. Pursuant to Amendment 1, interest payable on the existing 12% senior secured notes on September 30, 2020, December 31, 2020, March 31, 2021, June 30, 2021, September 30, 2021, and December 31, 2021 will be payable in-kind in arrears on the last day of such fiscal quarter. Alternatively, at the option of the holder, such interest amounts originally could have been paid in shares of Series K Preferred Stock; however, after December 18, 2020, the date the Series K Preferred Stock converted into shares of common stock, all such interest amounts can be paid in shares of our common stock based upon the conversion rate specified in the Certificate of Designation for the Series K Preferred Stock (or $0.40).\nThe balance outstanding under our amended and restated 12% senior secured notes as of the issuance date of our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2019 was approximately $56.3 million, which included outstanding principal of approximately $48.8 million, payment of in-kind interest of approximately $4.2 million that we were permitted to add to the aggregate outstanding principal balance, and unpaid accrued interest of approximately $3.3 million).\nFastPay Credit Facility. On February 6, 2020, we entered into a financing and security agreement with FastPay, pursuant to which FastPay extended a $15.0 million line of credit for working capital purposes secured by a first lien on all of our cash and accounts receivable and a second lien on all other assets. Borrowings under the facility bear interest at the LIBOR Rate plus 8.50% and have a final maturity of February 6, 2022. This line of credit was amended by that certain first amendment to financing and security agreement dated March 24, 2020 to permit us to amend and restate the 12% senior secured notes. The aggregate principal amount outstanding, plus accrued and unpaid interest, as of the issuance date of our accompanying consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2019 was approximately $5.0 million.\nSallyport Credit Facility. As of December 31, 2019, we no longer could borrow under our factoring facility with Sallyport and it was effectively closed effective January 30, 2020. As of May 4, 2020, all amounts owed to us by Sallyport were paid and there was no balance outstanding under the facility.\nTable 48: <table><tr><td>31 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nDelayed Draw Term Note. Pursuant to the Second A&R NPA, we agreed to issue, at BRF Finance's option, a 15% delayed draw term note (the Term Note\u201d), in the aggregate principal amount of $12.0 million to the investor. On March 24, 2020, we drew down approximately $6.9 million under the Term Note, and after payment of commitment and funding fees paid to BRF Finance in the amount of approximately $0.7 million, and other of its legal fees and expenses that we incurred, we received net proceeds of $6.0 million. The net proceeds were used by us for working capital and general corporate purposes. Additional borrowings under the Term Note requested by us may be made at the option of the purchasers. Up to $8.0 million in principal amount under the Term Note was originally due on March 31, 2021. Interest on amounts outstanding under the Term Note was payable in-kind in arrears on the last day of each fiscal quarter.\nPursuant to the terms of Amendment 1, the maturity date was changed from March 31, 2021 to March 31, 2022. Amendment 1 also provided that BRF Finance, as holder, could originally elect, in lieu of receipt of cash for payment of all or any portion of the interest due or cash payments up to the Conversion Portion (as defined in Amendment 1) of the Term Note, to receive shares of Series K Preferred Stock; however, after December 18, 2020, the date the Series K Preferred Stock converted into shares of our common stock, the holder may elect, in lieu of receipt of cash for such amounts, shares of our common stock based upon the conversion rate specified in the Certificate of Designation for the Series K Preferred Stock (or $0.40).\nAs of March 22, 2021, approximately $3.4 million, including approximately $3.3 million of principal amount of the Term Note and approximately $0.7 million of accrued interest, had been converted into shares of our Series K Preferred Stock. The aggregate principal amount outstanding under the Term Note as of March 22, 2021 was approximately $4.3 million (including payment of in-kind interest of approximately $0.7 million, which was added to the outstanding Term Note balance).\nPayroll Protection Program Loan. On April 6, 2020, we issued a note in favor of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., pursuant to the recently enacted Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act ( CARES Act\u201d) administered by the U.S. Small Business Administration ( SBA\u201d). We received total proceeds of approximately $5.7 million under the note. In accordance with the requirements of the CARES Act, we will use proceeds from the note primarily for payroll costs. The note is scheduled to mature on April 6, 2022 and has a 0.98% interest rate and is subject to the terms and conditions applicable to loans administered by the SBA under the CARES Act. The balance outstanding as of the issuance date of our accompanying consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2019 was approximately $5.7 million.\nThe note is eligible for partial forgiveness for the principal amounts that are used for the limited purposes that qualify for forgiveness under SBA requirements. In order to obtain forgiveness, we must request it and must provide documentation in accordance with the SBA requirements, and certify that the amounts we are requesting to be forgiven qualify under those requirements. We will remain responsible under the note for any amounts not forgiven, and that interest payable under the note will not be forgiven but that the SBA may pay the note interest on forgiven amounts. Requirements for forgiveness, among other requirements, provide for eligible expenditures, necessary records/documentation, or possible reductions of the forgiven amount due to changes in number of employees or compensation. It is our expectation that 100% of the principal amount of the note will be forgiven; however, no assurance to this effect can be given.\nTable 49: <table><tr><td>32 </td> </tr>\n</table>\n12% Convertible Debentures. On December 31, 2020, noteholders converted the 12% convertible debentures representing an aggregate of approximately $18.1 million of the then-outstanding principal and accrued but unpaid interest into 53,887,470 shares of our common stock at effective conversion per-share prices ranging from $0.33 to $0.40. Despite the terms of the 12% convertible debentures, the noteholders agreed to allow us to repay accrued but unpaid interest in shares of our common stock. The remaining 12% convertible debentures representing an aggregate of approximately $1.1 million of outstanding principal and accrued interest were not converted and, instead, such amounts were repaid in cash to the noteholders.\nGoing Concern\nWe performed an annual reporting period going concern assessment. Management is required to assess our ability to continue as a going concern. This Annual Report has been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and the liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. Our accompanying consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if we are unable to continue as a going concern.\nWe have had a history of recurring losses. Our recurring losses from operations and net capital deficiency have been evaluated by management to determine if the significance of those conditions or events would limit our ability to meet its obligations when due. The operating loss realized in fiscal 2019 was primarily a result of a marketing investment in customer growth, together with investment in people and technology as we continued to expand our operations, and operations rapidly expanding during fiscal 2019 with the TheStreet Merger and the Sports Illustrated Licensing Agreement. The operating loss realized in fiscal 2018 was primarily a result of investments in people, infrastructure for the Maven Platform and the operations rapidly expanding during fiscal 2018 with the acquisitions of HubPages and Say Media, along with continued costs based on the strategic growth plans in other verticals.\nAs reflected in our accompanying consolidated financial statements, we had revenues of approximately $53.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, and have experienced recurring net losses from operations, negative working capital and negative operating cash flows. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we incurred a net loss attributable to common stockholders of approximately $39.1 million, utilized cash in operating activities of approximately $57.0 million, and as of December 31, 2019, had an accumulated deficit of approximately $73.6 million. We have financed our working capital requirements since inception through the issuance of debt and equity securities.\nIn 2020 and continuing into 2021, we have also been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Many national governments and sports authorities around the world have made the decision to postpone/cancel high attendance sports events in an effort to reduce the spread of COVID-19. In addition, many governments and businesses have limited non-essential work activity, furloughed, and/or terminated many employees and closed some operations and/or locations, all of which has had a negative impact on the economic environment. As a result of these factors, we experienced a decline in traffic, advertising revenue, and earnings since early March 2020, due to the cancellation of high attendance sports events and the resulting decrease in traffic to the Maven Platform and advertising revenue. We have implemented cost reduction measures in an effort to offset our revenue and earnings declines, while experiencing increased cash flows by growth in digital subscriptions. The extent of the impact on our operational and financial performance will depend on future developments, including the duration and spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, related group gathering and sports event advisories and restrictions, and the extent and effectiveness of containment actions taken, all of which remain uncertain at the time of issuance of our accompanying consolidated financial statements.\nManagement has evaluated whether relevant conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Substantial doubt exists when conditions and events, considered in the aggregate, indicate it is probable that a company will not be able to meet its obligations as they become due within one year after the issuance date of its financial statements. Management's assessment is based on the relevant conditions that are known or reasonably knowable as of the date our accompanying consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2019 were issued or were available to be issued.\nTable 50: <table><tr><td>33 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nManagement's assessment of our ability to meet our future obligations is inherently judgmental, subjective and susceptible to change. The factors that we considered important in our going concern analysis, include, but are not limited to, our fiscal 2021 cash flow forecast and our fiscal 2021 operating budget. Management also considered our ability to repay our convertible debt through future equity and the implementation of cost reduction measures in effect to offset revenue and earnings declines from COVID-19. These factors consider information including, but not limited to, our financial condition, liquidity sources, obligations due within one year after the issuance date of our accompanying financial statements, the funds necessary to maintain operations and financial conditions, including negative financial trends or other indicators of possible financial difficulty.\nIn particular, our plan for the: (1) 2021 cash flow forecast, considered the use of our working capital line with FastPay (as described in Note 28, Subsequent Events, to our accompanying consolidated financial statements) to fund changes in working capital, where we have available credit of approximately $8.7 million as of the issuance date of our accompanying consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2019, and that we do not anticipate the need for any further borrowings that are subject to the holders approval, from our Term Note (as described in Note 28, Subsequent Events, to our accompanying consolidated financial statements) where we may be permitted to borrow up to an additional $5 million; and (2) 2021 operating budget, considered that approximately sixty-five percent of our revenue is from recurring subscriptions, generally paid in advance, and that digital subscription revenue, that accounts for approximately thirty percent of subscription revenue, grew approximately thirty percent in 2020 demonstrating the strength of our premium brand, and the plan to continue to grow our subscription revenue from our 2019 acquisition of TheStreet (as described in Note 28, Subsequent Events, to our accompanying consolidated financial statements) and to launch premium digital subscriptions from our Sports Illustrated licensed brands (as described in Note 28, Subsequent Events, to our accompanying consolidated financial statements), in January 2021.\nWe have considered both quantitative and qualitative factors as part of the assessment that are known or reasonably knowable as of the date our accompanying consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2019 were issued or were available to be issued, and concluded that conditions and events considered in the aggregate, do not raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern for a one-year period following the financial statement issuance date.\nResults of

The total net loss increased by approximately $12.4 million from approximately $26.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The primary reason for the increase in the total net loss is due to the continued rapid expansion of our operations during fiscal 2019 as they did in fiscal 2018, resulting in total operating costs of approximately $48.2 million for fiscal 2019, as compared to approximately $12.4 million for fiscal 2018. In particular, in fiscal 2019, we completed TheStreet Merger and entered into the Sports Illustrated Licensing Agreement to license the Sports Illustrated Brands. In fiscal 2018, we completed the HubPages Merger and the Say Media Merger. The basic and diluted net loss per common share for the year ended December 31, 2019 of $1.04 decreased from $1.69 for the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily because the weighted average basic and diluted shares increased as the net loss attributable to common stockholders increased. In fiscal 2018, the primary reasons for the increase in the net loss attributable to common stockholders was the deemed dividend on the Series H Preferred Stock of approximately $18.0 million, other expenses of approximately $17.2 million, and the calculation of the daily weighted average shares outstanding increased to 37,080,784 shares from 26,128,796 shares.\nOur growth strategy is principally focused on adding new publisher partners to our technology platform. In addition, if the right opportunity exists, we may also acquire related online media, publishing, and technology businesses. This combined growth strategy has expanded the scale of unique users interacting on our technology platform with increased revenues during 2019. We expect revenues increases in subsequent years will come from organic growth in operations, addition of more publisher partners, and mergers and acquisitions.\nTable 76: <table><tr><td>40 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenue\nThe following table sets forth revenue, cost of revenue, and gross profit (loss):\nTable 77: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Years Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 versus 2018 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>% Change </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(percentage reflect cost of revenue as a percentage of total revenue) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Revenue </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>53,343,310 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,700,199 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>47,643.11 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>835.8 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Cost of revenue </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>47,301,175 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>88.7 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,641,684 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>134.1 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>39,659,491 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>519.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Gross profit (loss) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>6,042,135 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11.3 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(1,941,485 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(34.1 </td> <td>)% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>7,983,620 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(411.2 </td> <td>)% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following table sets forth revenue by product line and the corresponding percent of total revenue:\nTable 78: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Years Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 versus 2018 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>% Change </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(percentages reflect product line as a percentage of total revenue) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Advertising </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>35,918,370 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>67.3 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,614,953 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>98.5 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>30,303,417 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>531.6 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Digital subscriptions </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,855,038 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12.9 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>85,246 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.5 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,769,792 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>118.8 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Magazine circulation </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9,046,473 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9,046,473 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>158.7 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Other </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,523,429 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.9 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,523,429 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>26.7 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total revenue </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>53,343,310 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,700,199 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>47,643,111 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>835.8 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, we had revenue of approximately $53.3 million as compared to revenue of approximately $5.7 million in 2018. During fiscal 2019, the primary sources of revenue were as follows: (i) approximately $35.9 million from advertising, due to $2.1 million generated by TheStreet, $11.2 million generated by Sports Illustrated, $6.7 million generated by HubPages, $14.7 million generated by Say Media, and $1.3 million generated by our legacy business; (ii) approximately $6.9 million from digital subscriptions, due to $5.5 million generated by TheStreet, $1.1 million generated by Sports Illustrated, $0.2 million generated by Say Media, and $0.1 million generated by our legacy business; (iii) approximately $9.0 million from magazine circulation, entirely generated by Sports Illustrated; and (iv) approximately $1.5 million from other revenue, due to $0.3 million generated by the TheStreet, $0.8 million generated by Sports Illustrated, $0.2 million generated by HubPages, $0.1 million generated by Say Media, and $0.2 million generated by our legacy business. During fiscal 2019, we generated revenue from our legacy business primarily from operations of on-line media channels from the Channel Partners generating advertising and membership subscriptions and, to a lesser extent, from the operations of TheStreet and Sports Illustrated. During fiscal 2018, we generated revenue from our legacy business primarily from operations of online media channels from the Channel Partners generating advertising and membership subscriptions and, to a lesser extent from the operation of HubPages and Say Media.\nCost of Revenue\nFor the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, we recognized cost of revenue of approximately $47.3 million and approximately $7.6 million, respectively. The increase of approximately $39.7 million in cost of revenue is primarily from our Channel Partner guarantees and revenue share payments of approximately $10.9 million; payroll and related expenses for customer support, technology maintenance and occupancy costs of related personnel of approximately $8.3 million; amortization of our Maven Platform of approximately $3.8 million (which includes our Maven Platform spending and amortization related to acquired developed technology from our acquisitions); royalty fees of $3.8 million; hosting, bandwidth, and software licensing fees of approximately $0.9 million; printing, distribution, and fulfillment costs of approximately $7.7 million; fees paid for data analytics and to other outside services providers of approximately $2.3 million; stock-based compensation of approximately $0.8 million; and other costs of revenue of approximately $1.1 million.\nTable 79: <table><tr><td>41 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, we capitalized costs related to the Maven Platform of approximately $3.8 million, as compared to approximately $4.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2018 when our technology operations were primarily in the application and development phase. In fiscal 2019, the capitalization of the Maven Platform development consisted of approximately $2.5 million in payroll and related expenses, including taxes and benefits, approximately $1.3 million in stock-based compensation for related personnel, and amortization of approximately $2.7 million. In fiscal 2018, costs of revenues consisted of approximately $2.2 million in payroll and related expenses, including taxes and benefits, approximately $1.9 million in stock-based compensation for related personnel, and amortization of approximately $1.8 million.\nOperating Expenses\nThe following table sets forth operating expenses and the corresponding percentage of total revenue:\nTable 80: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Years Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 versus 2018 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>% Change </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(percentages reflect expense as a percentage of total revenue) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Selling and marketing </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>12,789,056 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>24.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,720,714 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>30.2 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>11,068,342 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>643.2 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>General and administrative </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>29,511,204 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>55.3 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10,286,997 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>180.5 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>19,224,207 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>186.9 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Depreciation and amortization </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,551,372 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8.5 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>64,676 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.1 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,486,696 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,937.2 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total operating expenses </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>46,851,632 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>12,072,387 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>34,779,245 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>288.1 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nSelling and Marketing. For the year ended December 31, 2019, we incurred selling and marketing costs of approximately $12.8 million, as compared to approximately $1.7 million in 2018. The increase in selling and marketing costs of approximately $11.1 million in fiscal 2019 is primarily due to payroll of selling and marketing account management support teams, along with the related benefits and stock-based compensation of approximately $5.9 million; professional marketing professionals of approximately $0.7 million; office, travel, conferences, and occupancy costs of approximately $0.3 million; circulation costs of approximately $0.5 million; advertising and other related fulfillment costs of approximately $1.9 million; and other selling and marketing related costs of approximately $1.8 million.\nGeneral and Administrative. For the year ended December 31, 2019, we incurred general and administrative costs of approximately $29.5 million from payroll and related expenses, professional services, occupancy costs, stock-based compensation of related personnel, depreciation and amortization and other corporate expense, as compared to approximately $10.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase in general and administrative expenses of approximately $19.2 million is primarily due to our increase in headcount from 87 to 170 employees, along with the related benefits and stock compensation of approximately $12.3 million; professional services, including accounting, legal and insurance of approximately $5.4 million and facilities costs of approximately $0.8 million.\nTable 81: <table><tr><td>42 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOther (Expenses) Income\nThe following table sets forth other (expense) income:\nTable 82: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Years Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 versus 2018 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>% Change </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(percentages reflect other expense (income)\nas a percentage of the total)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Change in valuation of warrant derivative liabilities </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(1,015,151 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.9 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>964,124 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>-7.9 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(1,979,275 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16.3 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Change in valuation of embedded derivative liabilities </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(5,040,000 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>29.2 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2,971,694 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>24.5 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2,068,306 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>True-up termination fee </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,344,648 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11.1 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,344,648 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>-11.1 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Settlement of promissory notes receivable </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(3,366,031 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>27.7 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,366,031 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>-27.7 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Interest expense </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(10,463,570 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>60.7 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2,508,874 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>20.7 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(7,954,696 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>65.5 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Interest income </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13,976 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>-0.1 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>22,262 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>-0.2 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(8,286 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.1 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Liquidated damages </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(728,516 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.2 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2,940,654 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>24.2 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,212,138 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>-18.2 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Other income </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>262 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(129 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>391 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total other (expense) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(17,232,999 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(12,145,644 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(5,087,355 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>41.9 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nChange in Valuation of Warrant Derivative Liabilities.

The change in valuation of embedded derivative liabilities was the result of the loss recognized from the change in the fair value of the embedded derivative liabilities as of December 31, 2019 as compared to December 31, 2018.\nTrue-Up Termination Fee. On June 15, 2018, we entered into a securities purchase agreement with four investors to sell approximately $4.8 million principal amount of 10% senior convertible debentures. Strome Mezzanine Fund LP ( Strome\u201d) purchased $3.0 million of such principal amount and two of our senior executives and another investment fund purchased the remaining $1.8 million. On June 15, 2018, we also modified two previous securities purchase agreements dated January 4, 2018 and March 30, 2018 with Strome to eliminate the true-up provision under which we were committed to issue up to 1,700,000 shares of our common stock in certain circumstances. As consideration for such modification, we issued a warrant to Strome to purchase 1,500,000 shares of our common stock, exercisable at an initial price of $1.19 per share for a five-year period. The estimated fair value of this warrant on the June 15, 2018 issuance date of approximately $1.3 million, calculated pursuant to the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, was charged to operations as true-up termination fee during the year ended December 31, 2018. The true-up termination fee was the result of a modification two previous securities purchase agreements dated January 4, 2018 and March 30, 2018 with Strome during the year ended December 31, 2018.\nSettlement of Promissory Notes Receivable. On December 12, 2018, pursuant to the merger agreement with Say Media entered into on October 12, 2018, as amended on October 17, 2018, we settled the promissory notes receivable by effectively forgiving approximately $3.4 million of the balance due as of December 31, 2018.\nInterest Expense. We incurred interest expense of approximately $10.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to approximately $2.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily consisting of approximately $4.5 million of amortization of accretion of original issue discount and debt discount on notes payable; approximately $3.1 million of accrued interest; and approximately $2.9 million of cash paid for other interest. In fiscal 2018, interest expense primarily consisted of approximately $0.7 million of amortization of accretion of original issue discount and debt discount on notes payable; approximately $2.6 million of debt extinguishment; approximately $0.2 million of accrued interest; and approximately $0.1 million of other interest, less approximately $1.1 million gain on extinguishment of embedded derivatives liabilities upon extinguishment of host instrument.\nTable 83: <table><tr><td>43 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nLiquidated Damages. We recorded approximately $0.7 million of liquidating damages during the year ended December 31, 2019 primarily from issuance of the Series H, Series I, and Series J Preferred Stock, and 12% convertible debentures in fiscal 2019 since we determined that: (1) the registration statement covering the shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the Series H, Series I, and Series J Preferred Stock and conversation of the 12% convertible debentures would not be declared effective within the requisite time frame; and (2) that we would not be able to maintain its periodic filings in the requisite time frame with the SEC in order to satisfy the public information requirements under the applicable securities purchase agreements. We recorded liquidated damages of approximately $2.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2018 primarily from issuance of the Series H Preferred Stock and 12% convertible debentures in fiscal 2018.\nDeemed Dividend on Series H Preferred Stock. We recorded a beneficial conversion feature in the amount of approximately $18.0 million for the underlying common shares related to the 19,400 Series H Preferred Stock issuance since the nondetachable conversion feature was in-the-money (the conversion price of $0.33 was lower than our common stock trading price of $0.86) at the issuance date during the year ended December 31, 2018.\nRecent Disruptions to Our Operations\nOur normal business operations have recently been disrupted after the date our accompanying consolidated financial statements were issued for the year ended December 31, 2019 by a series of events surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic and related measures to control it. See Item 1A, Risk Factors - Because of the effects of COVID-19 pandemic and the uncertainty about their persistence, we may not be able to continue operations as a going concern.\u201d\nSeasonality\nWe expect to experience typical media company advertising and membership sales seasonality, which is strong in the fiscal fourth quarter and slower in the fiscal first quarter.\nEffects of Inflation\nTo date inflation has not had a material impact on our business or operating results.\nOur Future Business\nIn 2020, we completed the following acquisition:\nAsset Acquisition of LiftIgniter\nOn March 9, 2020, we entered into an asset purchase agreement with LiftIgniter and Maven Coalition, whereby Maven Coalition purchased substantially all the assets of LiftIgniter's machine learning platform, which personalizes content and product recommendations in real-time. The purchased assets included LiftIgniter's intellectual property and excluded certain accounts receivable. Maven Coalition also assumed certain of LiftIgniter's liabilities. The purchase price consisted of: (i) a cash payment of approximately $184,000 on February 19, 2020, in connection with the repayment of certain of its outstanding indebtedness; (ii) a cash payment at closing of approximately $131,200; (ii) collections of certain accounts receivable; (iv) on the first anniversary date of the closing issuance of restricted stock units for an aggregate of up to 312,500 shares of our common stock; and (v) on the second anniversary date of the closing issuance of restricted stock units for an aggregate of up to 312,500 shares of our common stock.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America ( GAAP\u201d) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reported periods. The more critical accounting estimates include estimates related to revenue recognition, platform development, impairment of long-lived assets, and stock-based compensation. We also have other key accounting policies, which involve the use of estimates, judgments and assumptions that are significant to understanding our results, which are described in Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, in our accompanying consolidated financial statements.\nTable 84: <table><tr><td>44 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Report, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. We believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the financial statements. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nRevenue\nIn accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC\u201d) 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, revenues are recognized when control of the promised goods or services are transferred to our customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration that we expect to receive in exchange for those goods or services. We generate all of its revenue from contracts with customers. We account for revenue on a gross basis, as compared to a net basis, in its statement of operations. We made this determination based on it taking the credit risk in its revenue-generating transactions and it also being the primary obligor responsible for providing the services to the customer. Cost of revenues is presented as a separate line item in the statement of operations.\nThe following is a description of the principal activities from which we generate revenue:\nAdvertising Revenue\nDigital Advertising. We recognize revenue from digital advertisements at the point when each ad is viewed. The quantity of advertisements, the impression bid prices, and revenue are reported on a real-time basis. We enter into contracts with advertising networks to serve display or video advertisements on the digital media pages associated with its various channels. Although reported advertising transactions are subject to adjustment by the advertising network partners, any such adjustments are known within a few days of month end. We owe our independent publisher Channel Partners a revenue share of the advertising revenue earned, which is recorded as service costs in the same period in which the associated advertising revenue is recognized.\nAdvertising revenue that is comprised of fees charged for the placement of advertising on the websites that we own and operate, is recognized as the advertising or sponsorship is displayed, provided that collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured.\nPrint Advertising. Advertising related revenues for print advertisements are recognized when advertisements are published (defined as an issue's on-sale date), net of provisions for estimated rebates, rate adjustments, and discounts.\nSubscription Revenue\nDigital Subscriptions. We enter into contracts with internet users that subscribe to premium content on the digital media channels. These contracts provide internet users with a membership subscription to access the premium content. For subscription revenue generated by our independent publisher Channel Partners' content, we owe our Channel Partners a revenue share of the membership subscription revenue earned, which is initially deferred and recorded as deferred contract costs. We recognize deferred contract costs over the membership subscription term in the same pattern that the associated membership subscription revenue is recognized.\nDigital subscription revenue generated from our websites that we own and operate are charged to customers' credit cards or are directly billed to corporate subscribers, and are generally billed in advance on a monthly, quarterly or annual basis. We calculate net subscription revenue by deducting from gross revenue an estimate of potential refunds from cancelled subscriptions as well as chargebacks of disputed credit card charges. Net subscription revenue is recognized ratably over the subscription periods. Deferred revenue relates to payments for subscription fees for which revenue has not been recognized because services have not yet been provided.\nTable 85: <table><tr><td>45 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nCirculation Revenue\nCirculation revenues include magazine subscriptions and single copy sales at newsstands.\nPrint Subscriptions. Revenue from magazine subscriptions are deferred and recognized proportionately as products are distributed to subscribers.\nNewsstand. Single copy revenue is recognized on the publication's on-sale date, net of provisions for estimated returns. We base our estimates for returns on historical experience and current marketplace conditions.\nLicensing Revenue\nContent licensing-based revenues are accrued generally monthly or quarterly based on the specific mechanisms of each contract. Generally, revenues are accrued based on estimated sales and adjusted as actual sales are reported by partners. These adjustments are typically recorded within three months of the initial estimates and have not been material. Any minimum guarantees are typically earned evenly over the fiscal year.\nCost of Revenue\nOur cost of revenue represents the cost of providing our digital media network channels and advertising and membership services. The cost of revenue that we have incurred in the periods presented primarily include:\nTable 86: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>Channel Partner guarantees and revenue share payments; </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>amortization of developed technology and platform development; </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>royalty fees; </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>hosting, bandwidth and software license fees; </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>printing, distribution, and fulfillment costs; </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>payroll and related expenses for customer support, technology maintenance, and occupancy costs of related personnel; </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>fees paid for data analytics and to other outside service providers; and </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>stock-based compensation of related personnel. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nPlatform Development\nFor the years presented, substantially all of our technology expenses are development costs for the Maven Platform that were capitalized as intangible costs. Technology costs are expensed as incurred or capitalized into property and equipment in accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB\u201d) Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC\u201d) Topic 350, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other. This ASC requires that costs incurred in the preliminary project and post-implementation stages of an internal use software project be expensed as incurred and that certain costs incurred in the application development stage of a project be capitalized.\nWe capitalize internal labor costs, including compensation, benefits and payroll taxes, incurred for certain capitalized platform development projects. Our policy with respect to capitalized internal labor stipulates that labor costs for employees working on eligible internal use capital projects are capitalized as part of the historical cost of the project when the impact, as compared to expensing such labor costs, is material. Maven Platform development capitalized during the application development stage of a project include:\nTable 87: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>payroll and related expenses for personnel; and </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>stock-based compensation of related personnel. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 88: <table><tr><td>46 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nSelling and Marketing\nSelling and marketing consist primarily of expenses incurred in selling and marketing our products.

Leases are recorded as an operating lease right-of-use assets and operating lease liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the consolidated balance sheets. At inception, we determine whether an arrangement that provides control over the use of an asset is a lease. When it is reasonably certain that we will exercise the renewal period, we include the impact of the renewal in the lease term for purposes of determining total future lease payments. Rent expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\nIn February 2016, FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU\u201d) ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), in order to increase transparency and comparability among organizations by recognizing lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet for those leases classified as operating leases under prior GAAP. We adopted ASU 2016-02 on January 1, 2019 which resulted in the recognition of right-of-use assets of approximately $1.7 million, lease liabilities for operating leases of approximately $1.8 million, with no cumulative effect adjustment on retained earnings on our consolidated balance sheets, with no material impact to our consolidated statements of operations (as further described in our accompanying consolidated financial statements in Note 7, Leases).\nTable 91: <table><tr><td>47 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nGoodwill\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets of businesses acquired in a business combination. Goodwill is not amortized but rather is tested for impairment at least annually on December 31, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of goodwill may not be recoverable. We have elected to first assess the qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis of determining whether it is necessary to perform the quantitative goodwill impairment test. If we determine that it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than its carrying amount, then the quantitative goodwill impairment test will be performed. The quantitative goodwill impairment test identifies goodwill impairment and measures the amount of goodwill impairment loss to be recognized by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. If the fair value exceeds the carrying amount, no further analysis is required; otherwise, any excess of the goodwill carrying amount over the implied fair value is recognized as an impairment loss, and the carrying value of goodwill is written down to fair value.\nStock Based Compensation\nWe provide stock-based compensation in the form of (a) stock awards to employees and directors, comprised of restricted stock awards and restricted stock units, (b) stock option grants to employees, directors and consultants, (c) common stock warrants to Channel Partners (as further described in Note 21, Stock Based Compensation, in our accompanying consolidated financial statements), and (d) common stock warrants to ABG (as further described in Note 21, Stock Based Compensation, in our accompanying consolidated financial statements).\nWe account for stock awards and stock option grants to employees, directors, and consultants by measuring the cost of services received in exchange for the stock-based payments as compensation expense in our consolidated financial statements. Stock awards and stock option grants to employees which are time-vested are measured at fair value on the grant date, and charged to operations ratably over the vesting period. Stock awards and stock option grants to employees which are performance-vested are measured at fair value on the grant date and charged to operations when the performance condition is satisfied.\nPrior to the adoption of ASU 2018-07 (as further described in our accompanying consolidated financial statement in Note 21, Stock Based Compensation), we accounted for stock-based payments to certain directors and consultants, and Channel Partners (collectively the non-employee awards\u201d) by determining the value of the stock compensation based upon the measurement date at either (a) the date at which a performance commitment is reached or (b) at the date at which the necessary performance to earn the equity instruments is complete, resulting in financial reporting period adjustments to stock-based compensation during the vesting terms for changes in the fair value of the awards. After adoption of ASU 2018-07, the measurement date for non-employee awards is the later of the adoption date of ASU 2018-07, or the date of grant, without change in the fair value of the award. There was no cumulative effect of adoption of ASU 2018-07 on January 1, 2019. For stock-based awards granted to non-employees subject to graded vesting that only contain service conditions, we have elected to recognize stock-based compensation expense using the straight-line recognition method.\nThe fair value measurement of equity awards and grants used for stock-based compensation is as follows: (1) restricted stock awards which are time-vested are determined using the quoted market price of the Company's common stock at the grant date; (2) restricted stock units and stock option grants which are time-vested and performance-vested are determined utilizing the Black-Scholes option-pricing model at the grant date; (3) restricted stock awards which provide for performance-vesting and a true-up provision are determined through consultants with our independent valuation firm using the binomial pricing model at the grant date; (4) stock option grants which provide for market-based vesting with a time-vesting overlay are determined through consultants with our independent valuation firm using the Monte Carlo model at the grant date; (5) Channel Partner warrants are determined utilizing the Black-Scholes option-pricing model; and (6) AGB Warrants are determined utilizing the Monte Carlo model (as further described in our accompanying consolidated financial statements in Note 21, Stock Based Compensation).\nTable 92: <table><tr><td>48 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nFair value determined under the Black-Scholes option-pricing model and Monte Carlo model is affected by several variables, the most significant of which are the life of the equity award, the exercise price of the stock option or warrants, as compared to the fair market value of the common stock on the grant date, and the estimated volatility of the common stock over the term of the equity award. Estimated volatility is based on the historical volatility of our common stock and is evaluated based upon market comparisons. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. The fair market value of common stock is determined by reference to the quoted market price of our common stock.\nThe fair value of the restricted stock units and stock options granted were probability weighted during the year ended December 31, 2019 under the Black-Scholes option-pricing model or Monte Carlo model as determined through consultants with our independent valuation firm since the value of the units or options, among other things, depend on the volatility of the underlying shares of our common stock, under the following two scenarios: (1) scenario one assumes that our common stock will be up-listed on a national stock exchange (the Exchange\u201d) on a certain listing date (the Up-list Date\u201d); and (2) scenario two assumes that our common stock is not up-listed on the Exchange prior to units' final vesting date (the No Up-list\u201d), collectively referred to as the Probability Weighted Scenarios\u201d.\nWe classify stock-based compensation expense in its consolidated statements of operations in the same manner in which the award recipient's cash compensation costs are classified.\nIncome Taxes\nWe utilize the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax law is recognized in results of operations in the period that includes the enactment date.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nWe periodically evaluate the carrying value of long-lived assets to be held and used when events or circumstances warrant such a review. The carrying value of a long-lived asset to be held and used is considered impaired when the anticipated separately identifiable undiscounted cash flows from such an asset are less than the carrying value of the asset. In that event, a loss is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the long-lived asset. Fair value is determined primarily by reference to the anticipated cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nNote 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, in our accompanying consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report includes Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAs of December 31, 2019, the following transactions, obligations or relationships represent our off-balance sheet arrangements:\nWarrant Derivative Liabilities\nStrome Warrants. On June 15, 2018, we modified the two securities purchase agreements dated January 4, 2018 and March 30, 2018 with Strome to eliminate the true-up provision under which we were committed to issue up to 1,700,000 shares of our common stock in certain circumstances (as further described in Note 20, Stockholders' Equity, in our accompanying consolidated financial statements). As consideration for such modification, we issued warrants to Strome (the Strome Warrants\u201d) to purchase up to 1,500,000 shares of our common stock, at an initial exercise price of $1.19 per share for a period of five years, subject to a reset provision and customary anti-dilution provisions. Strome was also granted observer rights on our Board. On August 3, 2018, as a result of the warrant exercise price being reduced to the floor exercise price and the triggering of the reset provision, the warrants no longer contained any reset provisions and will continue to be carried on our consolidated balance sheets as a derivative liability at fair value, as adjusted at each period-end since, among other criteria, delivery of unregistered shares is precluded upon exercise. Warrants exercisable for up to 1,500,000 shares of our common stock were outstanding as of December 31, 2019, with a derivative liability fair value of $760,042. In the event Strome decided to exercise these warrants, since shares of our common stock were available to settle the instrument, there would be no impact to our cash resources.\nTable 93: <table><tr><td>49 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nB. Riley Warrants. On October 18, 2018, we issued warrants to the investors to purchase up to 875,000 shares of our common stock in connection with the 10% OID convertible debentures, with an exercise price of $1.00 per share (as further described in Note 20, Stockholders' Equity, in our accompanying consolidated financial statements). The warrant instrument provides that upon the consummation of a subsequent financing, the $1.00 exercise price shall be adjusted under certain conditions. We determined that the aforementioned $1.00 exercise price adjustment provisions were inconsequential since we did not anticipate a consumption of a subsequent financing that would trigger a subsequent financing condition, therefore, we will carry the warrants on our consolidated balance sheets as a derivative liability at fair value, as adjusted at each period-end since, among other criteria, delivery of unregistered shares is precluded upon exercise. The warrants are exercisable for a period of seven years, subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments, and may, if at any time after the six-month anniversary of the issuance of the warrants there is no effective registration statement covering the re-sale of the shares of common stock underlying the warrants, be exercised on a cashless basis. Warrants exercisable for up to 875,000 shares of our common stock were outstanding as of December 31, 2019, with a derivative liability fair value of $607,513. In the event B. Riley decided to exercise these warrants (which are subject to certain contractual exercise limitations), since shares of our common stock were available to settle the instrument after considering the contractual exercise limitations, there would be no impact to our cash resources.\nEmbedded Derivative Liabilities\n12% Convertible Debentures. On December 12, 2018, we entered into a securities purchase agreement with three accredited investors, pursuant to which we issued to the investors 12% convertible debentures in the aggregate principal amount of $13,091,528, which included (i) the roll-over of an aggregate of $3,551,528 in principal and interest of the 10% OID convertible debentures issued to two of the investors on October 18, 2018 (as further described in Note 17, Convertible Debt, in our accompanying consolidated financial statements), and (ii) a placement fee of $540,000 to the placement agent, B. Riley FBR, in the offering. After payment of legal fees and expenses of the investors, we received net proceeds of approximately $9.0 million. On March 18, 2019, we entered into a securities purchase agreement with two accredited investors, including John Fichthorn, our Executive Chairman of our Board, pursuant to which we issued 12% convertible debentures in the aggregate principal amount of $1,696,000, which included a placement fee of $96,000 paid to B. Riley FBR in the form of a 12% convertible debenture, for acting as the Company's placement agent in the offering. We received net proceeds of $1,600,000 and paid legal fees and expenses of $10,000 in cash. On March 27, 2019, we entered into a securities purchase agreement with an accredited investor pursuant to which we issued 12% convertible debentures in the aggregate principal amount of $318,000, which included a placement fee of $18,000 paid to B. Riley FBR in the form of a 12% convertible debenture for acting as our placement agent in the offering. We received net proceeds of $300,000. On April 8, 2019, we entered into a securities purchase agreement with an accredited investor, Todd D. Sims, a member of our Board, pursuant to which we issued a 12% convertible debenture in the aggregate principal amount of $100,000 and received $100,000 from the proceeds.\nThe 12% convertible debentures issued on December 12, 2018 were convertible into shares of our common stock at the option of the investor at any time prior to December 31, 2020, at a conversion price of $0.33 per share, subject to adjustment for stock splits, stock dividends, and similar transactions, and beneficial ownership blocker provisions. The 12% convertible debentures issued on March 18, 2019, March 27, 2019, and April 8, 2019 were convertible into shares of our common stock at the option of the respective investor at any time prior to December 31, 2020, at a conversion price of $0.40 per share, subject to adjustment for stock splits, stock dividends, and similar transactions, and beneficial ownership blocker provisions. The investors ability to convert the 12% convertible debentures was subject to us receiving stockholder approval to increase our authorized number of shares of our common stock. Interest accrued at the rate of 12% per annum, payable on the earlier of conversion or December 31, 2020. Our obligations under the 12% convertible debentures were secured pursuant to the security agreement we entered into with each investor.\nUpon issuance of the 12% convertible debentures, we recognized a conversion option, buy-in feature, and default remedy feature as embedded derivatives that were bifurcated from the note instruments; therefore, we will carry the embedded derivative liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets at fair value, as adjusted at each period-end since, among other criteria, delivery of unregistered shares is precluded upon conversion. As of December 31, 2019, the fair value of the embedded derivative liabilities was approximately $13.5 million. If the investors decided to exercise their conversion rights under the debentures, since shares of our common stock were available to settle the instruments after considering the contractual conversion limitations, there would be no impact to our cash resources. Subsequent to December 31, 2019, the 12% convertible debentures are no longer outstanding and approximately $18.1 million and $1.1 million of the then outstanding principal and interest of were fully converted and repaid in cash, respectively.\nTable 94: <table><tr><td>50 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table sets forth our principal cash operating obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2019, aggregating to approximately $13.9 million.\nTable 95: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Payments due by Year * </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2022 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2023 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Operating leases </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,820,761 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,579,924 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>730,688 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>747,993 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>762,156 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Employment contracts </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,175,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>900,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>825,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>450,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Consulting agreement </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,881,722 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,923,722 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,958,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>13,877,483 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>8,403,646 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,513,688 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,197,993 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>762,156 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n* Subsequent to December 31, 2019, we entered into to several operating lease obligations, which are not reflected in the above table.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThis Annual Report includes, in one comprehensive filing, the business and financial information for the Fiscal Year Period (i.e., the year ended December 31, 2019), as well as for the Interim Periods (i.e., the three months ended March 31, 2019, the three and six months ended June 30, 2019, and the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019). Therefore, this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations provides an analysis of the financial condition and results of operations for the Fiscal Year Period and the Interim Periods. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes to those statements that are included elsewhere in this Annual Report. Our discussion includes forward-looking statements based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties, such as our plans, objectives, expectations, and intentions. Actual results and the timing of events could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of a number of factors. We use words such as anticipate,\u201d estimate,\u201d plan,\u201d project,\u201d continuing,\u201d ongoing,\u201d expect,\u201d believe,\u201d intend,\u201d may,\u201d will,\u201d should,\u201d could,\u201d and similar expressions to identify forward-looking statements.\nPlease see Our Future Business\u201d and Future Liquidity\u201d for additional important information.\nOverview\nWe operate a best-in-class technology platform empowering premium publishers who impact, inform, educate and entertain. We operate the media businesses for Sports Illustrated and TheStreet, and power more than 250 independent brands including History, Maxim, and Biography. The Maven Platform provides digital publishing, distribution and monetization capabilities to our own Sports Illustrated and TheStreet media businesses as well as to the Channel Partners. Generally, the Channel Partners are independently owned strategic partners who receive a share of revenue from the interaction with their content. They also benefit from our membership marketing and management systems to further enhance their revenue.\nOur growth strategy is to continue to expand by adding new premium publishers with high quality brands and content either as independent Channel Partners or by acquiring publishers as owned and operated entities. By adding premium content brands, we will further expand the scale of the Maven Platform, improve monetization effectiveness in both advertising and subscription revenues, and enhance the attractiveness to consumers and advertisers.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAs of December 31, 2019, our principal sources of liquidity consisted of cash of approximately $8.9 million. As of the issuance date of our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2019, we had also received funds from loan proceeds of approximately $17.6 million from additional resources, including proceeds under our working capital facility with FPP Finance LLC ( FastPay\u201d), a delayed draw loan, and payroll protection program loan, all of which are discussed in greater detail below in the section entitled Future Liquidity.\u201d\nWe continued to be focused on growing our existing operations and seeking accretive and complementary strategic acquisitions as part of our growth strategy. We believed, that with additional sources of liquidity and the ability to raise additional capital or incur additional indebtedness to supplement our then internal projections, we would be able to execute our growth plan and finance our working capital requirements.\n 27 \nWe have financed our working capital requirements since inception through issuances of equity securities and various debt financings. Our working capital deficit as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 was as follows:\n\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had a working capital deficit of approximately $39.4 million, consisting of approximately $48.2 million in total current assets and approximately $87.5 million in total current liabilities. Included in current assets as of December 31, 2019 was approximately $0.6 million of restricted cash. Also included in our working capital deficit was non-cash current liabilities, consisting of approximately $1.6 million of warrant derivative liabilities and approximately $13.5 million of embedded derivative liabilities, leaving a working capital deficit that required cash payments of approximately $24.9 million. As of December 31, 2018, we had a working capital deficit of approximately $12.0 million, consisting of approximately $9.5 million in total current assets and approximately $21.5 million in total current liabilities.\nOur cash flows during the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 consisted of the following:\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, net cash used in operating activities was approximately $57.0 million, consisting primarily of approximately $54.7 million used in cash for general and administrative expenses, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018, where net cash used in operating activities was approximately $7.4 million, consisting primarily of approximately $7.1 million for general and administrative expenses.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, net cash used in investing activities was approximately $19.0 million, consisting primarily of approximately $16.3 million for acquisition of businesses (which included the recognition of approximately $4.4 million for developed technology, approximately $2.6 million for the trade name, approximately $2.2 million for subscriber relationships, approximately $2.2 million for advertiser relationships, and approximately $1.1 million for databases acquired in TheStreet Merger), and approximately $2.5 million for our capitalized Maven Platform development. For the year ended December 31, 2018, net cash used in investing activities was approximately $23.6 million, consisting primarily of approximately $18.0 million for acquisition of businesses (which included the recognition of approximately $6.7 million for developed technology and approximately $0.3 million for the trade name in connection with the HubPages Merger, and the recognition of approximately $8.0 million for developed technology, approximately $0.5 million for trade name, and approximately $0.5 million for noncompete agreement in connection with the Say Media Merger), approximately $3.4 million from promissory notes proceeds, and approximately $2.2 million for our capitalized platform development.\n 28 \nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, net cash provided by financing activities was approximately $82.9 million, consisting of: (i) approximately $36.1 million in net proceeds from the issuance of Series I Convertible Preferred Stock ( Series I Preferred Stock\u201d) and Series J Convertible Preferred Stock ( Series J Preferred Stock\u201d) (for additional information see below); (ii) $2.0 million in gross proceeds from 12% senior secured subordinated convertible debentures (referred to herein as the 12% convertible debentures\u201d) (for additional information, see Note 17, Convertible Debt, in our accompanying consolidated financial statements); and (iii) $44.9 million in net debt financings, consisting of (x) $46.5 million in net proceeds from issuance of 12% senior secured notes, less repayments of long-term debt and debt issuance costs; offset by (y) approximately $0.4 million in repayment of officer promissory notes; (y) approximately $0.3 million in payments for taxes relating to repurchase of restricted shares; and (z) approximately $1.0 million in repayments of our line of credit.

On June 28, 2019, we issued shares of our Series I Preferred Stock pursuant to a securities purchase agreement entered into with certain accredited investors. In accordance with the securities purchase agreement, we issued an aggregate of 23,100 shares of Series I Preferred Stock at a stated value of $1,000, initially convertible into 46,200,000 shares of our common stock at a conversion rate equal to the stated value divided by the conversion price of $0.50 per share, for aggregate gross proceeds of $23.1 million used for working capital and general corporate purposes. Each share of Series I Preferred Stock is entitled to vote on an as-if-converted to common stock basis, subject to certain conditions.\nThe shares of Series I Preferred Stock were subject to limitations on conversion into shares of our common stock until the date an amendment to our certificate of incorporation was filed and accepted with the State of Delaware that increased the number of authorized shares of our common stock to at least a number permitting all the Series H Preferred Stock and Series I Preferred Stock to be converted in full. On December 18, 2020, we filed a Certificate of Amendment to our Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as amended (the Certificate of Amendment\u201d), to increase the number of authorized shares of our common stock. Accordingly, we do not have any shares of our Series I Preferred Stock currently outstanding. Please see Note 20, Stockholders' Equity, in our accompanying consolidated financial statements for addition information.\nSeries J Preferred Stock. On October 7, 2019, we issued shares of our Series J Preferred Stock pursuant to a securities purchase agreement with certain accredited investors. In accordance with the securities purchase agreement, we issued an aggregate of 20,000 shares of Series J Preferred Stock at a stated value of $1,000, initially convertible into 28,571,428 shares of our common stock at a conversion rate equal to the stated value divided by the conversion price of $0.70 per share, for aggregate gross proceeds of $20.0 million, and after principal and interest of $5.0 million from the 12% senior secured notes were converted into shares of our Series J Preferred Stock, we received net proceeds of $15.0 million, which we used for working capital and general corporate purposes. Each share of Series J Preferred Stock is entitled to vote on an as-if-converted to common stock basis, subject to certain conditions.\nThe shares of Series J Preferred Stock were subject to limitations on conversion into shares of our common stock until the date an amendment to our certificate of incorporation was filed and accepted with the State of Delaware that increases the number of authorized shares of our common stock to at least a number permitting all the Series H Preferred Stock, Series I Preferred Stock and Series J Preferred Stock to be converted in full. On December 18, 2020, in connection with the filing of a Certificate of Amendment, we increased the number of authorized shares of our common stock. Accordingly, we do not have any shares of our Series J Preferred Stock currently outstanding. Please see Note 20, Stockholders' Equity, in our accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information.\n 29 \nOur consolidated financial statements have been presented on the basis that we are a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. We had revenues of approximately $53.2 million during fiscal 2019, and have experienced recurring net losses from operations and negative operating cash flows. Consequently, we were dependent upon continued access to funding and capital resources from both new investors and related parties. If continued funding and capital resources are unavailable at reasonable terms, we may not be able to implement our growth plan and plan of operations. These financings may include terms that may be highly dilutive to existing stockholders.\nFuture Liquidity\nFrom January 1, 2020 to the issuance date of our accompanying consolidated financial statements for the Fiscal Year Period and the Interim Periods, we continued to incur operating losses and negative cash flow from operating and investing activities. We have raised $23.7 million in net proceeds pursuant to the sale and issuances of Series H Preferred Stock, Series I Preferred Stock, Series J Preferred Stock, and Series K Convertible Preferred Stock (the Series K Preferred Stock\u201d) and $17.6 million in various debt financings. Noteholders also converted our 12% convertible debentures representing an aggregate of approximately $18.1 million of the then-outstanding principal and accrued but unpaid interest, with the remaining noteholders holding our 12 convertible debentures representing an aggregate of approximately $1.1 million of outstanding principal and accrued interest were not converted and, instead, such amounts were repaid in cash to such noteholders. We also entered into an Exchange Agreement with a former officer pursuant to which, the parties agreed that in exchange of $0.4 million of outstanding principal and accrued but unpaid interest under certain officer promissory notes we would issue to him shares of our Series H Preferred Stock. Our cash balance as of the date our accompanying consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2019 were issued or were available to be issued was approximately $5.1 million. Summarized below are the additional debt financings and/or issued equity securities through the issuance of our consolidated financial statements.\nEquity Financings\nIncluded in the $23.7 million of equity financings (see Note 28, Subsequent Events, in our accompanying consolidated financial statements for further details) are the following:\nSeries H Preferred Stock. Between August 14, 2020 and August 20, 2020, we entered into several securities purchase agreements for the sale of Series H Preferred Stock with certain accredited investors, pursuant to which we issued an aggregate of 108 shares (after we rescinded the issuance of 2,145 shares that were deemed null and void and repaid to certain holders on October 28, 2020), at a stated value of $1,000 per share, initially convertible into 327,273shares of our common stock at a conversion rate equal to the stated value divided by the conversion price of $0.33 per share, for aggregate gross proceeds of approximately $130,000 for working capital and general corporate purposes. The number of shares issuable upon conversion of the Series H Preferred Stock will be adjusted in the event of stock splits, stock dividends, combinations of shares and similar transactions. Each share of Series H Preferred Stock is entitled to vote on an as-if-converted to common stock basis, subject to beneficial ownership blocker provisions and other certain conditions.\nThe shares of Series H Preferred Stock were subject to limitations on conversion into shares of our common stock until the date an amendment to our certificate of incorporation was filed and accepted with the State of Delaware that increases the number of authorized shares of our common stock to at least a number permitting all the Series H Preferred Stock to be converted in full. On December 18, 2020, we filed the Certificate of Amendment to increase the number of authorized shares of our common stock.\nSeries J Preferred Stock. On September 4, 2020, we closed on a Series J Preferred Stock issuance with two accredited investors, pursuant to which we issued an aggregate of 10,500 shares of Series J Preferred Stock at a stated value of $1,000 per share, initially convertible into 15,000,000 shares of our common stock at a conversion rate equal to the stated value divided by the conversion price of $0.70, for aggregate gross proceeds of $6.0 million for working capital and general corporate purposes.\nOn December 18, 2020, in connection with the filing of the Certificate of Amendment to increase the number of authorized shares of our common stock, the then-outstanding shares of Series J Preferred Stock automatically converted into shares of our common stock. Accordingly, we do not have any shares of our Series J Preferred Stock currently outstanding.\n 30 \nSeries K Preferred Stock. On October 22, 2020, 20,000 shares of our preferred stock were designated by our Board as Series K Preferred Stock. Between October 23, 2020 and November 11, 2020, we entered into several securities purchase agreements with accredited investors, pursuant to which we issued an aggregate of 18,042 shares of Series K Preferred Stock at a stated value of $1,000 per share, initially convertible into 45,105,000 shares of our common stock at a conversion rate equal to the stated value divided by the conversion price of $0.40 per share, for aggregate gross proceeds of approximately $18.0 million. The number of shares issuable upon conversion of the Series K Preferred Stock will be adjusted in the event of stock splits, stock dividends, combinations of shares and similar transactions. Each share of Series K Preferred Stock is entitled to vote on an as-if-converted to common stock basis, subject to other certain conditions.\nIn consideration for its services as placement agent, we paid B. Riley FBR, Inc. ( B. Riley FBR\u201d) a cash fee of $400,500. We used approximately $3.4 million of the net proceeds from the financing to partially repay the Term Note (as defined below) and used approximately $2.6 million for payment on a prior investment, with the remainder of approximately $12.0 million for working capital and general corporate purposes.\nOn December 18, 2020, in connection with the filing of the Certificate of Amendment to increase the number of authorized shares of our common stock, the then-outstanding shares of Series K Preferred Stock automatically converted into shares of our common stock. Accordingly, we do not have any shares of our Series K Preferred Stock currently outstanding.\nDebt Financings\nIncluded in the $16.8 million of debt financings (see Note 28, Subsequent Events, in our accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information) are the following:\nAmended and Restated 12% Senior Secured Notes. On February 27, 2020, we entered into a second amendment to the amended and restated note purchase agreement (the Second Amendment to A&R NPA\u201d), which further amended the amended and restated note purchase agreement, dated as of June 14, 2019 (the A&R NPA\u201d), with one accredited investor, BRF Finance Co., LLC ( BRF Finance\u201d), an affiliated entity of B. Riley Financial, Inc. ( B. Riley\u201d). The Second Amendment to A&R NPA further amended the amended and restated 12% senior secured note due June 14, 2022. Pursuant to the Second Amendment to A&R NPA, we replaced our previous $3.5 million working capital facility with Sallyport with a new $15.0 million working capital facility with FastPay; and (ii) BRF Finance issued a letter of credit in the amount of approximately $3.0 million to our landlord for our lease of the premises located at 225 Liberty Street, 27th Floor, New York, New York 10281. All borrowings under the amended and restated 12% senior secured notes are collateralized by substantially all assets of the Company.\nOn March 24, 2020, we entered into a second amended and restated note purchase agreement (the Second A&R NPA\u201d) with BRF Finance, an affiliated entity of B. Riley, in its capacity as agent for the purchasers, which further amended and restated the Second Amendment to A&R NPA. Pursuant to the Second A&R NPA, interest on amounts outstanding under the existing 12% senior secured notes with respect to (i) interest that was payable on such notes on March 31, 2020 and June 30, 2020, and (ii) at our option, with the consent of requisite purchasers, interest that was payable on such on September 30, 2020 and December 31, 2020, in lieu of the payment in cash of all or any portion of the interest due on such dates, would be payable in-kind in arrears on the last day of such applicable fiscal quarter.\nOn October 23, 2020, we entered into Amendment No. 1 to the Second A&R NPA with BRF Finance ( Amendment 1\u201d), pursuant to which the maturity date of the 12% senior secured notes was changed to December 31, 2022 or an earlier date if the obligations have been accelerated pursuant to and in accordance with the terms of Amendment 1. Pursuant to Amendment 1, interest payable on the existing 12% senior secured notes on September 30, 2020, December 31, 2020, March 31, 2021, June 30, 2021, September 30, 2021, and December 31, 2021 will be payable in-kind in arrears on the last day of such fiscal quarter. Alternatively, at the option of the holder, such interest amounts originally could have been paid in shares of Series K Preferred Stock; however, after December 18, 2020, the date the Series K Preferred Stock converted into shares of common stock, all such interest amounts can be paid in shares of our common stock based upon the conversion rate specified in the Certificate of Designation for the Series K Preferred Stock (or $0.40).\nThe balance outstanding under our amended and restated 12% senior secured notes as of the issuance date of our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2019 was approximately $56.3 million, which included outstanding principal of approximately $48.8 million, payment of in-kind interest of approximately $4.2 million that we were permitted to add to the aggregate outstanding principal balance, and unpaid accrued interest of approximately $3.3 million).\nFastPay Credit Facility. On February 6, 2020, we entered into a financing and security agreement with FastPay, pursuant to which FastPay extended a $15.0 million line of credit for working capital purposes secured by a first lien on all of our cash and accounts receivable and a second lien on all other assets. Borrowings under the facility bear interest at the LIBOR Rate plus 8.50% and have a final maturity of February 6, 2022. This line of credit was amended by that certain first amendment to financing and security agreement dated March 24, 2020 to permit us to amend and restate the 12% senior secured notes. The aggregate principal amount outstanding, plus accrued and unpaid interest, as of the issuance date of our accompanying consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2019 was approximately $5.0 million.\nSallyport Credit Facility. As of December 31, 2019, we no longer could borrow under our factoring facility with Sallyport and it was effectively closed effective January 30, 2020. As of May 4, 2020, all amounts owed to us by Sallyport were paid and there was no balance outstanding under the facility.\n 31 \nDelayed Draw Term Note. Pursuant to the Second A&R NPA, we agreed to issue, at BRF Finance's option, a 15% delayed draw term note (the Term Note\u201d), in the aggregate principal amount of $12.0 million to the investor. On March 24, 2020, we drew down approximately $6.9 million under the Term Note, and after payment of commitment and funding fees paid to BRF Finance in the amount of approximately $0.7 million, and other of its legal fees and expenses that we incurred, we received net proceeds of $6.0 million. The net proceeds were used by us for working capital and general corporate purposes. Additional borrowings under the Term Note requested by us may be made at the option of the purchasers. Up to $8.0 million in principal amount under the Term Note was originally due on March 31, 2021. Interest on amounts outstanding under the Term Note was payable in-kind in arrears on the last day of each fiscal quarter.\nPursuant to the terms of Amendment 1, the maturity date was changed from March 31, 2021 to March 31, 2022. Amendment 1 also provided that BRF Finance, as holder, could originally elect, in lieu of receipt of cash for payment of all or any portion of the interest due or cash payments up to the Conversion Portion (as defined in Amendment 1) of the Term Note, to receive shares of Series K Preferred Stock; however, after December 18, 2020, the date the Series K Preferred Stock converted into shares of our common stock, the holder may elect, in lieu of receipt of cash for such amounts, shares of our common stock based upon the conversion rate specified in the Certificate of Designation for the Series K Preferred Stock (or $0.40).\nAs of March 22, 2021, approximately $3.4 million, including approximately $3.3 million of principal amount of the Term Note and approximately $0.7 million of accrued interest, had been converted into shares of our Series K Preferred Stock. The aggregate principal amount outstanding under the Term Note as of March 22, 2021 was approximately $4.3 million (including payment of in-kind interest of approximately $0.7 million, which was added to the outstanding Term Note balance).\nPayroll Protection Program Loan. On April 6, 2020, we issued a note in favor of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., pursuant to the recently enacted Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act ( CARES Act\u201d) administered by the U.S. Small Business Administration ( SBA\u201d). We received total proceeds of approximately $5.7 million under the note. In accordance with the requirements of the CARES Act, we will use proceeds from the note primarily for payroll costs. The note is scheduled to mature on April 6, 2022 and has a 0.98% interest rate and is subject to the terms and conditions applicable to loans administered by the SBA under the CARES Act. The balance outstanding as of the issuance date of our accompanying consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2019 was approximately $5.7 million.\nThe note is eligible for partial forgiveness for the principal amounts that are used for the limited purposes that qualify for forgiveness under SBA requirements. In order to obtain forgiveness, we must request it and must provide documentation in accordance with the SBA requirements, and certify that the amounts we are requesting to be forgiven qualify under those requirements. We will remain responsible under the note for any amounts not forgiven, and that interest payable under the note will not be forgiven but that the SBA may pay the note interest on forgiven amounts. Requirements for forgiveness, among other requirements, provide for eligible expenditures, necessary records/documentation, or possible reductions of the forgiven amount due to changes in number of employees or compensation. It is our expectation that 100% of the principal amount of the note will be forgiven; however, no assurance to this effect can be given.\n 32 \n12% Convertible Debentures. On December 31, 2020, noteholders converted the 12% convertible debentures representing an aggregate of approximately $18.1 million of the then-outstanding principal and accrued but unpaid interest into 53,887,470 shares of our common stock at effective conversion per-share prices ranging from $0.33 to $0.40. Despite the terms of the 12% convertible debentures, the noteholders agreed to allow us to repay accrued but unpaid interest in shares of our common stock. The remaining 12% convertible debentures representing an aggregate of approximately $1.1 million of outstanding principal and accrued interest were not converted and, instead, such amounts were repaid in cash to the noteholders.\nGoing Concern\nWe performed an annual reporting period going concern assessment. Management is required to assess our ability to continue as a going concern. This Annual Report has been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and the liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. Our accompanying consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if we are unable to continue as a going concern.\nWe have had a history of recurring losses. Our recurring losses from operations and net capital deficiency have been evaluated by management to determine if the significance of those conditions or events would limit our ability to meet its obligations when due. The operating loss realized in fiscal 2019 was primarily a result of a marketing investment in customer growth, together with investment in people and technology as we continued to expand our operations, and operations rapidly expanding during fiscal 2019 with the TheStreet Merger and the Sports Illustrated Licensing Agreement. The operating loss realized in fiscal 2018 was primarily a result of investments in people, infrastructure for the Maven Platform and the operations rapidly expanding during fiscal 2018 with the acquisitions of HubPages and Say Media, along with continued costs based on the strategic growth plans in other verticals.\nAs reflected in our accompanying consolidated financial statements, we had revenues of approximately $53.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, and have experienced recurring net losses from operations, negative working capital and negative operating cash flows. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we incurred a net loss attributable to common stockholders of approximately $39.1 million, utilized cash in operating activities of approximately $57.0 million, and as of December 31, 2019, had an accumulated deficit of approximately $73.6 million. We have financed our working capital requirements since inception through the issuance of debt and equity securities.\nIn 2020 and continuing into 2021, we have also been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Many national governments and sports authorities around the world have made the decision to postpone/cancel high attendance sports events in an effort to reduce the spread of COVID-19. In addition, many governments and businesses have limited non-essential work activity, furloughed, and/or terminated many employees and closed some operations and/or locations, all of which has had a negative impact on the economic environment. As a result of these factors, we experienced a decline in traffic, advertising revenue, and earnings since early March 2020, due to the cancellation of high attendance sports events and the resulting decrease in traffic to the Maven Platform and advertising revenue. We have implemented cost reduction measures in an effort to offset our revenue and earnings declines, while experiencing increased cash flows by growth in digital subscriptions. The extent of the impact on our operational and financial performance will depend on future developments, including the duration and spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, related group gathering and sports event advisories and restrictions, and the extent and effectiveness of containment actions taken, all of which remain uncertain at the time of issuance of our accompanying consolidated financial statements.\nManagement has evaluated whether relevant conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Substantial doubt exists when conditions and events, considered in the aggregate, indicate it is probable that a company will not be able to meet its obligations as they become due within one year after the issuance date of its financial statements. Management's assessment is based on the relevant conditions that are known or reasonably knowable as of the date our accompanying consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2019 were issued or were available to be issued.\n 33 \nManagement's assessment of our ability to meet our future obligations is inherently judgmental, subjective and susceptible to change. The factors that we considered important in our going concern analysis, include, but are not limited to, our fiscal 2021 cash flow forecast and our fiscal 2021 operating budget. Management also considered our ability to repay our convertible debt through future equity and the implementation of cost reduction measures in effect to offset revenue and earnings declines from COVID-19. These factors consider information including, but not limited to, our financial condition, liquidity sources, obligations due within one year after the issuance date of our accompanying financial statements, the funds necessary to maintain operations and financial conditions, including negative financial trends or other indicators of possible financial difficulty.\nIn particular, our plan for the: (1) 2021 cash flow forecast, considered the use of our working capital line with FastPay (as described in Note 28, Subsequent Events, to our accompanying consolidated financial statements) to fund changes in working capital, where we have available credit of approximately $8.7 million as of the issuance date of our accompanying consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2019, and that we do not anticipate the need for any further borrowings that are subject to the holders approval, from our Term Note (as described in Note 28, Subsequent Events, to our accompanying consolidated financial statements) where we may be permitted to borrow up to an additional $5 million; and (2) 2021 operating budget, considered that approximately sixty-five percent of our revenue is from recurring subscriptions, generally paid in advance, and that digital subscription revenue, that accounts for approximately thirty percent of subscription revenue, grew approximately thirty percent in 2020 demonstrating the strength of our premium brand, and the plan to continue to grow our subscription revenue from our 2019 acquisition of TheStreet (as described in Note 28, Subsequent Events, to our accompanying consolidated financial statements) and to launch premium digital subscriptions from our Sports Illustrated licensed brands (as described in Note 28, Subsequent Events, to our accompanying consolidated financial statements), in January 2021.\nWe have considered both quantitative and qualitative factors as part of the assessment that are known or reasonably knowable as of the date our accompanying consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2019 were issued or were available to be issued, and concluded that conditions and events considered in the aggregate, do not raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern for a one-year period following the financial statement issuance date.\nResults of Operations\nSelected Financial Information for the Results of Operations for Each of the Quarterly Periods During Fiscal 2019 and Fiscal 2018\nRevenue\nThe following tables set forth revenue by product line:\n\n\n 34 \n\nDuring the three months ended March 31, 2019 and June 30, 2019, our revenue increased over the prior quarters as a result of the HubPages Merger and the Say Media Merger in fiscal 2018.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThis Annual Report includes, in one comprehensive filing, the business and financial information for the Fiscal Year Period (i.e., the year ended December 31, 2019), as well as for the Interim Periods (i.e., the three months ended March 31, 2019, the three and six months ended June 30, 2019, and the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019). Therefore, this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations provides an analysis of the financial condition and results of operations for the Fiscal Year Period and the Interim Periods. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes to those statements that are included elsewhere in this Annual Report. Our discussion includes forward-looking statements based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties, such as our plans, objectives, expectations, and intentions. Actual results and the timing of events could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of a number of factors. We use words such as anticipate,\u201d estimate,\u201d plan,\u201d project,\u201d continuing,\u201d ongoing,\u201d expect,\u201d believe,\u201d intend,\u201d may,\u201d will,\u201d should,\u201d could,\u201d and similar expressions to identify forward-looking statements.\nPlease see Our Future Business\u201d and Future Liquidity\u201d for additional important information.\nOverview\nWe operate a best-in-class technology platform empowering premium publishers who impact, inform, educate and entertain. We operate the media businesses for Sports Illustrated and TheStreet, and power more than 250 independent brands including History, Maxim, and Biography. The Maven Platform provides digital publishing, distribution and monetization capabilities to our own Sports Illustrated and TheStreet media businesses as well as to the Channel Partners. Generally, the Channel Partners are independently owned strategic partners who receive a share of revenue from the interaction with their content. They also benefit from our membership marketing and management systems to further enhance their revenue.\nOur growth strategy is to continue to expand by adding new premium publishers with high quality brands and content either as independent Channel Partners or by acquiring publishers as owned and operated entities. By adding premium content brands, we will further expand the scale of the Maven Platform, improve monetization effectiveness in both advertising and subscription revenues, and enhance the attractiveness to consumers and advertisers.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAs of December 31, 2019, our principal sources of liquidity consisted of cash of approximately $8.9 million. As of the issuance date of our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2019, we had also received funds from loan proceeds of approximately $17.6 million from additional resources, including proceeds under our working capital facility with FPP Finance LLC ( FastPay\u201d), a delayed draw loan, and payroll protection program loan, all of which are discussed in greater detail below in the section entitled Future Liquidity.\u201d\nWe continued to be focused on growing our existing operations and seeking accretive and complementary strategic acquisitions as part of our growth strategy. We believed, that with additional sources of liquidity and the ability to raise additional capital or incur additional indebtedness to supplement our then internal projections, we would be able to execute our growth plan and finance our working capital requirements.\n 27 \nWe have financed our working capital requirements since inception through issuances of equity securities and various debt financings. Our working capital deficit as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 was as follows:\nTable 43: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>As of December 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Current assets </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>48,160,360 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>9,533,342 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Current liabilities </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(87,541,031 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(21,536,090 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Working capital deficit </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(39,380,671 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(12,002,748 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had a working capital deficit of approximately $39.4 million, consisting of approximately $48.2 million in total current assets and approximately $87.5 million in total current liabilities.

On June 28, 2019, we issued shares of our Series I Preferred Stock pursuant to a securities purchase agreement entered into with certain accredited investors. In accordance with the securities purchase agreement, we issued an aggregate of 23,100 shares of Series I Preferred Stock at a stated value of $1,000, initially convertible into 46,200,000 shares of our common stock at a conversion rate equal to the stated value divided by the conversion price of $0.50 per share, for aggregate gross proceeds of $23.1 million used for working capital and general corporate purposes. Each share of Series I Preferred Stock is entitled to vote on an as-if-converted to common stock basis, subject to certain conditions.\nThe shares of Series I Preferred Stock were subject to limitations on conversion into shares of our common stock until the date an amendment to our certificate of incorporation was filed and accepted with the State of Delaware that increased the number of authorized shares of our common stock to at least a number permitting all the Series H Preferred Stock and Series I Preferred Stock to be converted in full. On December 18, 2020, we filed a Certificate of Amendment to our Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as amended (the Certificate of Amendment\u201d), to increase the number of authorized shares of our common stock. Accordingly, we do not have any shares of our Series I Preferred Stock currently outstanding. Please see Note 20, Stockholders' Equity, in our accompanying consolidated financial statements for addition information.\nSeries J Preferred Stock. On October 7, 2019, we issued shares of our Series J Preferred Stock pursuant to a securities purchase agreement with certain accredited investors. In accordance with the securities purchase agreement, we issued an aggregate of 20,000 shares of Series J Preferred Stock at a stated value of $1,000, initially convertible into 28,571,428 shares of our common stock at a conversion rate equal to the stated value divided by the conversion price of $0.70 per share, for aggregate gross proceeds of $20.0 million, and after principal and interest of $5.0 million from the 12% senior secured notes were converted into shares of our Series J Preferred Stock, we received net proceeds of $15.0 million, which we used for working capital and general corporate purposes. Each share of Series J Preferred Stock is entitled to vote on an as-if-converted to common stock basis, subject to certain conditions.\nThe shares of Series J Preferred Stock were subject to limitations on conversion into shares of our common stock until the date an amendment to our certificate of incorporation was filed and accepted with the State of Delaware that increases the number of authorized shares of our common stock to at least a number permitting all the Series H Preferred Stock, Series I Preferred Stock and Series J Preferred Stock to be converted in full. On December 18, 2020, in connection with the filing of a Certificate of Amendment, we increased the number of authorized shares of our common stock. Accordingly, we do not have any shares of our Series J Preferred Stock currently outstanding. Please see Note 20, Stockholders' Equity, in our accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information.\n 29 \nOur consolidated financial statements have been presented on the basis that we are a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. We had revenues of approximately $53.2 million during fiscal 2019, and have experienced recurring net losses from operations and negative operating cash flows. Consequently, we were dependent upon continued access to funding and capital resources from both new investors and related parties. If continued funding and capital resources are unavailable at reasonable terms, we may not be able to implement our growth plan and plan of operations. These financings may include terms that may be highly dilutive to existing stockholders.\nFuture Liquidity\nFrom January 1, 2020 to the issuance date of our accompanying consolidated financial statements for the Fiscal Year Period and the Interim Periods, we continued to incur operating losses and negative cash flow from operating and investing activities. We have raised $23.7 million in net proceeds pursuant to the sale and issuances of Series H Preferred Stock, Series I Preferred Stock, Series J Preferred Stock, and Series K Convertible Preferred Stock (the Series K Preferred Stock\u201d) and $17.6 million in various debt financings. Noteholders also converted our 12% convertible debentures representing an aggregate of approximately $18.1 million of the then-outstanding principal and accrued but unpaid interest, with the remaining noteholders holding our 12 convertible debentures representing an aggregate of approximately $1.1 million of outstanding principal and accrued interest were not converted and, instead, such amounts were repaid in cash to such noteholders. We also entered into an Exchange Agreement with a former officer pursuant to which, the parties agreed that in exchange of $0.4 million of outstanding principal and accrued but unpaid interest under certain officer promissory notes we would issue to him shares of our Series H Preferred Stock. Our cash balance as of the date our accompanying consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2019 were issued or were available to be issued was approximately $5.1 million. Summarized below are the additional debt financings and/or issued equity securities through the issuance of our consolidated financial statements.\nEquity Financings\nIncluded in the $23.7 million of equity financings (see Note 28, Subsequent Events, in our accompanying consolidated financial statements for further details) are the following:\nSeries H Preferred Stock. Between August 14, 2020 and August 20, 2020, we entered into several securities purchase agreements for the sale of Series H Preferred Stock with certain accredited investors, pursuant to which we issued an aggregate of 108 shares (after we rescinded the issuance of 2,145 shares that were deemed null and void and repaid to certain holders on October 28, 2020), at a stated value of $1,000 per share, initially convertible into 327,273shares of our common stock at a conversion rate equal to the stated value divided by the conversion price of $0.33 per share, for aggregate gross proceeds of approximately $130,000 for working capital and general corporate purposes. The number of shares issuable upon conversion of the Series H Preferred Stock will be adjusted in the event of stock splits, stock dividends, combinations of shares and similar transactions. Each share of Series H Preferred Stock is entitled to vote on an as-if-converted to common stock basis, subject to beneficial ownership blocker provisions and other certain conditions.\nThe shares of Series H Preferred Stock were subject to limitations on conversion into shares of our common stock until the date an amendment to our certificate of incorporation was filed and accepted with the State of Delaware that increases the number of authorized shares of our common stock to at least a number permitting all the Series H Preferred Stock to be converted in full. On December 18, 2020, we filed the Certificate of Amendment to increase the number of authorized shares of our common stock.\nSeries J Preferred Stock. On September 4, 2020, we closed on a Series J Preferred Stock issuance with two accredited investors, pursuant to which we issued an aggregate of 10,500 shares of Series J Preferred Stock at a stated value of $1,000 per share, initially convertible into 15,000,000 shares of our common stock at a conversion rate equal to the stated value divided by the conversion price of $0.70, for aggregate gross proceeds of $6.0 million for working capital and general corporate purposes.\nOn December 18, 2020, in connection with the filing of the Certificate of Amendment to increase the number of authorized shares of our common stock, the then-outstanding shares of Series J Preferred Stock automatically converted into shares of our common stock. Accordingly, we do not have any shares of our Series J Preferred Stock currently outstanding.\n 30 \nSeries K Preferred Stock. On October 22, 2020, 20,000 shares of our preferred stock were designated by our Board as Series K Preferred Stock. Between October 23, 2020 and November 11, 2020, we entered into several securities purchase agreements with accredited investors, pursuant to which we issued an aggregate of 18,042 shares of Series K Preferred Stock at a stated value of $1,000 per share, initially convertible into 45,105,000 shares of our common stock at a conversion rate equal to the stated value divided by the conversion price of $0.40 per share, for aggregate gross proceeds of approximately $18.0 million. The number of shares issuable upon conversion of the Series K Preferred Stock will be adjusted in the event of stock splits, stock dividends, combinations of shares and similar transactions. Each share of Series K Preferred Stock is entitled to vote on an as-if-converted to common stock basis, subject to other certain conditions.\nIn consideration for its services as placement agent, we paid B. Riley FBR, Inc. ( B. Riley FBR\u201d) a cash fee of $400,500. We used approximately $3.4 million of the net proceeds from the financing to partially repay the Term Note (as defined below) and used approximately $2.6 million for payment on a prior investment, with the remainder of approximately $12.0 million for working capital and general corporate purposes.\nOn December 18, 2020, in connection with the filing of the Certificate of Amendment to increase the number of authorized shares of our common stock, the then-outstanding shares of Series K Preferred Stock automatically converted into shares of our common stock. Accordingly, we do not have any shares of our Series K Preferred Stock currently outstanding.\nDebt Financings\nIncluded in the $16.8 million of debt financings (see Note 28, Subsequent Events, in our accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information) are the following:\nAmended and Restated 12% Senior Secured Notes. On February 27, 2020, we entered into a second amendment to the amended and restated note purchase agreement (the Second Amendment to A&R NPA\u201d), which further amended the amended and restated note purchase agreement, dated as of June 14, 2019 (the A&R NPA\u201d), with one accredited investor, BRF Finance Co., LLC ( BRF Finance\u201d), an affiliated entity of B. Riley Financial, Inc. ( B. Riley\u201d). The Second Amendment to A&R NPA further amended the amended and restated 12% senior secured note due June 14, 2022. Pursuant to the Second Amendment to A&R NPA, we replaced our previous $3.5 million working capital facility with Sallyport with a new $15.0 million working capital facility with FastPay; and (ii) BRF Finance issued a letter of credit in the amount of approximately $3.0 million to our landlord for our lease of the premises located at 225 Liberty Street, 27th Floor, New York, New York 10281. All borrowings under the amended and restated 12% senior secured notes are collateralized by substantially all assets of the Company.\nOn March 24, 2020, we entered into a second amended and restated note purchase agreement (the Second A&R NPA\u201d) with BRF Finance, an affiliated entity of B. Riley, in its capacity as agent for the purchasers, which further amended and restated the Second Amendment to A&R NPA. Pursuant to the Second A&R NPA, interest on amounts outstanding under the existing 12% senior secured notes with respect to (i) interest that was payable on such notes on March 31, 2020 and June 30, 2020, and (ii) at our option, with the consent of requisite purchasers, interest that was payable on such on September 30, 2020 and December 31, 2020, in lieu of the payment in cash of all or any portion of the interest due on such dates, would be payable in-kind in arrears on the last day of such applicable fiscal quarter.\nOn October 23, 2020, we entered into Amendment No. 1 to the Second A&R NPA with BRF Finance ( Amendment 1\u201d), pursuant to which the maturity date of the 12% senior secured notes was changed to December 31, 2022 or an earlier date if the obligations have been accelerated pursuant to and in accordance with the terms of Amendment 1. Pursuant to Amendment 1, interest payable on the existing 12% senior secured notes on September 30, 2020, December 31, 2020, March 31, 2021, June 30, 2021, September 30, 2021, and December 31, 2021 will be payable in-kind in arrears on the last day of such fiscal quarter. Alternatively, at the option of the holder, such interest amounts originally could have been paid in shares of Series K Preferred Stock; however, after December 18, 2020, the date the Series K Preferred Stock converted into shares of common stock, all such interest amounts can be paid in shares of our common stock based upon the conversion rate specified in the Certificate of Designation for the Series K Preferred Stock (or $0.40).\nThe balance outstanding under our amended and restated 12% senior secured notes as of the issuance date of our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2019 was approximately $56.3 million, which included outstanding principal of approximately $48.8 million, payment of in-kind interest of approximately $4.2 million that we were permitted to add to the aggregate outstanding principal balance, and unpaid accrued interest of approximately $3.3 million).\nFastPay Credit Facility. On February 6, 2020, we entered into a financing and security agreement with FastPay, pursuant to which FastPay extended a $15.0 million line of credit for working capital purposes secured by a first lien on all of our cash and accounts receivable and a second lien on all other assets. Borrowings under the facility bear interest at the LIBOR Rate plus 8.50% and have a final maturity of February 6, 2022. This line of credit was amended by that certain first amendment to financing and security agreement dated March 24, 2020 to permit us to amend and restate the 12% senior secured notes. The aggregate principal amount outstanding, plus accrued and unpaid interest, as of the issuance date of our accompanying consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2019 was approximately $5.0 million.\nSallyport Credit Facility. As of December 31, 2019, we no longer could borrow under our factoring facility with Sallyport and it was effectively closed effective January 30, 2020. As of May 4, 2020, all amounts owed to us by Sallyport were paid and there was no balance outstanding under the facility.\n 31 \nDelayed Draw Term Note. Pursuant to the Second A&R NPA, we agreed to issue, at BRF Finance's option, a 15% delayed draw term note (the Term Note\u201d), in the aggregate principal amount of $12.0 million to the investor. On March 24, 2020, we drew down approximately $6.9 million under the Term Note, and after payment of commitment and funding fees paid to BRF Finance in the amount of approximately $0.7 million, and other of its legal fees and expenses that we incurred, we received net proceeds of $6.0 million. The net proceeds were used by us for working capital and general corporate purposes. Additional borrowings under the Term Note requested by us may be made at the option of the purchasers. Up to $8.0 million in principal amount under the Term Note was originally due on March 31, 2021. Interest on amounts outstanding under the Term Note was payable in-kind in arrears on the last day of each fiscal quarter.\nPursuant to the terms of Amendment 1, the maturity date was changed from March 31, 2021 to March 31, 2022. Amendment 1 also provided that BRF Finance, as holder, could originally elect, in lieu of receipt of cash for payment of all or any portion of the interest due or cash payments up to the Conversion Portion (as defined in Amendment 1) of the Term Note, to receive shares of Series K Preferred Stock; however, after December 18, 2020, the date the Series K Preferred Stock converted into shares of our common stock, the holder may elect, in lieu of receipt of cash for such amounts, shares of our common stock based upon the conversion rate specified in the Certificate of Designation for the Series K Preferred Stock (or $0.40).\nAs of March 22, 2021, approximately $3.4 million, including approximately $3.3 million of principal amount of the Term Note and approximately $0.7 million of accrued interest, had been converted into shares of our Series K Preferred Stock. The aggregate principal amount outstanding under the Term Note as of March 22, 2021 was approximately $4.3 million (including payment of in-kind interest of approximately $0.7 million, which was added to the outstanding Term Note balance).\nPayroll Protection Program Loan. On April 6, 2020, we issued a note in favor of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., pursuant to the recently enacted Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act ( CARES Act\u201d) administered by the U.S. Small Business Administration ( SBA\u201d). We received total proceeds of approximately $5.7 million under the note. In accordance with the requirements of the CARES Act, we will use proceeds from the note primarily for payroll costs. The note is scheduled to mature on April 6, 2022 and has a 0.98% interest rate and is subject to the terms and conditions applicable to loans administered by the SBA under the CARES Act. The balance outstanding as of the issuance date of our accompanying consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2019 was approximately $5.7 million.\nThe note is eligible for partial forgiveness for the principal amounts that are used for the limited purposes that qualify for forgiveness under SBA requirements. In order to obtain forgiveness, we must request it and must provide documentation in accordance with the SBA requirements, and certify that the amounts we are requesting to be forgiven qualify under those requirements. We will remain responsible under the note for any amounts not forgiven, and that interest payable under the note will not be forgiven but that the SBA may pay the note interest on forgiven amounts. Requirements for forgiveness, among other requirements, provide for eligible expenditures, necessary records/documentation, or possible reductions of the forgiven amount due to changes in number of employees or compensation. It is our expectation that 100% of the principal amount of the note will be forgiven; however, no assurance to this effect can be given.\n 32 \n12% Convertible Debentures. On December 31, 2020, noteholders converted the 12% convertible debentures representing an aggregate of approximately $18.1 million of the then-outstanding principal and accrued but unpaid interest into 53,887,470 shares of our common stock at effective conversion per-share prices ranging from $0.33 to $0.40. Despite the terms of the 12% convertible debentures, the noteholders agreed to allow us to repay accrued but unpaid interest in shares of our common stock. The remaining 12% convertible debentures representing an aggregate of approximately $1.1 million of outstanding principal and accrued interest were not converted and, instead, such amounts were repaid in cash to the noteholders.\nGoing Concern\nWe performed an annual reporting period going concern assessment. Management is required to assess our ability to continue as a going concern. This Annual Report has been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and the liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business. Our accompanying consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if we are unable to continue as a going concern.\nWe have had a history of recurring losses. Our recurring losses from operations and net capital deficiency have been evaluated by management to determine if the significance of those conditions or events would limit our ability to meet its obligations when due. The operating loss realized in fiscal 2019 was primarily a result of a marketing investment in customer growth, together with investment in people and technology as we continued to expand our operations, and operations rapidly expanding during fiscal 2019 with the TheStreet Merger and the Sports Illustrated Licensing Agreement. The operating loss realized in fiscal 2018 was primarily a result of investments in people, infrastructure for the Maven Platform and the operations rapidly expanding during fiscal 2018 with the acquisitions of HubPages and Say Media, along with continued costs based on the strategic growth plans in other verticals.\nAs reflected in our accompanying consolidated financial statements, we had revenues of approximately $53.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, and have experienced recurring net losses from operations, negative working capital and negative operating cash flows. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we incurred a net loss attributable to common stockholders of approximately $39.1 million, utilized cash in operating activities of approximately $57.0 million, and as of December 31, 2019, had an accumulated deficit of approximately $73.6 million. We have financed our working capital requirements since inception through the issuance of debt and equity securities.\nIn 2020 and continuing into 2021, we have also been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Many national governments and sports authorities around the world have made the decision to postpone/cancel high attendance sports events in an effort to reduce the spread of COVID-19. In addition, many governments and businesses have limited non-essential work activity, furloughed, and/or terminated many employees and closed some operations and/or locations, all of which has had a negative impact on the economic environment. As a result of these factors, we experienced a decline in traffic, advertising revenue, and earnings since early March 2020, due to the cancellation of high attendance sports events and the resulting decrease in traffic to the Maven Platform and advertising revenue. We have implemented cost reduction measures in an effort to offset our revenue and earnings declines, while experiencing increased cash flows by growth in digital subscriptions. The extent of the impact on our operational and financial performance will depend on future developments, including the duration and spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, related group gathering and sports event advisories and restrictions, and the extent and effectiveness of containment actions taken, all of which remain uncertain at the time of issuance of our accompanying consolidated financial statements.\nManagement has evaluated whether relevant conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Substantial doubt exists when conditions and events, considered in the aggregate, indicate it is probable that a company will not be able to meet its obligations as they become due within one year after the issuance date of its financial statements. Management's assessment is based on the relevant conditions that are known or reasonably knowable as of the date our accompanying consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2019 were issued or were available to be issued.\n 33 \nManagement's assessment of our ability to meet our future obligations is inherently judgmental, subjective and susceptible to change. The factors that we considered important in our going concern analysis, include, but are not limited to, our fiscal 2021 cash flow forecast and our fiscal 2021 operating budget. Management also considered our ability to repay our convertible debt through future equity and the implementation of cost reduction measures in effect to offset revenue and earnings declines from COVID-19. These factors consider information including, but not limited to, our financial condition, liquidity sources, obligations due within one year after the issuance date of our accompanying financial statements, the funds necessary to maintain operations and financial conditions, including negative financial trends or other indicators of possible financial difficulty.\nIn particular, our plan for the: (1) 2021 cash flow forecast, considered the use of our working capital line with FastPay (as described in Note 28, Subsequent Events, to our accompanying consolidated financial statements) to fund changes in working capital, where we have available credit of approximately $8.7 million as of the issuance date of our accompanying consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2019, and that we do not anticipate the need for any further borrowings that are subject to the holders approval, from our Term Note (as described in Note 28, Subsequent Events, to our accompanying consolidated financial statements) where we may be permitted to borrow up to an additional $5 million; and (2) 2021 operating budget, considered that approximately sixty-five percent of our revenue is from recurring subscriptions, generally paid in advance, and that digital subscription revenue, that accounts for approximately thirty percent of subscription revenue, grew approximately thirty percent in 2020 demonstrating the strength of our premium brand, and the plan to continue to grow our subscription revenue from our 2019 acquisition of TheStreet (as described in Note 28, Subsequent Events, to our accompanying consolidated financial statements) and to launch premium digital subscriptions from our Sports Illustrated licensed brands (as described in Note 28, Subsequent Events, to our accompanying consolidated financial statements), in January 2021.\nWe have considered both quantitative and qualitative factors as part of the assessment that are known or reasonably knowable as of the date our accompanying consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2019 were issued or were available to be issued, and concluded that conditions and events considered in the aggregate, do not raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern for a one-year period following the financial statement issuance date.\nResults of
