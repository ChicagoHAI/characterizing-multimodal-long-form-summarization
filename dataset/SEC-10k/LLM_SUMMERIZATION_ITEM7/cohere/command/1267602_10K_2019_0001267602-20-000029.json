MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our audited annual consolidated financial statements and the related notes that appear elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements reflecting our current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from those discussed in these forward-looking statements due to a number of factors, including those described in the section entitled Risk Factors\u201d and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. For further information regarding forward-looking statements, please refer to the Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements and Projections\u201d at the beginning of Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOverview\nAlimera Sciences, Inc., and its subsidiaries (we, our or us), is a pharmaceutical company that specializes in the commercialization and development of prescription ophthalmic pharmaceuticals. We presently focus on diseases affecting the back of the eye, or retina, because these diseases are not well treated with current therapies and affect millions of people in our aging populations.\nILUVIEN\nOur only product is ILUVIEN\u00ae, which has received marketing authorization and reimbursement approval in numerous countries for the treatment of DME. In the U.S. and certain other countries outside Europe, ILUVIEN is indicated for the treatment of DME in patients who have been previously treated with a course of corticosteroids and did not have a clinically significant rise in intraocular pressure. In 17 countries in Europe, ILUVIEN is indicated for the treatment of vision impairment associated with chronic DME considered insufficiently responsive to available therapies. ILUVIEN is also now indicated in 16 countries in Europe for prevention of relapse in recurrent non-infectious uveitis affecting the posterior segment of the eye (NIU-PS). See Business - Overview\u201d above.\nWe market ILUVIEN directly in the U.S., Germany, the U.K., Portugal, Austria and Ireland. In addition, we have entered into various agreements under which distributors are providing or will provide regulatory, reimbursement and sales and marketing support for ILUVIEN in Belgium, France, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Spain, Australia, New Zealand, Canada and several countries in the Middle East. As of December 31, 2019, we have recognized sales of ILUVIEN to our international distributors in the Middle East, France, Italy and Spain.\nAccumulated Deficit\nWe commenced operations in June 2003. Since our inception we have incurred significant losses. As of December 31, 2019, we had accumulated a deficit of $387.6 million. We expect to incur additional expenses as we pursue our business strategy. See Business - Business Strategy\u201d above.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had approximately $9.4 million in cash and cash equivalents.\nLicense Agreement with EyePoint Pharmaceuticals US, Inc.\nIn July 2017, we amended and restated our license agreement with EyePoint Pharmaceuticals US, Inc. (EyePoint), formerly known as pSivida US, Inc., which was made effective July 1, 2017 (the New Collaboration Agreement). Under the New Collaboration Agreement, we have rights to the technology underlying ILUVIEN for the treatment of uveitis, including NIU-PS, in Europe, the Middle East and Africa. The New Collaboration Agreement converted our previous profit share obligation to a royalty payable on global net revenues of ILUVIEN. We began paying a 2% royalty on net revenues and other related consideration to EyePoint effective July 1, 2017. The royalty amount increased to 6% as of December 12, 2018. We will pay an additional 2% royalty on global net revenues and other related consideration in excess of $75.0 million in any year. During 2019 and 2018, we recognized approximately $2,158,000 and $998,000 of royalty expense, respectively.\nFollowing the signing of the New Collaboration Agreement, we retained a right to offset $15.0 million of future royalty payments. In March 2019, pursuant to the New Collaboration Agreement, we forgave $5,000,000 of the Future Offset in connection with the approval of ILUVIEN for NIU-PS in the U.K. As of December 31, 2019, the balance of the Future Offset was approximately $8,858,000. (See Note 10 of our notes to consolidated financial statements below.)\nSolar Capital Loans and Related Agreements\nOn January 5, 2018, we entered into a $40.0 million Loan and Security Agreement (the 2018 Solar Loan Agreement) with Solar Capital Ltd. (Solar Capital). Under the 2018 Solar Loan Agreement, we borrowed the entire $40.0 million as a term loan that was scheduled to mature on July 1, 2022 (the 2018 Solar Loan). We used the proceeds of the 2018 Solar Loan to refinance\nthe then outstanding loan (the Hercules Loan) under our previous loan agreement with Hercules Capital, Inc. (the Hercules Loan Agreement) and to pay closing expenses associated with the 2018 Solar Loan Agreement. On December 31, 2019, we refinanced the 2018 Solar Loan Agreement by entering into a $45.0 million Loan and Security Agreement (the 2019 Solar Loan Agreement) with Solar Capital. Under the 2019 Solar Loan Agreement, we borrowed $42.5 million on December 31, 2019 and $2.5 million on February 21, 2020 (the 2019 Solar Loan). The 2019 Solar Loan matures on July 1, 2024. We used the initial proceeds of the 2019 Solar Loan to pay off the 2018 Solar Loan, along with related prepayment, legal and other fees and expenses totaling approximately $2.3 million, which included a $1.8 million fee to Solar Capital upon repayment of the 2018 Solar Loan that was previously accrued and a $400,000 prepayment fee to Solar Capital that was capitalized as deferred financing costs.\nWe expect to use the remaining proceeds of the 2019 Solar Loan to provide additional working capital for general corporate purposes. (See Note 11 of our notes to consolidated financial statements below.)\nSources of Revenues\nOur revenues for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 were generated from product sales primarily in the U.S., Germany and the U.K. In the U.S., two large pharmaceutical distributors accounted for 60% and 69% of our consolidated revenues for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. These U.S.-based distributors purchase ILUVIEN from us, maintain inventories of ILUVIEN and sell downstream to physician offices, pharmacies and hospitals. Internationally, in countries where we sell direct, our customers are hospitals, clinics and pharmacies. We sometimes refer to physician offices, pharmacies, hospitals and clinics as end users. In international countries where we sell to distributors, these distributors maintain inventory levels of ILUVIEN and sell to their customers.\nReverse Stock Split Effective November 14, 2019\nOn November 14, 2019, we filed a certificate of amendment to our restated certificate of incorporation with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, which effected a one-for-15 reverse stock split (the reverse split\u201d) of our issued and outstanding shares of common stock at 5:01 PM Eastern Time on that date. As a result of the reverse split, every 15 shares of common stock issued and outstanding were converted into one share of common stock. No fractional shares were issued in connection with the reverse split. Stockholders who would otherwise have been entitled to a fractional share of common stock instead received a cash payment equal to such fraction multiplied by the average of the closing sales prices of the common stock (as adjusted to give effect to the reverse split) on The Nasdaq Global Market for the five consecutive trading days immediately preceding the effective date.\nThe reverse split did not change the par value of the common stock or the authorized number of shares of common stock. The reverse split affected all stockholders uniformly and did not alter any stockholder's percentage interest in our equity (other than as a result of the payment of cash in lieu of fractional shares). All outstanding options, preferred stock, restricted stock units, warrants and other securities entitling their holders to purchase or otherwise receive shares of Alimera's common stock have been adjusted as a result of the reverse split, as required by the terms of each security. The number of shares available to be awarded under our 2019 Omnibus Incentive Plan and the number of shares that are purchasable under our 2010 Employee Stock Purchase Plan have also been appropriately adjusted. The common stock began trading on The Nasdaq Global Market on a post-reverse split basis on November 15, 2019. The reverse split permitted us to regain compliance with Nasdaq's minimum bid price\u201d requirement for continued listing, which requires that the bid price of the stock of a listed company be at least $1.00 per share.\nFailure to Comply with Nasdaq Continued Listing Requirement\nOur common stock trades on The Nasdaq Global Market, which we believe helps support and maintain liquidity for our stock. Companies whose shares are listed on The Nasdaq Global Market, however, are subject to various rules and requirements imposed by Nasdaq that a listed company must satisfy to continue having its stock listed on the exchange. We received notice in September 2019 from The Nasdaq Stock Market (Nasdaq) that, for the last 30 consecutive trading days before the date of the notice, the Market Value of Listed Securities (MVLS) for our common stock was below the minimum MVLS of $50,000,000 required for continued listing on The Nasdaq Global Market. We have not regained compliance with Nasdaq's minimum MVLS requirement, and our 180-day compliance period expires on March 9, 2020. Nasdaq has three alternate standards for continued listing, and we expect to regain compliance with Nasdaq's continued listing standards by qualifying under a different listing standard that requires a listed company's revenue and total assets in each case to exceed $50 million (the Total Assets/Total Revenue Standard). Based on our revenue and total assets as reflected on the audited consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we believe that we meet the Total Assets/Total Revenue Standard. If Nasdaq concurs with our view as we expect, the Listing Qualifications Department of Nasdaq will send us a letter to that effect. We expect the letter to state that we have complied with the Total Assets/Total Revenue Standard and therefore our failure to comply with the minimum MVLS requirement will no longer affect our continued listing. We will not\nbe able to confirm that we have regained compliance, however, until we receive a letter to that effect from the Listing Qualifications Department of Nasdaq.\nWe cannot provide any assurances, however, that we will be able to regain compliance with the continued listing standards. Our statements in this section that we expect to regain compliance with the continued listing standards are forward-looking statements. We may not regain compliance, and actual results could differ materially from those projected in our forward-looking statements. Meaningful factors that could cause actual results to differ include our inability to meet the Total Assets/Total Revenue Standard as interpreted by Nasdaq. For more information about this topic, see the first risk factor under the heading Risk Factors - Risks Related to the Ownership of Our Common Stock\u201d above.\nResults of Operations - Year ended December 31, 2019 compared to year ended December 31, 2018\nTable 144: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In thousands, except share and per share data)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>NET REVENUE\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>53,943\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>46,599\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>COST OF GOODS SOLD, EXCLUDING DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION\n</td> <td>(6,626\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4,308\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>GROSS PROFIT\n</td> <td>47,317\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>42,291\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT AND MEDICAL AFFAIRS EXPENSES\n</td> <td>10,992\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11,274\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES\n</td> <td>13,954\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14,525\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>SALES AND MARKETING EXPENSES\n</td> <td>25,004\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23,517\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION\n</td> <td>2,641\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,645\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>OPERATING EXPENSES\n</td> <td>52,591\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>51,961\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>NET LOSS FROM OPERATIONS\n</td> <td>(5,274\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(9,670\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>INTEREST EXPENSE AND OTHER\n</td> <td>(4,869\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4,775\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>UNREALIZED FOREIGN CURRENCY LOSS, NET\n</td> <td>(84\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(65\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>LOSS ON EARLY EXTINGUISHMENT OF DEBT\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,766\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>NET LOSS BEFORE TAXES\n</td> <td>(10,227\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(16,276\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>PROVISION FOR TAXES\n</td> <td>(216\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(106\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>NET LOSS\n</td> <td>(10,443\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(16,382\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>GAIN ON EXTINGUISHMENT OF PREFERRED STOCK\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>38,330\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>NET (LOSS) INCOME AVAILABLE TO STOCKHOLDERS\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(10,443\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>21,948\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>NET (LOSS) INCOME PER SHARE - Basic (Note 2)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(2.19\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3.74\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>WEIGHTED AVERAGE SHARES OUTSTANDING - Basic\n</td> <td>4,770,204\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,866,809\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>NET (LOSS) INCOME PER SHARE - Diluted (Note 2)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(2.19\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3.71\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>WEIGHTED AVERAGE SHARES OUTSTANDING - Diluted\n</td> <td>4,770,204\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,915,872\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenue\nWe began generating revenue from ILUVIEN in 2013. In addition to generating revenue from product sales, we intend to seek to generate revenue from other sources such as upfront fees, milestone payments in connection with collaborative or strategic relationships, and royalties resulting from the licensing of ILUVIEN or any future product candidates and other intellectual property. Additionally, revenue from our international distributors fluctuates depending on the timing of the shipment of ILUVIEN to the distributors and the distributors' sales of ILUVIEN to their customers.\nNet revenue increased by approximately $7.3 million, or 16%, to approximately $53.9 million for 2019, compared to approximately $46.6 million for 2018. The increase was primarily attributable to the new and existing markets in which we sell to our international distributors. We also increased our sales volume in the U.S. and the countries in our international segment where we sell direct.\nCost of Goods Sold, Excluding Depreciation and Amortization, and Gross Profit\nGross profit is affected by costs of goods sold, which includes costs of manufactured goods sold and royalty payments to EyePoint under the New Collaboration Agreement. Additionally, cost of goods sold by our international distributors fluctuates depending on the revenue share attributable to the respective contract.\nCost of goods sold, excluding depreciation and amortization increased by approximately $2.3 million, or 53%, to approximately $6.6 million for 2019, compared to approximately $4.3 million for 2018. The increase was primarily attributable to our increased sales volume and an increase in royalty expense payable on our global net revenue as a result of the increased royalty percentage payable to EyePoint.\nGross profit increased by approximately $5.0 million, or 12%, to approximately $47.3 million for 2019, compared to approximately $42.3 million for 2018. Gross margin was 88% and 91% for 2019 and 2018, respectively. As our revenues to our international distributors increase and our royalty expense payable to EyePoint increases, we expect our gross margin to decrease.\nResearch, Development and Medical Affairs Expenses\nCurrently, our research, development and medical affairs expenses are primarily focused on activities that support ILUVIEN and include salaries and related expenses for research and development and medical affairs personnel, including medical science liaisons. Our research, development and medical affairs expenses also include costs related to the provision of medical affairs support, including symposia development for physician education, and costs related to compliance with FDA, EEA or other regulatory requirements. We expense both internal and external development costs as they are incurred.\nResearch, development and medical affairs expenses decreased by approximately $300,000, or 3%, to approximately $11.0 million for 2019, compared to approximately $11.3 million for 2018. The decrease was primarily attributable to decreases of approximately $610,000 in clinical studies as we are approaching the termination of our ongoing clinical studies, $280,000 in stability studies and approximately $160,000 of scientific communications costs. This decrease was partially offset by increases of approximately $580,000 in consultant expenses primarily due to staff turnover, and $190,000 in safety and quality costs.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation for employees in executive and administrative functions, including finance, accounting, information technology and human resources. Other significant costs include facilities costs and professional fees for accounting and legal services, including legal services associated with obtaining and maintaining patents. We expect to continue to incur significant costs to comply with the corporate governance, internal control and similar requirements applicable to public companies.\nGeneral and administrative expenses decreased by approximately $500,000, or 3%, to approximately $14.0 million for 2019, compared to approximately $14.5 million for 2018. The decrease was primarily attributable to decreases of approximately $940,000 in non-cash stock-based compensation expenses and approximately $620,000 for a one-time non-cash accrued severance expense incurred in 2018 due to the transition of our previous chief executive officer to a consulting role. This decrease was partially offset by increases of approximately $480,000 in logistics and supply chain costs and $400,000 in legal fees; both in part are attributable to Brexit preparation.\nSales and Marketing Expenses\nSales and marketing expenses consist primarily of third-party service fees and compensation for employees for the commercial promotion, the assessment of the commercial opportunity of, the development of market awareness for, the pursuit of reimbursement approval for and the commercialization of ILUVIEN, including launch plans for ILUVIEN in new markets. Other costs include professional fees associated with developing plans for ILUVIEN or any future products or product candidates and maintaining public relations.\nSales and marketing expenses increased by approximately $1.5 million, or 6%, to approximately $25.0 million for 2019, compared to approximately $23.5 million for 2018. The increase was primarily attributable to increases of approximately $970,000 in marketing costs, the largest component of which was associated with the launch of our direct-to-patient advertising pilot program in the U.S., and approximately $240,000 in market access costs.\nOperating Expenses\nAs a result of the changes in expenses described above, total operating expenses increased by approximately $600,000, or 1%, to approximately $52.6 million for 2019, compared to approximately $52.0 million for 2018. The increase was primarily attributable to an approximately $1.5 million increase in sales and marketing expenses, partially offset by decreases of $500,000 in general and administrative expenses and $300,000 in research, development and medical affairs expenses as described above.\nInterest Expense and Other\nAs described in our Overview above, we entered into the 2018 Solar Loan Agreement on January 5, 2018, which we refinanced with the 2019 Solar Loan Agreement on December 31, 2019. For 2018 and 2019, interest expense consisted primarily of interest and amortization of deferred financing costs and debt discounts associated with our outstanding debt under the 2018 Solar Loan Agreement. Interest income consisted primarily of interest earned on our cash, cash equivalents and investments.\nInterest expense and other. Interest expense and other increased by approximately $100,000, or 2%, to approximately $4.9 million for 2019, compared to approximately $4.8 million for 2018.\nLoss on Early Extinguishment of Debt\nWe recorded a loss on early extinguishment of debt of approximately $1.8 million during 2018 as a result of our refinancing the Hercules Loan by entering into the 2018 Solar Loan Agreement on January 5, 2018. We accounted for the December 31, 2019 refinancing of the 2018 Solar Loan Agreement with the 2019 Solar Loan Agreement as a modification, and as such, we did not incur a loss on extinguishment of debt in 2019.\nGain on Extinguishment of Preferred Stock\nOn September 4, 2018, we entered into and closed a Series B Preferred Stock Exchange Agreement (Exchange Agreement) with the holders of all of the outstanding approximately 8,416 shares of Series B Preferred Stock. Under the Exchange Agreement, the holders of Series B Preferred Stock exchanged their shares of Series B Preferred Stock for an aggregate of 10,150 shares of Series C Convertible Preferred Stock, par value $0.01 per share (Series C Preferred Stock). We determined that the Exchange Agreement resulted in an extinguishment of the Series B Preferred Stock. As a result, we recognized a gain of $38,330,000 on the extinguishment of preferred stock during 2018. (See Note 13 of our notes to consolidated financial statements below.)\nBasic and Diluted Net Income (Loss) Applicable to Common Stockholders per Share of Common Stock\nWe follow FASB Accounting Standards Codification (ASC), Earnings Per Share (ASC 260), which requires the reporting of both basic and diluted earnings per share. Because our preferred stockholders participate in dividends equally with common stockholders (if we were to declare and pay dividends), we use the two-class method to calculate EPS. However, our preferred stockholders are not contractually obligated to share in losses.\nBasic EPS is computed by dividing net income (loss) available to stockholders by the weighted average number of shares outstanding for the period. Diluted EPS is calculated in accordance with ASC 260 by adjusting weighted average shares outstanding for the dilutive effect of common stock options, restricted stock units and warrants. In periods where a net loss is recorded, no effect is given to potentially dilutive securities, since the effect would be anti-dilutive.\nWe had net income available to stockholders for 2018 due to the gain on extinguishment of preferred stock. (See Note 13 of our notes to consolidated financial statements below.)\nBasic and diluted earnings per share attributable to shares of common stock and shares of preferred stock that are convertible into common stock (participating securities) are as follows:\nTable 145: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In thousands, except share and per share data)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net (loss) income available to stockholders\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(10,443\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>21,948\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Allocation of undistributed (loss) income:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Loss) income attributable to common stock\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(10,443\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>17,459\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income attributable to participating securities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,489\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Basic shares:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Weighted average common shares\n</td> <td>4,770,204\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,666,856\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Weighted average participating shares\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,199,953\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total basic weighted average shares\n</td> <td>4,770,204\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,866,809\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Diluted shares:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Weighted average common shares\n</td> <td>4,770,204\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,666,856\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Dilutive weighted average shares\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>49,063\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total dilutive weighted common shares\n</td> <td>4,770,204\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,715,919\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Weighted average participating shares\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,199,953\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total dilutive weighted average shares\n</td> <td>4,770,204\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,915,872\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Basic EPS\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(2.19\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3.74\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Diluted EPS\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(2.19\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3.71\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCommon stock equivalent securities that would potentially dilute basic EPS in the future, but were not included in the computation of diluted EPS because they were either classified as participating or would have been anti-dilutive, totaled approximately 2.3 million and 0.9 million for 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nPotentially dilutive common stock equivalents are excluded from the diluted earnings per share denominator for periods of net loss because of their anti-dilutive effect. Therefore, for 2019, the weighted average shares used to calculate both basic and diluted loss per share were the same.\nResults of Operations - Segment Review\nThe following selected unaudited financial and operating data are derived from our consolidated financial statements. The results and discussions that follow reflect how executive management monitors the performance of our reporting segments.\nWe have three segments: U.S., International and Other. Each segment is separately managed and is evaluated primarily upon segment loss from operations. Non-cash items including stock-based compensation expense, depreciation and amortization are categorized as Other. We allocate certain operating expenses between our reporting segments based on activity-based costing methods. These activity-based costing methods require us to make estimates that affect the amount of each expense category that is attributed to each segment. Changes in these estimates will directly affect the amount of expense allocated to each segment and therefore the operating profit of each reporting segment. There were no significant changes in our expense allocation methodology during 2019 or 2018.\nU.S. Segment\nTable 146: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>NET REVENUE\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>32,283\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>31,966\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>COST OF GOODS SOLD, EXCLUDING DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION\n</td> <td>(3,487\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,875\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>GROSS PROFIT\n</td> <td>28,796\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>29,091\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT AND MEDICAL AFFAIRS EXPENSES\n</td> <td>5,943\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,457\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES\n</td> <td>8,449\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,147\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>SALES AND MARKETING EXPENSES\n</td> <td>17,591\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16,569\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>OPERATING EXPENSES\n</td> <td>31,983\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>31,173\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>SEGMENT LOSS FROM OPERATIONS\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(3,187\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(2,082\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nU.S. Segment - Year ended December 31, 2019 compared to year ended December 31, 2018\nNet Revenue. Net revenue increased by approximately $300,000, or 1%, to approximately $32.3 million for 2019, compared to approximately $32.0 million for 2018. The increase was primarily attributable to our increased end user demand, which increased 5% for the year ended December 31, 2019, increasing to 3,993 units compared to 3,802 units for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nCost of goods sold, excluding depreciation and amortization. Cost of goods sold, excluding depreciation and amortization increased by approximately $600,000, or 21%, to approximately $3.5 million for 2019 compared to approximately $2.9 million for 2018. The increase was primarily attributable to our increased royalty expense payable as a result of the increased royalty percentage payable to EyePoint.\nResearch, development and medical affairs expenses. Research, development and medical affairs expenses decreased by approximately $600,000, or 9%, to approximately $5.9 million for 2019, compared to approximately $6.5 million for 2018. The decrease was primarily attributable to decreases of approximately $390,000 in stability studies, $360,000 in clinical studies and $200,000 of scientific communications costs. This decrease was partially offset by an increase of approximately $360,000 in consultant costs primarily due to staff turnover.\nGeneral and administrative expenses. General and administrative expenses increased by approximately $300,000, or 4%, to approximately $8.4 million for 2019, compared to approximately $8.1 million for 2018. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in legal fees.\nSales and marketing expenses. Sales and marketing expenses increased by approximately $1.0 million, or 6%, to approximately $17.6 million for 2019, compared to approximately $16.6 million for 2018. The increase was primarily attributable to increases of approximately $800,000 in marketing costs, some of which were associated with the launch of our direct-to-patient advertising pilot program, and approximately $200,000 in market access costs.\nInternational Segment\nTable 147: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>NET REVENUE\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>21,660\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>14,633\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>COST OF GOODS SOLD, EXCLUDING DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION\n</td> <td>(3,139\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,433\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>GROSS PROFIT\n</td> <td>18,521\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13,200\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT AND MEDICAL AFFAIRS EXPENSES\n</td> <td>4,634\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,946\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES\n</td> <td>3,944\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,259\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>SALES AND MARKETING EXPENSES\n</td> <td>6,933\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,910\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>OPERATING EXPENSES\n</td> <td>15,511\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13,115\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>SEGMENT INCOME FROM OPERATIONS\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,010\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>85\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nInternational Segment - Year ended December 31, 2019 compared to year ended December 31, 2018\nNet Revenue. Net revenue increased by approximately $7.1 million, or 49%, to approximately $21.7 million for 2019, compared to approximately $14.6 million for 2018. The increase was primarily attributable to increased sales volume in the new and existing markets in which we sell to our international distributors. We also increased our sales volume in the countries in our international segment where we sell direct.\nCost of goods sold, excluding depreciation and amortization. Cost of goods sold, excluding depreciation and amortization increased by approximately $1.7 million, or 121%, to approximately $3.1 million for 2019, compared to approximately $1.4 million for 2018. The increase was primarily attributable to the cost of units sold associated with our increased international net revenue and royalty expense payable on our increased international net revenue as a result of the increased royalty percentage payable to EyePoint.\nResearch, development and medical affairs expenses. Research, development and medical affairs expenses increased by approximately $700,000, or 18%, to approximately $4.6 million for 2019, compared to approximately $3.9 million for 2018. The increase was primarily attributable to increases of approximately $430,000 in personnel costs and $220,000 in consultant costs.\nGeneral and administrative expenses. General and administrative expenses increased by approximately $600,000, or 18%, to approximately $3.9 million for 2019, compared to approximately $3.3 million for 2018. The increase was primarily attributable to increases of approximately $310,000 in logistics and supply chain costs, some of which are attributable to Brexit preparation, and $260,000 in legal fees.\nSales and marketing expenses. Sales and marketing expenses increased by approximately $1.0 million, or 17%, to approximately $6.9 million for 2019, compared to approximately $5.9 million for 2018. The increase was primarily attributable to increases of approximately $850,000 in personnel costs, including increased commission expense associated with our increased international net revenue, and approximately $170,000 in marketing costs.\nOther Segment\nTable 148: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT AND MEDICAL AFFAIRS EXPENSES\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>415\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>871\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES\n</td> <td>1,561\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,119\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>SALES AND MARKETING EXPENSES\n</td> <td>480\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,038\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION\n</td> <td>2,641\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,645\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>OPERATING EXPENSES\n</td> <td>5,097\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,673\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>SEGMENT LOSS FROM OPERATIONS\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(5,097\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(7,673\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur chief operating decision maker manages and evaluates our U.S. and International segments based on net loss from operations adjusted for certain non-cash items, such as stock-based compensation expense, accrued severance expenses and depreciation and amortization. Therefore, these non-cash expenses included in research, development and medical affairs expenses, general and administrative expenses, and sales and marketing expenses are classified within the Other segment within our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nWithin the respective financial statement line items included in the Other segment, stock-based compensation expense, collectively, decreased by approximately $1.9 million, or 43%, to $2.5 million for 2019, compared to $4.4 million for 2018. The decrease was primarily attributable to (a) a decrease in the average fair value of outstanding unvested options, which caused a decrease in option expense recognized in 2019, and (b) our paying cash bonuses to our non-executive employees for 2019, compared to our issuing RSUs to all employees in lieu of cash bonuses for 2018. Additionally, within general and administrative expenses we had a decrease of approximately $600,000 of one-time non-cash accrued severance expenses due to the transition of our previous chief executive officer to a consulting role; these expenses were accrued in 2018 and paid in 2019.\nDepreciation and amortization were approximately $2.6 million for both 2019 and 2018.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nSince inception, we have incurred recurring losses and negative cash flow from operations, and we have accumulated a deficit of $387.6 million through December 31, 2019. In 2018 and 2019, we funded our operations through the $40.0 million 2018 Solar Loan Agreement and an offering of common stock.\nOn January 5, 2018, we entered into the $40.0 million 2018 Solar Loan Agreement. Under that agreement, we borrowed the entire $40.0 million as a term loan that was scheduled to mature on July 1, 2022 (the 2018 Solar Loan). We used the proceeds of the 2018 Solar Loan Agreement to repay the Hercules Loan and pay related expenses. On December 31, 2019, we refinanced the 2018 Solar Loan Agreement by entering into the $45.0 million 2019 Solar Loan Agreement. Under the 2019 Solar Loan Agreement, we borrowed $42.5 million on December 31, 2019, and thereafter we borrowed the remaining $2.5 million on February 21, 2020 (the 2019 Solar Loan). The 2019 Solar Loan matures on July 1, 2024. We used the initial proceeds of the 2019 Solar Loan to pay off the 2018 Solar Loan, along with related prepayment, legal and other fees and expenses of approximately $2.3 million, which included a $1.8 million fee to Solar Capital upon repayment of the 2018 Solar Loan that was previously accrued and a $400,000 prepayment fee to Solar Capital that was capitalized as deferred financing costs. We expect to use the remaining proceeds of the 2019 Solar Loan to provide additional working capital for general corporate purposes. (See Note 11 of our notes to consolidated financial statements below.)\nOn October 24, 2019, we entered into a purchase agreement (Purchase Agreement) with Lincoln Park Capital Fund, LLC (Lincoln Park). The Purchase Agreement provided that, upon its terms and subject to its conditions and limitations, we could have directed Lincoln Park to purchase up to $20.0 million of shares of our common stock from time to time over the 36-month term of the Purchase Agreement. As consideration for Lincoln Park's commitment to purchase shares of common stock pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, on October 25, 2019 we issued to Lincoln Park 90,909 shares of our common stock (as adjusted to reflect the reverse split) for no additional consideration. On October 28, 2019, Lincoln Park purchased 133,333 shares at a price of $7.50 per share (which number of shares and per share amount have been adjusted to reflect the reverse split), for an aggregate price of $1,000,000. We terminated the Purchase Agreement effective November 12, 2019 after determining that we had no intention to conduct further sales to Lincoln Park under the Purchase Agreement.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had approximately $9.4 million in cash and cash equivalents. We may need to raise additional capital to fund our business strategy, including the continued commercialization of ILUVIEN. If we need to raise additional financing and are unable to do so, we will need to adjust our commercial plans so that we can continue to operate with our existing cash resources. The actual amount of funds that we will need will depend on many factors, some of which are beyond our control. We may need funds sooner than currently anticipated.\nWe cannot be sure that other additional financing will be available when needed or that, if available, the additional financing would be obtained on terms favorable to us or our stockholders. If we were to raise additional funds by issuing equity securities, substantial dilution to existing stockholders would likely result, and the terms of any new equity securities may have a preference over our common stock. If we were to attempt to raise additional funds through strategic collaboration agreements, we may not be successful in obtaining those agreements, or in receiving milestone or royalty payments under them. If we were to attempt to raise additional funds through debt financing, (a) the terms of the debt may involve significant cash payment obligations as well as covenants and specific financial ratios that may restrict our ability to commercialize ILUVIEN or any future products or product candidates or to operate our business; and (b) we would be required to obtain the permission or participation of Solar Capital, which we might not be able to obtain. Our capital raising efforts may be hindered by our current failure to comply with Nasdaq's continuing listing requirements, which could ultimately lead to our delisting from Nasdaq if we are unable to regain compliance. See Overview - Failure to Comply with Nasdaq Continued Listing Requirement\u201d and the first risk factor under the heading Risk Factors - Risks Related to the Ownership of Our Common Stock\u201d above. Our recurring losses and any potential needs to raise capital create substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern for the next 12 months following the issuance of the audited financial statements including in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nFor 2019, net cash used in our operations of $4.2 million was primarily due to our net loss of $10.4 million, offset by $2.6 million of non-cash depreciation and amortization, $2.5 million of non-cash stock-based compensation expense and $840,000 of non-cash interest expense associated with the amortization of our debt discount. Further reducing cash from operations was a $2.2 million increase in accounts receivable that was driven by increased revenue, a $1.0 million increase in inventory, an $830,000 increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets and a $450,000 decrease in deferred tax asset. This reduction was offset by a $1.4 million increase in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other current liabilities and a $390,000 increase in long-term liabilities.\nFor 2018, net cash used in our operations of $11.6 million was primarily due to our net loss of $16.4 million, offset by approximately $4.4 million in stock compensation expense, $2.6 million of depreciation and amortization expense, a $1.8 million charge for the loss on early extinguishment of debt and $840,000 of amortization costs associated with our debt discount. Further reducing cash from operations was a $6.0 million increase in accounts receivable that was driven by increased\nrevenue and a $930,000 increase in inventory. This reduction was offset by a $1.4 million increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses and other current liabilities.\nFor 2019, net cash used in our investing activities was approximately $174,000, which was primarily due to the purchase of equipment and software.\nFor 2018, net cash used in our investing activities was approximately $175,000, which was primarily due to the purchase of equipment and software.\nFor 2019, net cash provided by our financing activities was approximately $869,000, which was primarily due to incurring $2.5 million of additional debt by entering into the $45.0 million 2019 Solar Loan Agreement and our sale of $1.0 million of common stock to Lincoln Park. These increases in cash were offset by payments of approximately $2.3 million, which included a $1.8 million fee to Solar Capital upon repayment of the 2018 Solar Loan that was previously accrued and a $400,000 prepayment fee to Solar Capital that was capitalized as deferred financing costs.\nFor 2018, net cash provided by our financing activities was approximately $950,000, which was primarily due to entering into the $40.0 million 2018 Solar Loan Agreement, offset by paying off the $35.0 million Hercules Loan and related debt costs of $3.7 million.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements that have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate these estimates and judgments, including those described below. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. These estimates and assumptions form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results and experiences may differ materially from these estimates. We believe that the following accounting policies are the most critical to understanding and evaluating our reported financial results and affect the more significant judgments and estimates that we use to prepare our consolidated financial statements.\nRevenue Recognition\nNet Revenue\nWe sell our products to major pharmaceutical distributors, pharmacies, hospitals and wholesalers (collectively, our Customers). In addition to distribution agreements with Customers, we enter into arrangements with healthcare providers and payors that provide for government-mandated and/or privately-negotiated rebates, chargebacks, and discounts with respect to the purchase of our products. All of our current contracts have a single performance obligation, as the promise to transfer the individual goods is not separately identifiable from other promises in the contracts and is, therefore, not distinct.\nCurrently, all of our revenue is derived from product sales. We recognize revenues from product sales when the Customer obtains control, typically upon delivery. We accrue for fulfillment costs when the related revenue is recognized. Taxes collected from Customers relating to product sales and remitted to governmental authorities are excluded from revenues.\nAs of December 31, 2019 and 2018, we had received a total of $1.0 million of milestone payments in connection with our Canadian distributor that we have not recognized as revenue based on our analysis in connection with Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606). These deferred revenues are included as a component of other non-current liabilities on our balance sheets.\nEstimates of Variable Consideration\nRevenues from product sales are recorded at the net sales price (transaction price), which includes estimates of variable consideration for reserves related to statutory rebates to state Medicaid and other government agencies; commercial rebates and fees to Managed Care Organizations (MCOs), Group Purchasing Organizations (GPOs), distributors and specialty pharmacies; product returns; sales discounts (including trade discounts); distributor costs; wholesaler chargebacks; and allowances for patient assistance programs relating to sales of our products.\nThese reserves are based on estimates of the amounts earned or to be claimed on the related sales. Our estimates take into consideration historical experience, current contractual and statutory requirements, specific known market events and trends, industry data and Customer buying and payment patterns. Overall, these reserves reflect our best estimates of the amount of consideration to which we are entitled based on the terms of the contract. The amount of variable consideration included in the net sales price is limited to the amount that is probable not to result in a significant reversal in the amount of the cumulative revenue recognized in a future period. If actual results vary, we may adjust these estimates, which could have an effect on earnings in the period of adjustment.\nWith respect to our international contracts with third party distributors, certain contracts have elements of variable consideration, and management reviews those contracts on a regular basis and makes estimates of revenue based on historical ordering patterns and known market events and data. The amount of variable consideration included in net sales in each period can vary depending on the terms of these contracts and the probability of reversal in future periods.\nConsideration Payable to Customers\nDistribution service fees are payments issued to distributors for compliance with various contractually-defined inventory management practices or services provided to support patient access to a product. Distribution service fees reserves are based on the terms of each individual contract and are classified within accrued expenses and are recorded as a reduction of revenue.\nProduct Returns\nOur policies provide for product returns in the following circumstances: (a) expiration of shelf life on certain products; (b) product damaged while in the Customer's possession; and (c) following product recalls. Generally, returns for expired\nproduct are accepted three months before and up to one year after the expiration date of the related product, and the related product is destroyed after it is returned. We may either refund the sales price paid by the Customer by issuance of a credit, or exchange the returned product with replacement inventory. We typically do not provide cash refunds. We estimate the proportion of recorded revenue that will result in a return by considering relevant factors, including historical returns experience, the estimated level of inventory in the distribution channel, the shelf life of products and product recalls, if any.\nThe estimation process for product returns involves, in each case, a number of interrelating assumptions, which vary for each Customer. We estimate the amount of our product sales that may be returned by our Customers and record this estimate as a reduction of revenue from product sales in the period the related revenue is recognized, and because this returned product cannot be resold, there is no corresponding asset for product returns. To date, product returns have been minimal.\nOther Revenue\nWe enter into agreements in which we license certain rights to our products to partner companies that act as distributors. The terms of these arrangements may include payment to us of one or more of the following: non-refundable, up-front license fees; development, regulatory and commercial milestone payments; payments for manufacturing supply services we provide; and a revenue share on net sales of licensed products. Each of these payments is recognized as other revenues.\nAs part of the accounting for these arrangements, we must develop estimates that require judgment to determine the stand-alone selling price for each performance obligation identified in the contract. Performance obligations are promises in a contract to transfer a distinct good or service to the Customer, and we recognize revenue when, or as, performance obligations are satisfied. We use key assumptions to determine the stand-alone selling price; these assumptions may include forecasted revenues, development timelines, reimbursement rates for personnel costs, discount rates and probabilities of technical, regulatory and commercial success.\nCertain of these agreements include consideration in the form of milestone payments. At the inception of each arrangement that includes milestone payments, we evaluate the recognition of milestone payments. Typically, milestone payments are associated with events that are not entirely within our control or the licensee, such as regulatory approvals; are included in the transaction price; and are subject to a constraint until it is probable that there will not be a significant revenue reversal, typically upon achievement of the milestone. At the end of each reporting period, we re-evaluate the probability of achievement of such milestones and any related constraint, and if necessary, adjust our estimate of the overall transaction price.\nCustomer Payment Obligations\nWe receive payments from our Customers based on billing schedules established in each contract, which vary across locations, but generally range between 30 to 120 days. Occasionally, we offer extended payment terms or payment term discounts to certain customers. Amounts are recorded as accounts receivable when our right to consideration is unconditional. We do not assess whether a contract has a significant financing component if the expectation is that our Customer will pay for the product or services within one year or less of receiving those products or services.\nAdditional Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nResearch and Development Costs\nResearch and development expenditures are expensed as incurred, pursuant to ASC 730, Research and Development. Costs to license technology to be used in our research and development are expensed when incurred. Payments to licensors that relate to the achievement of preapproval development milestones are recorded as research and development expense when incurred.\nClinical Trial Prepaid and Accrued Expenses\nWe record prepaid assets and accrued liabilities related to clinical trials associated with contract research organizations (CROs), clinical trial investigators and other vendors based upon amounts paid and the estimated amount of work completed on each clinical trial. The financial terms of agreements vary from vendor to vendor and may result in uneven payment flows. As such, if we have advanced funds exceeding our estimate of the work completed, we record a prepaid asset. If our estimate of the work completed exceeds the amount paid, we record an accrued liability. All such costs are charged to research and development expenses based on these estimates. Our estimates may or may not match the actual services performed by the organizations as determined by patient enrollment levels and related activities. We monitor patient enrollment levels and related activities to the extent possible through internal reviews, correspondence and discussions with our CROs and review of contractual terms. However, if we have incomplete or inaccurate information, we may underestimate or overestimate activity levels associated with various clinical trials at a given point in time. In this event, we could record significant research and development expenses in future periods when the actual level of activities becomes known. To date, we have not experienced material changes in these estimates. Additionally, we do not expect material adjustments to research and development expenses\nto result from changes in the nature and level of clinical trial activity and related expenses that are currently subject to estimation. In the future, as we expand our clinical trial activities, we expect to have increased levels of research and development costs that will be subject to estimation.\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe have stock-based compensation under which various types of equity-based awards may be granted, including restricted stock units (RSUs) and stock options, to employees, directors and consultants. The exercise prices of stock options generally equal the fair values of our common stock at the dates of grant. We recognize compensation cost for all stock-based awards based on the grant date fair value in accordance with the provisions of ASC 718, Compensation - Stock Compensation. We recognize the grant date fair value as compensation cost of employee stock-based awards using the straight-line method over the actual vesting period, adjusted for our estimates of forfeiture. Typically, we grant stock options with a requisite service period of four years from the grant date. We have elected to use the Black-Scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock-based awards.\nWe concluded that this was the most appropriate method by which to value our share-based payment arrangements, but if any share-based payment instruments should be granted for which the Black-Scholes method does not meet the measurement objective as stated within ASC 718, we will use a more appropriate method for valuing that instrument. However, we do not believe that any instruments granted to date and accounted for under ASC 718 would require a method other than the Black-Scholes method.\nOur determination of the fair market value of share-based payment awards on the grant date using option valuation models requires the input of highly subjective assumptions, including the expected price volatility and option life. Changes in these input variables would affect the amount of expense associated with equity-based compensation. Expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of our common stock over the expected term of the stock option grant. To estimate the expected term, we use the simplified\u201d method for plain vanilla\u201d options as discussed within the SEC's Statement of Accounting Bulletin (SAB) 107. We believe that all factors listed within SAB 107 as pre-requisites for utilizing the simplified method are true for us and for our share-based payment arrangements. We intend to use the simplified method for the foreseeable future until more detailed information about exercise behavior will be more widely available. The risk-free interest rate is based on U.S. Treasury Daily Treasury Yield Curve Rates corresponding to the expected life assumed at the date of grant. Dividend yield is zero as there are no payments of dividends made or expected.\nIncome Taxes\nWe recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of our assets and liabilities in accordance with ASC 740, Income Taxes. We evaluate the positive and negative evidence bearing upon the realizability of our deferred tax assets on an annual basis. Significant management judgment is involved in determining the provision for income taxes, deferred tax assets and liabilities, and any valuation allowance recorded against net deferred tax assets. Due to uncertainties with respect to the realization of our U.S. deferred tax assets resulting from our history of operating losses, we have established a valuation allowance against our U.S. deferred tax asset balances to reduce the net carrying value to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized. As a result, we have fully reserved against the U.S. deferred tax asset balances. The valuation allowances are based on our estimates of taxable income in the jurisdictions in which we operate and the period over which deferred tax assets will be recoverable. If actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods, a change in the valuation allowance may be needed, which could materially impact our financial position and results of operations.\nOur deferred tax assets primarily consist of net operating loss (NOL) carry-forwards. As of December 31, 2019, we had federal NOL carry-forwards of approximately $125.8 million and state NOL carry-forwards of approximately $173.0 million, respectively, subject to further limitation based upon the final results of our Internal Revenue Code (IRC) sections 382 and 383 analyses. These NOLs are available to reduce future income otherwise taxable. If not utilized, the federal NOL carry-forwards will expire at various dates between 2029 and 2037, our federal NOL created in 2018 will carry forward indefinitely and the state NOL carry-forwards will expire at various dates between 2020 and 2038.\nSections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code limit the annual use of NOL carry-forwards and tax credit carry-forwards, respectively, following an ownership change. NOL carry-forwards may be subject to annual limitations under IRC Section 382 (Section 382) (or comparable provisions of state law) if certain changes in ownership were to occur. We periodically evaluate our NOL carry-forwards and whether certain changes in ownership have occurred that would limit our ability to utilize a portion of our NOL carry-forwards. If we determine that significant ownership changes have occurred since we generated our NOL carry-forwards, we may be subject to annual limitations on the use of these NOL carry-forwards under Section 382 (or comparable provisions of state law). We have determined that a Section 382 change in ownership occurred in late 2015. As a result of this change in ownership, we estimated that approximately $18.6 million of our federal NOLs and\napproximately $382,000 of federal tax credits generated prior to the change in ownership will not be utilized in the future. We are currently in the process of refining and finalizing these calculations, and upon finalization, will determine if a write-off is necessary. The reduction to our NOL deferred tax asset due to the annual Section 382 limitation and the NOL carryforward period would result in an offsetting reduction in valuation allowance recorded against the NOL deferred tax asset.\nIf we were to determine that we are able to realize any of our net deferred tax assets in the future, we would adjust the valuation allowance to increase net income in the period in which we make that determination. We believe that the most significant uncertainty affecting the determination of our valuation allowance will be our estimation of the extent and timing of future net income, if any.\nWe considered our income tax positions for uncertainty in accordance with ASC 740. The balance of unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 are approximately $58,000 and $68,000, respectively. Both balances relate to research and development tax credits. In accordance with ASC 740-10, such attributes are reduced to the amount that is expected to be recognized in the future. We do not accrue interest or penalties, as there is no risk of additional tax liability due to significant NOLs available. We do not expect any decreases to the unrecognized tax benefits within the next twelve months due to any lapses in statute of limitations. Tax years from 2015 to 2018 remain subject to examination in California, Georgia, Kentucky, New Jersey, Tennessee, Texas and on the federal level, provided that assessment of NOL carry-forwards available for use can be examined for all years since 2009. The statute of limitations on these years will close when the NOLs expire or when the statute closes on the years in which we use the NOLs.\nForeign Currency Translation\nThe U.S. dollar is the functional currency of Alimera Sciences, Inc. The Euro is the functional currency for the majority of our subsidiaries operating outside of the U.S.\nOur foreign currency assets and liabilities are remeasured into U.S. dollars at end-of-period exchange rates, except for nonmonetary balance sheet accounts, which are remeasured at historical exchange rates. Revenue and expenses are remeasured at average exchange rates in effect during each period, except for those expenses related to the non-monetary balance sheet amounts, which are remeasured at historical exchange rates. Gains or losses from foreign currency remeasurement are included in income.\nThe financial statements of the foreign subsidiaries whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar have been translated into U.S. dollars in accordance with ASC 830-30, Translation of Financial Statements. For the subsidiaries operating outside of the U.S. that are denominated in the Euro, assets and liabilities are translated at end-of-period rates while revenues and expenses are translated at average rates in effect during the period in which the activity took place. Equity is translated at historical rates and the resulting cumulative translation adjustments are included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe do not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, that would have been established to facilitate off-balance sheet arrangements (as that term is defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of SEC Regulation S-K) or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. As such, we are not exposed to any financing, liquidity, market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in those types of relationships. We enter into guarantees in the ordinary course of business related to the guarantee of our own performance and the performance of our subsidiaries.\nNew Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 2 of our notes to consolidated financial statements below for a description of recent accounting pronouncements, including the expected dates of adoption and expected effects on results of operations and financial condition, if known.", "summary": "- Table 144 shows information from the 2019 financial statements of a company, presented in two columns for comparison with the 2018 financial

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our audited annual consolidated financial statements and the related notes that appear elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements reflecting our current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from those discussed in these forward-looking statements due to a number of factors, including those described in the section entitled Risk Factors\u201d and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. For further information regarding forward-looking statements, please refer to the Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements and Projections\u201d at the beginning of Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOverview\nAlimera Sciences, Inc., and its subsidiaries (we, our or us), is a pharmaceutical company that specializes in the commercialization and development of prescription ophthalmic pharmaceuticals. We presently focus on diseases affecting the back of the eye, or retina, because these diseases are not well treated with current therapies and affect millions of people in our aging populations.\nILUVIEN\nOur only product is ILUVIEN\u00ae, which has received marketing authorization and reimbursement approval in numerous countries for the treatment of DME. In the U.S. and certain other countries outside Europe, ILUVIEN is indicated for the treatment of DME in patients who have been previously treated with a course of corticosteroids and did not have a clinically significant rise in intraocular pressure. In 17 countries in Europe, ILUVIEN is indicated for the treatment of vision impairment associated with chronic DME considered insufficiently responsive to available therapies. ILUVIEN is also now indicated in 16 countries in Europe for prevention of relapse in recurrent non-infectious uveitis affecting the posterior segment of the eye (NIU-PS). See Business - Overview\u201d above.\nWe market ILUVIEN directly in the U.S., Germany, the U.K., Portugal, Austria and Ireland. In addition, we have entered into various agreements under which distributors are providing or will provide regulatory, reimbursement and sales and marketing support for ILUVIEN in Belgium, France, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Spain, Australia, New Zealand, Canada and several countries in the Middle East. As of December 31, 2019, we have recognized sales of ILUVIEN to our international distributors in the Middle East, France, Italy and Spain.\nAccumulated Deficit\nWe commenced operations in June 2003. Since our inception we have incurred significant losses. As of December 31, 2019, we had accumulated a deficit of $387.6 million. We expect to incur additional expenses as we pursue our business strategy. See Business - Business Strategy\u201d above.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had approximately $9.4 million in cash and cash equivalents.\nLicense Agreement with EyePoint Pharmaceuticals US, Inc.\nIn July 2017, we amended and restated our license agreement with EyePoint Pharmaceuticals US, Inc. (EyePoint), formerly known as pSivida US, Inc., which was made effective July 1, 2017 (the New Collaboration Agreement). Under the New Collaboration Agreement, we have rights to the technology underlying ILUVIEN for the treatment of uveitis, including NIU-PS, in Europe, the Middle East and Africa. The New Collaboration Agreement converted our previous profit share obligation to a royalty payable on global net revenues of ILUVIEN. We began paying a 2% royalty on net revenues and other related consideration to EyePoint effective July 1, 2017. The royalty amount increased to 6% as of December 12, 2018. We will pay an additional 2% royalty on global net revenues and other related consideration in excess of $75.0 million in any year. During 2019 and 2018, we recognized approximately $2,158,000 and $998,000 of royalty expense, respectively.\nFollowing the signing of the New Collaboration Agreement, we retained a right to offset $15.0 million of future royalty payments. In March 2019, pursuant to the New Collaboration Agreement, we forgave $5,000,000 of the Future Offset in connection with the approval of ILUVIEN for NIU-PS in the U.K. As of December 31, 2019, the balance of the Future Offset was approximately $8,858,000. (See Note 10 of our notes to consolidated financial statements below.)\nSolar Capital Loans and Related Agreements\nOn January 5, 2018, we entered into a $40.0 million Loan and Security Agreement (the 2018 Solar Loan Agreement) with Solar Capital Ltd. (Solar Capital). Under the 2018 Solar Loan Agreement, we borrowed the entire $40.0 million as a term loan that was scheduled to mature on July 1, 2022 (the 2018 Solar Loan). We used the proceeds of the 2018 Solar Loan to refinance\nthe then outstanding loan (the Hercules Loan) under our previous loan agreement with Hercules Capital, Inc. (the Hercules Loan Agreement) and to pay closing expenses associated with the 2018 Solar Loan Agreement. On December 31, 2019, we refinanced the 2018 Solar Loan Agreement by entering into a $45.0 million Loan and Security Agreement (the 2019 Solar Loan Agreement) with Solar Capital. Under the 2019 Solar Loan Agreement, we borrowed $42.5 million on December 31, 2019 and $2.5 million on February 21, 2020 (the 2019 Solar Loan). The 2019 Solar Loan matures on July 1, 2024. We used the initial proceeds of the 2019 Solar Loan to pay off the 2018 Solar Loan, along with related prepayment, legal and other fees and expenses totaling approximately $2.3 million, which included a $1.8 million fee to Solar Capital upon repayment of the 2018 Solar Loan that was previously accrued and a $400,000 prepayment fee to Solar Capital that was capitalized as deferred financing costs.\nWe expect to use the remaining proceeds of the 2019 Solar Loan to provide additional working capital for general corporate purposes. (See Note 11 of our notes to consolidated financial statements below.)\nSources of Revenues\nOur revenues for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 were generated from product sales primarily in the U.S., Germany and the U.K. In the U.S., two large pharmaceutical distributors accounted for 60% and 69% of our consolidated revenues for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. These U.S.-based distributors purchase ILUVIEN from us, maintain inventories of ILUVIEN and sell downstream to physician offices, pharmacies and hospitals. Internationally, in countries where we sell direct, our customers are hospitals, clinics and pharmacies. We sometimes refer to physician offices, pharmacies, hospitals and clinics as end users. In international countries where we sell to distributors, these distributors maintain inventory levels of ILUVIEN and sell to their customers.\nReverse Stock Split Effective November 14, 2019\nOn November 14, 2019, we filed a certificate of amendment to our restated certificate of incorporation with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, which effected a one-for-15 reverse stock split (the reverse split\u201d) of our issued and outstanding shares of common stock at 5:01 PM Eastern Time on that date. As a result of the reverse split, every 15 shares of common stock issued and outstanding were converted into one share of common stock. No fractional shares were issued in connection with the reverse split. Stockholders who would otherwise have been entitled to a fractional share of common stock instead received a cash payment equal to such fraction multiplied by the average of the closing sales prices of the common stock (as adjusted to give effect to the reverse split) on The Nasdaq Global Market for the five consecutive trading days immediately preceding the effective date.\nThe reverse split did not change the par value of the common stock or the authorized number of shares of common stock. The reverse split affected all stockholders uniformly and did not alter any stockholder's percentage interest in our equity (other than as a result of the payment of cash in lieu of fractional shares). All outstanding options, preferred stock, restricted stock units, warrants and other securities entitling their holders to purchase or otherwise receive shares of Alimera's common stock have been adjusted as a result of the reverse split, as required by the terms of each security. The number of shares available to be awarded under our 2019 Omnibus Incentive Plan and the number of shares that are purchasable under our 2010 Employee Stock Purchase Plan have also been appropriately adjusted. The common stock began trading on The Nasdaq Global Market on a post-reverse split basis on November 15, 2019. The reverse split permitted us to regain compliance with Nasdaq's minimum bid price\u201d requirement for continued listing, which requires that the bid price of the stock of a listed company be at least $1.00 per share.\nFailure to Comply with Nasdaq Continued Listing Requirement\nOur common stock trades on The Nasdaq Global Market, which we believe helps support and maintain liquidity for our stock. Companies whose shares are listed on The Nasdaq Global Market, however, are subject to various rules and requirements imposed by Nasdaq that a listed company must satisfy to continue having its stock listed on the exchange. We received notice in September 2019 from The Nasdaq Stock Market (Nasdaq) that, for the last 30 consecutive trading days before the date of the notice, the Market Value of Listed Securities (MVLS) for our common stock was below the minimum MVLS of $50,000,000 required for continued listing on The Nasdaq Global Market. We have not regained compliance with Nasdaq's minimum MVLS requirement, and our 180-day compliance period expires on March 9, 2020. Nasdaq has three alternate standards for continued listing, and we expect to regain compliance with Nasdaq's continued listing standards by qualifying under a different listing standard that requires a listed company's revenue and total assets in each case to exceed $50 million (the Total Assets/Total Revenue Standard). Based on our revenue and total assets as reflected on the audited consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we believe that we meet the Total Assets/Total Revenue Standard. If Nasdaq concurs with our view as we expect, the Listing Qualifications Department of Nasdaq will send us a letter to that effect. We expect the letter to state that we have complied with the Total Assets/Total Revenue Standard and therefore our failure to comply with the minimum MVLS requirement will no longer affect our continued listing. We will not\nbe able to confirm that we have regained compliance, however, until we receive a letter to that effect from the Listing Qualifications Department of Nasdaq.\nWe cannot provide any assurances, however, that we will be able to regain compliance with the continued listing standards. Our statements in this section that we expect to regain compliance with the continued listing standards are forward-looking statements. We may not regain compliance, and actual results could differ materially from those projected in our forward-looking statements. Meaningful factors that could cause actual results to differ include our inability to meet the Total Assets/Total Revenue Standard as interpreted by Nasdaq. For more information about this topic, see the first risk factor under the heading Risk Factors - Risks Related to the Ownership of Our Common Stock\u201d above.\nResults of Operations - Year ended December 31, 2019 compared to year ended December 31, 2018\n\nRevenue\nWe began generating revenue from ILUVIEN in 2013. In addition to generating revenue from product sales, we intend to seek to generate revenue from other sources such as upfront fees, milestone payments in connection with collaborative or strategic relationships, and royalties resulting from the licensing of ILUVIEN or any future product candidates and other intellectual property. Additionally, revenue from our international distributors fluctuates depending on the timing of the shipment of ILUVIEN to the distributors and the distributors' sales of ILUVIEN to their customers.\nNet revenue increased by approximately $7.3 million, or 16%, to approximately $53.9 million for 2019, compared to approximately $46.6 million for 2018. The increase was primarily attributable to the new and existing markets in which we sell to our international distributors. We also increased our sales volume in the U.S. and the countries in our international segment where we sell direct.\nCost of Goods Sold, Excluding Depreciation and Amortization, and Gross Profit\nGross profit is affected by costs of goods sold, which includes costs of manufactured goods sold and royalty payments to EyePoint under the New Collaboration Agreement. Additionally, cost of goods sold by our international distributors fluctuates depending on the revenue share attributable to the respective contract.\nCost of goods sold, excluding depreciation and amortization increased by approximately $2.3 million, or 53%, to approximately $6.6 million for 2019, compared to approximately $4.3 million for 2018. The increase was primarily attributable to our increased sales volume and an increase in royalty expense payable on our global net revenue as a result of the increased royalty percentage payable to EyePoint.\nGross profit increased by approximately $5.0 million, or 12%, to approximately $47.3 million for 2019, compared to approximately $42.3 million for 2018. Gross margin was 88% and 91% for 2019 and 2018, respectively. As our revenues to our international distributors increase and our royalty expense payable to EyePoint increases, we expect our gross margin to decrease.\nResearch, Development and Medical Affairs Expenses\nCurrently, our research, development and medical affairs expenses are primarily focused on activities that support ILUVIEN and include salaries and related expenses for research and development and medical affairs personnel, including medical science liaisons. Our research, development and medical affairs expenses also include costs related to the provision of medical affairs support, including symposia development for physician education, and costs related to compliance with FDA, EEA or other regulatory requirements. We expense both internal and external development costs as they are incurred.\nResearch, development and medical affairs expenses decreased by approximately $300,000, or 3%, to approximately $11.0 million for 2019, compared to approximately $11.3 million for 2018. The decrease was primarily attributable to decreases of approximately $610,000 in clinical studies as we are approaching the termination of our ongoing clinical studies, $280,000 in stability studies and approximately $160,000 of scientific communications costs. This decrease was partially offset by increases of approximately $580,000 in consultant expenses primarily due to staff turnover, and $190,000 in safety and quality costs.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation for employees in executive and administrative functions, including finance, accounting, information technology and human resources. Other significant costs include facilities costs and professional fees for accounting and legal services, including legal services associated with obtaining and maintaining patents. We expect to continue to incur significant costs to comply with the corporate governance, internal control and similar requirements applicable to public companies.\nGeneral and administrative expenses decreased by approximately $500,000, or 3%, to approximately $14.0 million for 2019, compared to approximately $14.5 million for 2018. The decrease was primarily attributable to decreases of approximately $940,000 in non-cash stock-based compensation expenses and approximately $620,000 for a one-time non-cash accrued severance expense incurred in 2018 due to the transition of our previous chief executive officer to a consulting role. This decrease was partially offset by increases of approximately $480,000 in logistics and supply chain costs and $400,000 in legal fees; both in part are attributable to Brexit preparation.\nSales and Marketing Expenses\nSales and marketing expenses consist primarily of third-party service fees and compensation for employees for the commercial promotion, the assessment of the commercial opportunity of, the development of market awareness for, the pursuit of reimbursement approval for and the commercialization of ILUVIEN, including launch plans for ILUVIEN in new markets. Other costs include professional fees associated with developing plans for ILUVIEN or any future products or product candidates and maintaining public relations.\nSales and marketing expenses increased by approximately $1.5 million, or 6%, to approximately $25.0 million for 2019, compared to approximately $23.5 million for 2018. The increase was primarily attributable to increases of approximately $970,000 in marketing costs, the largest component of which was associated with the launch of our direct-to-patient advertising pilot program in the U.S., and approximately $240,000 in market access costs.\nOperating Expenses\nAs a result of the changes in expenses described above, total operating expenses increased by approximately $600,000, or 1%, to approximately $52.6 million for 2019, compared to approximately $52.0 million for 2018. The increase was primarily attributable to an approximately $1.5 million increase in sales and marketing expenses, partially offset by decreases of $500,000 in general and administrative expenses and $300,000 in research, development and medical affairs expenses as described above.\nInterest Expense and Other\nAs described in our Overview above, we entered into the 2018 Solar Loan Agreement on January 5, 2018, which we refinanced with the 2019 Solar Loan Agreement on December 31, 2019. For 2018 and 2019, interest expense consisted primarily of interest and amortization of deferred financing costs and debt discounts associated with our outstanding debt under the 2018 Solar Loan Agreement. Interest income consisted primarily of interest earned on our cash, cash equivalents and investments.\nInterest expense and other. Interest expense and other increased by approximately $100,000, or 2%, to approximately $4.9 million for 2019, compared to approximately $4.8 million for 2018.\nLoss on Early Extinguishment of Debt\nWe recorded a loss on early extinguishment of debt of approximately $1.8 million during 2018 as a result of our refinancing the Hercules Loan by entering into the 2018 Solar Loan Agreement on January 5, 2018. We accounted for the December 31, 2019 refinancing of the 2018 Solar Loan Agreement with the 2019 Solar Loan Agreement as a modification, and as such, we did not incur a loss on extinguishment of debt in 2019.\nGain on Extinguishment of Preferred Stock\nOn September 4, 2018, we entered into and closed a Series B Preferred Stock Exchange Agreement (Exchange Agreement) with the holders of all of the outstanding approximately 8,416 shares of Series B Preferred Stock. Under the Exchange Agreement, the holders of Series B Preferred Stock exchanged their shares of Series B Preferred Stock for an aggregate of 10,150 shares of Series C Convertible Preferred Stock, par value $0.01 per share (Series C Preferred Stock). We determined that the Exchange Agreement resulted in an extinguishment of the Series B Preferred Stock. As a result, we recognized a gain of $38,330,000 on the extinguishment of preferred stock during 2018. (See Note 13 of our notes to consolidated financial statements below.)\nBasic and Diluted Net Income (Loss) Applicable to Common Stockholders per Share of Common Stock\nWe follow FASB Accounting Standards Codification (ASC), Earnings Per Share (ASC 260), which requires the reporting of both basic and diluted earnings per share. Because our preferred stockholders participate in dividends equally with common stockholders (if we were to declare and pay dividends), we use the two-class method to calculate EPS. However, our preferred stockholders are not contractually obligated to share in losses.\nBasic EPS is computed by dividing net income (loss) available to stockholders by the weighted average number of shares outstanding for the period. Diluted EPS is calculated in accordance with ASC 260 by adjusting weighted average shares outstanding for the dilutive effect of common stock options, restricted stock units and warrants. In periods where a net loss is recorded, no effect is given to potentially dilutive securities, since the effect would be anti-dilutive.\nWe had net income available to stockholders for 2018 due to the gain on extinguishment of preferred stock. (See Note 13 of our notes to consolidated financial statements below.)\nBasic and diluted earnings per share attributable to shares of common stock and shares of preferred stock that are convertible into common stock (participating securities) are as follows:\n\nCommon stock equivalent securities that would potentially dilute basic EPS in the future, but were not included in the computation of diluted EPS because they were either classified as participating or would have been anti-dilutive, totaled approximately 2.3 million and 0.9 million for 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nPotentially dilutive common stock equivalents are excluded from the diluted earnings per share denominator for periods of net loss because of their anti-dilutive effect. Therefore, for 2019, the weighted average shares used to calculate both basic and diluted loss per share were the same.\nResults of Operations - Segment Review\nThe following selected unaudited financial and operating data are derived from our consolidated financial statements. The results and discussions that follow reflect how executive management monitors the performance of our reporting segments.\nWe have three segments: U.S., International and Other. Each segment is separately managed and is evaluated primarily upon segment loss from operations. Non-cash items including stock-based compensation expense, depreciation and amortization are categorized as Other. We allocate certain operating expenses between our reporting segments based on activity-based costing methods. These activity-based costing methods require us to make estimates that affect the amount of each expense category that is attributed to each segment. Changes in these estimates will directly affect the amount of expense allocated to each segment and therefore the operating profit of each reporting segment. There were no significant changes in our expense allocation methodology during 2019 or 2018.\nU.S. Segment\n\nU.S. Segment - Year ended December 31, 2019 compared to year ended December 31, 2018\nNet Revenue. Net revenue increased by approximately $300,000, or 1%, to approximately $32.3 million for 2019, compared to approximately $32.0 million for 2018. The increase was primarily attributable to our increased end user demand, which increased 5% for the year ended December 31, 2019, increasing to 3,993 units compared to 3,802 units for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nCost of goods sold, excluding depreciation and amortization. Cost of goods sold, excluding depreciation and amortization increased by approximately $600,000, or 21%, to approximately $3.5 million for 2019 compared to approximately $2.9 million for 2018. The increase was primarily attributable to our increased royalty expense payable as a result of the increased royalty percentage payable to EyePoint.\nResearch, development and medical affairs expenses. Research, development and medical affairs expenses decreased by approximately $600,000, or 9%, to approximately $5.9 million for 2019, compared to approximately $6.5 million for 2018. The decrease was primarily attributable to decreases of approximately $390,000 in stability studies, $360,000 in clinical studies and $200,000 of scientific communications costs. This decrease was partially offset by an increase of approximately $360,000 in consultant costs primarily due to staff turnover.\nGeneral and administrative expenses. General and administrative expenses increased by approximately $300,000, or 4%, to approximately $8.4 million for 2019, compared to approximately $8.1 million for 2018. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in legal fees.\nSales and marketing expenses. Sales and marketing expenses increased by approximately $1.0 million, or 6%, to approximately $17.6 million for 2019, compared to approximately $16.6 million for 2018. The increase was primarily attributable to increases of approximately $800,000 in marketing costs, some of which were associated with the launch of our direct-to-patient advertising pilot program, and approximately $200,000 in market access costs.\nInternational Segment\n\nInternational Segment - Year ended December 31, 2019 compared to year ended December 31, 2018\nNet Revenue. Net revenue increased by approximately $7.1 million, or 49%, to approximately $21.7 million for 2019, compared to approximately $14.6 million for 2018. The increase was primarily attributable to increased sales volume in the new and existing markets in which we sell to our international distributors. We also increased our sales volume in the countries in our international segment where we sell direct.\nCost of goods sold, excluding depreciation and amortization. Cost of goods sold, excluding depreciation and amortization increased by approximately $1.7 million, or 121%, to approximately $3.1 million for 2019, compared to approximately $1.4 million for 2018. The increase was primarily attributable to the cost of units sold associated with our increased international net revenue and royalty expense payable on our increased international net revenue as a result of the increased royalty percentage payable to EyePoint.\nResearch, development and medical affairs expenses. Research, development and medical affairs expenses increased by approximately $700,000, or 18%, to approximately $4.6 million for 2019, compared to approximately $3.9 million for 2018. The increase was primarily attributable to increases of approximately $430,000 in personnel costs and $220,000 in consultant costs.\nGeneral and administrative expenses. General and administrative expenses increased by approximately $600,000, or 18%, to approximately $3.9 million for 2019, compared to approximately $3.3 million for 2018. The increase was primarily attributable to increases of approximately $310,000 in logistics and supply chain costs, some of which are attributable to Brexit preparation, and $260,000 in legal fees.\nSales and marketing expenses. Sales and marketing expenses increased by approximately $1.0 million, or 17%, to approximately $6.9 million for 2019, compared to approximately $5.9 million for 2018. The increase was primarily attributable to increases of approximately $850,000 in personnel costs, including increased commission expense associated with our increased international net revenue, and approximately $170,000 in marketing costs.\nOther Segment\n\nOur chief operating decision maker manages and evaluates our U.S. and International segments based on net loss from operations adjusted for certain non-cash items, such as stock-based compensation expense, accrued severance expenses and depreciation and amortization. Therefore, these non-cash expenses included in research, development and medical affairs expenses, general and administrative expenses, and sales and marketing expenses are classified within the Other segment within our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nWithin the respective financial statement line items included in the Other segment, stock-based compensation expense, collectively, decreased by approximately $1.9 million, or 43%, to $2.5 million for 2019, compared to $4.4 million for 2018. The decrease was primarily attributable to (a) a decrease in the average fair value of outstanding unvested options, which caused a decrease in option expense recognized in 2019, and (b) our paying cash bonuses to our non-executive employees for 2019, compared to our issuing RSUs to all employees in lieu of cash bonuses for 2018. Additionally, within general and administrative expenses we had a decrease of approximately $600,000 of one-time non-cash accrued severance expenses due to the transition of our previous chief executive officer to a consulting role; these expenses were accrued in 2018 and paid in 2019.\nDepreciation and amortization were approximately $2.6 million for both 2019 and 2018.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nSince inception, we have incurred recurring losses and negative cash flow from operations, and we have accumulated a deficit of $387.6 million through December 31, 2019. In 2018 and 2019, we funded our operations through the $40.0 million 2018 Solar Loan Agreement and an offering of common stock.\nOn January 5, 2018, we entered into the $40.0 million 2018 Solar Loan Agreement. Under that agreement, we borrowed the entire $40.0 million as a term loan that was scheduled to mature on July 1, 2022 (the 2018 Solar Loan). We used the proceeds of the 2018 Solar Loan Agreement to repay the Hercules Loan and pay related expenses. On December 31, 2019, we refinanced the 2018 Solar Loan Agreement by entering into the $45.0 million 2019 Solar Loan Agreement. Under the 2019 Solar Loan Agreement, we borrowed $42.5 million on December 31, 2019, and thereafter we borrowed the remaining $2.5 million on February 21, 2020 (the 2019 Solar Loan). The 2019 Solar Loan matures on July 1, 2024. We used the initial proceeds of the 2019 Solar Loan to pay off the 2018 Solar Loan, along with related prepayment, legal and other fees and expenses of approximately $2.3 million, which included a $1.8 million fee to Solar Capital upon repayment of the 2018 Solar Loan that was previously accrued and a $400,000 prepayment fee to Solar Capital that was capitalized as deferred financing costs. We expect to use the remaining proceeds of the 2019 Solar Loan to provide additional working capital for general corporate purposes. (See Note 11 of our notes to consolidated financial statements below.)\nOn October 24, 2019, we entered into a purchase agreement (Purchase Agreement) with Lincoln Park Capital Fund, LLC (Lincoln Park). The Purchase Agreement provided that, upon its terms and subject to its conditions and limitations, we could have directed Lincoln Park to purchase up to $20.0 million of shares of our common stock from time to time over the 36-month term of the Purchase Agreement. As consideration for Lincoln Park's commitment to purchase shares of common stock pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, on October 25, 2019 we issued to Lincoln Park 90,909 shares of our common stock (as adjusted to reflect the reverse split) for no additional consideration. On October 28, 2019, Lincoln Park purchased 133,333 shares at a price of $7.50 per share (which number of shares and per share amount have been adjusted to reflect the reverse split), for an aggregate price of $1,000,000. We terminated the Purchase Agreement effective November 12, 2019 after determining that we had no intention to conduct further sales to Lincoln Park under the Purchase Agreement.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had approximately $9.4 million in cash and cash equivalents. We may need to raise additional capital to fund our business strategy, including the continued commercialization of ILUVIEN. If we need to raise additional financing and are unable to do so, we will need to adjust our commercial plans so that we can continue to operate with our existing cash resources. The actual amount of funds that we will need will depend on many factors, some of which are beyond our control. We may need funds sooner than currently anticipated.\nWe cannot be sure that other additional financing will be available when needed or that, if available, the additional financing would be obtained on terms favorable to us or our stockholders. If we were to raise additional funds by issuing equity securities, substantial dilution to existing stockholders would likely result, and the terms of any new equity securities may have a preference over our common stock. If we were to attempt to raise additional funds through strategic collaboration agreements, we may not be successful in obtaining those agreements, or in receiving milestone or royalty payments under them. If we were to attempt to raise additional funds through debt financing, (a) the terms of the debt may involve significant cash payment obligations as well as covenants and specific financial ratios that may restrict our ability to commercialize ILUVIEN or any future products or product candidates or to operate our business; and (b) we would be required to obtain the permission or participation of Solar Capital, which we might not be able to obtain. Our capital raising efforts may be hindered by our current failure to comply with Nasdaq's continuing listing requirements, which could ultimately lead to our delisting from Nasdaq if we are unable to regain compliance. See Overview - Failure to Comply with Nasdaq Continued Listing Requirement\u201d and the first risk factor under the heading Risk Factors - Risks Related to the Ownership of Our Common Stock\u201d above. Our recurring losses and any potential needs to raise capital create substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern for the next 12 months following the issuance of the audited financial statements including in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nFor 2019, net cash used in our operations of $4.2 million was primarily due to our net loss of $10.4 million, offset by $2.6 million of non-cash depreciation and amortization, $2.5 million of non-cash stock-based compensation expense and $840,000 of non-cash interest expense associated with the amortization of our debt discount. Further reducing cash from operations was a $2.2 million increase in accounts receivable that was driven by increased revenue, a $1.0 million increase in inventory, an $830,000 increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets and a $450,000 decrease in deferred tax asset. This reduction was offset by a $1.4 million increase in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other current liabilities and a $390,000 increase in long-term liabilities.\nFor 2018, net cash used in our operations of $11.6 million was primarily due to our net loss of $16.4 million, offset by approximately $4.4 million in stock compensation expense, $2.6 million of depreciation and amortization expense, a $1.8 million charge for the loss on early extinguishment of debt and $840,000 of amortization costs associated with our debt discount. Further reducing cash from operations was a $6.0 million increase in accounts receivable that was driven by increased\nrevenue and a $930,000 increase in inventory. This reduction was offset by a $1.4 million increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses and other current liabilities.\nFor 2019, net cash used in our investing activities was approximately $174,000, which was primarily due to the purchase of equipment and software.\nFor 2018, net cash used in our investing activities was approximately $175,000, which was primarily due to the purchase of equipment and software.\nFor 2019, net cash provided by our financing activities was approximately $869,000, which was primarily due to incurring $2.5 million of additional debt by entering into the $45.0 million 2019 Solar Loan Agreement and our sale of $1.0 million of common stock to Lincoln Park. These increases in cash were offset by payments of approximately $2.3 million, which included a $1.8 million fee to Solar Capital upon repayment of the 2018 Solar Loan that was previously accrued and a $400,000 prepayment fee to Solar Capital that was capitalized as deferred financing costs.\nFor 2018, net cash provided by our financing activities was approximately $950,000, which was primarily due to entering into the $40.0 million 2018 Solar Loan Agreement, offset by paying off the $35.0 million Hercules Loan and related debt costs of $3.7 million.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements that have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate these estimates and judgments, including those described below. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. These estimates and assumptions form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results and experiences may differ materially from these estimates. We believe that the following accounting policies are the most critical to understanding and evaluating our reported financial results and affect the more significant judgments and estimates that we use to prepare our consolidated financial statements.\nRevenue Recognition\nNet Revenue\nWe sell our products to major pharmaceutical distributors, pharmacies, hospitals and wholesalers (collectively, our Customers). In addition to distribution agreements with Customers, we enter into arrangements with healthcare providers and payors that provide for government-mandated and/or privately-negotiated rebates, chargebacks, and discounts with respect to the purchase of our products. All of our current contracts have a single performance obligation, as the promise to transfer the individual goods is not separately identifiable from other promises in the contracts and is, therefore, not distinct.\nCurrently, all of our revenue is derived from product sales. We recognize revenues from product sales when the Customer obtains control, typically upon delivery. We accrue for fulfillment costs when the related revenue is recognized. Taxes collected from Customers relating to product sales and remitted to governmental authorities are excluded from revenues.\nAs of December 31, 2019 and 2018, we had received a total of $1.0 million of milestone payments in connection with our Canadian distributor that we have not recognized as revenue based on our analysis in connection with Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606). These deferred revenues are included as a component of other non-current liabilities on our balance sheets.\nEstimates of Variable Consideration\nRevenues from product sales are recorded at the net sales price (transaction price), which includes estimates of variable consideration for reserves related to statutory rebates to state Medicaid and other government agencies; commercial rebates and fees to Managed Care Organizations (MCOs), Group Purchasing Organizations (GPOs), distributors and specialty pharmacies; product returns; sales discounts (including trade discounts); distributor costs; wholesaler chargebacks; and allowances for patient assistance programs relating to sales of our products.\nThese reserves are based on estimates of the amounts earned or to be claimed on the related sales. Our estimates take into consideration historical experience, current contractual and statutory requirements, specific known market events and trends, industry data and Customer buying and payment patterns. Overall, these reserves reflect our best estimates of the amount of consideration to which we are entitled based on the terms of the contract. The amount of variable consideration included in the net sales price is limited to the amount that is probable not to result in a significant reversal in the amount of the cumulative revenue recognized in a future period. If actual results vary, we may adjust these estimates, which could have an effect on earnings in the period of adjustment.\nWith respect to our international contracts with third party distributors, certain contracts have elements of variable consideration, and management reviews those contracts on a regular basis and makes estimates of revenue based on historical ordering patterns and known market events and data. The amount of variable consideration included in net sales in each period can vary depending on the terms of these contracts and the probability of reversal in future periods.\nConsideration Payable to Customers\nDistribution service fees are payments issued to distributors for compliance with various contractually-defined inventory management practices or services provided to support patient access to a product. Distribution service fees reserves are based on the terms of each individual contract and are classified within accrued expenses and are recorded as a reduction of revenue.\nProduct Returns\nOur policies provide for product returns in the following circumstances: (a) expiration of shelf life on certain products; (b) product damaged while in the Customer's possession; and (c) following product recalls. Generally, returns for expired\nproduct are accepted three months before and up to one year after the expiration date of the related product, and the related product is destroyed after it is returned. We may either refund the sales price paid by the Customer by issuance of a credit, or exchange the returned product with replacement inventory. We typically do not provide cash refunds. We estimate the proportion of recorded revenue that will result in a return by considering relevant factors, including historical returns experience, the estimated level of inventory in the distribution channel, the shelf life of products and product recalls, if any.\nThe estimation process for product returns involves, in each case, a number of interrelating assumptions, which vary for each Customer. We estimate the amount of our product sales that may be returned by our Customers and record this estimate as a reduction of revenue from product sales in the period the related revenue is recognized, and because this returned product cannot be resold, there is no corresponding asset for product returns. To date, product returns have been minimal.\nOther Revenue\nWe enter into agreements in which we license certain rights to our products to partner companies that act as distributors. The terms of these arrangements may include payment to us of one or more of the following: non-refundable, up-front license fees; development, regulatory and commercial milestone payments; payments for manufacturing supply services we provide; and a revenue share on net sales of licensed products. Each of these payments is recognized as other revenues.\nAs part of the accounting for these arrangements, we must develop estimates that require judgment to determine the stand-alone selling price for each performance obligation identified in the contract. Performance obligations are promises in a contract to transfer a distinct good or service to the Customer, and we recognize revenue when, or as, performance obligations are satisfied. We use key assumptions to determine the stand-alone selling price; these assumptions may include forecasted revenues, development timelines, reimbursement rates for personnel costs, discount rates and probabilities of technical, regulatory and commercial success.\nCertain of these agreements include consideration in the form of milestone payments. At the inception of each arrangement that includes milestone payments, we evaluate the recognition of milestone payments. Typically, milestone payments are associated with events that are not entirely within our control or the licensee, such as regulatory approvals; are included in the transaction price; and are subject to a constraint until it is probable that there will not be a significant revenue reversal, typically upon achievement of the milestone. At the end of each reporting period, we re-evaluate the probability of achievement of such milestones and any related constraint, and if necessary, adjust our estimate of the overall transaction price.\nCustomer Payment Obligations\nWe receive payments from our Customers based on billing schedules established in each contract, which vary across locations, but generally range between 30 to 120 days. Occasionally, we offer extended payment terms or payment term discounts to certain customers. Amounts are recorded as accounts receivable when our right to consideration is unconditional. We do not assess whether a contract has a significant financing component if the expectation is that our Customer will pay for the product or services within one year or less of receiving those products or services.\nAdditional Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nResearch and Development Costs\nResearch and development expenditures are expensed as incurred, pursuant to ASC 730, Research and Development. Costs to license technology to be used in our research and development are expensed when incurred. Payments to licensors that relate to the achievement of preapproval development milestones are recorded as research and development expense when incurred.\nClinical Trial Prepaid and Accrued Expenses\nWe record prepaid assets and accrued liabilities related to clinical trials associated with contract research organizations (CROs), clinical trial investigators and other vendors based upon amounts paid and the estimated amount of work completed on each clinical trial. The financial terms of agreements vary from vendor to vendor and may result in uneven payment flows. As such, if we have advanced funds exceeding our estimate of the work completed, we record a prepaid asset. If our estimate of the work completed exceeds the amount paid, we record an accrued liability. All such costs are charged to research and development expenses based on these estimates. Our estimates may or may not match the actual services performed by the organizations as determined by patient enrollment levels and related activities. We monitor patient enrollment levels and related activities to the extent possible through internal reviews, correspondence and discussions with our CROs and review of contractual terms. However, if we have incomplete or inaccurate information, we may underestimate or overestimate activity levels associated with various clinical trials at a given point in time. In this event, we could record significant research and development expenses in future periods when the actual level of activities becomes known. To date, we have not experienced material changes in these estimates. Additionally, we do not expect material adjustments to research and development expenses\nto result from changes in the nature and level of clinical trial activity and related expenses that are currently subject to estimation. In the future, as we expand our clinical trial activities, we expect to have increased levels of research and development costs that will be subject to estimation.\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe have stock-based compensation under which various types of equity-based awards may be granted, including restricted stock units (RSUs) and stock options, to employees, directors and consultants. The exercise prices of stock options generally equal the fair values of our common stock at the dates of grant. We recognize compensation cost for all stock-based awards based on the grant date fair value in accordance with the provisions of ASC 718, Compensation - Stock Compensation. We recognize the grant date fair value as compensation cost of employee stock-based awards using the straight-line method over the actual vesting period, adjusted for our estimates of forfeiture. Typically, we grant stock options with a requisite service period of four years from the grant date. We have elected to use the Black-Scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock-based awards.\nWe concluded that this was the most appropriate method by which to value our share-based payment arrangements, but if any share-based payment instruments should be granted for which the Black-Scholes method does not meet the measurement objective as stated within ASC 718, we will use a more appropriate method for valuing that instrument. However, we do not believe that any instruments granted to date and accounted for under ASC 718 would require a method other than the Black-Scholes method.\nOur determination of the fair market value of share-based payment awards on the grant date using option valuation models requires the input of highly subjective assumptions, including the expected price volatility and option life. Changes in these input variables would affect the amount of expense associated with equity-based compensation. Expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of our common stock over the expected term of the stock option grant. To estimate the expected term, we use the simplified\u201d method for plain vanilla\u201d options as discussed within the SEC's Statement of Accounting Bulletin (SAB) 107. We believe that all factors listed within SAB 107 as pre-requisites for utilizing the simplified method are true for us and for our share-based payment arrangements. We intend to use the simplified method for the foreseeable future until more detailed information about exercise behavior will be more widely available. The risk-free interest rate is based on U.S. Treasury Daily Treasury Yield Curve Rates corresponding to the expected life assumed at the date of grant. Dividend yield is zero as there are no payments of dividends made or expected.\nIncome Taxes\nWe recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of our assets and liabilities in accordance with ASC 740, Income Taxes. We evaluate the positive and negative evidence bearing upon the realizability of our deferred tax assets on an annual basis. Significant management judgment is involved in determining the provision for income taxes, deferred tax assets and liabilities, and any valuation allowance recorded against net deferred tax assets. Due to uncertainties with respect to the realization of our U.S. deferred tax assets resulting from our history of operating losses, we have established a valuation allowance against our U.S. deferred tax asset balances to reduce the net carrying value to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized. As a result, we have fully reserved against the U.S. deferred tax asset balances. The valuation allowances are based on our estimates of taxable income in the jurisdictions in which we operate and the period over which deferred tax assets will be recoverable. If actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods, a change in the valuation allowance may be needed, which could materially impact our financial position and results of operations.\nOur deferred tax assets primarily consist of net operating loss (NOL) carry-forwards. As of December 31, 2019, we had federal NOL carry-forwards of approximately $125.8 million and state NOL carry-forwards of approximately $173.0 million, respectively, subject to further limitation based upon the final results of our Internal Revenue Code (IRC) sections 382 and 383 analyses. These NOLs are available to reduce future income otherwise taxable. If not utilized, the federal NOL carry-forwards will expire at various dates between 2029 and 2037, our federal NOL created in 2018 will carry forward indefinitely and the state NOL carry-forwards will expire at various dates between 2020 and 2038.\nSections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code limit the annual use of NOL carry-forwards and tax credit carry-forwards, respectively, following an ownership change. NOL carry-forwards may be subject to annual limitations under IRC Section 382 (Section 382) (or comparable provisions of state law) if certain changes in ownership were to occur. We periodically evaluate our NOL carry-forwards and whether certain changes in ownership have occurred that would limit our ability to utilize a portion of our NOL carry-forwards. If we determine that significant ownership changes have occurred since we generated our NOL carry-forwards, we may be subject to annual limitations on the use of these NOL carry-forwards under Section 382 (or comparable provisions of state law). We have determined that a Section 382 change in ownership occurred in late 2015. As a result of this change in ownership, we estimated that approximately $18.6 million of our federal NOLs and\napproximately $382,000 of federal tax credits generated prior to the change in ownership will not be utilized in the future. We are currently in the process of refining and finalizing these calculations, and upon finalization, will determine if a write-off is necessary. The reduction to our NOL deferred tax asset due to the annual Section 382 limitation and the NOL carryforward period would result in an offsetting reduction in valuation allowance recorded against the NOL deferred tax asset.\nIf we were to determine that we are able to realize any of our net deferred tax assets in the future, we would adjust the valuation allowance to increase net income in the period in which we make that determination. We believe that the most significant uncertainty affecting the determination of our valuation allowance will be our estimation of the extent and timing of future net income, if any.\nWe considered our income tax positions for uncertainty in accordance with ASC 740. The balance of unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 are approximately $58,000 and $68,000, respectively. Both balances relate to research and development tax credits. In accordance with ASC 740-10, such attributes are reduced to the amount that is expected to be recognized in the future. We do not accrue interest or penalties, as there is no risk of additional tax liability due to significant NOLs available. We do not expect any decreases to the unrecognized tax benefits within the next twelve months due to any lapses in statute of limitations. Tax years from 2015 to 2018 remain subject to examination in California, Georgia, Kentucky, New Jersey, Tennessee, Texas and on the federal level, provided that assessment of NOL carry-forwards available for use can be examined for all years since 2009. The statute of limitations on these years will close when the NOLs expire or when the statute closes on the years in which we use the NOLs.\nForeign Currency Translation\nThe U.S. dollar is the functional currency of Alimera Sciences, Inc. The Euro is the functional currency for the majority of our subsidiaries operating outside of the U.S.\nOur foreign currency assets and liabilities are remeasured into U.S. dollars at end-of-period exchange rates, except for nonmonetary balance sheet accounts, which are remeasured at historical exchange rates. Revenue and expenses are remeasured at average exchange rates in effect during each period, except for those expenses related to the non-monetary balance sheet amounts, which are remeasured at historical exchange rates. Gains or losses from foreign currency remeasurement are included in income.\nThe financial statements of the foreign subsidiaries whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar have been translated into U.S. dollars in accordance with ASC 830-30, Translation of Financial Statements. For the subsidiaries operating outside of the U.S. that are denominated in the Euro, assets and liabilities are translated at end-of-period rates while revenues and expenses are translated at average rates in effect during the period in which the activity took place. Equity is translated at historical rates and the resulting cumulative translation adjustments are included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe do not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, that would have been established to facilitate off-balance sheet arrangements (as that term is defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of SEC Regulation S-K) or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. As such, we are not exposed to any financing, liquidity, market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in those types of relationships. We enter into guarantees in the ordinary course of business related to the guarantee of our own performance and the performance of our subsidiaries.\nNew Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 2 of our notes to consolidated financial statements below for a description of recent accounting pronouncements, including the expected dates of adoption and expected effects on results of operations and financial condition, if known.", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our audited annual consolidated financial statements and the related notes that appear elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements reflecting our current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from those discussed in these forward-looking statements due to a number of factors, including those described in the section entitled Risk Factors\u201d and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. For further information regarding forward-looking statements, please refer to the Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements and Projections\u201d at the beginning of Part I of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOverview\nAlimera Sciences, Inc., and its subsidiaries (we, our or us), is a pharmaceutical company that specializes in the commercialization and development of prescription ophthalmic pharmaceuticals. We presently focus on diseases affecting the back of the eye, or retina, because these diseases are not well treated with current therapies and affect millions of people in our aging populations.\nILUVIEN\nOur only product is ILUVIEN\u00ae, which has received marketing authorization and reimbursement approval in numerous countries for the treatment of DME. In the U.S. and certain other countries outside Europe, ILUVIEN is indicated for the treatment of DME in patients who have been previously treated with a course of corticosteroids and did not have a clinically significant rise in intraocular pressure. In 17 countries in Europe, ILUVIEN is indicated for the treatment of vision impairment associated with chronic DME considered insufficiently responsive to available therapies. ILUVIEN is also now indicated in 16 countries in Europe for prevention of relapse in recurrent non-infectious uveitis affecting the posterior segment of the eye (NIU-PS). See Business - Overview\u201d above.\nWe market ILUVIEN directly in the U.S., Germany, the U.K., Portugal, Austria and Ireland. In addition, we have entered into various agreements under which distributors are providing or will provide regulatory, reimbursement and sales and marketing support for ILUVIEN in Belgium, France, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Spain, Australia, New Zealand, Canada and several countries in the Middle East. As of December 31, 2019, we have recognized sales of ILUVIEN to our international distributors in the Middle East, France, Italy and Spain.\nAccumulated Deficit\nWe commenced operations in June 2003. Since our inception we have incurred significant losses. As of December 31, 2019, we had accumulated a deficit of $387.6 million. We expect to incur additional expenses as we pursue our business strategy. See Business - Business Strategy\u201d above.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had approximately $9.4 million in cash and cash equivalents.\nLicense Agreement with EyePoint Pharmaceuticals US, Inc.\nIn July 2017, we amended and restated our license agreement with EyePoint Pharmaceuticals US, Inc. (EyePoint), formerly known as pSivida US, Inc., which was made effective July 1, 2017 (the New Collaboration Agreement). Under the New Collaboration Agreement, we have rights to the technology underlying ILUVIEN for the treatment of uveitis, including NIU-PS, in Europe, the Middle East and Africa. The New Collaboration Agreement converted our previous profit share obligation to a royalty payable on global net revenues of ILUVIEN. We began paying a 2% royalty on net revenues and other related consideration to EyePoint effective July 1, 2017. The royalty amount increased to 6% as of December 12, 2018. We will pay an additional 2% royalty on global net revenues and other related consideration in excess of $75.0 million in any year. During 2019 and 2018, we recognized approximately $2,158,000 and $998,000 of royalty expense, respectively.\nFollowing the signing of the New Collaboration Agreement, we retained a right to offset $15.0 million of future royalty payments. In March 2019, pursuant to the New Collaboration Agreement, we forgave $5,000,000 of the Future Offset in connection with the approval of ILUVIEN for NIU-PS in the U.K. As of December 31, 2019, the balance of the Future Offset was approximately $8,858,000. (See Note 10 of our notes to consolidated financial statements below.)\nSolar Capital Loans and Related Agreements\nOn January 5, 2018, we entered into a $40.0 million Loan and Security Agreement (the 2018 Solar Loan Agreement) with Solar Capital Ltd. (Solar Capital). Under the 2018 Solar Loan Agreement, we borrowed the entire $40.0 million as a term loan that was scheduled to mature on July 1, 2022 (the 2018 Solar Loan). We used the proceeds of the 2018 Solar Loan to refinance\nthe then outstanding loan (the Hercules Loan) under our previous loan agreement with Hercules Capital, Inc. (the Hercules Loan Agreement) and to pay closing expenses associated with the 2018 Solar Loan Agreement. On December 31, 2019, we refinanced the 2018 Solar Loan Agreement by entering into a $45.0 million Loan and Security Agreement (the 2019 Solar Loan Agreement) with Solar Capital. Under the 2019 Solar Loan Agreement, we borrowed $42.5 million on December 31, 2019 and $2.5 million on February 21, 2020 (the 2019 Solar Loan). The 2019 Solar Loan matures on July 1, 2024. We used the initial proceeds of the 2019 Solar Loan to pay off the 2018 Solar Loan, along with related prepayment, legal and other fees and expenses totaling approximately $2.3 million, which included a $1.8 million fee to Solar Capital upon repayment of the 2018 Solar Loan that was previously accrued and a $400,000 prepayment fee to Solar Capital that was capitalized as deferred financing costs.\nWe expect to use the remaining proceeds of the 2019 Solar Loan to provide additional working capital for general corporate purposes. (See Note 11 of our notes to consolidated financial statements below.)\nSources of Revenues\nOur revenues for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 were generated from product sales primarily in the U.S., Germany and the U.K. In the U.S., two large pharmaceutical distributors accounted for 60% and 69% of our consolidated revenues for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. These U.S.-based distributors purchase ILUVIEN from us, maintain inventories of ILUVIEN and sell downstream to physician offices, pharmacies and hospitals. Internationally, in countries where we sell direct, our customers are hospitals, clinics and pharmacies. We sometimes refer to physician offices, pharmacies, hospitals and clinics as end users. In international countries where we sell to distributors, these distributors maintain inventory levels of ILUVIEN and sell to their customers.\nReverse Stock Split Effective November 14, 2019\nOn November 14, 2019, we filed a certificate of amendment to our restated certificate of incorporation with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, which effected a one-for-15 reverse stock split (the reverse split\u201d) of our issued and outstanding shares of common stock at 5:01 PM Eastern Time on that date. As a result of the reverse split, every 15 shares of common stock issued and outstanding were converted into one share of common stock. No fractional shares were issued in connection with the reverse split. Stockholders who would otherwise have been entitled to a fractional share of common stock instead received a cash payment equal to such fraction multiplied by the average of the closing sales prices of the common stock (as adjusted to give effect to the reverse split) on The Nasdaq Global Market for the five consecutive trading days immediately preceding the effective date.\nThe reverse split did not change the par value of the common stock or the authorized number of shares of common stock. The reverse split affected all stockholders uniformly and did not alter any stockholder's percentage interest in our equity (other than as a result of the payment of cash in lieu of fractional shares). All outstanding options, preferred stock, restricted stock units, warrants and other securities entitling their holders to purchase or otherwise receive shares of Alimera's common stock have been adjusted as a result of the reverse split, as required by the terms of each security. The number of shares available to be awarded under our 2019 Omnibus Incentive Plan and the number of shares that are purchasable under our 2010 Employee Stock Purchase Plan have also been appropriately adjusted. The common stock began trading on The Nasdaq Global Market on a post-reverse split basis on November 15, 2019. The reverse split permitted us to regain compliance with Nasdaq's minimum bid price\u201d requirement for continued listing, which requires that the bid price of the stock of a listed company be at least $1.00 per share.\nFailure to Comply with Nasdaq Continued Listing Requirement\nOur common stock trades on The Nasdaq Global Market, which we believe helps support and maintain liquidity for our stock. Companies whose shares are listed on The Nasdaq Global Market, however, are subject to various rules and requirements imposed by Nasdaq that a listed company must satisfy to continue having its stock listed on the exchange. We received notice in September 2019 from The Nasdaq Stock Market (Nasdaq) that, for the last 30 consecutive trading days before the date of the notice, the Market Value of Listed Securities (MVLS) for our common stock was below the minimum MVLS of $50,000,000 required for continued listing on The Nasdaq Global Market. We have not regained compliance with Nasdaq's minimum MVLS requirement, and our 180-day compliance period expires on March 9, 2020. Nasdaq has three alternate standards for continued listing, and we expect to regain compliance with Nasdaq's continued listing standards by qualifying under a different listing standard that requires a listed company's revenue and total assets in each case to exceed $50 million (the Total Assets/Total Revenue Standard). Based on our revenue and total assets as reflected on the audited consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we believe that we meet the Total Assets/Total Revenue Standard. If Nasdaq concurs with our view as we expect, the Listing Qualifications Department of Nasdaq will send us a letter to that effect. We expect the letter to state that we have complied with the Total Assets/Total Revenue Standard and therefore our failure to comply with the minimum MVLS requirement will no longer affect our continued listing. We will not\nbe able to confirm that we have regained compliance, however, until we receive a letter to that effect from the Listing Qualifications Department of Nasdaq.\nWe cannot provide any assurances, however, that we will be able to regain compliance with the continued listing standards. Our statements in this section that we expect to regain compliance with the continued listing standards are forward-looking statements. We may not regain compliance, and actual results could differ materially from those projected in our forward-looking statements. Meaningful factors that could cause actual results to differ include our inability to meet the Total Assets/Total Revenue Standard as interpreted by Nasdaq. For more information about this topic, see the first risk factor under the heading Risk Factors - Risks Related to the Ownership of Our Common Stock\u201d above.\nResults of Operations - Year ended December 31, 2019 compared to year ended December 31, 2018\nTable 144: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In thousands, except share and per share data)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>NET REVENUE\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>53,943\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>46,599\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>COST OF GOODS SOLD, EXCLUDING DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION\n</td> <td>(6,626\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4,308\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>GROSS PROFIT\n</td> <td>47,317\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>42,291\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT AND MEDICAL AFFAIRS EXPENSES\n</td> <td>10,992\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11,274\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES\n</td> <td>13,954\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>14,525\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>SALES AND MARKETING EXPENSES\n</td> <td>25,004\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23,517\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION\n</td> <td>2,641\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,645\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>OPERATING EXPENSES\n</td> <td>52,591\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>51,961\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>NET LOSS FROM OPERATIONS\n</td> <td>(5,274\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(9,670\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>INTEREST EXPENSE AND OTHER\n</td> <td>(4,869\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(4,775\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>UNREALIZED FOREIGN CURRENCY LOSS, NET\n</td> <td>(84\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(65\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>LOSS ON EARLY EXTINGUISHMENT OF DEBT\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,766\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>NET LOSS BEFORE TAXES\n</td> <td>(10,227\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(16,276\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>PROVISION FOR TAXES\n</td> <td>(216\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(106\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>NET LOSS\n</td> <td>(10,443\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(16,382\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>GAIN ON EXTINGUISHMENT OF PREFERRED STOCK\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>38,330\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>NET (LOSS) INCOME AVAILABLE TO STOCKHOLDERS\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(10,443\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>21,948\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>NET (LOSS) INCOME PER SHARE - Basic (Note 2)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(2.19\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3.74\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>WEIGHTED AVERAGE SHARES OUTSTANDING - Basic\n</td> <td>4,770,204\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,866,809\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>NET (LOSS) INCOME PER SHARE - Diluted (Note 2)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(2.19\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3.71\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>WEIGHTED AVERAGE SHARES OUTSTANDING - Diluted\n</td> <td>4,770,204\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,915,872\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenue\nWe began generating revenue from ILUVIEN in 2013. In addition to generating revenue from product sales, we intend to seek to generate revenue from other sources such as upfront fees, milestone payments in connection with collaborative or strategic relationships, and royalties resulting from the licensing of ILUVIEN or any future product candidates and other intellectual property. Additionally, revenue from our international distributors fluctuates depending on the timing of the shipment of ILUVIEN to the distributors and the distributors' sales of ILUVIEN to their customers.\nNet revenue increased by approximately $7.3 million, or 16%, to approximately $53.9 million for 2019, compared to approximately $46.6 million for 2018. The increase was primarily attributable to the new and existing markets in which we sell to our international distributors. We also increased our sales volume in the U.S. and the countries in our international segment where we sell direct.\nCost of Goods Sold, Excluding Depreciation and Amortization, and Gross Profit\nGross profit is affected by costs of goods sold, which includes costs of manufactured goods sold and royalty payments to EyePoint under the New Collaboration Agreement. Additionally, cost of goods sold by our international distributors fluctuates depending on the revenue share attributable to the respective contract.\nCost of goods sold, excluding depreciation and amortization increased by approximately $2.3 million, or 53%, to approximately $6.6 million for 2019, compared to approximately $4.3 million for 2018. The increase was primarily attributable to our increased sales volume and an increase in royalty expense payable on our global net revenue as a result of the increased royalty percentage payable to EyePoint.\nGross profit increased by approximately $5.0 million, or 12%, to approximately $47.3 million for 2019, compared to approximately $42.3 million for 2018. Gross margin was 88% and 91% for 2019 and 2018, respectively. As our revenues to our international distributors increase and our royalty expense payable to EyePoint increases, we expect our gross margin to decrease.\nResearch, Development and Medical Affairs Expenses\nCurrently, our research, development and medical affairs expenses are primarily focused on activities that support ILUVIEN and include salaries and related expenses for research and development and medical affairs personnel, including medical science liaisons. Our research, development and medical affairs expenses also include costs related to the provision of medical affairs support, including symposia development for physician education, and costs related to compliance with FDA, EEA or other regulatory requirements. We expense both internal and external development costs as they are incurred.\nResearch, development and medical affairs expenses decreased by approximately $300,000, or 3%, to approximately $11.0 million for 2019, compared to approximately $11.3 million for 2018. The decrease was primarily attributable to decreases of approximately $610,000 in clinical studies as we are approaching the termination of our ongoing clinical studies, $280,000 in stability studies and approximately $160,000 of scientific communications costs. This decrease was partially offset by increases of approximately $580,000 in consultant expenses primarily due to staff turnover, and $190,000 in safety and quality costs.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation for employees in executive and administrative functions, including finance, accounting, information technology and human resources. Other significant costs include facilities costs and professional fees for accounting and legal services, including legal services associated with obtaining and maintaining patents. We expect to continue to incur significant costs to comply with the corporate governance, internal control and similar requirements applicable to public companies.\nGeneral and administrative expenses decreased by approximately $500,000, or 3%, to approximately $14.0 million for 2019, compared to approximately $14.5 million for 2018. The decrease was primarily attributable to decreases of approximately $940,000 in non-cash stock-based compensation expenses and approximately $620,000 for a one-time non-cash accrued severance expense incurred in 2018 due to the transition of our previous chief executive officer to a consulting role. This decrease was partially offset by increases of approximately $480,000 in logistics and supply chain costs and $400,000 in legal fees; both in part are attributable to Brexit preparation.\nSales and Marketing Expenses\nSales and marketing expenses consist primarily of third-party service fees and compensation for employees for the commercial promotion, the assessment of the commercial opportunity of, the development of market awareness for, the pursuit of reimbursement approval for and the commercialization of ILUVIEN, including launch plans for ILUVIEN in new markets. Other costs include professional fees associated with developing plans for ILUVIEN or any future products or product candidates and maintaining public relations.\nSales and marketing expenses increased by approximately $1.5 million, or 6%, to approximately $25.0 million for 2019, compared to approximately $23.5 million for 2018. The increase was primarily attributable to increases of approximately $970,000 in marketing costs, the largest component of which was associated with the launch of our direct-to-patient advertising pilot program in the U.S., and approximately $240,000 in market access costs.\nOperating Expenses\nAs a result of the changes in expenses described above, total operating expenses increased by approximately $600,000, or 1%, to approximately $52.6 million for 2019, compared to approximately $52.0 million for 2018. The increase was primarily attributable to an approximately $1.5 million increase in sales and marketing expenses, partially offset by decreases of $500,000 in general and administrative expenses and $300,000 in research, development and medical affairs expenses as described above.\nInterest Expense and Other\nAs described in our Overview above, we entered into the 2018 Solar Loan Agreement on January 5, 2018, which we refinanced with the 2019 Solar Loan Agreement on December 31, 2019. For 2018 and 2019, interest expense consisted primarily of interest and amortization of deferred financing costs and debt discounts associated with our outstanding debt under the 2018 Solar Loan Agreement. Interest income consisted primarily of interest earned on our cash, cash equivalents and investments.\nInterest expense and other. Interest expense and other increased by approximately $100,000, or 2%, to approximately $4.9 million for 2019, compared to approximately $4.8 million for 2018.\nLoss on Early Extinguishment of Debt\nWe recorded a loss on early extinguishment of debt of approximately $1.8 million during 2018 as a result of our refinancing the Hercules Loan by entering into the 2018 Solar Loan Agreement on January 5, 2018. We accounted for the December 31, 2019 refinancing of the 2018 Solar Loan Agreement with the 2019 Solar Loan Agreement as a modification, and as such, we did not incur a loss on extinguishment of debt in 2019.\nGain on Extinguishment of Preferred Stock\nOn September 4, 2018, we entered into and closed a Series B Preferred Stock Exchange Agreement (Exchange Agreement) with the holders of all of the outstanding approximately 8,416 shares of Series B Preferred Stock. Under the Exchange Agreement, the holders of Series B Preferred Stock exchanged their shares of Series B Preferred Stock for an aggregate of 10,150 shares of Series C Convertible Preferred Stock, par value $0.01 per share (Series C Preferred Stock). We determined that the Exchange Agreement resulted in an extinguishment of the Series B Preferred Stock. As a result, we recognized a gain of $38,330,000 on the extinguishment of preferred stock during 2018. (See Note 13 of our notes to consolidated financial statements below.)\nBasic and Diluted Net Income (Loss) Applicable to Common Stockholders per Share of Common Stock\nWe follow FASB Accounting Standards Codification (ASC), Earnings Per Share (ASC 260), which requires the reporting of both basic and diluted earnings per share. Because our preferred stockholders participate in dividends equally with common stockholders (if we were to declare and pay dividends), we use the two-class method to calculate EPS. However, our preferred stockholders are not contractually obligated to share in losses.\nBasic EPS is computed by dividing net income (loss) available to stockholders by the weighted average number of shares outstanding for the period. Diluted EPS is calculated in accordance with ASC 260 by adjusting weighted average shares outstanding for the dilutive effect of common stock options, restricted stock units and warrants. In periods where a net loss is recorded, no effect is given to potentially dilutive securities, since the effect would be anti-dilutive.\nWe had net income available to stockholders for 2018 due to the gain on extinguishment of preferred stock. (See Note 13 of our notes to consolidated financial statements below.)\nBasic and diluted earnings per share attributable to shares of common stock and shares of preferred stock that are convertible into common stock (participating securities) are as follows:\nTable 145: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In thousands, except share and per share data)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net (loss) income available to stockholders\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(10,443\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>21,948\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Allocation of undistributed (loss) income:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Loss) income attributable to common stock\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(10,443\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>17,459\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income attributable to participating securities\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>4,489\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Basic shares:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Weighted average common shares\n</td> <td>4,770,204\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,666,856\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Weighted average participating shares\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,199,953\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total basic weighted average shares\n</td> <td>4,770,204\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,866,809\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Diluted shares:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Weighted average common shares\n</td> <td>4,770,204\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,666,856\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Dilutive weighted average shares\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>49,063\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total dilutive weighted common shares\n</td> <td>4,770,204\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,715,919\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Weighted average participating shares\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,199,953\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total dilutive weighted average shares\n</td> <td>4,770,204\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,915,872\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Basic EPS\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(2.19\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3.74\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Diluted EPS\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(2.19\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3.71\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCommon stock equivalent securities that would potentially dilute basic EPS in the future, but were not included in the computation of diluted EPS because they were either classified as participating or would have been anti-dilutive, totaled approximately 2.3 million and 0.9 million for 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nPotentially dilutive common stock equivalents are excluded from the diluted earnings per share denominator for periods of net loss because of their anti-dilutive effect. Therefore, for 2019, the weighted average shares used to calculate both basic and diluted loss per share were the same.\nResults of Operations - Segment Review\nThe following selected unaudited financial and operating data are derived from our consolidated financial statements. The results and discussions that follow reflect how executive management monitors the performance of our reporting segments.\nWe have three segments: U.S., International and Other. Each segment is separately managed and is evaluated primarily upon segment loss from operations. Non-cash items including stock-based compensation expense, depreciation and amortization are categorized as Other. We allocate certain operating expenses between our reporting segments based on activity-based costing methods. These activity-based costing methods require us to make estimates that affect the amount of each expense category that is attributed to each segment. Changes in these estimates will directly affect the amount of expense allocated to each segment and therefore the operating profit of each reporting segment. There were no significant changes in our expense allocation methodology during 2019 or 2018.\nU.S. Segment\nTable 146: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>NET REVENUE\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>32,283\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>31,966\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>COST OF GOODS SOLD, EXCLUDING DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION\n</td> <td>(3,487\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(2,875\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>GROSS PROFIT\n</td> <td>28,796\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>29,091\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT AND MEDICAL AFFAIRS EXPENSES\n</td> <td>5,943\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>6,457\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES\n</td> <td>8,449\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,147\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>SALES AND MARKETING EXPENSES\n</td> <td>17,591\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16,569\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>OPERATING EXPENSES\n</td> <td>31,983\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>31,173\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>SEGMENT LOSS FROM OPERATIONS\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(3,187\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(2,082\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nU.S. Segment - Year ended December 31, 2019 compared to year ended December 31, 2018\nNet Revenue. Net revenue increased by approximately $300,000, or 1%, to approximately $32.3 million for 2019, compared to approximately $32.0 million for 2018. The increase was primarily attributable to our increased end user demand, which increased 5% for the year ended December 31, 2019, increasing to 3,993 units compared to 3,802 units for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nCost of goods sold, excluding depreciation and amortization. Cost of goods sold, excluding depreciation and amortization increased by approximately $600,000, or 21%, to approximately $3.5 million for 2019 compared to approximately $2.9 million for 2018. The increase was primarily attributable to our increased royalty expense payable as a result of the increased royalty percentage payable to EyePoint.\nResearch, development and medical affairs expenses. Research, development and medical affairs expenses decreased by approximately $600,000, or 9%, to approximately $5.9 million for 2019, compared to approximately $6.5 million for 2018. The decrease was primarily attributable to decreases of approximately $390,000 in stability studies, $360,000 in clinical studies and $200,000 of scientific communications costs. This decrease was partially offset by an increase of approximately $360,000 in consultant costs primarily due to staff turnover.\nGeneral and administrative expenses. General and administrative expenses increased by approximately $300,000, or 4%, to approximately $8.4 million for 2019, compared to approximately $8.1 million for 2018. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in legal fees.\nSales and marketing expenses. Sales and marketing expenses increased by approximately $1.0 million, or 6%, to approximately $17.6 million for 2019, compared to approximately $16.6 million for 2018. The increase was primarily attributable to increases of approximately $800,000 in marketing costs, some of which were associated with the launch of our direct-to-patient advertising pilot program, and approximately $200,000 in market access costs.\nInternational Segment\nTable 147: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>NET REVENUE\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>21,660\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>14,633\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>COST OF GOODS SOLD, EXCLUDING DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION\n</td> <td>(3,139\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,433\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>GROSS PROFIT\n</td> <td>18,521\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13,200\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT AND MEDICAL AFFAIRS EXPENSES\n</td> <td>4,634\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,946\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES\n</td> <td>3,944\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,259\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>SALES AND MARKETING EXPENSES\n</td> <td>6,933\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>5,910\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>OPERATING EXPENSES\n</td> <td>15,511\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13,115\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>SEGMENT INCOME FROM OPERATIONS\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,010\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>85\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nInternational Segment - Year ended December 31, 2019 compared to year ended December 31, 2018\nNet Revenue. Net revenue increased by approximately $7.1 million, or 49%, to approximately $21.7 million for 2019, compared to approximately $14.6 million for 2018. The increase was primarily attributable to increased sales volume in the new and existing markets in which we sell to our international distributors. We also increased our sales volume in the countries in our international segment where we sell direct.\nCost of goods sold, excluding depreciation and amortization. Cost of goods sold, excluding depreciation and amortization increased by approximately $1.7 million, or 121%, to approximately $3.1 million for 2019, compared to approximately $1.4 million for 2018. The increase was primarily attributable to the cost of units sold associated with our increased international net revenue and royalty expense payable on our increased international net revenue as a result of the increased royalty percentage payable to EyePoint.\nResearch, development and medical affairs expenses. Research, development and medical affairs expenses increased by approximately $700,000, or 18%, to approximately $4.6 million for 2019, compared to approximately $3.9 million for 2018. The increase was primarily attributable to increases of approximately $430,000 in personnel costs and $220,000 in consultant costs.\nGeneral and administrative expenses. General and administrative expenses increased by approximately $600,000, or 18%, to approximately $3.9 million for 2019, compared to approximately $3.3 million for 2018. The increase was primarily attributable to increases of approximately $310,000 in logistics and supply chain costs, some of which are attributable to Brexit preparation, and $260,000 in legal fees.\nSales and marketing expenses. Sales and marketing expenses increased by approximately $1.0 million, or 17%, to approximately $6.9 million for 2019, compared to approximately $5.9 million for 2018. The increase was primarily attributable to increases of approximately $850,000 in personnel costs, including increased commission expense associated with our increased international net revenue, and approximately $170,000 in marketing costs.\nOther Segment\nTable 148: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2019\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2018\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(In thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT AND MEDICAL AFFAIRS EXPENSES\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>415\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>871\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES\n</td> <td>1,561\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,119\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>SALES AND MARKETING EXPENSES\n</td> <td>480\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,038\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION\n</td> <td>2,641\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,645\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>OPERATING EXPENSES\n</td> <td>5,097\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,673\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>SEGMENT LOSS FROM OPERATIONS\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(5,097\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(7,673\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur chief operating decision maker manages and evaluates our U.S. and International segments based on net loss from operations adjusted for certain non-cash items, such as stock-based compensation expense, accrued severance expenses and depreciation and amortization. Therefore, these non-cash expenses included in research, development and medical affairs expenses, general and administrative expenses, and sales and marketing expenses are classified within the Other segment within our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nWithin the respective financial statement line items included in the Other segment, stock-based compensation expense, collectively, decreased by approximately $1.9 million, or 43%, to $2.5 million for 2019, compared to $4.4 million for 2018. The decrease was primarily attributable to (a) a decrease in the average fair value of outstanding unvested options, which caused a decrease in option expense recognized in 2019, and (b) our paying cash bonuses to our non-executive employees for 2019, compared to our issuing RSUs to all employees in lieu of cash bonuses for 2018. Additionally, within general and administrative expenses we had a decrease of approximately $600,000 of one-time non-cash accrued severance expenses due to the transition of our previous chief executive officer to a consulting role; these expenses were accrued in 2018 and paid in 2019.\nDepreciation and amortization were approximately $2.6 million for both 2019 and 2018.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nSince inception, we have incurred recurring losses and negative cash flow from operations, and we have accumulated a deficit of $387.6 million through December 31, 2019. In 2018 and 2019, we funded our operations through the $40.0 million 2018 Solar Loan Agreement and an offering of common stock.\nOn January 5, 2018, we entered into the $40.0 million 2018 Solar Loan Agreement. Under that agreement, we borrowed the entire $40.0 million as a term loan that was scheduled to mature on July 1, 2022 (the 2018 Solar Loan). We used the proceeds of the 2018 Solar Loan Agreement to repay the Hercules Loan and pay related expenses. On December 31, 2019, we refinanced the 2018 Solar Loan Agreement by entering into the $45.0 million 2019 Solar Loan Agreement. Under the 2019 Solar Loan Agreement, we borrowed $42.5 million on December 31, 2019, and thereafter we borrowed the remaining $2.5 million on February 21, 2020 (the 2019 Solar Loan). The 2019 Solar Loan matures on July 1, 2024. We used the initial proceeds of the 2019 Solar Loan to pay off the 2018 Solar Loan, along with related prepayment, legal and other fees and expenses of approximately $2.3 million, which included a $1.8 million fee to Solar Capital upon repayment of the 2018 Solar Loan that was previously accrued and a $400,000 prepayment fee to Solar Capital that was capitalized as deferred financing costs. We expect to use the remaining proceeds of the 2019 Solar Loan to provide additional working capital for general corporate purposes. (See Note 11 of our notes to consolidated financial statements below.)\nOn October 24, 2019, we entered into a purchase agreement (Purchase Agreement) with Lincoln Park Capital Fund, LLC (Lincoln Park). The Purchase Agreement provided that, upon its terms and subject to its conditions and limitations, we could have directed Lincoln Park to purchase up to $20.0 million of shares of our common stock from time to time over the 36-month term of the Purchase Agreement. As consideration for Lincoln Park's commitment to purchase shares of common stock pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, on October 25, 2019 we issued to Lincoln Park 90,909 shares of our common stock (as adjusted to reflect the reverse split) for no additional consideration. On October 28, 2019, Lincoln Park purchased 133,333 shares at a price of $7.50 per share (which number of shares and per share amount have been adjusted to reflect the reverse split), for an aggregate price of $1,000,000. We terminated the Purchase Agreement effective November 12, 2019 after determining that we had no intention to conduct further sales to Lincoln Park under the Purchase Agreement.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had approximately $9.4 million in cash and cash equivalents. We may need to raise additional capital to fund our business strategy, including the continued commercialization of ILUVIEN. If we need to raise additional financing and are unable to do so, we will need to adjust our commercial plans so that we can continue to operate with our existing cash resources. The actual amount of funds that we will need will depend on many factors, some of which are beyond our control. We may need funds sooner than currently anticipated.\nWe cannot be sure that other additional financing will be available when needed or that, if available, the additional financing would be obtained on terms favorable to us or our stockholders. If we were to raise additional funds by issuing equity securities, substantial dilution to existing stockholders would likely result, and the terms of any new equity securities may have a preference over our common stock. If we were to attempt to raise additional funds through strategic collaboration agreements, we may not be successful in obtaining those agreements, or in receiving milestone or royalty payments under them. If we were to attempt to raise additional funds through debt financing, (a) the terms of the debt may involve significant cash payment obligations as well as covenants and specific financial ratios that may restrict our ability to commercialize ILUVIEN or any future products or product candidates or to operate our business; and (b) we would be required to obtain the permission or participation of Solar Capital, which we might not be able to obtain. Our capital raising efforts may be hindered by our current failure to comply with Nasdaq's continuing listing requirements, which could ultimately lead to our delisting from Nasdaq if we are unable to regain compliance. See Overview - Failure to Comply with Nasdaq Continued Listing Requirement\u201d and the first risk factor under the heading Risk Factors - Risks Related to the Ownership of Our Common Stock\u201d above. Our recurring losses and any potential needs to raise capital create substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern for the next 12 months following the issuance of the audited financial statements including in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nFor 2019, net cash used in our operations of $4.2 million was primarily due to our net loss of $10.4 million, offset by $2.6 million of non-cash depreciation and amortization, $2.5 million of non-cash stock-based compensation expense and $840,000 of non-cash interest expense associated with the amortization of our debt discount. Further reducing cash from operations was a $2.2 million increase in accounts receivable that was driven by increased revenue, a $1.0 million increase in inventory, an $830,000 increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets and a $450,000 decrease in deferred tax asset. This reduction was offset by a $1.4 million increase in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other current liabilities and a $390,000 increase in long-term liabilities.\nFor 2018, net cash used in our operations of $11.6 million was primarily due to our net loss of $16.4 million, offset by approximately $4.4 million in stock compensation expense, $2.6 million of depreciation and amortization expense, a $1.8 million charge for the loss on early extinguishment of debt and $840,000 of amortization costs associated with our debt discount. Further reducing cash from operations was a $6.0 million increase in accounts receivable that was driven by increased\nrevenue and a $930,000 increase in inventory. This reduction was offset by a $1.4 million increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses and other current liabilities.\nFor 2019, net cash used in our investing activities was approximately $174,000, which was primarily due to the purchase of equipment and software.\nFor 2018, net cash used in our investing activities was approximately $175,000, which was primarily due to the purchase of equipment and software.\nFor 2019, net cash provided by our financing activities was approximately $869,000, which was primarily due to incurring $2.5 million of additional debt by entering into the $45.0 million 2019 Solar Loan Agreement and our sale of $1.0 million of common stock to Lincoln Park. These increases in cash were offset by payments of approximately $2.3 million, which included a $1.8 million fee to Solar Capital upon repayment of the 2018 Solar Loan that was previously accrued and a $400,000 prepayment fee to Solar Capital that was capitalized as deferred financing costs.\nFor 2018, net cash provided by our financing activities was approximately $950,000, which was primarily due to entering into the $40.0 million 2018 Solar Loan Agreement, offset by paying off the $35.0 million Hercules Loan and related debt costs of $3.7 million.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements that have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate these estimates and judgments, including those described below. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. These estimates and assumptions form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results and experiences may differ materially from these estimates. We believe that the following accounting policies are the most critical to understanding and evaluating our reported financial results and affect the more significant judgments and estimates that we use to prepare our consolidated financial statements.\nRevenue Recognition\nNet Revenue\nWe sell our products to major pharmaceutical distributors, pharmacies, hospitals and wholesalers (collectively, our Customers). In addition to distribution agreements with Customers, we enter into arrangements with healthcare providers and payors that provide for government-mandated and/or privately-negotiated rebates, chargebacks, and discounts with respect to the purchase of our products. All of our current contracts have a single performance obligation, as the promise to transfer the individual goods is not separately identifiable from other promises in the contracts and is, therefore, not distinct.\nCurrently, all of our revenue is derived from product sales. We recognize revenues from product sales when the Customer obtains control, typically upon delivery. We accrue for fulfillment costs when the related revenue is recognized. Taxes collected from Customers relating to product sales and remitted to governmental authorities are excluded from revenues.\nAs of December 31, 2019 and 2018, we had received a total of $1.0 million of milestone payments in connection with our Canadian distributor that we have not recognized as revenue based on our analysis in connection with Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606). These deferred revenues are included as a component of other non-current liabilities on our balance sheets.\nEstimates of Variable Consideration\nRevenues from product sales are recorded at the net sales price (transaction price), which includes estimates of variable consideration for reserves related to statutory rebates to state Medicaid and other government agencies; commercial rebates and fees to Managed Care Organizations (MCOs), Group Purchasing Organizations (GPOs), distributors and specialty pharmacies; product returns; sales discounts (including trade discounts); distributor costs; wholesaler chargebacks; and allowances for patient assistance programs relating to sales of our products.\nThese reserves are based on estimates of the amounts earned or to be claimed on the related sales. Our estimates take into consideration historical experience, current contractual and statutory requirements, specific known market events and trends, industry data and Customer buying and payment patterns. Overall, these reserves reflect our best estimates of the amount of consideration to which we are entitled based on the terms of the contract. The amount of variable consideration included in the net sales price is limited to the amount that is probable not to result in a significant reversal in the amount of the cumulative revenue recognized in a future period. If actual results vary, we may adjust these estimates, which could have an effect on earnings in the period of adjustment.\nWith respect to our international contracts with third party distributors, certain contracts have elements of variable consideration, and management reviews those contracts on a regular basis and makes estimates of revenue based on historical ordering patterns and known market events and data. The amount of variable consideration included in net sales in each period can vary depending on the terms of these contracts and the probability of reversal in future periods.\nConsideration Payable to Customers\nDistribution service fees are payments issued to distributors for compliance with various contractually-defined inventory management practices or services provided to support patient access to a product. Distribution service fees reserves are based on the terms of each individual contract and are classified within accrued expenses and are recorded as a reduction of revenue.\nProduct Returns\nOur policies provide for product returns in the following circumstances: (a) expiration of shelf life on certain products; (b) product damaged while in the Customer's possession; and (c) following product recalls. Generally, returns for expired\nproduct are accepted three months before and up to one year after the expiration date of the related product, and the related product is destroyed after it is returned. We may either refund the sales price paid by the Customer by issuance of a credit, or exchange the returned product with replacement inventory. We typically do not provide cash refunds. We estimate the proportion of recorded revenue that will result in a return by considering relevant factors, including historical returns experience, the estimated level of inventory in the distribution channel, the shelf life of products and product recalls, if any.\nThe estimation process for product returns involves, in each case, a number of interrelating assumptions, which vary for each Customer. We estimate the amount of our product sales that may be returned by our Customers and record this estimate as a reduction of revenue from product sales in the period the related revenue is recognized, and because this returned product cannot be resold, there is no corresponding asset for product returns. To date, product returns have been minimal.\nOther Revenue\nWe enter into agreements in which we license certain rights to our products to partner companies that act as distributors. The terms of these arrangements may include payment to us of one or more of the following: non-refundable, up-front license fees; development, regulatory and commercial milestone payments; payments for manufacturing supply services we provide; and a revenue share on net sales of licensed products. Each of these payments is recognized as other revenues.\nAs part of the accounting for these arrangements, we must develop estimates that require judgment to determine the stand-alone selling price for each performance obligation identified in the contract. Performance obligations are promises in a contract to transfer a distinct good or service to the Customer, and we recognize revenue when, or as, performance obligations are satisfied. We use key assumptions to determine the stand-alone selling price; these assumptions may include forecasted revenues, development timelines, reimbursement rates for personnel costs, discount rates and probabilities of technical, regulatory and commercial success.\nCertain of these agreements include consideration in the form of milestone payments. At the inception of each arrangement that includes milestone payments, we evaluate the recognition of milestone payments. Typically, milestone payments are associated with events that are not entirely within our control or the licensee, such as regulatory approvals; are included in the transaction price; and are subject to a constraint until it is probable that there will not be a significant revenue reversal, typically upon achievement of the milestone. At the end of each reporting period, we re-evaluate the probability of achievement of such milestones and any related constraint, and if necessary, adjust our estimate of the overall transaction price.\nCustomer Payment Obligations\nWe receive payments from our Customers based on billing schedules established in each contract, which vary across locations, but generally range between 30 to 120 days. Occasionally, we offer extended payment terms or payment term discounts to certain customers. Amounts are recorded as accounts receivable when our right to consideration is unconditional. We do not assess whether a contract has a significant financing component if the expectation is that our Customer will pay for the product or services within one year or less of receiving those products or services.\nAdditional Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nResearch and Development Costs\nResearch and development expenditures are expensed as incurred, pursuant to ASC 730, Research and Development. Costs to license technology to be used in our research and development are expensed when incurred. Payments to licensors that relate to the achievement of preapproval development milestones are recorded as research and development expense when incurred.\nClinical Trial Prepaid and Accrued Expenses\nWe record prepaid assets and accrued liabilities related to clinical trials associated with contract research organizations (CROs), clinical trial investigators and other vendors based upon amounts paid and the estimated amount of work completed on each clinical trial. The financial terms of agreements vary from vendor to vendor and may result in uneven payment flows. As such, if we have advanced funds exceeding our estimate of the work completed, we record a prepaid asset. If our estimate of the work completed exceeds the amount paid, we record an accrued liability. All such costs are charged to research and development expenses based on these estimates. Our estimates may or may not match the actual services performed by the organizations as determined by patient enrollment levels and related activities. We monitor patient enrollment levels and related activities to the extent possible through internal reviews, correspondence and discussions with our CROs and review of contractual terms. However, if we have incomplete or inaccurate information, we may underestimate or overestimate activity levels associated with various clinical trials at a given point in time. In this event, we could record significant research and development expenses in future periods when the actual level of activities becomes known. To date, we have not experienced material changes in these estimates. Additionally, we do not expect material adjustments to research and development expenses\nto result from changes in the nature and level of clinical trial activity and related expenses that are currently subject to estimation. In the future, as we expand our clinical trial activities, we expect to have increased levels of research and development costs that will be subject to estimation.\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe have stock-based compensation under which various types of equity-based awards may be granted, including restricted stock units (RSUs) and stock options, to employees, directors and consultants. The exercise prices of stock options generally equal the fair values of our common stock at the dates of grant. We recognize compensation cost for all stock-based awards based on the grant date fair value in accordance with the provisions of ASC 718, Compensation - Stock Compensation. We recognize the grant date fair value as compensation cost of employee stock-based awards using the straight-line method over the actual vesting period, adjusted for our estimates of forfeiture. Typically, we grant stock options with a requisite service period of four years from the grant date. We have elected to use the Black-Scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock-based awards.\nWe concluded that this was the most appropriate method by which to value our share-based payment arrangements, but if any share-based payment instruments should be granted for which the Black-Scholes method does not meet the measurement objective as stated within ASC 718, we will use a more appropriate method for valuing that instrument. However, we do not believe that any instruments granted to date and accounted for under ASC 718 would require a method other than the Black-Scholes method.\nOur determination of the fair market value of share-based payment awards on the grant date using option valuation models requires the input of highly subjective assumptions, including the expected price volatility and option life. Changes in these input variables would affect the amount of expense associated with equity-based compensation. Expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of our common stock over the expected term of the stock option grant. To estimate the expected term, we use the simplified\u201d method for plain vanilla\u201d options as discussed within the SEC's Statement of Accounting Bulletin (SAB) 107. We believe that all factors listed within SAB 107 as pre-requisites for utilizing the simplified method are true for us and for our share-based payment arrangements. We intend to use the simplified method for the foreseeable future until more detailed information about exercise behavior will be more widely available. The risk-free interest rate is based on U.S. Treasury Daily Treasury Yield Curve Rates corresponding to the expected life assumed at the date of grant. Dividend yield is zero as there are no payments of dividends made or expected.\nIncome Taxes\nWe recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of our assets and liabilities in accordance with ASC 740, Income Taxes. We evaluate the positive and negative evidence bearing upon the realizability of our deferred tax assets on an annual basis. Significant management judgment is involved in determining the provision for income taxes, deferred tax assets and liabilities, and any valuation allowance recorded against net deferred tax assets. Due to uncertainties with respect to the realization of our U.S. deferred tax assets resulting from our history of operating losses, we have established a valuation allowance against our U.S. deferred tax asset balances to reduce the net carrying value to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized. As a result, we have fully reserved against the U.S. deferred tax asset balances. The valuation allowances are based on our estimates of taxable income in the jurisdictions in which we operate and the period over which deferred tax assets will be recoverable. If actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods, a change in the valuation allowance may be needed, which could materially impact our financial position and results of operations.\nOur deferred tax assets primarily consist of net operating loss (NOL) carry-forwards. As of December 31, 2019, we had federal NOL carry-forwards of approximately $125.8 million and state NOL carry-forwards of approximately $173.0 million, respectively, subject to further limitation based upon the final results of our Internal Revenue Code (IRC) sections 382 and 383 analyses. These NOLs are available to reduce future income otherwise taxable. If not utilized, the federal NOL carry-forwards will expire at various dates between 2029 and 2037, our federal NOL created in 2018 will carry forward indefinitely and the state NOL carry-forwards will expire at various dates between 2020 and 2038.\nSections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code limit the annual use of NOL carry-forwards and tax credit carry-forwards, respectively, following an ownership change. NOL carry-forwards may be subject to annual limitations under IRC Section 382 (Section 382) (or comparable provisions of state law) if certain changes in ownership were to occur. We periodically evaluate our NOL carry-forwards and whether certain changes in ownership have occurred that would limit our ability to utilize a portion of our NOL carry-forwards. If we determine that significant ownership changes have occurred since we generated our NOL carry-forwards, we may be subject to annual limitations on the use of these NOL carry-forwards under Section 382 (or comparable provisions of state law). We have determined that a Section 382 change in ownership occurred in late 2015. As a result of this change in ownership, we estimated that approximately $18.6 million of our federal NOLs and\napproximately $382,000 of federal tax credits generated prior to the change in ownership will not be utilized in the future. We are currently in the process of refining and finalizing these calculations, and upon finalization, will determine if a write-off is necessary. The reduction to our NOL deferred tax asset due to the annual Section 382 limitation and the NOL carryforward period would result in an offsetting reduction in valuation allowance recorded against the NOL deferred tax asset.\nIf we were to determine that we are able to realize any of our net deferred tax assets in the future, we would adjust the valuation allowance to increase net income in the period in which we make that determination. We believe that the most significant uncertainty affecting the determination of our valuation allowance will be our estimation of the extent and timing of future net income, if any.\nWe considered our income tax positions for uncertainty in accordance with ASC 740. The balance of unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 are approximately $58,000 and $68,000, respectively. Both balances relate to research and development tax credits. In accordance with ASC 740-10, such attributes are reduced to the amount that is expected to be recognized in the future. We do not accrue interest or penalties, as there is no risk of additional tax liability due to significant NOLs available. We do not expect any decreases to the unrecognized tax benefits within the next twelve months due to any lapses in statute of limitations. Tax years from 2015 to 2018 remain subject to examination in California, Georgia, Kentucky, New Jersey, Tennessee, Texas and on the federal level, provided that assessment of NOL carry-forwards available for use can be examined for all years since 2009. The statute of limitations on these years will close when the NOLs expire or when the statute closes on the years in which we use the NOLs.\nForeign Currency Translation\nThe U.S. dollar is the functional currency of Alimera Sciences, Inc. The Euro is the functional currency for the majority of our subsidiaries operating outside of the U.S.\nOur foreign currency assets and liabilities are remeasured into U.S. dollars at end-of-period exchange rates, except for nonmonetary balance sheet accounts, which are remeasured at historical exchange rates. Revenue and expenses are remeasured at average exchange rates in effect during each period, except for those expenses related to the non-monetary balance sheet amounts, which are remeasured at historical exchange rates. Gains or losses from foreign currency remeasurement are included in income.\nThe financial statements of the foreign subsidiaries whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar have been translated into U.S. dollars in accordance with ASC 830-30, Translation of Financial Statements. For the subsidiaries operating outside of the U.S. that are denominated in the Euro, assets and liabilities are translated at end-of-period rates while revenues and expenses are translated at average rates in effect during the period in which the activity took place. Equity is translated at historical rates and the resulting cumulative translation adjustments are included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe do not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, that would have been established to facilitate off-balance sheet arrangements (as that term is defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of SEC Regulation S-K) or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. As such, we are not exposed to any financing, liquidity, market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in those types of relationships. We enter into guarantees in the ordinary course of business related to the guarantee of our own performance and the performance of our subsidiaries.\nNew Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 2 of our notes to consolidated financial statements below for a description of recent accounting pronouncements, including the expected dates of adoption and expected effects on results of operations and financial condition, if known."}
