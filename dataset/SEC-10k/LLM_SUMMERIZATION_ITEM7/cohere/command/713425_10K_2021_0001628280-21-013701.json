MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with Item 8. Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d. This discussion contains forward-looking statements relating to our future financial performance, business strategy, financing plans and other future events that involve uncertainties and risks. You can identify these statements by forward-looking words such as anticipate,\u201d intend,\u201d plan,\u201d continue,\u201d could,\u201d grow,\u201d may,\u201d potential,\u201d predict,\u201d strive,\u201d estimate,\u201d believe,\u201d expect\u201d and similar expressions that convey uncertainty of future events or outcomes. Any forward-looking statements herein are made pursuant to the safe harbor provision of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Our actual results could differ materially from the results anticipated by these forward-looking statements as a result of many known and unknown factors that are beyond our ability to control or predict, including but not limited to those discussed above in Risk Factors\u201d and elsewhere in this report. See also Special Cautionary Notice Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d at the beginning of Item 1. Business.\u201d\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nWe have based the following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations on our consolidated financial statements, which we have prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2021, describes the significant accounting policies that we have used in preparing our consolidated financial statements. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including, but not limited to, those related to revenue/collectability. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Our actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nWe believe the critical accounting policies listed below affect significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the financial statements.\nRevenue Recognition.\nLicense. Our perpetual software licenses provide the customer with a right to use the software as it exists at the time of purchase. We recognize revenue for distinct software licenses once the license period has begun and we have made the software available to the customer.\nOur perpetual software licenses are sold with maintenance under which we provide customers with telephone consulting, product updates on a when and if available basis, and releases of new versions of products previously purchased by the customer, as well as error reporting and correction services.\nSubscription. Subscription fees include Software-as-a-Service (\"SaaS\") revenue for the right to use the software for a limited period of time in an environment hosted by the Company or by a third party. The customer accesses and uses the software on an as needed basis over the Internet or via a dedicated line; however, the customer has no right to take delivery of the software. The underlying arrangements typically include a single fee for the service that is billed monthly, quarterly or annually. The Company's SaaS solutions represent a series of distinct services that are substantially the same and have the same pattern of transfer to the customer. Revenue from a SaaS solution is generally recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement.\nProfessional Services and Other. Our professional services revenue consists of fees generated from consulting, implementation and training services, including reimbursements of out-pocket expenses in connection with our services. These services are typically optional to our customers, and are distinct from our software. Fees for our professional services are separately priced and are generally billed on an hourly basis, and revenue is recognized over time as the services are performed. We believe the output method of hours worked provides the best depiction of the transfer of our services since the customer is receiving the benefit from our services as the work is performed. Reimbursements received from customers for out-of-pocket expenses were recorded in revenue and totaled approximately $20,000, $1.5 million, and $1.4 million for 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nMaintenance and Support. Revenue is derived from maintenance and support services, under which we provide customers with telephone consulting, product updates on a when and if available basis, and releases of new versions of products previously purchased by the customer, as well as error reporting and correction services. Maintenance for perpetual licenses is renewable, generally on an annual basis, at the option of the customer. Maintenance terms typically range from one to three years. Revenue related to maintenance is generally paid in advance and recognized ratably over the term of the agreement since the Company is standing ready to provide a series of maintenance services that are substantially the same each period over the term; therefore, time is the best measure of progress. Support services for subscriptions are included in the subscription fees and are recognized as a component of such fees.\nIndirect Channel Revenue. We record revenue from sales made through the indirect sales channels on a gross basis, because we control the goods or services and act as the principal in the transaction. In reaching this determination, we evaluate sales through our indirect channel on a case-by-case basis and consider a number of factors including indicators of control such as the party having the primary responsibility to provide specified goods or services, and the party having discretion in establishing prices.\nSales Taxes. We account for sales taxes collected from customers on a net basis.\nSignificant Judgments. Many of our contracts include multiple performance obligations. Our products and services generally do not require a significant amount of integration or interdependency; therefore, our products and services are generally not combined. We allocate the transaction price for each contract to each performance obligation based on the relative standalone selling price (SSP) for each performance obligation within each contract.\nWe use judgment in determining the SSP for products and services. For substantially all performance obligations except on-premise licenses, we are able to establish SSP based on the observable prices of products or services sold separately in comparable circumstances to similar customers. We typically establish an SSP range for our products and services which is reassessed on a periodic basis or when facts and circumstances change. Our on-premise licenses have not historically been sold on a standalone basis, as the vast majority of all customers elect to purchase on-premise license support contracts at the time of a on-premise license purchase. Support contracts are generally priced as a percentage of the net fees paid by the customer to access the on-premise license. We are unable to establish the SSP for our on-premise licenses based on observable prices given the same products are sold for a broad range of amounts (that is, the selling price is highly variable) and a representative SSP is not discernible from past transactions or other observable evidence. As a result, the SSP for a on-premise license included in a contract with multiple performance obligations is determined by applying a residual approach whereby all other performance obligations within a contract are first allocated a portion of the transaction price based upon their respective SSPs, with any residual amount of transaction price allocated to on-premise license revenue.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following table sets forth certain revenue and expense items as a percentage of total revenue for the three years ended April 30, 2021, 2020, and 2019 and the percentage increases and decreases in those items for the years ended April 30, 2021 and 2020:\nTable 14: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Percentage of Total Revenue </td> <td> </td> <td>Pct.

meaningful\nEconomic Overview and Significant Trends in Our Business\nFor fiscal 2022, we expect the global economy to improve modestly when compared to recent periods. We believe information technology spending will incrementally improve over the long term as increased global competition forces companies to improve productivity by upgrading their technology systems, which could result in an improved selling environment. Although this improvement could slow or regress at any time, due in part to concerns related to the effects of the spread of the global virus and trade conflicts on global capital markets and general economic conditions, we believe that our organizational and financial structure will enable us to take advantage of any sustained economic rebound. While we do not expect that the COVID-19 pandemic will cause any material adverse changes on our business or financial results for fiscal 2022, we are unable to accurately predict the impact that the coronavirus will have due to various uncertainties, including the ultimate geographic spread of the virus, the severity of the disease, the duration of the outbreak, and actions that may be taken by governmental authorities. Customers continue to take long periods to evaluate discretionary software purchases.\nCorporate capital spending trends and commitments are the primary determinants of the size of the market for business software. Corporate capital spending is, in turn, a function of general economic conditions in the U.S. and abroad and in particular may be affected by conditions in U.S. and global credit markets. In recent years, the weakness in the overall global economy and the U.S. economy has resulted in reduced expenditures in the business software market.\nIn April 2021, the International Monetary Fund ( IMF\u201d) provided an update to the World Economic Outlook for the 2021 and 2022 world economic growth forecast. The update noted that, High uncertainty surrounds the global economic outlook, primarily related to the path of the pandemic. The contraction of activity in 2020 was unprecedented in living memory in its speed and synchronized nature. But it could have been a lot worse. Although difficult to pin down precisely, IMF staff estimates suggest that the contraction could have been three times as large if not for extraordinary policy support. Much remains to be done to beat back the pandemic and avoid divergence in income per capita across economies and persistent increases in inequality within countries.\nAfter an estimated contraction of -3.3 percent in 2020, the global economy is projected to grow at 6 percent in 2021, moderating to 4.4 percent in 2022. The contraction for 2020 is 1.1 percentage points smaller than projected in the October 2020 World Economic Outlook (WEO), reflecting the higher-than-expected growth out turns in the second half of the year for most regions after lockdowns were eased and as economies adapted to new ways of working. The projections for 2021 and 2022 are 0.8 percentage point and 0.2 percentage point stronger than in the October 2020 WEO, reflecting additional fiscal support in a few large economies and the anticipated vaccine-powered recovery in the second half of the year.\u201d\nAs the economy improves from the COVID-19 decline, we believe that the recovery may drive some businesses to invest in achieving more process and efficiency enhancements in their operations and to invest in solutions that improve operating margins, rather than make large infrastructure-type technology purchases. If this trend continues, we believe it may tend to favor our supply chain solutions, which are designed to provide a more rapid return on investment and are targeted at some of the largest profit drivers in a customer's business. While the recent difficult economic environment has had a particularly adverse impact on the weaker companies in our target markets, we believe a large percentage of our customers are seeking to make investments to strengthen their operations, and some are taking advantage of current economic conditions to gain market share. We have taken steps to best ensure the health and safety of our employees globally. Our daily execution has evolved into a largely virtual model, and we continue to find innovative ways to engage with customers and prospects, ensuring that they are supported as they navigate through this unprecedented period.\nBusiness Opportunities and Risks\nWe currently view the following factors as the primary opportunities and risks associated with our business:\n\u2022Dependence on Capital Spending Patterns. There is risk associated with our dependence on the capital spending patterns of U.S. and international businesses, which in turn are functions of economic trends and conditions over which we have no control.\n\u2022Acquisition Opportunities. There are opportunities for selective acquisitions or investments to expand our sales distribution channels and/or broaden our product offering by providing additional solutions for our target markets.\n\u2022Acquisition Risks. There are risks associated with acquisitions of complementary companies, products and technologies, including the risks that we will not achieve the financial and strategic goals that we contemplate at the time of the transaction. More specifically, in any acquisition we will face risks and challenges associated with the uncertain value of the acquired business or assets, the difficulty of assimilating operations and personnel, integrating acquired technologies and products and maintaining the loyalty of the customers of the acquired business.\n\u2022Competitive Technologies. There is a risk that our competitors may develop technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to our technology.\n\u2022Competition in General. There are risks inherent in the market for business application software and related services, which has been and continues to be intensely competitive; for example, some of our competitors may become more aggressive with their prices and/or payment terms, which may adversely affect our profit margins.\nFor more information, please see Risk Factors\u201d in Item 1A. above.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nFor information with respect to recent accounting pronouncements, if any, and the impact of these pronouncements on our consolidated financial statements, if any, see Note 1(n) of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-K.\nMarket Conditions by Operating Segment\nWe operate and manage our business in three segments based on software and services provided in three key product markets: (1) SCM, which provides collaborative supply chain solutions to streamline and optimize the production, distribution and management of products between trading partners; (2) IT Consulting, which consists of IT staffing and consulting services; and (3) Other, which consists of (i) American Software ERP, a provider of purchasing and materials management, customer order processing, financial, human resources, and manufacturing solutions, and (ii) unallocated corporate overhead expenses. The SCM segment includes the businesses of Logility and DMI.\nOur SCM segment experienced a 5% decrease in revenue during fiscal 2021 when compared to fiscal 2020, primarily due to a 60% decrease in license fees, a 17% decrease in professional services and other revenue and an 8% decrease in maintenance revenue partially offset by a 31% increase in subscription fees. Our SCM segment experienced a 10% increase in revenue during fiscal 2020 when compared to fiscal 2019, primarily due to a 57% increase in subscription fees, a 12% increase in professional services and other revenue and a 5% increase in license fees partially offset by a 5% decrease in maintenance revenue.\nOur IT Consulting segment experienced an approximately 6% increase in revenue in fiscal 2021 when compared to fiscal 2020 and a 10% decrease in revenue in fiscal 2020 when compared to fiscal 2019, due primarily to fluctuations in IT staffing work at our largest customer. As companies have moved to cut costs and limit IT budgets, they have utilized more outsourcing services, which tend to be more cost effective for them. In the past, this trend has resulted in increased business for this segment. However, there is a countervailing trend to outsource IT to international markets that historically have been more price competitive than domestic sources like us. Our largest consulting customer comprised 29% of our IT Consulting revenue in fiscal 2021, 33% in fiscal 2020 and 47% in fiscal 2019. The loss of this customer would negatively and materially affect our IT Consulting business.\nThe Other segment revenue decreased 14% in fiscal 2021 when compared to fiscal 2020, primarily due to a 93% decrease in license fees, a 13% decrease in professional services and other revenue and a 1% decrease in maintenance revenue. The Other segment revenue increased 2% in fiscal 2020 when compared to fiscal 2019, primarily due to a 70% increase in license fees and a 4% increase in professional services and other revenue, partially offset by a 6% decrease in maintenance revenue.\nREVENUE\nTable 15: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Years Ended April 30, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>% Change </td> <td> </td> <td>% of Total Revenue </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2021 vs. 2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 vs. 2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Subscription fees </td> <td>$ </td> <td>28,877 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>22,033 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>14,026 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>31 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>57 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>26 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>19 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>13 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>License fees </td> <td>2,993 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,582 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,126 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(61) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>6 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>3 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>7 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>6 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Professional service and other </td> <td>39,616 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>42,774 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>42,154 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(7) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>1 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>35 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>37 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>39 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Maintenance </td> <td>39,922 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>43,077 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>45,400 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(7) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>(5) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>36 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>37 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>42 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Total revenue </td> <td>$ </td> <td>111,408 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>115,466 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>108,706 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(4) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>6 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>100 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>100 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>100 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor the year ended April 30, 2021, the 4% decrease in total revenue was attributable primarily to a 61% decrease in license revenue, a 7% decrease in professional services and other revenue and a 7% decrease in maintenance revenue partially offset by a 31% increase in subscription fees revenue.\nFor the year ended April 30, 2020, the 6% increase in total revenue was attributable primarily to a 57% increase in subscription fees revenue, a 6% increase in license revenue and a 1% increase in professional services and other revenue, partially offset by a 5% decrease in maintenance revenue.\nDue to intensely competitive markets, we discount subscription and license fees from our published list price due to pricing pressure in our industry. Numerous factors contribute to the amount of the discounts provided, such as previous customer purchases, the number of customer sites utilizing the software, the number of modules purchased and the number of users, the type of platform deployment, as well as the overall size of the contract. While all these factors affect the discount amount of a particular contract, the overall percentage discount has not materially changed in the recent reported fiscal periods.\nThe change in our revenue from period to period is primarily due to the volume of products and related services sold in any period and the amounts of products or modules purchased with each sale.\nInternational revenue represented approximately 15% of total revenue for the year ended April 30, 2021, 19% of total revenue for the year ended April 30, 2020, and 20% for the year ended April 30, 2019. Our international revenue may fluctuate substantially from period to period primarily because we derive these revenue from a relatively small number of customers.\nSubscription Fees Revenue\nTable 16: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Years Ended April 30, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>% Change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2021 vs. 2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 vs. 2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Supply Chain Management </td> <td>$ </td> <td>28,877 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>22,033 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>14,026 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>31 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>57 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total subscription fees revenue </td> <td>$ </td> <td>28,877 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>22,033 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>14,026 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>31 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>57 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor the year ended April 30, 2021, subscription fee revenue increased by 31% when compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to an increase in Cloud Services Annual Contract Value (\"ACV\") of approximately 53% to $26.4 million compared to $17.3 million in the same period of the prior year. This increase was attributable to an increase in the number of contracts, contracts with a higher Cloud Services ACV, as well as an increase in the value of multi-year contracts (typically three to five years). This is evidence of our successful transition to the cloud subscription model. ACV is a forward-looking operating measure used by management to better understand Cloud Services (SaaS and other related cloud services) revenue trends within our business, as it reflects our current estimate of revenue to be generated under existing client contracts in the forward 12-month period.\nLicense Fees Revenue\nTable 17: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Years Ended April 30, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>% Change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2021 vs. 2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 vs. 2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Supply Chain Management </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,977 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>7,354 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>6,992 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(60) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>5 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other </td> <td>16 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>228 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>134 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(93) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>70 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total license fees revenue </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,993 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>7,582 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>7,126 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(61) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>6 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor the year ended April 30, 2021, license fee revenue decreased by 61% when compared to the previous year. Our Other business segment experienced a 93% decrease in license fees for the year ended April 30, 2021 when compared to the same period in the prior year due to the timing of selling into the installed customer base. Our SCM segment experienced a 60% decrease in license fees primarily due to a decrease in the number of new customers choosing to deploy our software on-premise this year. We anticipate that the majority of future license fee sales will be to existing on-premise customers for add-on expansion. The SCM segment constituted 99%, 97% and 98% of our total license fee revenue for the years ended April 30, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nFor the year ended April 30, 2020, license fee revenue increased by 6% when compared to the previous year. Our Other business segment experienced a 70% increase in license fees for the year ended April 30, 2020 when compared to the same period in the prior year due to the timing of selling into the installed customer base. SCM experienced a 5% increase in license fees primarily due to a few new customers choosing to deploy our software on-premise. SCM constituted 97% and 98% of our total license fee revenue for the years ended April 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nThe direct sales channel provided approximately 83% of license fee revenue for the year ended April 30, 2021, compared to approximately 92% in fiscal 2020 and 84% in fiscal 2019. The decrease in direct license fees from fiscal 2020 to fiscal 2021 was largely due to one large license fee deal to a new customer last year compared to none this year. The increase in direct license fees from fiscal 2019 to fiscal 2020 was largely due to our indirect channel selling proportionately more SaaS than license contracts compared to our direct channel.\nFor the year ended April 30, 2021, our margins after commissions on direct sales were approximately 84%, and our margins after commissions on indirect sales were approximately 58%. For the year ended April 30, 2020, our margins after commissions on\ndirect sales were approximately 88%, and our margins after commissions on indirect sales were approximately 53%. For the year ended April 30, 2019, our margins after commissions on direct sales were approximately 87%, and our margins after commissions on indirect sales were approximately 55%. The margins after commissions for direct sales were relatively consistent, between 84% to 88%, while the range for indirect sales had a wider spread of 53% to 58%. The indirect channel margins for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2021 increased when compared to the same periods in the prior year due to the mix of value-added reseller ( VAR\u201d) commission rates. DMI is responsible for the bulk of our indirect sales and the commission percentage varies based on whether the sale is domestic or international.\nProfessional Services and Other Revenue\nTable 18: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Years Ended April 30, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>% Change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2021 vs. 2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 vs. 2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Supply Chain Management </td> <td>$ </td> <td>19,713 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>23,782 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>21,190 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(17) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>12 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>IT Consulting </td> <td>19,036 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17,997 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>20,007 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>(10) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other </td> <td>867 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>995 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>957 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(13) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>4 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total professional services and other revenue </td> <td>$ </td> <td>39,616 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>42,774 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>42,154 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(7) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>1 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe 7% decrease in total professional services and other revenue for the year ended April 30, 2021 was due to a 17% decrease in our SCM segment professional services due primarily due to lower implementation project work resulting from lower subscription and license fee sales in the first three quarters of fiscal 2021, combined with a 13% decrease in our Other segment due to lower utilization from project implementation services and services activity. This increase was partially offset by a 6% increase in our IT consulting segment due to the timing of project work.\nThe 1% increase in total professional services and other revenue for the year ended April 30, 2020 was due to a 12% increase from our SCM segment due primarily due to a ramp up of implementation project work resulting from increased subscription and license fee sales in recent periods, combined with a 4% increase in our Other segment due to utilization from project implementation services and services revenue. This increase was partially offset by an 10% decrease in our IT consulting segment due to the timing of project work.\nIn our software segments, we have observed that there is a tendency for professional services and other revenue to lag changes in license revenue by one to three quarters, as new licenses in one quarter often involve implementation and consulting services in subsequent quarters, for which we recognize revenue only as we perform those services.\nMaintenance Revenue\nTable 19: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Years Ended April 30, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>% Change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2021 vs. 2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 vs. 2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Supply Chain Management </td> <td>$ </td> <td>38,701 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>41,848 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>44,088 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(8) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>(5) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other </td> <td>1,221 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,229 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,312 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>(6) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total maintenance revenue </td> <td>$ </td> <td>39,922 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>43,077 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>45,400 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(7) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>(5) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe 7% decrease in total maintenance revenue for the year ended April 30, 2021 was due to a 1% decrease in our Other segment due to fewer customer renewals and an 8% decrease in maintenance revenue from our SCM segment due to normal customer attrition and customers converting from on-premise support to our SaaS cloud platform.\nThe 5% decrease in total maintenance revenue for the year ended April 30, 2020 was due to a 6% decrease in our Other segment due to fewer customer renewals and a 5% decrease in maintenance revenue from our SCM segment due to normal customer attrition.\nThe SCM segment's maintenance revenue constituted 97% of total maintenance revenue for the years ended April 30, 2021, 2021, 2020 and 2019.

The total gross margin percentage for the year ended April 30, 2020 increased to 55% when compared to the same period in the prior year due to increases in gross margin percentage for license fees, professional services and other gross margins and maintenance gross margins, partially offset by a decrease in subscription fees margins.\nGross Margin on Subscription Fees\nFor the year ended April 30, 2021, our gross margin percentage on subscription fees increased from 57% in fiscal 2020 to 59% primarily due to an increase in subscription revenue and lower capitalized software amortization expense.\nFor the year ended April 30, 2020, our gross margin percentage on subscription fees decreased from 59% in fiscal 2019 to 57% primarily due to an increase in capitalized software amortization expense.\nGross Margin on License Fees\nThe decrease in license fee gross margin percentage for the year ended April 30, 2021 when compared to fiscal 2020 was primarily due to lower license fee revenue.\nThe increase in license fee gross margin percentage for the year ended April 30, 2020 when compared to fiscal 2019 was primarily due to lower agent commission and amortization of intangibles expense and to a lesser extent higher license fee revenue.\nLicense fee gross margin percentage tends to be directly related to the level of license fee revenue due to the relatively fixed cost of capitalized software amortization expense, amortization of acquired software and the sales mix between our direct and indirect channels.\nGross Margin on Professional Services and Other\nFor the year ended April 30, 2021, our gross margin percentage on professional services and other decreased from 28% in fiscal 2020 to 27% primarily because our IT Consulting segment professional services and other revenue gross margin decreased from 18% in fiscal 2020 to 17% in fiscal 2021 due to a decrease in project utilization rates. Our other segment decreased from 53% in fiscal 2020 to 41% in fiscal 2021 due to a slower ramp up of project work. Our SCM segment professional services and other gross margin was 35% for both fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020.\nFor the year ended April 30, 2020, our gross margin percentage on professional services and other increased from 25% in fiscal 2019 to 28% due to increased gross margins in our SCM segment which increased from 28% in fiscal 2019 to 35% in fiscal 2020 due to increased revenue and higher billing utilization. Our IT Consulting segment professional services and other revenue\ngross margin decreased from 22% in fiscal 2019 to 18% in fiscal 2020 due to a decrease in project related billing. Our other segment increased from 47% in fiscal 2019 to 53% in fiscal 2020 due to improved billing utilization rates.\nAs discussed above, our IT Consulting segment typically has lower margins when compared to the Other segments that have higher margin implementation service revenue. The IT Consulting segment was 48%, 42% and 47% of the Company's professional services and other revenue in fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Our SCM segment was 50%, 56% and 50% of the Company's professional services and other revenue in fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Our Other segment was 2%, 2% and 3% of the Company's professional services and other revenue in fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nGross Margin on Maintenance\nMaintenance gross margin decreased to 81% in fiscal 2021 from 83% in fiscal 2020 due to lower maintenance revenue cost containment efforts. The primary cost component is maintenance staffing, which is relatively inelastic in the short term.\nMaintenance gross margin increased to 83% in fiscal 2020 from 82% in fiscal 2019 due to cost containment efforts. The primary cost component is maintenance staffing, which is relatively inelastic in the short term.\nEXPENSES\nTable 21: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>

2021, gross product research and development costs and capitalized software development costs decreased by 5% primarily due to a decrease in headcount from third-party contractors compared to fiscal 2020. Capitalized software development costs decreased in fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 due to the timing of project work and an increase in agile software programming that accelerates the software releases to weeks from months. We expect capitalized software to be\nimmaterial in fiscal 2022. Amortization of capitalized software development decreased 28% in fiscal 2021 when compared to fiscal 2020 as some projects were fully amortized.\nFor the year ended April 30, 2020, gross product research and development costs and capitalized software development costs decreased by 3% primarily due to a decrease in headcount from third-party contractors compared to fiscal 2019. Capitalized software development costs decreased in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 due to the timing of project work. Amortization of capitalized software development increased 27% in fiscal 2020 when compared to fiscal 2019 due to the timing of project releases.\nSales and Marketing\nFor the year ended April 30, 2021, the decrease in sales and marketing expenses compared to fiscal 2020 was due primarily to lower marketing spend, including a reduction in trade shows and conferences and lower travel costs due to COVID-19. Fiscal 2021 was impacted by COVID-19 for the entire year versus fiscal 2020.\nFor the year ended April 30, 2020, the increase in sales and marketing expenses compared to fiscal 2019 was due primarily to an increase in headcount, higher variable compensation, higher sales commissions, an increase in contractor costs and an increase in recruiting fees, which was partially offset by lower marketing spend and lower travel costs due to COVID-19.\nGeneral and Administrative\nFor the year ended April 30, 2021, general and administrative expenses remained relatively flat when compared to fiscal 2020 primarily due to a reduction in variable compensation, legal fees and cost containment efforts of overhead costs, partially offset by an increase in insurance and benefit expenses.\nFor the year ended April 30, 2020, the increase in general and administrative expenses compared to fiscal 2019 was primarily due to higher variable compensation and higher overhead costs and, to a lesser extent, higher legal, stock option and insurance costs.\nThe total number of employees was 424 on April 30, 2021, 428 on April 30, 2020 and 424 on April 30, 2019.\nAmortization of Acquisition-related Intangible Assets\nFor the year ended April 30, 2021, we recorded $0.8 million in intangible amortization expense, of which $0.2 million is included in operating expenses and $0.6 million is included in cost of license fees.\nFor the year ended April 30, 2020, we recorded $1.6 million in intangible amortization expense, of which $0.3 million is included in operating expenses and $1.3 million is included in cost of license fees.\nOperating Income/(Loss)\nTable 23: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Years Ended April 30, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>% Change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2021 vs. 2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 vs. 2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Supply Chain Management </td> <td>$ </td> <td>18,922 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>19,612 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>15,967 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(4) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>23 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>IT Consulting </td> <td>456 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>332 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>964 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>37 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>(66) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other* </td> <td>(15,017) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(13,896) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(11,655) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>19 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Operating Income </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,361 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>6,048 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,276 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(28) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>15 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\n______________\n* Includes certain unallocated expenses.\nOur SCM segment operating income decreased by 4% in fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 primarily due to a 5% decrease in revenue. Our SCM segment operating income increased by 23% in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 primarily due to a 10% increase in revenue.\nOur IT Consulting segment operating income increased 37% in fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 primarily due to a 6% increase in revenue due to the type of project billing. Our IT Consulting segment operating income decreased 66% in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 primarily due to a decrease in revenue and lower gross margins due to the type of project billing.\nThe increase in the Other segment operating loss in fiscal 2021 when compared to fiscal 2020 was due primarily to a 14% decrease in revenue and an increase in variable compensation and benefit costs. The increase in the Other segment operating loss in fiscal 2020 when compared to fiscal 2019 was due primarily to an increase in variable compensation and overhead costs, partially offset by a 2% increase in revenue in fiscal 2020.\nOther Income\nOther income is comprised of net interest and dividend income, rental income net of related depreciation expenses, exchange rate gains and losses, realized and unrealized gains and losses from investments. Other income was approximately $4.5 million in the year ended April 30, 2021 compared to $0.8 million in fiscal 2020. The increase was primarily due to unrealized gains of $3.6 million in fiscal 2021 compared to unrealized losses of $0.1 million for the same period last year, lower interest income of $0.4 million in fiscal 2021 compared to $1.5 million in fiscal 2020 and exchange rate gains of approximately $53,000 compared to losses of $605,000 for the same period last year.\nOther income was approximately $0.8 million in the year ended April 30, 2020 compared to $2.4 million in fiscal 2019. The decrease was primarily due to unrealized losses of $0.1 million in fiscal 2020 compared to unrealized gains of $1.0 million in fiscal 2019, lower interest income of $1.5 million in fiscal 2020 compared to $2.1 million in fiscal 2019 and higher exchange rate losses of approximately $605,000 compared to $486,000 for the same period last year.\nFor the years ended April 30, 2021 and 2020, our investments generated an annualized yield of approximately 1.7% and 1.4%, respectively.\nIncome Taxes\nDuring the year ended April 30, 2021, we recorded income tax expense of $759,000 compared to $56,000 in fiscal 2020 and $838,000 in fiscal 2019. Our effective income tax rate takes into account the source of taxable income by state and available income tax credits. Our effective tax rate was 8.6%, 1%, and 11% in fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The effective tax rate for fiscal 2021 is higher compared to fiscal 2020 due to a decrease in the amount of excess tax benefits from stock option deductions and a decrease in foreign tax credits.\nOperating Pattern\nWe experience an irregular pattern of quarterly and annual operating results, caused primarily by fluctuations in both the number and size of software contracts received and delivered from quarter to quarter and our ability to recognize revenue in that quarter and annually in accordance with our revenue recognition policies. We expect this pattern to continue.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nSources and Uses of Cash\nWe have historically funded, and continue to fund, our operations and capital expenditures primarily with cash generated from operating activities. The changes in net cash that our operating activities provide generally reflect the changes in net earnings and non-cash operating items plus the effect of changes in operating assets and liabilities, such as investment trading securities, trade accounts receivable, trade accounts payable, accrued expenses and deferred revenue. We have no debt obligations or off-balance sheet financing arrangements, and therefore we used no cash for debt service purposes.\nThe following tables provide information about our cash flows and liquidity positions as of and for the fiscal years ended April 30, 2021, 2020 and 2019. You should read these tables and the discussion that follows in conjunction with our consolidated statements of cash flows contained in Item 8 of this report.\nTable 24: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Years ended\nApril 30, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(in thousands) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by operating activities </td> <td>$ </td> <td>17,756 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>25,982 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>23,930 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash used in investing activities </td> <td>(1,298) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(3,590) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(7,213) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash used in financing activities </td> <td>(7,614) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(3,866) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(8,223) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net change in cash and cash equivalents </td> <td>$ </td> <td>8,844 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>18,526 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>8,494 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe decrease in cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 was due primarily to: (1) a decrease in the net proceeds from sales and maturities of trading securities due to timing of sales and maturity dates, (2) unrealized\ngains on investments due to timing of sales of investments, (3) lower depreciation and amortization expense due to several capitalized software projects and intangible assets being fully amortized and (4) a lower increase in accounts payable and other liabilities during fiscal 2021, when compared to a higher increase in fiscal 2020 due primarily to timing and the amount of sales commissions and bonuses.\nThese factors were partially offset by: (1) a decrease in the purchases of trading securities due to timing, (2) the decrease in accounts receivable was more significant in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2021 due to timing of sales and billing, (3) an increase in prepaid expenses and other assets in fiscal 2021 compared to the decrease in fiscal 2020 due to timing of purchases, (4) an increase in deferred revenue in fiscal 2021 when compared to fiscal 2020 primarily due to the timing of cloud and maintenance revenue recognition, (5) an increase in net earnings, (6) higher stock-based compensation expense in fiscal 2021 due to an increase in options granted and (7) a decrease in deferred income taxes in fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 due to timing.\nThe decrease in cash used in investing activities in fiscal 2021 compared to cash used in investing activities in fiscal 2020 was due to: a decrease in capitalized software development costs due to the timing of R&D efforts and partially offset by higher purchases of equipment.\nThe increase in cash used in financing activities in fiscal 2021 when compared to fiscal 2020 was due primarily to: a decrease in proceeds from exercise of stock options, partially offset by an increase in cash dividends paid on common stock in fiscal 2021 due to an increase in the number of shares outstanding.\nThe following table provides information regarding the changes in our total cash and investments position:\nTable 25: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>As of April 30, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(in thousands) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash and cash equivalents </td> <td>$ </td> <td>88,658 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>79,814 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investments </td> <td>16,006 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14,862 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total cash and investments </td> <td>$ </td> <td>104,664 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>94,676 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net increase in total cash and investments </td> <td>9,988 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,194 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs of April 30, 2021, we had $104.7 million in total cash and investments with no outstanding debt, and believe that our sources of liquidity and capital resources will be sufficient to satisfy our presently anticipated requirements for working capital, capital expenditures and other corporate needs during at least the next twelve months. However, at some future date we may need to seek additional sources of capital to meet our requirements. If such need arises, we may be required to raise additional funds through equity or debt financing. We currently do not have a bank line of credit. We can provide no assurance that bank lines of credit or other financing will be available on terms acceptable to us. If available, such financing may result in dilution to our shareholders or higher interest expense.\nDays Sales Outstanding (\"DSO\") in accounts receivable were 85 and 78 days as of April 30, 2021 and April 30, 2020, respectively. Our current ratio on April 30, 2021 was 2.7 to 1, compared to 2.9 to 1 on April 30, 2020. DSO can fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis due to a number of factors including the percentage of total revenue that comes from software license sales (which typically have installment payment terms), seasonality, shifts in customer buying patterns, the timing of customer payments and annual SaaS and maintenance renewals, lengthened contractual payment terms in response to competitive pressures, the underlying mix of products and services, and the geographic concentration of revenue.\nOn August 19, 2002, our Board of Directors approved a resolution authorizing the repurchase of up to 2.0 million shares of our Class A common stock. These repurchases have been and will be made through open market purchases at prevailing market prices. The timing of any repurchases will depend upon market conditions, the market price of our common stock and management's assessment of our liquidity and cash flow needs. For this repurchase plan, through April 30, 2021, we have repurchased 1,053,679 shares of common stock at a cost of approximately $6.2 million. Under all repurchase plans as of April 30, 2021, we have repurchased 4,588,632 shares of common stock at a cost of approximately $25.6 million.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe are not a party to any off-balance sheet arrangements that have, or are reasonably likely to have, a material current or future effect on our financial condition, revenue or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.\nSee Item 5 of this report, under the caption Market for Registrant's Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters, and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities.\u201d", "summary": "- The case study analyzes the financial statements of a company over three years, including revenue, cost of revenue, operating expenses, operating income, net earnings, and more.\n- The total revenue of the company remained relatively stable at around $111.4 million in 2019, $115.7 million in 2020, and $108.7 million in 2021.\n- Subscription fees revenue decreased from $28.9 million in 2019 to $22.0 million in 2021, while total license fees revenue increased from $7,582 million in 2019 to $7,126 million in 2021.\n- The company's gross margin on subscription fees decreased from 59% in 2019 to 57% in 2021, while its gross margin on license fees increased from 36% in 2019 to 37% in 2021.\n- The company's research and development costs decreased from $16,964 million in 2019 to $15,348 million in 2021, while its sales and marketing costs decreased from $21,958 million in 2019 to $20,992 million in 2021.\n- The company's operating income decreased from $4,361 million in 2019 to $5,276 million in 2021.", "item_7_tables": "Table 14: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Percentage of Total Revenue </td> <td> </td> <td>Pct.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with Item 8. Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d. This discussion contains forward-looking statements relating to our future financial performance, business strategy, financing plans and other future events that involve uncertainties and risks. You can identify these statements by forward-looking words such as anticipate,\u201d intend,\u201d plan,\u201d continue,\u201d could,\u201d grow,\u201d may,\u201d potential,\u201d predict,\u201d strive,\u201d estimate,\u201d believe,\u201d expect\u201d and similar expressions that convey uncertainty of future events or outcomes. Any forward-looking statements herein are made pursuant to the safe harbor provision of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Our actual results could differ materially from the results anticipated by these forward-looking statements as a result of many known and unknown factors that are beyond our ability to control or predict, including but not limited to those discussed above in Risk Factors\u201d and elsewhere in this report. See also Special Cautionary Notice Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d at the beginning of Item 1. Business.\u201d\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nWe have based the following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations on our consolidated financial statements, which we have prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2021, describes the significant accounting policies that we have used in preparing our consolidated financial statements. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including, but not limited to, those related to revenue/collectability. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Our actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nWe believe the critical accounting policies listed below affect significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the financial statements.\nRevenue Recognition.\nLicense. Our perpetual software licenses provide the customer with a right to use the software as it exists at the time of purchase. We recognize revenue for distinct software licenses once the license period has begun and we have made the software available to the customer.\nOur perpetual software licenses are sold with maintenance under which we provide customers with telephone consulting, product updates on a when and if available basis, and releases of new versions of products previously purchased by the customer, as well as error reporting and correction services.\nSubscription. Subscription fees include Software-as-a-Service (\"SaaS\") revenue for the right to use the software for a limited period of time in an environment hosted by the Company or by a third party. The customer accesses and uses the software on an as needed basis over the Internet or via a dedicated line; however, the customer has no right to take delivery of the software. The underlying arrangements typically include a single fee for the service that is billed monthly, quarterly or annually. The Company's SaaS solutions represent a series of distinct services that are substantially the same and have the same pattern of transfer to the customer. Revenue from a SaaS solution is generally recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement.\nProfessional Services and Other. Our professional services revenue consists of fees generated from consulting, implementation and training services, including reimbursements of out-pocket expenses in connection with our services. These services are typically optional to our customers, and are distinct from our software. Fees for our professional services are separately priced and are generally billed on an hourly basis, and revenue is recognized over time as the services are performed. We believe the output method of hours worked provides the best depiction of the transfer of our services since the customer is receiving the benefit from our services as the work is performed. Reimbursements received from customers for out-of-pocket expenses were recorded in revenue and totaled approximately $20,000, $1.5 million, and $1.4 million for 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nMaintenance and Support. Revenue is derived from maintenance and support services, under which we provide customers with telephone consulting, product updates on a when and if available basis, and releases of new versions of products previously purchased by the customer, as well as error reporting and correction services. Maintenance for perpetual licenses is renewable, generally on an annual basis, at the option of the customer. Maintenance terms typically range from one to three years. Revenue related to maintenance is generally paid in advance and recognized ratably over the term of the agreement since the Company is standing ready to provide a series of maintenance services that are substantially the same each period over the term; therefore, time is the best measure of progress. Support services for subscriptions are included in the subscription fees and are recognized as a component of such fees.\nIndirect Channel Revenue. We record revenue from sales made through the indirect sales channels on a gross basis, because we control the goods or services and act as the principal in the transaction. In reaching this determination, we evaluate sales through our indirect channel on a case-by-case basis and consider a number of factors including indicators of control such as the party having the primary responsibility to provide specified goods or services, and the party having discretion in establishing prices.\nSales Taxes. We account for sales taxes collected from customers on a net basis.\nSignificant Judgments. Many of our contracts include multiple performance obligations. Our products and services generally do not require a significant amount of integration or interdependency; therefore, our products and services are generally not combined. We allocate the transaction price for each contract to each performance obligation based on the relative standalone selling price (SSP) for each performance obligation within each contract.\nWe use judgment in determining the SSP for products and services. For substantially all performance obligations except on-premise licenses, we are able to establish SSP based on the observable prices of products or services sold separately in comparable circumstances to similar customers. We typically establish an SSP range for our products and services which is reassessed on a periodic basis or when facts and circumstances change. Our on-premise licenses have not historically been sold on a standalone basis, as the vast majority of all customers elect to purchase on-premise license support contracts at the time of a on-premise license purchase. Support contracts are generally priced as a percentage of the net fees paid by the customer to access the on-premise license. We are unable to establish the SSP for our on-premise licenses based on observable prices given the same products are sold for a broad range of amounts (that is, the selling price is highly variable) and a representative SSP is not discernible from past transactions or other observable evidence. As a result, the SSP for a on-premise license included in a contract with multiple performance obligations is determined by applying a residual approach whereby all other performance obligations within a contract are first allocated a portion of the transaction price based upon their respective SSPs, with any residual amount of transaction price allocated to on-premise license revenue.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following table sets forth certain revenue and expense items as a percentage of total revenue for the three years ended April 30, 2021, 2020, and 2019 and the percentage increases and decreases in those items for the years ended April 30, 2021 and 2020:\n\nnm - not meaningful\nEconomic Overview and Significant Trends in Our Business\nFor fiscal 2022, we expect the global economy to improve modestly when compared to recent periods. We believe information technology spending will incrementally improve over the long term as increased global competition forces companies to improve productivity by upgrading their technology systems, which could result in an improved selling environment. Although this improvement could slow or regress at any time, due in part to concerns related to the effects of the spread of the global virus and trade conflicts on global capital markets and general economic conditions, we believe that our organizational and financial structure will enable us to take advantage of any sustained economic rebound. While we do not expect that the COVID-19 pandemic will cause any material adverse changes on our business or financial results for fiscal 2022, we are unable to accurately predict the impact that the coronavirus will have due to various uncertainties, including the ultimate geographic spread of the virus, the severity of the disease, the duration of the outbreak, and actions that may be taken by governmental authorities. Customers continue to take long periods to evaluate discretionary software purchases.\nCorporate capital spending trends and commitments are the primary determinants of the size of the market for business software. Corporate capital spending is, in turn, a function of general economic conditions in the U.S. and abroad and in particular may be affected by conditions in U.S. and global credit markets. In recent years, the weakness in the overall global economy and the U.S. economy has resulted in reduced expenditures in the business software market.\nIn April 2021, the International Monetary Fund ( IMF\u201d) provided an update to the World Economic Outlook for the 2021 and 2022 world economic growth forecast. The update noted that, High uncertainty surrounds the global economic outlook, primarily related to the path of the pandemic. The contraction of activity in 2020 was unprecedented in living memory in its speed and synchronized nature. But it could have been a lot worse. Although difficult to pin down precisely, IMF staff estimates suggest that the contraction could have been three times as large if not for extraordinary policy support. Much remains to be done to beat back the pandemic and avoid divergence in income per capita across economies and persistent increases in inequality within countries.\nAfter an estimated contraction of -3.3 percent in 2020, the global economy is projected to grow at 6 percent in 2021, moderating to 4.4 percent in 2022. The contraction for 2020 is 1.1 percentage points smaller than projected in the October 2020 World Economic Outlook (WEO), reflecting the higher-than-expected growth out turns in the second half of the year for most regions after lockdowns were eased and as economies adapted to new ways of working. The projections for 2021 and 2022 are 0.8 percentage point and 0.2 percentage point stronger than in the October 2020 WEO, reflecting additional fiscal support in a few large economies and the anticipated vaccine-powered recovery in the second half of the year.\u201d\nAs the economy improves from the COVID-19 decline, we believe that the recovery may drive some businesses to invest in achieving more process and efficiency enhancements in their operations and to invest in solutions that improve operating margins, rather than make large infrastructure-type technology purchases. If this trend continues, we believe it may tend to favor our supply chain solutions, which are designed to provide a more rapid return on investment and are targeted at some of the largest profit drivers in a customer's business. While the recent difficult economic environment has had a particularly adverse impact on the weaker companies in our target markets, we believe a large percentage of our customers are seeking to make investments to strengthen their operations, and some are taking advantage of current economic conditions to gain market share. We have taken steps to best ensure the health and safety of our employees globally. Our daily execution has evolved into a largely virtual model, and we continue to find innovative ways to engage with customers and prospects, ensuring that they are supported as they navigate through this unprecedented period.\nBusiness Opportunities and Risks\nWe currently view the following factors as the primary opportunities and risks associated with our business:\n\u2022Dependence on Capital Spending Patterns. There is risk associated with our dependence on the capital spending patterns of U.S. and international businesses, which in turn are functions of economic trends and conditions over which we have no control.\n\u2022Acquisition Opportunities. There are opportunities for selective acquisitions or investments to expand our sales distribution channels and/or broaden our product offering by providing additional solutions for our target markets.\n\u2022Acquisition Risks. There are risks associated with acquisitions of complementary companies, products and technologies, including the risks that we will not achieve the financial and strategic goals that we contemplate at the time of the transaction. More specifically, in any acquisition we will face risks and challenges associated with the uncertain value of the acquired business or assets, the difficulty of assimilating operations and personnel, integrating acquired technologies and products and maintaining the loyalty of the customers of the acquired business.\n\u2022Competitive Technologies. There is a risk that our competitors may develop technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to our technology.\n\u2022Competition in General. There are risks inherent in the market for business application software and related services, which has been and continues to be intensely competitive; for example, some of our competitors may become more aggressive with their prices and/or payment terms, which may adversely affect our profit margins.\nFor more information, please see Risk Factors\u201d in Item 1A. above.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nFor information with respect to recent accounting pronouncements, if any, and the impact of these pronouncements on our consolidated financial statements, if any, see Note 1(n) of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-K.\nMarket Conditions by Operating Segment\nWe operate and manage our business in three segments based on software and services provided in three key product markets: (1) SCM, which provides collaborative supply chain solutions to streamline and optimize the production, distribution and management of products between trading partners; (2) IT Consulting, which consists of IT staffing and consulting services; and (3) Other, which consists of (i) American Software ERP, a provider of purchasing and materials management, customer order processing, financial, human resources, and manufacturing solutions, and (ii) unallocated corporate overhead expenses. The SCM segment includes the businesses of Logility and DMI.\nOur SCM segment experienced a 5% decrease in revenue during fiscal 2021 when compared to fiscal 2020, primarily due to a 60% decrease in license fees, a 17% decrease in professional services and other revenue and an 8% decrease in maintenance revenue partially offset by a 31% increase in subscription fees. Our SCM segment experienced a 10% increase in revenue during fiscal 2020 when compared to fiscal 2019, primarily due to a 57% increase in subscription fees, a 12% increase in professional services and other revenue and a 5% increase in license fees partially offset by a 5% decrease in maintenance revenue.\nOur IT Consulting segment experienced an approximately 6% increase in revenue in fiscal 2021 when compared to fiscal 2020 and a 10% decrease in revenue in fiscal 2020 when compared to fiscal 2019, due primarily to fluctuations in IT staffing work at our largest customer. As companies have moved to cut costs and limit IT budgets, they have utilized more outsourcing services, which tend to be more cost effective for them. In the past, this trend has resulted in increased business for this segment. However, there is a countervailing trend to outsource IT to international markets that historically have been more price competitive than domestic sources like us. Our largest consulting customer comprised 29% of our IT Consulting revenue in fiscal 2021, 33% in fiscal 2020 and 47% in fiscal 2019. The loss of this customer would negatively and materially affect our IT Consulting business.\nThe Other segment revenue decreased 14% in fiscal 2021 when compared to fiscal 2020, primarily due to a 93% decrease in license fees, a 13% decrease in professional services and other revenue and a 1% decrease in maintenance revenue. The Other segment revenue increased 2% in fiscal 2020 when compared to fiscal 2019, primarily due to a 70% increase in license fees and a 4% increase in professional services and other revenue, partially offset by a 6% decrease in maintenance revenue.\nREVENUE\n\nFor the year ended April 30, 2021, the 4% decrease in total revenue was attributable primarily to a 61% decrease in license revenue, a 7% decrease in professional services and other revenue and a 7% decrease in maintenance revenue partially offset by a 31% increase in subscription fees revenue.\nFor the year ended April 30, 2020, the 6% increase in total revenue was attributable primarily to a 57% increase in subscription fees revenue, a 6% increase in license revenue and a 1% increase in professional services and other revenue, partially offset by a 5% decrease in maintenance revenue.\nDue to intensely competitive markets, we discount subscription and license fees from our published list price due to pricing pressure in our industry. Numerous factors contribute to the amount of the discounts provided, such as previous customer purchases, the number of customer sites utilizing the software, the number of modules purchased and the number of users, the type of platform deployment, as well as the overall size of the contract. While all these factors affect the discount amount of a particular contract, the overall percentage discount has not materially changed in the recent reported fiscal periods.\nThe change in our revenue from period to period is primarily due to the volume of products and related services sold in any period and the amounts of products or modules purchased with each sale.\nInternational revenue represented approximately 15% of total revenue for the year ended April 30, 2021, 19% of total revenue for the year ended April 30, 2020, and 20% for the year ended April 30, 2019. Our international revenue may fluctuate substantially from period to period primarily because we derive these revenue from a relatively small number of customers.\nSubscription Fees Revenue\n\nFor the year ended April 30, 2021, subscription fee revenue increased by 31% when compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to an increase in Cloud Services Annual Contract Value (\"ACV\") of approximately 53% to $26.4 million compared to $17.3 million in the same period of the prior year. This increase was attributable to an increase in the number of contracts, contracts with a higher Cloud Services ACV, as well as an increase in the value of multi-year contracts (typically three to five years). This is evidence of our successful transition to the cloud subscription model. ACV is a forward-looking operating measure used by management to better understand Cloud Services (SaaS and other related cloud services) revenue trends within our business, as it reflects our current estimate of revenue to be generated under existing client contracts in the forward 12-month period.\nLicense Fees Revenue\n\nFor the year ended April 30, 2021, license fee revenue decreased by 61% when compared to the previous year. Our Other business segment experienced a 93% decrease in license fees for the year ended April 30, 2021 when compared to the same period in the prior year due to the timing of selling into the installed customer base. Our SCM segment experienced a 60% decrease in license fees primarily due to a decrease in the number of new customers choosing to deploy our software on-premise this year. We anticipate that the majority of future license fee sales will be to existing on-premise customers for add-on expansion. The SCM segment constituted 99%, 97% and 98% of our total license fee revenue for the years ended April 30, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nFor the year ended April 30, 2020, license fee revenue increased by 6% when compared to the previous year. Our Other business segment experienced a 70% increase in license fees for the year ended April 30, 2020 when compared to the same period in the prior year due to the timing of selling into the installed customer base. SCM experienced a 5% increase in license fees primarily due to a few new customers choosing to deploy our software on-premise. SCM constituted 97% and 98% of our total license fee revenue for the years ended April 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nThe direct sales channel provided approximately 83% of license fee revenue for the year ended April 30, 2021, compared to approximately 92% in fiscal 2020 and 84% in fiscal 2019. The decrease in direct license fees from fiscal 2020 to fiscal 2021 was largely due to one large license fee deal to a new customer last year compared to none this year. The increase in direct license fees from fiscal 2019 to fiscal 2020 was largely due to our indirect channel selling proportionately more SaaS than license contracts compared to our direct channel.\nFor the year ended April 30, 2021, our margins after commissions on direct sales were approximately 84%, and our margins after commissions on indirect sales were approximately 58%. For the year ended April 30, 2020, our margins after commissions on\ndirect sales were approximately 88%, and our margins after commissions on indirect sales were approximately 53%. For the year ended April 30, 2019, our margins after commissions on direct sales were approximately 87%, and our margins after commissions on indirect sales were approximately 55%. The margins after commissions for direct sales were relatively consistent, between 84% to 88%, while the range for indirect sales had a wider spread of 53% to 58%. The indirect channel margins for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2021 increased when compared to the same periods in the prior year due to the mix of value-added reseller ( VAR\u201d) commission rates. DMI is responsible for the bulk of our indirect sales and the commission percentage varies based on whether the sale is domestic or international.\nProfessional Services and Other Revenue\n\nThe 7% decrease in total professional services and other revenue for the year ended April 30, 2021 was due to a 17% decrease in our SCM segment professional services due primarily due to lower implementation project work resulting from lower subscription and license fee sales in the first three quarters of fiscal 2021, combined with a 13% decrease in our Other segment due to lower utilization from project implementation services and services activity. This increase was partially offset by a 6% increase in our IT consulting segment due to the timing of project work.\nThe 1% increase in total professional services and other revenue for the year ended April 30, 2020 was due to a 12% increase from our SCM segment due primarily due to a ramp up of implementation project work resulting from increased subscription and license fee sales in recent periods, combined with a 4% increase in our Other segment due to utilization from project implementation services and services revenue. This increase was partially offset by an 10% decrease in our IT consulting segment due to the timing of project work.\nIn our software segments, we have observed that there is a tendency for professional services and other revenue to lag changes in license revenue by one to three quarters, as new licenses in one quarter often involve implementation and consulting services in subsequent quarters, for which we recognize revenue only as we perform those services.\nMaintenance Revenue\n\nThe 7% decrease in total maintenance revenue for the year ended April 30, 2021 was due to a 1% decrease in our Other segment due to fewer customer renewals and an 8% decrease in maintenance revenue from our SCM segment due to normal customer attrition and customers converting from on-premise support to our SaaS cloud platform.\nThe 5% decrease in total maintenance revenue for the year ended April 30, 2020 was due to a 6% decrease in our Other segment due to fewer customer renewals and a 5% decrease in maintenance revenue from our SCM segment due to normal customer attrition.\nThe SCM segment's maintenance revenue constituted 97% of total maintenance revenue for the years ended April 30, 2021, 2021, 2020 and 2019. Typically, our maintenance revenue has had a direct relationship to current and historic license fee revenue, since new licenses are the potential source of new maintenance customers.\nGROSS MARGIN\nThe following table provides both dollar amounts and percentage measures of gross margin:\n\nThe total gross margin percentage for the year ended April 30, 2021 decreased to 54% when compared to the same period in the prior year due to decreases in gross margin percentage for professional services and other gross margins, license fees margins and maintenance gross margins, partially offset by an increase in subscription fees. The total gross margin percentage for the year ended April 30, 2020 increased to 55% when compared to the same period in the prior year due to increases in gross margin percentage for license fees, professional services and other gross margins and maintenance gross margins, partially offset by a decrease in subscription fees margins.\nGross Margin on Subscription Fees\nFor the year ended April 30, 2021, our gross margin percentage on subscription fees increased from 57% in fiscal 2020 to 59% primarily due to an increase in subscription revenue and lower capitalized software amortization expense.\nFor the year ended April 30, 2020, our gross margin percentage on subscription fees decreased from 59% in fiscal 2019 to 57% primarily due to an increase in capitalized software amortization expense.\nGross Margin on License Fees\nThe decrease in license fee gross margin percentage for the year ended April 30, 2021 when compared to fiscal 2020 was primarily due to lower license fee revenue.\nThe increase in license fee gross margin percentage for the year ended April 30, 2020 when compared to fiscal 2019 was primarily due to lower agent commission and amortization of intangibles expense and to a lesser extent higher license fee revenue.\nLicense fee gross margin percentage tends to be directly related to the level of license fee revenue due to the relatively fixed cost of capitalized software amortization expense, amortization of acquired software and the sales mix between our direct and indirect channels.\nGross Margin on Professional Services and Other\nFor the year ended April 30, 2021, our gross margin percentage on professional services and other decreased from 28% in fiscal 2020 to 27% primarily because our IT Consulting segment professional services and other revenue gross margin decreased from 18% in fiscal 2020 to 17% in fiscal 2021 due to a decrease in project utilization rates. Our other segment decreased from 53% in fiscal 2020 to 41% in fiscal 2021 due to a slower ramp up of project work. Our SCM segment professional services and other gross margin was 35% for both fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020.\nFor the year ended April 30, 2020, our gross margin percentage on professional services and other increased from 25% in fiscal 2019 to 28% due to increased gross margins in our SCM segment which increased from 28% in fiscal 2019 to 35% in fiscal 2020 due to increased revenue and higher billing utilization. Our IT Consulting segment professional services and other revenue\ngross margin decreased from 22% in fiscal 2019 to 18% in fiscal 2020 due to a decrease in project related billing. Our other segment increased from 47% in fiscal 2019 to 53% in fiscal 2020 due to improved billing utilization rates.\nAs discussed above, our IT Consulting segment typically has lower margins when compared to the Other segments that have higher margin implementation service revenue. The IT Consulting segment was 48%, 42% and 47% of the Company's professional services and other revenue in fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Our SCM segment was 50%, 56% and 50% of the Company's professional services and other revenue in fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Our Other segment was 2%, 2% and 3% of the Company's professional services and other revenue in fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nGross Margin on Maintenance\nMaintenance gross margin decreased to 81% in fiscal 2021 from 83% in fiscal 2020 due to lower maintenance revenue cost containment efforts. The primary cost component is maintenance staffing, which is relatively inelastic in the short term.\nMaintenance gross margin increased to 83% in fiscal 2020 from 82% in fiscal 2019 due to cost containment efforts. The primary cost component is maintenance staffing, which is relatively inelastic in the short term.\nEXPENSES\n\nResearch and Development\nGross product research and development costs include all non-capitalized and capitalized software development costs.\nA breakdown of the research and development costs is as follows:\n\n______________\n* Included in cost of license fees and cost of subscription fees.\nFor the year ended April 30, 2021, gross product research and development costs and capitalized software development costs decreased by 5% primarily due to a decrease in headcount from third-party contractors compared to fiscal 2020. Capitalized software development costs decreased in fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 due to the timing of project work and an increase in agile software programming that accelerates the software releases to weeks from months. We expect capitalized software to be\nimmaterial in fiscal 2022. Amortization of capitalized software development decreased 28% in fiscal 2021 when compared to fiscal 2020 as some projects were fully amortized.\nFor the year ended April 30, 2020, gross product research and development costs and capitalized software development costs decreased by 3% primarily due to a decrease in headcount from third-party contractors compared to fiscal 2019. Capitalized software development costs decreased in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 due to the timing of project work. Amortization of capitalized software development increased 27% in fiscal 2020 when compared to fiscal 2019 due to the timing of project releases.\nSales and Marketing\nFor the year ended April 30, 2021, the decrease in sales and marketing expenses compared to fiscal 2020 was due primarily to lower marketing spend, including a reduction in trade shows and conferences and lower travel costs due to COVID-19. Fiscal 2021 was impacted by COVID-19 for the entire year versus fiscal 2020.\nFor the year ended April 30, 2020, the increase in sales and marketing expenses compared to fiscal 2019 was due primarily to an increase in headcount, higher variable compensation, higher sales commissions, an increase in contractor costs and an increase in recruiting fees, which was partially offset by lower marketing spend and lower travel costs due to COVID-19.\nGeneral and Administrative\nFor the year ended April 30, 2021, general and administrative expenses remained relatively flat when compared to fiscal 2020 primarily due to a reduction in variable compensation, legal fees and cost containment efforts of overhead costs, partially offset by an increase in insurance and benefit expenses.\nFor the year ended April 30, 2020, the increase in general and administrative expenses compared to fiscal 2019 was primarily due to higher variable compensation and higher overhead costs and, to a lesser extent, higher legal, stock option and insurance costs.\nThe total number of employees was 424 on April 30, 2021, 428 on April 30, 2020 and 424 on April 30, 2019.\nAmortization of Acquisition-related Intangible Assets\nFor the year ended April 30, 2021, we recorded $0.8 million in intangible amortization expense, of which $0.2 million is included in operating expenses and $0.6 million is included in cost of license fees.\nFor the year ended April 30, 2020, we recorded $1.6 million in intangible amortization expense, of which $0.3 million is included in operating expenses and $1.3 million is included in cost of license fees.\nOperating Income/(Loss)\n\n______________\n* Includes certain unallocated expenses.\nOur SCM segment operating income decreased by 4% in fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 primarily due to a 5% decrease in revenue. Our SCM segment operating income increased by 23% in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 primarily due to a 10% increase in revenue.\nOur IT Consulting segment operating income increased 37% in fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 primarily due to a 6% increase in revenue due to the type of project billing. Our IT Consulting segment operating income decreased 66% in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 primarily due to a decrease in revenue and lower gross margins due to the type of project billing.\nThe increase in the Other segment operating loss in fiscal 2021 when compared to fiscal 2020 was due primarily to a 14% decrease in revenue and an increase in variable compensation and benefit costs. The increase in the Other segment operating loss in fiscal 2020 when compared to fiscal 2019 was due primarily to an increase in variable compensation and overhead costs, partially offset by a 2% increase in revenue in fiscal 2020.\nOther Income\nOther income is comprised of net interest and dividend income, rental income net of related depreciation expenses, exchange rate gains and losses, realized and unrealized gains and losses from investments. Other income was approximately $4.5 million in the year ended April 30, 2021 compared to $0.8 million in fiscal 2020. The increase was primarily due to unrealized gains of $3.6 million in fiscal 2021 compared to unrealized losses of $0.1 million for the same period last year, lower interest income of $0.4 million in fiscal 2021 compared to $1.5 million in fiscal 2020 and exchange rate gains of approximately $53,000 compared to losses of $605,000 for the same period last year.\nOther income was approximately $0.8 million in the year ended April 30, 2020 compared to $2.4 million in fiscal 2019. The decrease was primarily due to unrealized losses of $0.1 million in fiscal 2020 compared to unrealized gains of $1.0 million in fiscal 2019, lower interest income of $1.5 million in fiscal 2020 compared to $2.1 million in fiscal 2019 and higher exchange rate losses of approximately $605,000 compared to $486,000 for the same period last year.\nFor the years ended April 30, 2021 and 2020, our investments generated an annualized yield of approximately 1.7% and 1.4%, respectively.\nIncome Taxes\nDuring the year ended April 30, 2021, we recorded income tax expense of $759,000 compared to $56,000 in fiscal 2020 and $838,000 in fiscal 2019. Our effective income tax rate takes into account the source of taxable income by state and available income tax credits. Our effective tax rate was 8.6%, 1%, and 11% in fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The effective tax rate for fiscal 2021 is higher compared to fiscal 2020 due to a decrease in the amount of excess tax benefits from stock option deductions and a decrease in foreign tax credits.\nOperating Pattern\nWe experience an irregular pattern of quarterly and annual operating results, caused primarily by fluctuations in both the number and size of software contracts received and delivered from quarter to quarter and our ability to recognize revenue in that quarter and annually in accordance with our revenue recognition policies. We expect this pattern to continue.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nSources and Uses of Cash\nWe have historically funded, and continue to fund, our operations and capital expenditures primarily with cash generated from operating activities. The changes in net cash that our operating activities provide generally reflect the changes in net earnings and non-cash operating items plus the effect of changes in operating assets and liabilities, such as investment trading securities, trade accounts receivable, trade accounts payable, accrued expenses and deferred revenue. We have no debt obligations or off-balance sheet financing arrangements, and therefore we used no cash for debt service purposes.\nThe following tables provide information about our cash flows and liquidity positions as of and for the fiscal years ended April 30, 2021, 2020 and 2019. You should read these tables and the discussion that follows in conjunction with our consolidated statements of cash flows contained in Item 8 of this report.\n\nThe decrease in cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 was due primarily to: (1) a decrease in the net proceeds from sales and maturities of trading securities due to timing of sales and maturity dates, (2) unrealized\ngains on investments due to timing of sales of investments, (3) lower depreciation and amortization expense due to several capitalized software projects and intangible assets being fully amortized and (4) a lower increase in accounts payable and other liabilities during fiscal 2021, when compared to a higher increase in fiscal 2020 due primarily to timing and the amount of sales commissions and bonuses.\nThese factors were partially offset by: (1) a decrease in the purchases of trading securities due to timing, (2) the decrease in accounts receivable was more significant in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2021 due to timing of sales and billing, (3) an increase in prepaid expenses and other assets in fiscal 2021 compared to the decrease in fiscal 2020 due to timing of purchases, (4) an increase in deferred revenue in fiscal 2021 when compared to fiscal 2020 primarily due to the timing of cloud and maintenance revenue recognition, (5) an increase in net earnings, (6) higher stock-based compensation expense in fiscal 2021 due to an increase in options granted and (7) a decrease in deferred income taxes in fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 due to timing.\nThe decrease in cash used in investing activities in fiscal 2021 compared to cash used in investing activities in fiscal 2020 was due to: a decrease in capitalized software development costs due to the timing of R&D efforts and partially offset by higher purchases of equipment.\nThe increase in cash used in financing activities in fiscal 2021 when compared to fiscal 2020 was due primarily to: a decrease in proceeds from exercise of stock options, partially offset by an increase in cash dividends paid on common stock in fiscal 2021 due to an increase in the number of shares outstanding.\nThe following table provides information regarding the changes in our total cash and investments position:\n\nAs of April 30, 2021, we had $104.7 million in total cash and investments with no outstanding debt, and believe that our sources of liquidity and capital resources will be sufficient to satisfy our presently anticipated requirements for working capital, capital expenditures and other", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with Item 8.

See also Special Cautionary Notice Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d at the beginning of Item 1. Business.\u201d\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nWe have based the following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations on our consolidated financial statements, which we have prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2021, describes the significant accounting policies that we have used in preparing our consolidated financial statements. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including, but not limited to, those related to revenue/collectability. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Our actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nWe believe the critical accounting policies listed below affect significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the financial statements.\nRevenue Recognition.\nLicense. Our perpetual software licenses provide the customer with a right to use the software as it exists at the time of purchase. We recognize revenue for distinct software licenses once the license period has begun and we have made the software available to the customer.\nOur perpetual software licenses are sold with maintenance under which we provide customers with telephone consulting, product updates on a when and if available basis, and releases of new versions of products previously purchased by the customer, as well as error reporting and correction services.\nSubscription. Subscription fees include Software-as-a-Service (\"SaaS\") revenue for the right to use the software for a limited period of time in an environment hosted by the Company or by a third party. The customer accesses and uses the software on an as needed basis over the Internet or via a dedicated line; however, the customer has no right to take delivery of the software. The underlying arrangements typically include a single fee for the service that is billed monthly, quarterly or annually. The Company's SaaS solutions represent a series of distinct services that are substantially the same and have the same pattern of transfer to the customer. Revenue from a SaaS solution is generally recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement.\nProfessional Services and Other. Our professional services revenue consists of fees generated from consulting, implementation and training services, including reimbursements of out-pocket expenses in connection with our services. These services are typically optional to our customers, and are distinct from our software. Fees for our professional services are separately priced and are generally billed on an hourly basis, and revenue is recognized over time as the services are performed. We believe the output method of hours worked provides the best depiction of the transfer of our services since the customer is receiving the benefit from our services as the work is performed. Reimbursements received from customers for out-of-pocket expenses were recorded in revenue and totaled approximately $20,000, $1.5 million, and $1.4 million for 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nMaintenance and Support. Revenue is derived from maintenance and support services, under which we provide customers with telephone consulting, product updates on a when and if available basis, and releases of new versions of products previously purchased by the customer, as well as error reporting and correction services. Maintenance for perpetual licenses is renewable, generally on an annual basis, at the option of the customer. Maintenance terms typically range from one to three years. Revenue related to maintenance is generally paid in advance and recognized ratably over the term of the agreement since the Company is standing ready to provide a series of maintenance services that are substantially the same each period over the term; therefore, time is the best measure of progress. Support services for subscriptions are included in the subscription fees and are recognized as a component of such fees.\nIndirect Channel Revenue. We record revenue from sales made through the indirect sales channels on a gross basis, because we control the goods or services and act as the principal in the transaction. In reaching this determination, we evaluate sales through our indirect channel on a case-by-case basis and consider a number of factors including indicators of control such as the party having the primary responsibility to provide specified goods or services, and the party having discretion in establishing prices.\nSales Taxes. We account for sales taxes collected from customers on a net basis.\nSignificant Judgments. Many of our contracts include multiple performance obligations. Our products and services generally do not require a significant amount of integration or interdependency; therefore, our products and services are generally not combined. We allocate the transaction price for each contract to each performance obligation based on the relative standalone selling price (SSP) for each performance obligation within each contract.\nWe use judgment in determining the SSP for products and services. For substantially all performance obligations except on-premise licenses, we are able to establish SSP based on the observable prices of products or services sold separately in comparable circumstances to similar customers. We typically establish an SSP range for our products and services which is reassessed on a periodic basis or when facts and circumstances change. Our on-premise licenses have not historically been sold on a standalone basis, as the vast majority of all customers elect to purchase on-premise license support contracts at the time of a on-premise license purchase. Support contracts are generally priced as a percentage of the net fees paid by the customer to access the on-premise license. We are unable to establish the SSP for our on-premise licenses based on observable prices given the same products are sold for a broad range of amounts (that is, the selling price is highly variable) and a representative SSP is not discernible from past transactions or other observable evidence. As a result, the SSP for a on-premise license included in a contract with multiple performance obligations is determined by applying a residual approach whereby all other performance obligations within a contract are first allocated a portion of the transaction price based upon their respective SSPs, with any residual amount of transaction price allocated to on-premise license revenue.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following table sets forth certain revenue and expense items as a percentage of total revenue for the three years ended April 30, 2021, 2020, and 2019 and the percentage increases and decreases in those items for the years ended April 30, 2021 and 2020:\nTable 14: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Percentage of Total Revenue </td> <td> </td> <td>Pct.

meaningful\nEconomic Overview and Significant Trends in Our Business\nFor fiscal 2022, we expect the global economy to improve modestly when compared to recent periods. We believe information technology spending will incrementally improve over the long term as increased global competition forces companies to improve productivity by upgrading their technology systems, which could result in an improved selling environment. Although this improvement could slow or regress at any time, due in part to concerns related to the effects of the spread of the global virus and trade conflicts on global capital markets and general economic conditions, we believe that our organizational and financial structure will enable us to take advantage of any sustained economic rebound. While we do not expect that the COVID-19 pandemic will cause any material adverse changes on our business or financial results for fiscal 2022, we are unable to accurately predict the impact that the coronavirus will have due to various uncertainties, including the ultimate geographic spread of the virus, the severity of the disease, the duration of the outbreak, and actions that may be taken by governmental authorities. Customers continue to take long periods to evaluate discretionary software purchases.\nCorporate capital spending trends and commitments are the primary determinants of the size of the market for business software. Corporate capital spending is, in turn, a function of general economic conditions in the U.S. and abroad and in particular may be affected by conditions in U.S. and global credit markets. In recent years, the weakness in the overall global economy and the U.S. economy has resulted in reduced expenditures in the business software market.\nIn April 2021, the International Monetary Fund ( IMF\u201d) provided an update to the World Economic Outlook for the 2021 and 2022 world economic growth forecast. The update noted that, High uncertainty surrounds the global economic outlook, primarily related to the path of the pandemic. The contraction of activity in 2020 was unprecedented in living memory in its speed and synchronized nature. But it could have been a lot worse. Although difficult to pin down precisely, IMF staff estimates suggest that the contraction could have been three times as large if not for extraordinary policy support. Much remains to be done to beat back the pandemic and avoid divergence in income per capita across economies and persistent increases in inequality within countries.\nAfter an estimated contraction of -3.3 percent in 2020, the global economy is projected to grow at 6 percent in 2021, moderating to 4.4 percent in 2022. The contraction for 2020 is 1.1 percentage points smaller than projected in the October 2020 World Economic Outlook (WEO), reflecting the higher-than-expected growth out turns in the second half of the year for most regions after lockdowns were eased and as economies adapted to new ways of working. The projections for 2021 and 2022 are 0.8 percentage point and 0.2 percentage point stronger than in the October 2020 WEO, reflecting additional fiscal support in a few large economies and the anticipated vaccine-powered recovery in the second half of the year.\u201d\nAs the economy improves from the COVID-19 decline, we believe that the recovery may drive some businesses to invest in achieving more process and efficiency enhancements in their operations and to invest in solutions that improve operating margins, rather than make large infrastructure-type technology purchases. If this trend continues, we believe it may tend to favor our supply chain solutions, which are designed to provide a more rapid return on investment and are targeted at some of the largest profit drivers in a customer's business. While the recent difficult economic environment has had a particularly adverse impact on the weaker companies in our target markets, we believe a large percentage of our customers are seeking to make investments to strengthen their operations, and some are taking advantage of current economic conditions to gain market share. We have taken steps to best ensure the health and safety of our employees globally. Our daily execution has evolved into a largely virtual model, and we continue to find innovative ways to engage with customers and prospects, ensuring that they are supported as they navigate through this unprecedented period.\nBusiness Opportunities and Risks\nWe currently view the following factors as the primary opportunities and risks associated with our business:\n\u2022Dependence on Capital Spending Patterns. There is risk associated with our dependence on the capital spending patterns of U.S. and international businesses, which in turn are functions of economic trends and conditions over which we have no control.\n\u2022Acquisition Opportunities. There are opportunities for selective acquisitions or investments to expand our sales distribution channels and/or broaden our product offering by providing additional solutions for our target markets.\n\u2022Acquisition Risks. There are risks associated with acquisitions of complementary companies, products and technologies, including the risks that we will not achieve the financial and strategic goals that we contemplate at the time of the transaction. More specifically, in any acquisition we will face risks and challenges associated with the uncertain value of the acquired business or assets, the difficulty of assimilating operations and personnel, integrating acquired technologies and products and maintaining the loyalty of the customers of the acquired business.\n\u2022Competitive Technologies. There is a risk that our competitors may develop technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to our technology.\n\u2022Competition in General. There are risks inherent in the market for business application software and related services, which has been and continues to be intensely competitive; for example, some of our competitors may become more aggressive with their prices and/or payment terms, which may adversely affect our profit margins.\nFor more information, please see Risk Factors\u201d in Item 1A. above.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nFor information with respect to recent accounting pronouncements, if any, and the impact of these pronouncements on our consolidated financial statements, if any, see Note 1(n) of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Form 10-K.\nMarket Conditions by Operating Segment\nWe operate and manage our business in three segments based on software and services provided in three key product markets: (1) SCM, which provides collaborative supply chain solutions to streamline and optimize the production, distribution and management of products between trading partners; (2) IT Consulting, which consists of IT staffing and consulting services; and (3) Other, which consists of (i) American Software ERP, a provider of purchasing and materials management, customer order processing, financial, human resources, and manufacturing solutions, and (ii) unallocated corporate overhead expenses. The SCM segment includes the businesses of Logility and DMI.\nOur SCM segment experienced a 5% decrease in revenue during fiscal 2021 when compared to fiscal 2020, primarily due to a 60% decrease in license fees, a 17% decrease in professional services and other revenue and an 8% decrease in maintenance revenue partially offset by a 31% increase in subscription fees. Our SCM segment experienced a 10% increase in revenue during fiscal 2020 when compared to fiscal 2019, primarily due to a 57% increase in subscription fees, a 12% increase in professional services and other revenue and a 5% increase in license fees partially offset by a 5% decrease in maintenance revenue.\nOur IT Consulting segment experienced an approximately 6% increase in revenue in fiscal 2021 when compared to fiscal 2020 and a 10% decrease in revenue in fiscal 2020 when compared to fiscal 2019, due primarily to fluctuations in IT staffing work at our largest customer. As companies have moved to cut costs and limit IT budgets, they have utilized more outsourcing services, which tend to be more cost effective for them. In the past, this trend has resulted in increased business for this segment. However, there is a countervailing trend to outsource IT to international markets that historically have been more price competitive than domestic sources like us. Our largest consulting customer comprised 29% of our IT Consulting revenue in fiscal 2021, 33% in fiscal 2020 and 47% in fiscal 2019. The loss of this customer would negatively and materially affect our IT Consulting business.\nThe Other segment revenue decreased 14% in fiscal 2021 when compared to fiscal 2020, primarily due to a 93% decrease in license fees, a 13% decrease in professional services and other revenue and a 1% decrease in maintenance revenue. The Other segment revenue increased 2% in fiscal 2020 when compared to fiscal 2019, primarily due to a 70% increase in license fees and a 4% increase in professional services and other revenue, partially offset by a 6% decrease in maintenance revenue.\nREVENUE\nTable 15: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Years Ended April 30, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>% Change </td> <td> </td> <td>% of Total Revenue </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2021 vs. 2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 vs. 2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Subscription fees </td> <td>$ </td> <td>28,877 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>22,033 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>14,026 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>31 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>57 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>26 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>19 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>13 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>License fees </td> <td>2,993 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,582 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,126 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(61) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>6 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>3 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>7 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>6 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Professional service and other </td> <td>39,616 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>42,774 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>42,154 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(7) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>1 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>35 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>37 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>39 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Maintenance </td> <td>39,922 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>43,077 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>45,400 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(7) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>(5) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>36 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>37 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>42 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Total revenue </td> <td>$ </td> <td>111,408 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>115,466 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>108,706 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(4) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>6 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>100 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>100 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>100 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor the year ended April 30, 2021, the 4% decrease in total revenue was attributable primarily to a 61% decrease in license revenue, a 7% decrease in professional services and other revenue and a 7% decrease in maintenance revenue partially offset by a 31% increase in subscription fees revenue.\nFor the year ended April 30, 2020, the 6% increase in total revenue was attributable primarily to a 57% increase in subscription fees revenue, a 6% increase in license revenue and a 1% increase in professional services and other revenue, partially offset by a 5% decrease in maintenance revenue.\nDue to intensely competitive markets, we discount subscription and license fees from our published list price due to pricing pressure in our industry. Numerous factors contribute to the amount of the discounts provided, such as previous customer purchases, the number of customer sites utilizing the software, the number of modules purchased and the number of users, the type of platform deployment, as well as the overall size of the contract. While all these factors affect the discount amount of a particular contract, the overall percentage discount has not materially changed in the recent reported fiscal periods.\nThe change in our revenue from period to period is primarily due to the volume of products and related services sold in any period and the amounts of products or modules purchased with each sale.\nInternational revenue represented approximately 15% of total revenue for the year ended April 30, 2021, 19% of total revenue for the year ended April 30, 2020, and 20% for the year ended April 30, 2019. Our international revenue may fluctuate substantially from period to period primarily because we derive these revenue from a relatively small number of customers.\nSubscription Fees Revenue\nTable 16: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Years Ended April 30, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>% Change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2021 vs. 2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 vs. 2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Supply Chain Management </td> <td>$ </td> <td>28,877 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>22,033 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>14,026 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>31 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>57 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total subscription fees revenue </td> <td>$ </td> <td>28,877 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>22,033 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>14,026 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>31 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>57 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor the year ended April 30, 2021, subscription fee revenue increased by 31% when compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to an increase in Cloud Services Annual Contract Value (\"ACV\") of approximately 53% to $26.4 million compared to $17.3 million in the same period of the prior year. This increase was attributable to an increase in the number of contracts, contracts with a higher Cloud Services ACV, as well as an increase in the value of multi-year contracts (typically three to five years). This is evidence of our successful transition to the cloud subscription model. ACV is a forward-looking operating measure used by management to better understand Cloud Services (SaaS and other related cloud services) revenue trends within our business, as it reflects our current estimate of revenue to be generated under existing client contracts in the forward 12-month period.\nLicense Fees Revenue\nTable 17: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Years Ended April 30, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>% Change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2021 vs. 2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 vs. 2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Supply Chain Management </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,977 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>7,354 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>6,992 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(60) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>5 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other </td> <td>16 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>228 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>134 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(93) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>70 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total license fees revenue </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,993 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>7,582 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>7,126 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(61) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>6 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor the year ended April 30, 2021, license fee revenue decreased by 61% when compared to the previous year. Our Other business segment experienced a 93% decrease in license fees for the year ended April 30, 2021 when compared to the same period in the prior year due to the timing of selling into the installed customer base. Our SCM segment experienced a 60% decrease in license fees primarily due to a decrease in the number of new customers choosing to deploy our software on-premise this year. We anticipate that the majority of future license fee sales will be to existing on-premise customers for add-on expansion. The SCM segment constituted 99%, 97% and 98% of our total license fee revenue for the years ended April 30, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nFor the year ended April 30, 2020, license fee revenue increased by 6% when compared to the previous year. Our Other business segment experienced a 70% increase in license fees for the year ended April 30, 2020 when compared to the same period in the prior year due to the timing of selling into the installed customer base. SCM experienced a 5% increase in license fees primarily due to a few new customers choosing to deploy our software on-premise. SCM constituted 97% and 98% of our total license fee revenue for the years ended April 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nThe direct sales channel provided approximately 83% of license fee revenue for the year ended April 30, 2021, compared to approximately 92% in fiscal 2020 and 84% in fiscal 2019. The decrease in direct license fees from fiscal 2020 to fiscal 2021 was largely due to one large license fee deal to a new customer last year compared to none this year. The increase in direct license fees from fiscal 2019 to fiscal 2020 was largely due to our indirect channel selling proportionately more SaaS than license contracts compared to our direct channel.\nFor the year ended April 30, 2021, our margins after commissions on direct sales were approximately 84%, and our margins after commissions on indirect sales were approximately 58%. For the year ended April 30, 2020, our margins after commissions on\ndirect sales were approximately 88%, and our margins after commissions on indirect sales were approximately 53%. For the year ended April 30, 2019, our margins after commissions on direct sales were approximately 87%, and our margins after commissions on indirect sales were approximately 55%. The margins after commissions for direct sales were relatively consistent, between 84% to 88%, while the range for indirect sales had a wider spread of 53% to 58%. The indirect channel margins for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2021 increased when compared to the same periods in the prior year due to the mix of value-added reseller ( VAR\u201d) commission rates. DMI is responsible for the bulk of our indirect sales and the commission percentage varies based on whether the sale is domestic or international.\nProfessional Services and Other Revenue\nTable 18: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Years Ended April 30, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>% Change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2021 vs. 2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 vs. 2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Supply Chain Management </td> <td>$ </td> <td>19,713 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>23,782 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>21,190 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(17) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>12 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>IT Consulting </td> <td>19,036 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17,997 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>20,007 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>(10) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other </td> <td>867 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>995 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>957 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(13) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>4 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total professional services and other revenue </td> <td>$ </td> <td>39,616 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>42,774 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>42,154 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(7) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>1 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe 7% decrease in total professional services and other revenue for the year ended April 30, 2021 was due to a 17% decrease in our SCM segment professional services due primarily due to lower implementation project work resulting from lower subscription and license fee sales in the first three quarters of fiscal 2021, combined with a 13% decrease in our Other segment due to lower utilization from project implementation services and services activity. This increase was partially offset by a 6% increase in our IT consulting segment due to the timing of project work.\nThe 1% increase in total professional services and other revenue for the year ended April 30, 2020 was due to a 12% increase from our SCM segment due primarily due to a ramp up of implementation project work resulting from increased subscription and license fee sales in recent periods, combined with a 4% increase in our Other segment due to utilization from project implementation services and services revenue. This increase was partially offset by an 10% decrease in our IT consulting segment due to the timing of project work.\nIn our software segments, we have observed that there is a tendency for professional services and other revenue to lag changes in license revenue by one to three quarters, as new licenses in one quarter often involve implementation and consulting services in subsequent quarters, for which we recognize revenue only as we perform those services.\nMaintenance Revenue\nTable 19: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Years Ended April 30, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>% Change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2021 vs. 2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 vs. 2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Supply Chain Management </td> <td>$ </td> <td>38,701 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>41,848 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>44,088 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(8) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>(5) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other </td> <td>1,221 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,229 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,312 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>(6) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total maintenance revenue </td> <td>$ </td> <td>39,922 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>43,077 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>45,400 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(7) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>(5) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe 7% decrease in total maintenance revenue for the year ended April 30, 2021 was due to a 1% decrease in our Other segment due to fewer customer renewals and an 8% decrease in maintenance revenue from our SCM segment due to normal customer attrition and customers converting from on-premise support to our SaaS cloud platform.\nThe 5% decrease in total maintenance revenue for the year ended April 30, 2020 was due to a 6% decrease in our Other segment due to fewer customer renewals and a 5% decrease in maintenance revenue from our SCM segment due to normal customer attrition.\nThe SCM segment's maintenance revenue constituted 97% of total maintenance revenue for the years ended April 30, 2021, 2021, 2020 and 2019. Typically, our maintenance revenue has had a direct relationship to current and historic license fee revenue, since new licenses are the potential source of new maintenance customers.\nGROSS MARGIN\nThe following table provides both dollar amounts and percentage measures of gross margin:\nTable 20: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Years Ended April 30, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(in thousands) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross margin on subscriptions fees </td> <td>$ </td> <td>16,993 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>59 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>12,542 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>57 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>8,267 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>59 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross margin on license fees </td> <td>1,072 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>36 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>2,784 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>37 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>696 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross margin on professional services and other </td> <td>10,523 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>27 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>12,079 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>28 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>10,733 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>25 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross margin on maintenance </td> <td>32,392 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>81 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>35,753 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>83 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>37,044 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>82 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total gross margin </td> <td>$ </td> <td>60,980 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>54 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>63,158 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>55 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>56,740 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>52 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe total gross margin percentage for the year ended April 30, 2021 decreased to 54% when compared to the same period in the prior year due to decreases in gross margin percentage for professional services and other gross margins, license fees margins and maintenance gross margins, partially offset by an increase in subscription fees. The total gross margin percentage for the year ended April 30, 2020 increased to 55% when compared to the same period in the prior year due to increases in gross margin percentage for license fees, professional services and other gross margins and maintenance gross margins, partially offset by a decrease in subscription fees margins.\nGross Margin on Subscription Fees\nFor the year ended April 30, 2021, our gross margin percentage on subscription fees increased from 57% in fiscal 2020 to 59% primarily due to an increase in subscription revenue and lower capitalized software amortization expense.\nFor the year ended April 30, 2020, our gross margin percentage on subscription fees decreased from 59% in fiscal 2019 to 57% primarily due to an increase in capitalized software amortization expense.\nGross Margin on License Fees\nThe decrease in license fee gross margin percentage for the year ended April 30, 2021 when compared to fiscal 2020 was primarily due to lower license fee revenue.\nThe increase in license fee gross margin percentage for the year ended April 30, 2020 when compared to fiscal 2019 was primarily due to lower agent commission and amortization of intangibles expense and to a lesser extent higher license fee revenue.\nLicense fee gross margin percentage tends to be directly related to the level of license fee revenue due to the relatively fixed cost of capitalized software amortization expense, amortization of acquired software and the sales mix between our direct and indirect channels.\nGross Margin on Professional Services and Other\nFor the year ended April 30, 2021, our gross margin percentage on professional services and other decreased from 28% in fiscal 2020 to 27% primarily because our IT Consulting segment professional services and other revenue gross margin decreased from 18% in fiscal 2020 to 17% in fiscal 2021 due to a decrease in project utilization rates. Our other segment decreased from 53% in fiscal 2020 to 41% in fiscal 2021 due to a slower ramp up of project work. Our SCM segment professional services and other gross margin was 35% for both fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020.\nFor the year ended April 30, 2020, our gross margin percentage on professional services and other increased from 25% in fiscal 2019 to 28% due to increased gross margins in our SCM segment which increased from 28% in fiscal 2019 to 35% in fiscal 2020 due to increased revenue and higher billing utilization. Our IT Consulting segment professional services and other revenue\ngross margin decreased from 22% in fiscal 2019 to 18% in fiscal 2020 due to a decrease in project related billing. Our other segment increased from 47% in fiscal 2019 to 53% in fiscal 2020 due to improved billing utilization rates.\nAs discussed above, our IT Consulting segment typically has lower margins when compared to the Other segments that have higher margin implementation service revenue. The IT Consulting segment was 48%, 42% and 47% of the Company's professional services and other revenue in fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Our SCM segment was 50%, 56% and 50% of the Company's professional services and other revenue in fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Our Other segment was 2%, 2% and 3% of the Company's professional services and other revenue in fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nGross Margin on Maintenance\nMaintenance gross margin decreased to 81% in fiscal 2021 from 83% in fiscal 2020 due to lower maintenance revenue cost containment efforts. The primary cost component is maintenance staffing, which is relatively inelastic in the short term.\nMaintenance gross margin increased to 83% in fiscal 2020 from 82% in fiscal 2019 due to cost containment efforts. The primary cost component is maintenance staffing, which is relatively inelastic in the short term.\nEXPENSES\nTable 21: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>

2021, gross product research and development costs and capitalized software development costs decreased by 5% primarily due to a decrease in headcount from third-party contractors compared to fiscal 2020. Capitalized software development costs decreased in fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 due to the timing of project work and an increase in agile software programming that accelerates the software releases to weeks from months. We expect capitalized software to be\nimmaterial in fiscal 2022. Amortization of capitalized software development decreased 28% in fiscal 2021 when compared to fiscal 2020 as some projects were fully amortized.\nFor the year ended April 30, 2020, gross product research and development costs and capitalized software development costs decreased by 3% primarily due to a decrease in headcount from third-party contractors compared to fiscal 2019. Capitalized software development costs decreased in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 due to the timing of project work. Amortization of capitalized software development increased 27% in fiscal 2020 when compared to fiscal 2019 due to the timing of project releases.\nSales and Marketing\nFor the year ended April 30, 2021, the decrease in sales and marketing expenses compared to fiscal 2020 was due primarily to lower marketing spend, including a reduction in trade shows and conferences and lower travel costs due to COVID-19. Fiscal 2021 was impacted by COVID-19 for the entire year versus fiscal 2020.\nFor the year ended April 30, 2020, the increase in sales and marketing expenses compared to fiscal 2019 was due primarily to an increase in headcount, higher variable compensation, higher sales commissions, an increase in contractor costs and an increase in recruiting fees, which was partially offset by lower marketing spend and lower travel costs due to COVID-19.\nGeneral and Administrative\nFor the year ended April 30, 2021, general and administrative expenses remained relatively flat when compared to fiscal 2020 primarily due to a reduction in variable compensation, legal fees and cost containment efforts of overhead costs, partially offset by an increase in insurance and benefit expenses.\nFor the year ended April 30, 2020, the increase in general and administrative expenses compared to fiscal 2019 was primarily due to higher variable compensation and higher overhead costs and, to a lesser extent, higher legal, stock option and insurance costs.\nThe total number of employees was 424 on April 30, 2021, 428 on April 30, 2020 and 424 on April 30, 2019.\nAmortization of Acquisition-related Intangible Assets\nFor the year ended April 30, 2021, we recorded $0.8 million in intangible amortization expense, of which $0.2 million is included in operating expenses and $0.6 million is included in cost of license fees.\nFor the year ended April 30, 2020, we recorded $1.6 million in intangible amortization expense, of which $0.3 million is included in operating expenses and $1.3 million is included in cost of license fees.\nOperating Income/(Loss)\nTable 23: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Years Ended April 30, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>% Change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2021 vs. 2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 vs. 2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Supply Chain Management </td> <td>$ </td> <td>18,922 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>19,612 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>15,967 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(4) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>23 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>IT Consulting </td> <td>456 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>332 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>964 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>37 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>(66) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other* </td> <td>(15,017) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(13,896) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(11,655) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>19 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Operating Income </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,361 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>6,048 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,276 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(28) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>15 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\n______________\n* Includes certain unallocated expenses.\nOur SCM segment operating income decreased by 4% in fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 primarily due to a 5% decrease in revenue. Our SCM segment operating income increased by 23% in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 primarily due to a 10% increase in revenue.\nOur IT Consulting segment operating income increased 37% in fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 primarily due to a 6% increase in revenue due to the type of project billing. Our IT Consulting segment operating income decreased 66% in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2019 primarily due to a decrease in revenue and lower gross margins due to the type of project billing.\nThe increase in the Other segment operating loss in fiscal 2021 when compared to fiscal 2020 was due primarily to a 14% decrease in revenue and an increase in variable compensation and benefit costs. The increase in the Other segment operating loss in fiscal 2020 when compared to fiscal 2019 was due primarily to an increase in variable compensation and overhead costs, partially offset by a 2% increase in revenue in fiscal 2020.\nOther Income\nOther income is comprised of net interest and dividend income, rental income net of related depreciation expenses, exchange rate gains and losses, realized and unrealized gains and losses from investments. Other income was approximately $4.5 million in the year ended April 30, 2021 compared to $0.8 million in fiscal 2020. The increase was primarily due to unrealized gains of $3.6 million in fiscal 2021 compared to unrealized losses of $0.1 million for the same period last year, lower interest income of $0.4 million in fiscal 2021 compared to $1.5 million in fiscal 2020 and exchange rate gains of approximately $53,000 compared to losses of $605,000 for the same period last year.\nOther income was approximately $0.8 million in the year ended April 30, 2020 compared to $2.4 million in fiscal 2019. The decrease was primarily due to unrealized losses of $0.1 million in fiscal 2020 compared to unrealized gains of $1.0 million in fiscal 2019, lower interest income of $1.5 million in fiscal 2020 compared to $2.1 million in fiscal 2019 and higher exchange rate losses of approximately $605,000 compared to $486,000 for the same period last year.\nFor the years ended April 30, 2021 and 2020, our investments generated an annualized yield of approximately 1.7% and 1.4%, respectively.\nIncome Taxes\nDuring the year ended April 30, 2021, we recorded income tax expense of $759,000 compared to $56,000 in fiscal 2020 and $838,000 in fiscal 2019. Our effective income tax rate takes into account the source of taxable income by state and available income tax credits. Our effective tax rate was 8.6%, 1%, and 11% in fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The effective tax rate for fiscal 2021 is higher compared to fiscal 2020 due to a decrease in the amount of excess tax benefits from stock option deductions and a decrease in foreign tax credits.\nOperating Pattern\nWe experience an irregular pattern of quarterly and annual operating results, caused primarily by fluctuations in both the number and size of software contracts received and delivered from quarter to quarter and our ability to recognize revenue in that quarter and annually in accordance with our revenue recognition policies. We expect this pattern to continue.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nSources and Uses of Cash\nWe have historically funded, and continue to fund, our operations and capital expenditures primarily with cash generated from operating activities. The changes in net cash that our operating activities provide generally reflect the changes in net earnings and non-cash operating items plus the effect of changes in operating assets and liabilities, such as investment trading securities, trade accounts receivable, trade accounts payable, accrued expenses and deferred revenue. We have no debt obligations or off-balance sheet financing arrangements, and therefore we used no cash for debt service purposes.\nThe following tables provide information about our cash flows and liquidity positions as of and for the fiscal years ended April 30, 2021, 2020 and 2019. You should read these tables and the discussion that follows in conjunction with our consolidated statements of cash flows contained in Item 8 of this report.\nTable 24: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Years ended\nApril 30, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(in thousands) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by operating activities </td> <td>$ </td> <td>17,756 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>25,982 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>23,930 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash used in investing activities </td> <td>(1,298) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(3,590) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(7,213) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash used in financing activities </td> <td>(7,614) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(3,866) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(8,223) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net change in cash and cash equivalents </td> <td>$ </td> <td>8,844 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>18,526 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>8,494 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe decrease in cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 was due primarily to: (1) a decrease in the net proceeds from sales and maturities of trading securities due to timing of sales and maturity dates, (2) unrealized\ngains on investments due to timing of sales of investments, (3) lower depreciation and amortization expense due to several capitalized software projects and intangible assets being fully amortized and (4) a lower increase in accounts payable and other liabilities during fiscal 2021, when compared to a higher increase in fiscal 2020 due primarily to timing and the amount of sales commissions and bonuses.\nThese factors were partially offset by: (1) a decrease in the purchases of trading securities due to timing, (2) the decrease in accounts receivable was more significant in fiscal 2020 compared to fiscal 2021 due to timing of sales and billing, (3) an increase in prepaid expenses and other assets in fiscal 2021 compared to the decrease in fiscal 2020 due to timing of purchases, (4) an increase in deferred revenue in fiscal 2021 when compared to fiscal 2020 primarily due to the timing of cloud and maintenance revenue recognition, (5) an increase in net earnings, (6) higher stock-based compensation expense in fiscal 2021 due to an increase in options granted and (7) a decrease in deferred income taxes in fiscal 2021 compared to fiscal 2020 due to timing.\nThe decrease in cash used in investing activities in fiscal 2021 compared to cash used in investing activities in fiscal 2020 was due to: a decrease in capitalized software development costs due to the timing of R&D efforts and partially offset by higher purchases of equipment.\nThe increase in cash used in financing activities in fiscal 2021 when compared to fiscal 2020 was due primarily to: a decrease in proceeds from exercise of stock options, partially offset by an increase in cash dividends paid on common stock in fiscal 2021 due to an increase in the number of shares outstanding.\nThe following table provides information regarding the changes in our total cash and investments position:\nTable 25: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>As of April 30, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(in thousands) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash and cash equivalents </td> <td>$ </td> <td>88,658 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>79,814 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investments </td> <td>16,006 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14,862 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total cash and investments </td> <td>$ </td> <td>104,664 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>94,676 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net increase in total cash and investments </td> <td>9,988 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,194 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs of April 30, 2021, we had $104.7 million in total cash and investments with no outstanding debt, and believe that our sources of liquidity and capital resources will be sufficient to satisfy our presently anticipated requirements for working capital, capital expenditures and other"}
