Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThe following Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (\"MD&A\") is intended to help the reader understand our results of operations, financial condition and our current business environment. This MD&A is provided as a supplement to-and should be read in conjunction with-our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes thereto included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nThis MD&A is organized into the following sections:\n\u2022Restatement and Related Actions-a brief overview of the Restatement and related legal proceedings; and the related costs and expenses.\n\u2022Overview of Osiris-a general description of our business, products and history.\n\u2022Critical Accounting Policies-a discussion of accounting policies that require critical judgments and estimates.\n\u2022Recent and Pending Accounting Pronouncements-a discussion of recent and pending accounting policies under review by us that require critical judgments and estimates.\n\u2022Results of Operations-an analysis of our consolidated results of operations for the three years presented in our consolidated financial statements.\n\u2022Quarterly Results of Operations-an analysis of our consolidated unaudited quarterly results of operations for the quarterly periods in 2017, 2016 and 2015.\n\u2022Liquidity and Capital Resources-an analysis of our liquidity and financial positions; cash flows; off-balance sheet arrangements and aggregate contractual obligations.\nRestatement and Related Actions\nAs discussed in the 2014 Form 10-K/A and the Explanatory Note, we restated our audited financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2014 in the 2014 Form 10-K/A.\nWe have restated our unaudited interim financial statements for the quarters ended March 31, 2015, June 30, 2015 and September 30, 2015 in this Form 10-K. For more information about the 2015 Interim Period Restatement, see Note 15 to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. The determination to restate our financial statements was made by the Audit\nCommittee upon management's recommendation to address discovered errors. As a result of the Restatement, we have become subject to a number of additional costs and risks, including costs for accounting and legal fees in connection with or related to the Restatement and the remediation of material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. In addition, we have been subject to stockholder, governmental and other actions in connection with the Restatement and related matters. See \"Legal Proceedings\" in Part I, Item 3 of this Form 10-K and the risks described under the heading \"Risks Related to the Restatement of Financial Statements and Failure to File SEC Reports\" under \"Risk Factors\" in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K.\nExpenses Incurred\nIn 2017 and 2016, we recorded $9.5 million and $8.1 million, respectively, of expenses for professional fees related to the Restatement and the related legal proceedings. These expenses are included in \"General and administrative expenses\" in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss). These expenses, all of which were expensed as incurred, include costs of (i) outside professionals engaged by the Audit Committee and a special committee of the Board to review certain matters related to the Restatement; (ii) outside accounting professionals we engaged to assist with the Restatement and recommend improvements to our internal control over financial reporting; (iii) our former independent registered public accounting firm related to its re-audit of our 2014 consolidated financial statements as part of the Restatement, (iv) our current independent registered public accounting firm related to its audits of our 2015 and 2016 consolidated financial statements incurred, (v) reimbursement of expenses of certain current and former officers and directors related to legal proceedings; and (vi) our outside legal counsel related to these matters.\nLegal Proceedings\nAs previously disclosed, we believe that both the previously disclosed SEC and SDNY investigations are now concluded with respect to the Company. In November 2017, we paid a civil penalty in the amount of $1.5 million as part of the SEC settlement, which we recorded as an expense in the fourth quarter of 2015. The SEC civil case is continuing against four of our former officers. We are currently advancing expenses incurred by three of these former officers.\nAs discussed above, on March 11, 2018, we entered into a memorandum of understanding to settle the securities class action lawsuit. By the terms of the memorandum, the Company agreed in principle to a total payment of $18.5 million in cash, which was recorded as an expense in the fourth quarter of 2015. A definitive settlement agreement resulting from the memorandum is expected to be entered into in the second quarter of 2018 and will require court approval. Of the $18.5 million settlement payment, we expect to be reimbursed approximately $4.8 million from our insurance carrier, which we recorded as a receivable in the fourth quarter of 2015.\nFuture Costs\nWe expect to continue to incur significant legal and other professional services expenses associated with the Restatement and the resolution of the related legal proceedings in 2018. We will recognize these expenses as services are received. Costs related to the Restatement that may be incurred in 2018 may also include payments of expenses incurred by certain current and former officers and directors related to these matters; and incremental expenses for remediation activities related to improving our internal control over financial reporting.\nInsurance Coverage\nWe maintained $5.0 million of director's and officer's liability insurance coverage during the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015. Approximately $0.2 million has been paid to us as of December 31, 2017 for reimbursable expenses incurred by us and the remaining $4.8 million will be used to contribute to the settlement of the securities class action described above.\nRemediation\nOur management, with the oversight of the Audit Committee, has undertaken a plan to remediate our material weaknesses. Our remediation efforts are intended to address the identified material weaknesses as well as to strengthen our overall financial control environment. See Part II, Item 9A, \"Controls and Procedures\" of this Form 10-K for more information about the material weaknesses and our remediation activities.\nOverview of Osiris\nOsiris Therapeutics, Inc. researches, develops, manufactures, markets and sells regenerative medicine products intended to improve the health and lives of patients and lower overall healthcare costs. We have achieved commercial success with products in orthopedics, sports medicine and wound care, including the Grafix product line, Stravix, BIO4 and Cartiform. We continue to advance our R&D by focusing on innovation in regenerative medicine, including the development of bioengineered stem cell and tissue-based products.\nWe are a fully integrated company, having developed capabilities in research and development, manufacturing, marketing and sales of our products. We are focused on the long-term commercial growth of the Company through the delivery of differentiated products for use across multiple fields of medicine with clear value propositions to patients, healthcare providers and third-party payors.\nOur History\nWe began operations in 1992 and were a Delaware corporation until, with the approval of our stockholders, we reincorporated as a Maryland corporation in May 2010.\nFrom May 2010 to October 2013, we operated as two business segments, therapeutics and biosurgery. Our therapeutics business focused on developing biologic stem cell drug candidates from a readily available source-adult bone marrow. Our biosurgery business, now our only segment, focuses on using unique tissue preservation technologies to develop viable human tissue products designed to improve wound closure and surgical outcomes for patients and physicians over standard of care alone.\nIn October 2013, we sold our therapeutics business, including Prochymal, a stem cell drug for treatment of graft versus host disease, and related assets, to Mesoblast. The agreement with Mesoblast provided for the receipt of $50 million in initial consideration and up to an additional $50 million in payments upon Mesoblast achieving certain clinical and regulatory milestones.\nSince 2013, we have focused our resources on our biosurgery business and have built a substantial direct sales force dedicated exclusively to sell our Grafix and Stravix products. As a result, sales of our Grafix products increased significantly. However, the contribution of our Grafix product line to our operating income has been limited due to the heavy investment in sales and marketing. We operate in a competitive and challenging business environment and recognize that our execution of our product development and market penetration strategy will face a number of challenges. As a result, we may experience variability in our overall results, and in our quarter to quarter revenue.\nIn September 2013, we received the Untitled Letter from the FDA stating that Grafix and Ovation did not meet the definition of a 361 HCT/P. Among the grounds for the FDA's position were our marketing claims, including wound healing claims for Grafix. We revised all of our marketing claims for Grafix and resolved all issues with the Untitled Letter, which included the discontinuance of Ovation in 2014. Grafix remains on the market as a 361 HCT/P. Production of Ovation was discontinued in the third quarter of 2014 and we sold or shipped to consignees all of our remaining Ovation inventory by the end of October 2014.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2014, we executed marketing and distribution agreements with the Stryker and Arthrex for the distribution of BIO4 and Cartiform, respectively. Sales under these exclusive distribution arrangements commenced in 2015.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (\"GAAP\") requires management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported. Due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making those assumptions, actual results could differ from those estimates. We believe that the most significant estimates that affect our financial statements are those that relate to the fair value of our available for sale investments, the amounts of our deferred tax assets and liabilities and related valuation allowance, the net realizable value of inventory and related allowance for obsolescence, the ultimate realizability of our accounts receivable and estimates of collectability, the reserve for sales returns, and the fair value of our share-based awards. Note 2, \"Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,\" to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.\nThe policies and estimates discussed in this section are considered critical because they had or could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and because they require significant judgments, assumptions or estimates. We base our estimates on historical experience and other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates and such differences could be material. We have reviewed these critical accounting policies and related disclosures with the Audit Committee.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe recognize revenue from the sales of our products when (i) title and the risk of loss pass to the customer; (ii) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; (iii) sales amounts are fixed and determinable; and (iv) collectability is reasonably assured. Due to the nature of the products and the manufacturing process, we generally do not allow sales returns or refunds unless the product is returned in the original shipping container and is determined to be salable.\nTitle and the risk of loss generally passes to the customer upon receipt of the product by our customer when acceptance of ownership risks occurs. Many of our customers accept the risks of ownership only when they use (implant) our product; for shipments to these customers, title and risk of loss passes upon product use and prior to such use we classify products shipped to these customers as consignment inventory pending receipt of such notice.\nBased on our collection history with certain customers, collectability is not reasonably assured until actual cash payment is received. Thus, we recognize revenue for those customers when cash is received.\nWe record deferred revenue when we receive payments prior to the time we recognize revenue.\nInvestments and Other Comprehensive Income\nInvestments consist primarily of marketable securities with a total portfolio duration of approximately two years. Investments classified as available for sale are valued at their fair value, with unrealized gains and losses reported as a separate component of stockholders' equity in accumulated other comprehensive income. All realized gains and losses on our investments available for sale are recognized in results of operations when earned, as other income (expense), net.\nInvestments classified as available for sale are evaluated periodically to determine whether a decline in their value is \"other than temporary.\" The term \"other than temporary\" is not intended to\nindicate a permanent decline in value; rather, it means that the prospects for near term recovery of value is not necessarily favorable, or that there is a lack of evidence to support fair values equal to, or greater than, the carrying value of the security. We review criteria such as the magnitude and duration of the decline, as well as the reasons for the decline, to predict whether the loss in value is other than temporary. If a decline in value is determined to be other than temporary, the carrying value of the security is reduced and a corresponding charge to earnings is recognized.\nTrade Accounts Receivable\nAccounts receivable are reported at their net realizable value. We consider receivables outstanding longer than the time specified in the respective customer's contract to be past due. In making the determination of the appropriate allowance for doubtful accounts, management considers prior experience with customers, analysis of accounts receivable aging reports, changes in customer payment patterns, and historical write-offs.\nInventory Valuation\nInventory consists of raw materials, products in process, finished goods available for sale and products held by customers under consignment sales arrangements. We determine our inventory values using the first-in, first-out method. Inventory is valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value and excludes units that we anticipate distributing for clinical evaluation.\nValuation of Long-lived Assets\nWe review the carrying value of long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or group of assets may not be fully recoverable. Factors that would require an impairment assessment include, among other things, a significant change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used, a continual decline in our operating performance, or a fundamental change in our business condition. If an impairment indicator is present, we evaluate recoverability by a comparison of the carrying amount of the assets to future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the assets. Assets are grouped at the lowest level for which there is identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows generated by other asset groups. If the total of the expected undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset, an impairment loss is recognized for the difference between the fair value and carrying value of the asset group. Fair value is generally determined by estimates of discounted cash flows. The discount rate used in any estimate of discounted cash flows would be the rate required for a similar investment of like risk. There were no impairment losses recognized during the years 2017, 2016 or 2015.\nFair Value Accounting\nWe disclose the fair value of our financial assets in our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Fair value is defined as the price at which an asset could be exchanged or a liability transferred (an exit price) in an orderly transaction between knowledgeable, willing parties in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability. Where available, fair value is based on observable market prices or parameters or derived from such prices or parameters. Where observable prices or inputs are not available, valuation models are applied.\nWe estimated the fair value of stock options using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. Fair value is amortized on an accelerated basis over the requisite service periods of the awards. We generally issue stock option awards that vest over four years and have a ten-year contractual life. The\nfair value of stock options granted during each of the years was estimated using the following weighted-average assumptions:\nTable 11: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>Year ended\nDecember 31, </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>2017 </th> <th> </th> <th>2016 </th> <th> </th> <th>2015 </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest rate\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>1.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>1.8 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Dividend yield\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>0.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>0.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Term (in years)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6.2 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Volatility\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>71.9 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>67.4 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>69.4 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nInterest Rate-The risk-free interest rate was determined using the yield available for zero-coupon United States government issues with a remaining term approximating the expected life of the options.\nDividend-On September 16, 2015, we declared a non-recurring, special cash dividend to shareholders. We do not expect to pay a dividend in the foreseeable future, and as such, the expected dividend yield is zero.\nTerm-Since the Company has limited option exercise history, it has generally elected to estimate the expected life of an award based upon the SEC-approved \"simplified method\" noted under the provisions of Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 107 with the continued use of this method extended under the provisions of Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 110.\nVolatility-Expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of the Company's common stock, which we believe will be indicative of future experience.\nResearch and Development Costs\nOur R&D costs are expensed as incurred. R&D consists of expenses incurred in identifying, developing and testing tissue-based products. These expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses for personnel, fees paid to professional service providers for independent monitoring and analysis of our clinical studies, costs of contract research, costs of facilities, and costs of manufacturing clinical study materials and quality control supplies.\nIncome Taxes\nSignificant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes and income tax assets and liabilities, including evaluating uncertainties in the application of accounting principles and complex tax laws.\nDeferred tax liabilities and assets are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences of temporary differences, income tax credits and net operating loss carryforwards. Temporary differences are primarily the result of the differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their financial reporting values. Deferred tax liabilities and assets are measured by applying the enacted statutory tax rates applicable to the future years in which deferred tax liabilities or assets are expected to be settled or realized. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized. Income tax expense, if any, consists of the taxes payable for the current period and the change during the period in deferred tax assets and liabilities.\nWe recognize the impact of a tax position in our consolidated financial statements if that position is more likely than not to be sustained upon an examination based on the technical merits of the position. Although we believe that we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions, we can provide no assurance that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be materially different. We make adjustments to these reserves when facts and circumstances change, such as the closing of a tax\naudit or the refinement of an estimate. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences will affect the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made and could have a material impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The provision for income taxes includes the effects of any reserves that we believe are appropriate, as well as the related net interest and penalties.\nOn December 22, 2017, the President of the United States signed into law the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the \"Tax Act\") which included significant changes to the existing income tax laws for domestic corporations. Key features of the Tax Act effective in 2018 include:\n\u2022 Reduction of the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%;\n\u2022 Elimination of the alternative minimum tax (\"AMT\");\n\u2022 Refundability of AMT credit carryforwards as of December 31, 2017\n\u2022 Changes in the deductibility of certain aspects of executive compensation;\n\u2022 Changes in the deductibility of certain entertainment and recreation expenses; and\n\u2022 Changes in incentive tax breaks for U.S. production activities.\nAs a result of the refundability of the AMT credit carryforwards, we recorded a receivable of $1.5 million as of December 31, 2017. Because of our existing Federal net operating loss carryforwards and current expectations as to the recovery of our net deferred tax assets, we believe that the Tax Act will not have significant additional impacts on our financial results and financial position, including on our liquidity, for the foreseeable future. See Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nRecent and Pending Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for a full description of recent accounting pronouncements and our expectation of their impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nResults of Operations\nThe following tables setting forth selected financial data for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, 2015 and 2014 have been prepared in accordance with GAAP:\nTable 12: <table> <tr>

The agreement with Mesoblast provided for the receipt of $50 million in initial consideration and up to an additional $50 million in payments upon Mesoblast achieving certain clinical and regulatory milestones. In addition, we are entitled to earn single to low double-digit percentage cash royalties on future sales by Mesoblast of Prochymal and other products utilizing the acquired technology. Our former therapeutics business generated royalty revenue and related expenses in 2014.

As a result, the amount of product revenue and percentage of total in 2015 and 2014 represent sales of Grafix products only.\nAnnual Comparisons for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, 2015 and 2014\nRevenue\nRevenue was $118.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, which increased $9.1 million, or 8.4%, compared with revenue of $109.4 million in 2016. The increase in revenue was due to the following:\n\u2022 Grafix/Stravix revenue increased $3.0 million, or 3.7%, primarily due to increased market awareness and acceptance as we increased selling efforts.\n\u2022 BIO4 revenue increased $4.7 million, or 24.3%, primarily due to increased market presence through our distribution arrangement with Stryker.\n\u2022 Cartiform revenue increased $1.5 million, or 20.0%, primarily due to increased market presence through our distribution arrangement with Arthrex.\nRevenue was $109.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, which increased $29.7 million, or 37.2%, compared with revenue of $79.7 million in 2015.\n\u2022 Grafix/Stravix revenue increased $20.3 million, or 32.7%, due to continued marketing and sale of the products, increased Medicare coverage, and an increase in the size of our sales force. The Stravix product line was launched in late 2015.\n\u2022 BIO4 revenue increased $11.6 million, or 147.2%, primarily due to increased market awareness through our distribution arrangement with Stryker.\n\u2022 Cartiform revenue increased $2.4 million, or 47.2%, primarily due to increased market awareness through our distribution arrangement with Arthrex.\nRevenue was $79.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, which increased $28.9 million, or 56.8%, compared with revenue of $50.8 million in 2014.\n\u2022 Grafix revenue increased $26.0 million, or 72.0%, primarily due to expansion of our in-house sales and marketing teams, as well as increased sales from our third-party product distributors. In addition, Grafix obtained Medicare coverage in 2015, which further aided sales.\n\u2022 Commercial sales of BIO4 began in the second half of 2014. In the fourth quarter of 2014, we entered into an agreement with Stryker for the exclusive distribution of BIO4. The initial commercial sales of BIO4 under the distribution agreement began in the first quarter of 2015 resulting in an increase of revenue of $7.2 million in 2015 compared to 2014.\n\u2022 Commercial sales of our Cartiform product began in 2012. In the fourth quarter 2014, we entered into an agreement with Arthrex for the exclusive distribution of Cartiform. The initial commercial sales of Cartiform under the distribution agreement began in the first quarter of 2015 resulting in an increase in revenue of $3.4 million compared to 2014.\n\u2022 Production of Ovation was discontinued in the third quarter of 2014 and we sold or shipped to consignees all of our remaining Ovation inventory by the fourth quarter of 2014.\nGross Profit and Gross Margin\nGross profit is affected by a number of factors including product mix, cost of labor and raw materials, unit volumes, pricing, competition, new products, new customer programs, and capacity utilization. In the case of new products and new customer programs, profitability normally lags revenue growth due to product start-up costs, lower manufacturing volumes in the start-up phase, operational inefficiencies, and under-absorbed overhead. Gross margin can improve over time if manufacturing\nvolumes increase and if our utilization rates and overhead absorption improves. As a result of these and other factors, our gross margin may vary from period to period.\nGross profit was $85.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, which increased $7.2 million, or 9.1%, compared with gross profit of $78.6 million in 2016. Gross margin improved to 72.4% for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared with 71.9% in 2016. The primary reason for the increase in gross profit was an increase in pricing in late 2016, along with higher sales. Gross margin also improved as a result of manufacturing efficiencies from higher production volume.\nGross profit was $78.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, which increased $26.0 million, or 49.3%, compared with gross profit of $52.7 million in 2015. Gross margin improved to 71.9% for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared with 66.1% in 2015. The primary reason for the increase in gross profit was higher sales volume. Gross margin improved as a result of manufacturing efficiencies from higher production volume, the addition of a contract manufacturer for certain cadaveric tissue (which decreased production costs), and, in connection with the Restatement, the reversal of the recognition of revenue from two distributors in 2015, which we changed from the accrual basis of accounting to the cash basis of accounting, but continued to recognize the costs as products were shipped.\nGross profit was $52.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, which increased $11.7 million, or 28.7%, compared with gross profit of $40.9 million in 2014. Gross profit increased primarily due to higher sales volume. Gross margin decreased to 66.1% for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared with 80.6% in 2014. As noted above, in connection with the Restatement, we reversed the recognition of revenue from two distributors in 2015, which we changed from the accrual basis of accounting to the cash basis of accounting, but continued to recognize the costs as products were shipped.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nOur R&D expenses of $4.1 million in 2017 and $6.3 million in 2016 were primarily related to four clinical studies in 2017 and 2016. R&D expenses declined in 2017 compared to 2016, primarily due to the cancellation of three clinical studies in the fourth quarter of 2016 that began in 2015 and 2016 as we re-evaluated our market opportunities and research priorities.\nOur R&D expenses of $6.3 million in 2016 and $4.9 million in 2015 were primarily related to four clinical studies that began in 2015 and 2016. R&D expenses increased in 2016 compared to 2015, primarily due to the addition of clinical studies during 2016.\nOur R&D expenses of $4.9 million in 2015 with $3.4 million in 2014. The increase of $1.5 million in 2015 compared to 2014 was primarily related to clinical studies that began in 2015 to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of Grafix for the treatment of complex, diabetic foot wounds.\nSales and Marketing Expenses\nSales and marketing expenses totaled $61.5 million, or 50.1% of sales, during the year ended December 31, 2017, compared with $59.1million, or 54.0% of sales for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in sales and marketing expense of $2.4 million was primarily due to higher labor costs, including commissions.\nSales and marketing expenses totaled $59.1 million, or 54.0% of sales, during the year ended December 31, 2016, compared with $56.6 million, or 71.0% of sales for the year ended December 31, 2015. The $2.5 million increase in sales and marketing expense was primarily due to higher labor costs, including commissions.\nSales and marketing expenses totaled $56.6 million, or 71.0% of sales, during the year ended December 31, 2015, compared with $36.4 million, or 71.6% of sales for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase in sales and marketing expense of $20.2 million was primarily due to higher labor costs, including commissions of $13.8 million, and higher travel related costs of $2.7 million, higher contract services of $0.9 million, and higher costs in general as we expanded our sales, marketing and reimbursement support capabilities.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses totaled $22.1 million, or 18.7% of sales, during the year ended December 31, 2017, compared with $17.4 million, or 15.9% of sales, for the year ended December 31, 2016. This increase of $4.7 million was due to higher labor costs of $2.7 million, as we added finance, human resources, and information technology personnel to support operations, and higher professional fees of $1.9 million, primarily related to the Restatement and the related legal proceedings. In 2017, general and administrative expenses included $9.5 million of expenses for professional fees related to the Restatement and the related legal proceedings.\nGeneral and administrative expenses totaled $17.4 million, or 15.9% of sales, during the year ended December 31, 2016, compared with $9.5 million, or 11.9% of sales for the year ended December 31, 2015. This increase of $7.9 million was primarily due to higher professional fees, primarily related to the Restatement and the related legal matters. In 2016, general and administrative expenses included $8.1 million of expenses for professional fees related to the Restatement and the related legal proceedings.\nGeneral and administrative expenses totaled $9.5 million, or 11.9% of sales, during the year ended December 31, 2015, compared with $8.1 million, or 16.0% of sales for the year ended December 31, 2014. This increase of $1.4 million was primarily due to higher professional fees. In 2015, general and administrative expenses included $0.5 million of expenses for professional fees related to the Restatement and the related legal proceedings.\nSettlement of SEC and Shareholder Actions\nIn November 2017, we paid a civil penalty in the amount of $1.5 million as part of the SEC settlement with regard to the SEC investigation previously discussed, all of which was recorded as expenses in the fourth quarter of 2015. As discussed above, we are a party to a securities class action and multiple shareholder derivative actions. On March 11, 2018, we entered into a memorandum of understanding to settle the securities class action lawsuit. By the terms of the memorandum, the Company agreed in principle to a total payment of $18.5 million in cash. A definitive settlement agreement resulting from the memorandum is expected to be entered into in the second quarter of 2018 and will require court approval. Of the $18.5 million settlement payment, we expect to be reimbursed approximately $4.8 million from our insurance carrier, which we recorded as a receivable in 2015. As a result, we recorded the net amount of $13.7 million as a pretax expense in the fourth quarter of 2015.\nOther Income (Expense), net\nOther expense, net in 2017 was $0.6 million, a decrease of $1.2 million compared to other income, net of $0.4 million in 2016. The decrease is primarily due to a loss recognized in 2017 on the sale of Mesoblast Limited common stock.\nOther income, net in 2016 was $0.4 million, an increase of $2.1 million compared to other expense net of $1.7 million in 2015. The increase is primarily due to a loss recognized in 2015 related to Mesoblast Limited common stock.\nOther expense, net in 2015 was $1.7 million, which was comparable to other expense net of $1.8 million in 2014.\nIncome Taxes\nIncome tax benefit from continuing operations for 2017 was $1.4 million primarily due to the release of the valuation allowance on the AMT carryforwards, offset by state tax expense where the Company did not have state credit or net operating losses available.\nIncome tax expense from continuing operations for 2016 was $0.1 million primarily due to state tax obligations.\nIncome tax expense from continuing operations for 2015 was $0.5 million and was primarily due to an uncertain tax position relating to state taxes, compared to the expense from continuing operations of $0.1 million in 2014, which consisted primarily of AMT and state taxes.\nBecause realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon future earnings, a full valuation allowance has been recorded on the net deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, which relate primarily to net operating loss and various business tax credit carryforwards. In the event that we become profitable, we have general business credits (before a 100% valuation allowance) of approximately $0.4 million that may be utilized to reduce our federal tax. As discussed above under \"Critical Accounting Policies-Income Taxes,\" the Tax Act enacted on December 22, 2017 reduced the U.S. corporate income tax rate from a maximum of 35% to 21% and reduced the valuation allowance previously recognized on AMT credit carryforwards, which will be refundable credits.\nMesoblast Income (Loss) from Discontinued Operations\nAs noted above, in October 2013, we sold our therapeutics business to Mesoblast. The agreement with Mesoblast provided for the receipt of $50 million in initial consideration and up to an additional $50 million in payments upon Mesoblast achieving certain clinical and regulatory milestones. In addition, we are entitled to earn royalties on future sales by Mesoblast of Prochymal and other products utilizing the acquired technology. We received all of the initial consideration by April 2014, consisting of $35 million in cash and $15 million of Mesoblast Limited common stock which we classified as a trading security. The Mesoblast Limited common stock was subject to a holding period which was ultimately extended to May 2015. During this holding period, Mesoblast Limited provided us limited protection against a decline in the market value of the stock. In May 2015, concurrent with the expiration of the holding period, Mesoblast paid us $6.2 million representing the decline in the market value of the stock through that date. Later in 2015, we sold all of the Mesoblast Limited common stock for $6.8 million, resulting in a realized loss of $2.6 million, which was recorded in other income (expense), net in our consolidated statement of comprehensive income (loss) for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nAs noted above, in connection with the sale of our therapeutics business to Mesoblast, we are entitled to receive contingent consideration as a result of Mesoblast achieving certain milestones. In July 2017, we received contingent consideration of $10.0 million in Mesoblast Limited common stock and $350 thousand in cash as a milestone payment. We recorded $10.0 million, net of $0.3 million in tax, in discontinued operations in 2017. All of the Mesoblast Limited common stock was sold in 2017, resulting in a loss of approximately $1.9 million, which was reported in other income (expense), net in our consolidated statement of comprehensive income (loss) for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nSelected Unaudited Quarterly Financial Data\nThe following table sets forth selected financial data for each of the periods indicated.

In connection with the settlement of the class action described above, we expect to pay approximately $13.7 million in 2018 as part of the settlement amount not covered by insurance.\nEven after taking into consideration the settlement of the class action described above, we anticipate our cash on hand, investments and cash flows from operations will be sufficient to finance our operations for the next twelve months.\nCash Flows\nThe following table sets forth a summary of our cash flows for each of our three most recently completed fiscal years:\nTable 15: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>Year Ended December 31, </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <th>(In thousands)\n</th> <th> </th> <th>2017 </th> <th> </th> <th>2016 </th> <th> </th> <th>2015 </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash used in operating activities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(5,223 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>(6,238 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>(10,979 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash provided by investing activities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,343 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>24,072 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash provided by financing activities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>128 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(75 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>(6,157 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating Activities\nNet cash used in operating activities was $5.2 million during 2017, and was primarily due to our loss from continuing operations of $1.2 million, plus a realized loss on investment of approximately $2.0 million, and changes in operating assets and liabilities, which included an increase in accounts receivable, net, of $2.8 million, an increase in prepaid and other current assets of $1.6 million, due in part to an increase in income tax receivable, and a net decrease in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities of $1.1 million, and payment of an accrued civil penalty of $1.5 million to the SEC in 2017.\nNet cash used in operating activities was $6.2 million during 2016, and was primarily due to our net loss of $3.7 million, and increases of $4.4 million in accounts receivable, net, and $1.8 million in inventory, both due to growth of our business. These increases were partially offset by a $2.3 million increase in accounts payable, accrued expenses and other liabilities, which was due in part to higher professional fees resulting from the Restatement and the related legal proceedings.\nNet cash used in operating activities was $11.0 million during 2015, and was primarily due to our net loss from continuing operations of $35.8 million and a $5.4 million increase in accounts receivable, net. Partially offsetting these items were accruals of $15.2 million for settlement of SEC and securities legal proceedings, net of an insurance receivable, a $4.4 million net increase in accounts payable, accrued expenses, and other liabilities, primarily due to higher accrued commissions resulting from new distributor agreements effective in 2015, $2.8 million in non-cash share-based compensation, a $2.5 million realized net loss on investments, and a $4.1 million decrease in prepaid expenses and other assets, primarily due to a reduction in prepaid commissions and receivable from Mesoblast for the guaranteed payments.\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash provided by investing activities was $5.3 million during 2017, and was primarily due to the net proceeds from the sale of Mesoblast Limited common stock of approximately $7.9 million, partially offset by $2.0 million in purchases of property and equipment made during the year.\nNet cash provided by investing activities was $2 thousand during 2016, and was primarily due to net proceeds from the sale of investments of $1.4 million, offset by $1.4 million in purchases of property and equipment made during the year.\nNet cash provided by investing activities was $24.1 million during 2015, and was primarily due to $18.8 million in net proceeds from the sale of investments, including proceeds from the sale of Mesoblast Limited common stock, and $6.2 million in guaranteed payments from Mesoblast, partially offset by $0.9 million in purchases of property and equipment made during the year.\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $0.1 million during 2017, and reflects the proceeds from the exercise of options to purchase our common stock.\nNet cash used in financing activities was $0.1 million during 2016, and primarily reflects the principal payments on capital lease obligations.\nNet cash used in financing activities was $6.2 million during 2015, and primarily reflects $6.9 million payment of a special dividend, partially offset by $0.8 million in proceeds from the exercise of stock options to purchase our common stock, net of repurchases of common stock.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe had no off-balance sheet financing arrangements as of December 31, 2017, 2016 or 2015.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table sets forth our estimates as to the amounts and timing of contractual payments for our most significant contractual obligations at December 31, 2017:\nTable 16: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>Payment Due by Fiscal Year </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <th>Contractual Obligations\n</th> <th> </th> <th>Total </th> <th> </th> <th>Less Than\n1-Year </th> <th> </th> <th>Years 1-3 </th> <th> </th> <th>Years 4-5 </th> <th> </th> <th>More Than\n5-Years </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>(amounts in thousands)\n</th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating leases\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>7,408 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>1,139 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>2,552 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>2,600 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>1,117 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total contractual obligations\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>7,408 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>1,139 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>2,552 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>2,600 </td> <td> </td> <td>\n$ </td> <td>1,117 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating leases consist of our lease for 61,203 square feet of laboratory, production, warehouse and office space in Columbia, Maryland, which lease expires in 2023.\nThe contractual obligations table does not include obligations relating to contract research organizations (\"CROs\"). CROs perform many of the tasks required under our clinical studies, and we utilize their expertise to ensure objectivity of the clinical results. We pay fees directly to the CROs for their professional services, which may be payable upon specified study milestones or as they provide services, depending on the structure of the contract. We are also responsible for reimbursing the CROs for certain pass through expenses they incur in administering the study. The timing of our payments to the CROs is dependent upon the progress of the various studies, which is highly variable dependent upon the speed with which the CROs are able to enroll patients and testing sites. As such, we are unable to specifically predict the timing of future payments to CROs in connection with a specific clinical study.", "summary": "- The provided JSON contains information about

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThe following Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (\"MD&A\") is intended to help the reader understand our results of operations, financial condition and our current business environment. This MD&A is provided as a supplement to-and should be read in conjunction with-our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes thereto included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nThis MD&A is organized into the following sections:\n\u2022Restatement and Related Actions-a brief overview of the Restatement and related legal proceedings; and the related costs and expenses.\n\u2022Overview of Osiris-a general description of our business, products and history.\n\u2022Critical Accounting Policies-a discussion of accounting policies that require critical judgments and estimates.\n\u2022Recent and Pending Accounting Pronouncements-a discussion of recent and pending accounting policies under review by us that require critical judgments and estimates.\n\u2022Results of Operations-an analysis of our consolidated results of operations for the three years presented in our consolidated financial statements.\n\u2022Quarterly Results of Operations-an analysis of our consolidated unaudited quarterly results of operations for the quarterly periods in 2017, 2016 and 2015.\n\u2022Liquidity and Capital Resources-an analysis of our liquidity and financial positions; cash flows; off-balance sheet arrangements and aggregate contractual obligations.\nRestatement and Related Actions\nAs discussed in the 2014 Form 10-K/A and the Explanatory Note, we restated our audited financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2014 in the 2014 Form 10-K/A.\nWe have restated our unaudited interim financial statements for the quarters ended March 31, 2015, June 30, 2015 and September 30, 2015 in this Form 10-K. For more information about the 2015 Interim Period Restatement, see Note 15 to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. The determination to restate our financial statements was made by the Audit\nCommittee upon management's recommendation to address discovered errors. As a result of the Restatement, we have become subject to a number of additional costs and risks, including costs for accounting and legal fees in connection with or related to the Restatement and the remediation of material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. In addition, we have been subject to stockholder, governmental and other actions in connection with the Restatement and related matters. See \"Legal Proceedings\" in Part I, Item 3 of this Form 10-K and the risks described under the heading \"Risks Related to the Restatement of Financial Statements and Failure to File SEC Reports\" under \"Risk Factors\" in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K.\nExpenses Incurred\nIn 2017 and 2016, we recorded $9.5 million and $8.1 million, respectively, of expenses for professional fees related to the Restatement and the related legal proceedings. These expenses are included in \"General and administrative expenses\" in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss). These expenses, all of which were expensed as incurred, include costs of (i) outside professionals engaged by the Audit Committee and a special committee of the Board to review certain matters related to the Restatement; (ii) outside accounting professionals we engaged to assist with the Restatement and recommend improvements to our internal control over financial reporting; (iii) our former independent registered public accounting firm related to its re-audit of our 2014 consolidated financial statements as part of the Restatement, (iv) our current independent registered public accounting firm related to its audits of our 2015 and 2016 consolidated financial statements incurred, (v) reimbursement of expenses of certain current and former officers and directors related to legal proceedings; and (vi) our outside legal counsel related to these matters.\nLegal Proceedings\nAs previously disclosed, we believe that both the previously disclosed SEC and SDNY investigations are now concluded with respect to the Company. In November 2017, we paid a civil penalty in the amount of $1.5 million as part of the SEC settlement, which we recorded as an expense in the fourth quarter of 2015. The SEC civil case is continuing against four of our former officers. We are currently advancing expenses incurred by three of these former officers.\nAs discussed above, on March 11, 2018, we entered into a memorandum of understanding to settle the securities class action lawsuit. By the terms of the memorandum, the Company agreed in principle to a total payment of $18.5 million in cash, which was recorded as an expense in the fourth quarter of 2015. A definitive settlement agreement resulting from the memorandum is expected to be entered into in the second quarter of 2018 and will require court approval. Of the $18.5 million settlement payment, we expect to be reimbursed approximately $4.8 million from our insurance carrier, which we recorded as a receivable in the fourth quarter of 2015.\nFuture Costs\nWe expect to continue to incur significant legal and other professional services expenses associated with the Restatement and the resolution of the related legal proceedings in 2018. We will recognize these expenses as services are received. Costs related to the Restatement that may be incurred in 2018 may also include payments of expenses incurred by certain current and former officers and directors related to these matters; and incremental expenses for remediation activities related to improving our internal control over financial reporting.\nInsurance Coverage\nWe maintained $5.0 million of director's and officer's liability insurance coverage during the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015. Approximately $0.2 million has been paid to us as of December 31, 2017 for reimbursable expenses incurred by us and the remaining $4.8 million will be used to contribute to the settlement of the securities class action described above.\nRemediation\nOur management, with the oversight of the Audit Committee, has undertaken a plan to remediate our material weaknesses. Our remediation efforts are intended to address the identified material weaknesses as well as to strengthen our overall financial control environment. See Part II, Item 9A, \"Controls and Procedures\" of this Form 10-K for more information about the material weaknesses and our remediation activities.\nOverview of Osiris\nOsiris Therapeutics, Inc. researches, develops, manufactures, markets and sells regenerative medicine products intended to improve the health and lives of patients and lower overall healthcare costs. We have achieved commercial success with products in orthopedics, sports medicine and wound care, including the Grafix product line, Stravix, BIO4 and Cartiform. We continue to advance our R&D by focusing on innovation in regenerative medicine, including the development of bioengineered stem cell and tissue-based products.\nWe are a fully integrated company, having developed capabilities in research and development, manufacturing, marketing and sales of our products. We are focused on the long-term commercial growth of the Company through the delivery of differentiated products for use across multiple fields of medicine with clear value propositions to patients, healthcare providers and third-party payors.\nOur History\nWe began operations in 1992 and were a Delaware corporation until, with the approval of our stockholders, we reincorporated as a Maryland corporation in May 2010.\nFrom May 2010 to October 2013, we operated as two business segments, therapeutics and biosurgery. Our therapeutics business focused on developing biologic stem cell drug candidates from a readily available source-adult bone marrow. Our biosurgery business, now our only segment, focuses on using unique tissue preservation technologies to develop viable human tissue products designed to improve wound closure and surgical outcomes for patients and physicians over standard of care alone.\nIn October 2013, we sold our therapeutics business, including Prochymal, a stem cell drug for treatment of graft versus host disease, and related assets, to Mesoblast. The agreement with Mesoblast provided for the receipt of $50 million in initial consideration and up to an additional $50 million in payments upon Mesoblast achieving certain clinical and regulatory milestones.\nSince 2013, we have focused our resources on our biosurgery business and have built a substantial direct sales force dedicated exclusively to sell our Grafix and Stravix products. As a result, sales of our Grafix products increased significantly. However, the contribution of our Grafix product line to our operating income has been limited due to the heavy investment in sales and marketing. We operate in a competitive and challenging business environment and recognize that our execution of our product development and market penetration strategy will face a number of challenges. As a result, we may experience variability in our overall results, and in our quarter to quarter revenue.\nIn September 2013, we received the Untitled Letter from the FDA stating that Grafix and Ovation did not meet the definition of a 361 HCT/P. Among the grounds for the FDA's position were our marketing claims, including wound healing claims for Grafix. We revised all of our marketing claims for Grafix and resolved all issues with the Untitled Letter, which included the discontinuance of Ovation in 2014. Grafix remains on the market as a 361 HCT/P. Production of Ovation was discontinued in the third quarter of 2014 and we sold or shipped to consignees all of our remaining Ovation inventory by the end of October 2014.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2014, we executed marketing and distribution agreements with the Stryker and Arthrex for the distribution of BIO4 and Cartiform, respectively. Sales under these exclusive distribution arrangements commenced in 2015.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (\"GAAP\") requires management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported. Due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making those assumptions, actual results could differ from those estimates. We believe that the most significant estimates that affect our financial statements are those that relate to the fair value of our available for sale investments, the amounts of our deferred tax assets and liabilities and related valuation allowance, the net realizable value of inventory and related allowance for obsolescence, the ultimate realizability of our accounts receivable and estimates of collectability, the reserve for sales returns, and the fair value of our share-based awards. Note 2, \"Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,\" to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.\nThe policies and estimates discussed in this section are considered critical because they had or could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and because they require significant judgments, assumptions or estimates. We base our estimates on historical experience and other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates and such differences could be material. We have reviewed these critical accounting policies and related disclosures with the Audit Committee.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe recognize revenue from the sales of our products when (i) title and the risk of loss pass to the customer; (ii) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; (iii) sales amounts are fixed and determinable; and (iv) collectability is reasonably assured. Due to the nature of the products and the manufacturing process, we generally do not allow sales returns or refunds unless the product is returned in the original shipping container and is determined to be salable.\nTitle and the risk of loss generally passes to the customer upon receipt of the product by our customer when acceptance of ownership risks occurs. Many of our customers accept the risks of ownership only when they use (implant) our product; for shipments to these customers, title and risk of loss passes upon product use and prior to such use we classify products shipped to these customers as consignment inventory pending receipt of such notice.\nBased on our collection history with certain customers, collectability is not reasonably assured until actual cash payment is received. Thus, we recognize revenue for those customers when cash is received.\nWe record deferred revenue when we receive payments prior to the time we recognize revenue.\nInvestments and Other Comprehensive Income\nInvestments consist primarily of marketable securities with a total portfolio duration of approximately two years. Investments classified as available for sale are valued at their fair value, with unrealized gains and losses reported as a separate component of stockholders' equity in accumulated other comprehensive income. All realized gains and losses on our investments available for sale are recognized in results of operations when earned, as other income (expense), net.\nInvestments classified as available for sale are evaluated periodically to determine whether a decline in their value is \"other than temporary.\" The term \"other than temporary\" is not intended to\nindicate a permanent decline in value; rather, it means that the prospects for near term recovery of value is not necessarily favorable, or that there is a lack of evidence to support fair values equal to, or greater than, the carrying value of the security. We review criteria such as the magnitude and duration of the decline, as well as the reasons for the decline, to predict whether the loss in value is other than temporary. If a decline in value is determined to be other than temporary, the carrying value of the security is reduced and a corresponding charge to earnings is recognized.\nTrade Accounts Receivable\nAccounts receivable are reported at their net realizable value. We consider receivables outstanding longer than the time specified in the respective customer's contract to be past due. In making the determination of the appropriate allowance for doubtful accounts, management considers prior experience with customers, analysis of accounts receivable aging reports, changes in customer payment patterns, and historical write-offs.\nInventory Valuation\nInventory consists of raw materials, products in process, finished goods available for sale and products held by customers under consignment sales arrangements. We determine our inventory values using the first-in, first-out method. Inventory is valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value and excludes units that we anticipate distributing for clinical evaluation.\nValuation of Long-lived Assets\nWe review the carrying value of long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or group of assets may not be fully recoverable. Factors that would require an impairment assessment include, among other things, a significant change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used, a continual decline in our operating performance, or a fundamental change in our business condition. If an impairment indicator is present, we evaluate recoverability by a comparison of the carrying amount of the assets to future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the assets. Assets are grouped at the lowest level for which there is identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows generated by other asset groups. If the total of the expected undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset, an impairment loss is recognized for the difference between the fair value and carrying value of the asset group. Fair value is generally determined by estimates of discounted cash flows. The discount rate used in any estimate of discounted cash flows would be the rate required for a similar investment of like risk. There were no impairment losses recognized during the years 2017, 2016 or 2015.\nFair Value Accounting\nWe disclose the fair value of our financial assets in our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Fair value is defined as the price at which an asset could be exchanged or a liability transferred (an exit price) in an orderly transaction between knowledgeable, willing parties in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability. Where available, fair value is based on observable market prices or parameters or derived from such prices or parameters. Where observable prices or inputs are not available, valuation models are applied.\nWe estimated the fair value of stock options using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. Fair value is amortized on an accelerated basis over the requisite service periods of the awards. We generally issue stock option awards that vest over four years and have a ten-year contractual life. The\nfair value of stock options granted during each of the years was estimated using the following weighted-average assumptions:\n\nInterest Rate-The risk-free interest rate was determined using the yield available for zero-coupon United States government issues with a remaining term approximating the expected life of the options.\nDividend-On September 16, 2015, we declared a non-recurring, special cash dividend to shareholders. We do not expect to pay a dividend in the foreseeable future, and as such, the expected dividend yield is zero.\nTerm-Since the Company has limited option exercise history, it has generally elected to estimate the expected life of an award based upon the SEC-approved \"simplified method\" noted under the provisions of Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 107 with the continued use of this method extended under the provisions of Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 110.\nVolatility-Expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of the Company's common stock, which we believe will be indicative of future experience.\nResearch and Development Costs\nOur R&D costs are expensed as incurred. R&D consists of expenses incurred in identifying, developing and testing tissue-based products. These expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses for personnel, fees paid to professional service providers for independent monitoring and analysis of our clinical studies, costs of contract research, costs of facilities, and costs of manufacturing clinical study materials and quality control supplies.\nIncome Taxes\nSignificant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes and income tax assets and liabilities, including evaluating uncertainties in the application of accounting principles and complex tax laws.\nDeferred tax liabilities and assets are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences of temporary differences, income tax credits and net operating loss carryforwards. Temporary differences are primarily the result of the differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their financial reporting values. Deferred tax liabilities and assets are measured by applying the enacted statutory tax rates applicable to the future years in which deferred tax liabilities or assets are expected to be settled or realized. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized. Income tax expense, if any, consists of the taxes payable for the current period and the change during the period in deferred tax assets and liabilities.\nWe recognize the impact of a tax position in our consolidated financial statements if that position is more likely than not to be sustained upon an examination based on the technical merits of the position. Although we believe that we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions, we can provide no assurance that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be materially different. We make adjustments to these reserves when facts and circumstances change, such as the closing of a tax\naudit or the refinement of an estimate. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences will affect the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made and could have a material impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The provision for income taxes includes the effects of any reserves that we believe are appropriate, as well as the related net interest and penalties.\nOn December 22, 2017, the President of the United States signed into law the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the \"Tax Act\") which included significant changes to the existing income tax laws for domestic corporations. Key features of the Tax Act effective in 2018 include:\n\u2022 Reduction of the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%;\n\u2022 Elimination of the alternative minimum tax (\"AMT\");\n\u2022 Refundability of AMT credit carryforwards as of December 31, 2017\n\u2022 Changes in the deductibility of certain aspects of executive compensation;\n\u2022 Changes in the deductibility of certain entertainment and recreation expenses; and\n\u2022 Changes in incentive tax breaks for U.S. production activities.\nAs a result of the refundability of the AMT credit carryforwards, we recorded a receivable of $1.5 million as of December 31, 2017. Because of our existing Federal net operating loss carryforwards and current expectations as to the recovery of our net deferred tax assets, we believe that the Tax Act will not have significant additional impacts on our financial results and financial position, including on our liquidity, for the foreseeable future. See Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nRecent and Pending Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for a full description of recent accounting pronouncements and our expectation of their impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nResults of Operations\nThe following tables setting forth selected financial data for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, 2015 and 2014 have been prepared in accordance with GAAP:\n\n(1)In October 2013, we sold our therapeutics business to Mesoblast. The agreement with Mesoblast provided for the receipt of $50 million in initial consideration and up to an additional $50 million in payments upon Mesoblast achieving certain clinical and regulatory milestones. In addition, we are entitled to earn single to low double-digit percentage cash royalties on future sales by Mesoblast of Prochymal and other products utilizing the acquired technology. Our former therapeutics business generated royalty revenue and related expenses in 2014. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\n\n(1)The Stravix product line was launched in late 2015; however, the first sale of the product did not occur until January 2016. As a result, the amount of product revenue and percentage of total in 2015 and 2014 represent sales of Grafix products only.\nAnnual Comparisons for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, 2015 and 2014\nRevenue\nRevenue was $118.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, which increased $9.1 million, or 8.4%, compared with revenue of $109.4 million in 2016. The increase in revenue was due to the following:\n\u2022 Grafix/Stravix revenue increased $3.0 million, or 3.7%, primarily due to increased market awareness and acceptance as we increased selling efforts.\n\u2022 BIO4 revenue increased $4.7 million, or 24.3%, primarily due to increased market presence through our distribution arrangement with Stryker.\n\u2022 Cartiform revenue increased $1.5 million, or 20.0%, primarily due to increased market presence through our distribution arrangement with Arthrex.\nRevenue was $109.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, which increased $29.7 million, or 37.2%, compared with revenue of $79.7 million in 2015.\n\u2022 Grafix/Stravix revenue increased $20.3 million, or 32.7%, due to continued marketing and sale of the products, increased Medicare coverage, and an increase in the size of our sales force. The Stravix product line was launched in late 2015.\n\u2022 BIO4 revenue increased $11.6 million, or 147.2%, primarily due to increased market awareness through our distribution arrangement with Stryker.\n\u2022 Cartiform revenue increased $2.4 million, or 47.2%, primarily due to increased market awareness through our distribution arrangement with Arthrex.\nRevenue was $79.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, which increased $28.9 million, or 56.8%, compared with revenue of $50.8 million in 2014.\n\u2022 Grafix revenue increased $26.0 million, or 72.0%, primarily due to expansion of our in-house sales and marketing teams, as well as increased sales from our third-party product distributors. In addition, Grafix obtained Medicare coverage in 2015, which further aided sales.\n\u2022 Commercial sales of BIO4 began in the second half of 2014. In the fourth quarter of 2014, we entered into an agreement with Stryker for the exclusive distribution of BIO4. The initial commercial sales of BIO4 under the distribution agreement began in the first quarter of 2015 resulting in an increase of revenue of $7.2 million in 2015 compared to 2014.\n\u2022 Commercial sales of our Cartiform product began in 2012. In the fourth quarter 2014, we entered into an agreement with Arthrex for the exclusive distribution of Cartiform. The initial commercial sales of Cartiform under the distribution agreement began in the first quarter of 2015 resulting in an increase in revenue of $3.4 million compared to 2014.\n\u2022 Production of Ovation was discontinued in the third quarter of 2014 and we sold or shipped to consignees all of our remaining Ovation inventory by the fourth quarter of 2014.\nGross Profit and Gross Margin\nGross profit is affected by a number of factors including product mix, cost of labor and raw materials, unit volumes, pricing, competition, new products, new customer programs, and capacity utilization. In the case of new products and new customer programs, profitability normally lags revenue growth due to product start-up costs, lower manufacturing volumes in the start-up phase, operational inefficiencies, and under-absorbed overhead. Gross margin can improve over time if manufacturing\nvolumes increase and if our utilization rates and overhead absorption improves. As a result of these and other factors, our gross margin may vary from period to period.\nGross profit was $85.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, which increased $7.2 million, or 9.1%, compared with gross profit of $78.6 million in 2016. Gross margin improved to 72.4% for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared with 71.9% in 2016. The primary reason for the increase in gross profit was an increase in pricing in late 2016, along with higher sales. Gross margin also improved as a result of manufacturing efficiencies from higher production volume.\nGross profit was $78.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, which increased $26.0 million, or 49.3%, compared with gross profit of $52.7 million in 2015. Gross margin improved to 71.9% for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared with 66.1% in 2015. The primary reason for the increase in gross profit was higher sales volume. Gross margin improved as a result of manufacturing efficiencies from higher production volume, the addition of a contract manufacturer for certain cadaveric tissue (which decreased production costs), and, in connection with the Restatement, the reversal of the recognition of revenue from two distributors in 2015, which we changed from the accrual basis of accounting to the cash basis of accounting, but continued to recognize the costs as products were shipped.\nGross profit was $52.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, which increased $11.7 million, or 28.7%, compared with gross profit of $40.9 million in 2014. Gross profit increased primarily due to higher sales volume. Gross margin decreased to 66.1% for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared with 80.6% in 2014. As noted above, in connection with the Restatement, we reversed the recognition of revenue from two distributors in 2015, which we changed from the accrual basis of accounting to the cash basis of accounting, but continued to recognize the costs as products were shipped.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nOur R&D expenses of $4.1 million in 2017 and $6.3 million in 2016 were primarily related to four clinical studies in 2017 and 2016. R&D expenses declined in 2017 compared to 2016, primarily due to the cancellation of three clinical studies in the fourth quarter of 2016 that began in 2015 and 2016 as we re-evaluated our market opportunities and research priorities.\nOur R&D expenses of $6.3 million in 2016 and $4.9 million in 2015 were primarily related to four clinical studies that began in 2015 and 2016. R&D expenses increased in 2016 compared to 2015, primarily due to the addition of clinical studies during 2016.\nOur R&D expenses of $4.9 million in 2015 with $3.4 million in 2014. The increase of $1.5 million in 2015 compared to 2014 was primarily related to clinical studies that began in 2015 to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of Grafix for the treatment of complex, diabetic foot wounds.\nSales and Marketing Expenses\nSales and marketing expenses totaled $61.5 million, or 50.1% of sales, during the year ended December 31, 2017, compared with $59.1million, or 54.0% of sales for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in sales and marketing expense of $2.4 million was primarily due to higher labor costs, including commissions.\nSales and marketing expenses totaled $59.1 million, or 54.0% of sales, during the year ended December 31, 2016, compared with $56.6 million, or 71.0% of sales for the year ended December 31, 2015. The $2.5 million increase in sales and marketing expense was primarily due to higher labor costs, including commissions.\nSales and marketing expenses totaled $56.6 million, or 71.0% of sales, during the year ended December 31, 2015, compared with $36.4 million, or 71.6% of sales for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase in sales and marketing expense of $20.2 million was primarily due to higher labor costs, including commissions of $13.8 million, and higher travel related costs of $2.7 million, higher contract services of $0.9 million, and higher costs in general as we expanded our sales, marketing and reimbursement support capabilities.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses totaled $22.1 million, or 18.7% of sales, during the year ended December 31, 2017, compared with $17.4 million, or 15.9% of sales, for the year ended December 31, 2016. This increase of $4.7 million was due to higher labor costs of $2.7 million, as we added finance, human resources, and information technology personnel to support operations, and higher professional fees of $1.9 million, primarily related to the Restatement and the related legal proceedings. In 2017, general and administrative expenses included $9.5 million of expenses for professional fees related to the Restatement and the related legal proceedings.\nGeneral and administrative expenses totaled $17.4 million, or 15.9% of sales, during the year ended December 31, 2016, compared with $9.5 million, or 11.9% of sales for the year ended December 31, 2015. This increase of $7.9 million was primarily due to higher professional fees, primarily related to the Restatement and the related legal matters. In 2016, general and administrative expenses included $8.1 million of expenses for professional fees related to the Restatement and the related legal proceedings.\nGeneral and administrative expenses totaled $9.5 million, or 11.9% of sales, during the year ended December 31, 2015, compared with $8.1 million, or 16.0% of sales for the year ended December 31, 2014. This increase of $1.4 million was primarily due to higher professional fees. In 2015, general and administrative expenses included $0.5 million of expenses for professional fees related to the Restatement and the related legal proceedings.\nSettlement of SEC and Shareholder Actions\nIn November 2017, we paid a civil penalty in the amount of $1.5 million as part of the SEC settlement with regard to the SEC investigation previously discussed, all of which was recorded as expenses in the fourth quarter of 2015. As discussed above, we are a party to a securities class action and multiple shareholder derivative actions. On March 11, 2018, we entered into a memorandum of understanding to settle the securities class action lawsuit. By the terms of the memorandum, the Company agreed in principle to a total payment of $18.5 million in cash. A definitive settlement agreement resulting from the memorandum is expected to be entered into in the second quarter of 2018 and will require court approval. Of the $18.5 million settlement payment, we expect to be reimbursed approximately $4.8 million from our insurance carrier, which we recorded as a receivable in 2015. As a result, we recorded the net amount of $13.7 million as a pretax expense in the fourth quarter of 2015.\nOther Income (Expense), net\nOther expense, net in 2017 was $0.6 million, a decrease of $1.2 million compared to other income, net of $0.4 million in 2016. The decrease is primarily due to a loss recognized in 2017 on the sale of Mesoblast Limited common stock.\nOther income, net in 2016 was $0.4 million, an increase of $2.1 million compared to other expense net of $1.7 million in 2015. The increase is primarily due to a loss recognized in 2015 related to Mesoblast Limited common stock.\nOther expense, net in 2015 was $1.7 million, which was comparable to other expense net of $1.8 million in 2014.\nIncome Taxes\nIncome tax benefit from continuing operations for 2017 was $1.4 million primarily due to the release of the valuation allowance on the AMT carryforwards, offset by state tax expense where the Company did not have state credit or net operating losses available.\nIncome tax expense from continuing operations for 2016 was $0.1 million primarily due to state tax obligations.\nIncome tax expense from continuing operations for 2015 was $0.5 million and was primarily due to an uncertain tax position relating to state taxes, compared to the expense from continuing operations of $0.1 million in 2014, which consisted primarily of AMT and state taxes.\nBecause realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon future earnings, a full valuation allowance has been recorded on the net deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, which relate primarily to net operating loss and various business tax credit carryforwards. In the event that we become profitable, we have general business credits (before a 100% valuation allowance) of approximately $0.4 million that may be utilized to reduce our federal tax. As discussed above under \"Critical Accounting Policies-Income Taxes,\" the Tax Act enacted on December 22, 2017 reduced the U.S. corporate income tax rate from a maximum of 35% to 21% and reduced the valuation allowance previously recognized on AMT credit carryforwards, which will be refundable credits.\nMesoblast Income (Loss) from Discontinued Operations\nAs noted above, in October 2013, we sold our therapeutics business to Mesoblast. The agreement with Mesoblast provided for the receipt of $50 million in initial consideration and up to an additional $50 million in payments upon Mesoblast achieving certain clinical and regulatory milestones. In addition, we are entitled to earn royalties on future sales by Mesoblast of Prochymal and other products utilizing the acquired technology. We received all of the initial consideration by April 2014, consisting of $35 million in cash and $15 million of Mesoblast Limited common stock which we classified as a trading security. The Mesoblast Limited common stock was subject to a holding period which was ultimately extended to May 2015. During this holding period, Mesoblast Limited provided us limited protection against a decline in the market value of the stock. In May 2015, concurrent with the expiration of the holding period, Mesoblast paid us $6.2 million representing the decline in the market value of the stock through that date. Later in 2015, we sold all of the Mesoblast Limited common stock for $6.8 million, resulting in a realized loss of $2.6 million, which was recorded in other income (expense), net in our consolidated statement of comprehensive income (loss) for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nAs noted above, in connection with the sale of our therapeutics business to Mesoblast, we are entitled to receive contingent consideration as a result of Mesoblast achieving certain milestones. In July 2017, we received contingent consideration of $10.0 million in Mesoblast Limited common stock and $350 thousand in cash as a milestone payment. We recorded $10.0 million, net of $0.3 million in tax, in discontinued operations in 2017. All of the Mesoblast Limited common stock was sold in 2017, resulting in a loss of approximately $1.9 million, which was reported in other income (expense), net in our consolidated statement of comprehensive income (loss) for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nSelected Unaudited Quarterly Financial Data\nThe following table sets forth selected financial data for each of the periods indicated. Amounts are computed independently each quarter, therefore, the sum of the quarterly amounts may not equal the total amount for the respective year due to rounding.\n", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThe following Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (\"MD&A\") is intended to help the reader understand our results of operations, financial condition and our current business environment. This MD&A is provided as a supplement to-and should be read in conjunction with-our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes thereto included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nThis MD&A is organized into the following sections:\n\u2022Restatement and Related Actions-a brief overview of the Restatement and related legal proceedings; and the related costs and expenses.\n\u2022Overview of Osiris-a general description of our business, products and history.\n\u2022Critical Accounting Policies-a discussion of accounting policies that require critical judgments and estimates.\n\u2022Recent and Pending Accounting Pronouncements-a discussion of recent and pending accounting policies under review by us that require critical judgments and estimates.\n\u2022Results of Operations-an analysis of our consolidated results of operations for the three years presented in our consolidated financial statements.\n\u2022Quarterly Results of Operations-an analysis of our consolidated unaudited quarterly results of operations for the quarterly periods in 2017, 2016 and 2015.\n\u2022Liquidity and Capital Resources-an analysis of our liquidity and financial positions; cash flows; off-balance sheet arrangements and aggregate contractual obligations.\nRestatement and Related Actions\nAs discussed in the 2014 Form 10-K/A and the Explanatory Note, we restated our audited financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2014 in the 2014 Form 10-K/A.\nWe have restated our unaudited interim financial statements for the quarters ended March 31, 2015, June 30, 2015 and September 30, 2015 in this Form 10-K. For more information about the 2015 Interim Period Restatement, see Note 15 to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. The determination to restate our financial statements was made by the Audit\nCommittee upon management's recommendation to address discovered errors. As a result of the Restatement, we have become subject to a number of additional costs and risks, including costs for accounting and legal fees in connection with or related to the Restatement and the remediation of material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. In addition, we have been subject to stockholder, governmental and other actions in connection with the Restatement and related matters. See \"Legal Proceedings\" in Part I, Item 3 of this Form 10-K and the risks described under the heading \"Risks Related to the Restatement of Financial Statements and Failure to File SEC Reports\" under \"Risk Factors\" in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K.\nExpenses Incurred\nIn 2017 and 2016, we recorded $9.5 million and $8.1 million, respectively, of expenses for professional fees related to the Restatement and the related legal proceedings. These expenses are included in \"General and administrative expenses\" in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss). These expenses, all of which were expensed as incurred, include costs of (i) outside professionals engaged by the Audit Committee and a special committee of the Board to review certain matters related to the Restatement; (ii) outside accounting professionals we engaged to assist with the Restatement and recommend improvements to our internal control over financial reporting; (iii) our former independent registered public accounting firm related to its re-audit of our 2014 consolidated financial statements as part of the Restatement, (iv) our current independent registered public accounting firm related to its audits of our 2015 and 2016 consolidated financial statements incurred, (v) reimbursement of expenses of certain current and former officers and directors related to legal proceedings; and (vi) our outside legal counsel related to these matters.\nLegal Proceedings\nAs previously disclosed, we believe that both the previously disclosed SEC and SDNY investigations are now concluded with respect to the Company. In November 2017, we paid a civil penalty in the amount of $1.5 million as part of the SEC settlement, which we recorded as an expense in the fourth quarter of 2015. The SEC civil case is continuing against four of our former officers. We are currently advancing expenses incurred by three of these former officers.\nAs discussed above, on March 11, 2018, we entered into a memorandum of understanding to settle the securities class action lawsuit. By the terms of the memorandum, the Company agreed in principle to a total payment of $18.5 million in cash, which was recorded as an expense in the fourth quarter of 2015. A definitive settlement agreement resulting from the memorandum is expected to be entered into in the second quarter of 2018 and will require court approval. Of the $18.5 million settlement payment, we expect to be reimbursed approximately $4.8 million from our insurance carrier, which we recorded as a receivable in the fourth quarter of 2015.\nFuture Costs\nWe expect to continue to incur significant legal and other professional services expenses associated with the Restatement and the resolution of the related legal proceedings in 2018. We will recognize these expenses as services are received. Costs related to the Restatement that may be incurred in 2018 may also include payments of expenses incurred by certain current and former officers and directors related to these matters; and incremental expenses for remediation activities related to improving our internal control over financial reporting.\nInsurance Coverage\nWe maintained $5.0 million of director's and officer's liability insurance coverage during the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015. Approximately $0.2 million has been paid to us as of December 31, 2017 for reimbursable expenses incurred by us and the remaining $4.8 million will be used to contribute to the settlement of the securities class action described above.\nRemediation\nOur management, with the oversight of the Audit Committee, has undertaken a plan to remediate our material weaknesses. Our remediation efforts are intended to address the identified material weaknesses as well as to strengthen our overall financial control environment. See Part II, Item 9A, \"Controls and Procedures\" of this Form 10-K for more information about the material weaknesses and our remediation activities.\nOverview of Osiris\nOsiris Therapeutics, Inc. researches, develops, manufactures, markets and sells regenerative medicine products intended to improve the health and lives of patients and lower overall healthcare costs. We have achieved commercial success with products in orthopedics, sports medicine and wound care, including the Grafix product line, Stravix, BIO4 and Cartiform. We continue to advance our R&D by focusing on innovation in regenerative medicine, including the development of bioengineered stem cell and tissue-based products.\nWe are a fully integrated company, having developed capabilities in research and development, manufacturing, marketing and sales of our products. We are focused on the long-term commercial growth of the Company through the delivery of differentiated products for use across multiple fields of medicine with clear value propositions to patients, healthcare providers and third-party payors.\nOur History\nWe began operations in 1992 and were a Delaware corporation until, with the approval of our stockholders, we reincorporated as a Maryland corporation in May 2010.\nFrom May 2010 to October 2013, we operated as two business segments, therapeutics and biosurgery. Our therapeutics business focused on developing biologic stem cell drug candidates from a readily available source-adult bone marrow. Our biosurgery business, now our only segment, focuses on using unique tissue preservation technologies to develop viable human tissue products designed to improve wound closure and surgical outcomes for patients and physicians over standard of care alone.\nIn October 2013, we sold our therapeutics business, including Prochymal, a stem cell drug for treatment of graft versus host disease, and related assets, to Mesoblast. The agreement with Mesoblast provided for the receipt of $50 million in initial consideration and up to an additional $50 million in payments upon Mesoblast achieving certain clinical and regulatory milestones.\nSince 2013, we have focused our resources on our biosurgery business and have built a substantial direct sales force dedicated exclusively to sell our Grafix and Stravix products. As a result, sales of our Grafix products increased significantly. However, the contribution of our Grafix product line to our operating income has been limited due to the heavy investment in sales and marketing. We operate in a competitive and challenging business environment and recognize that our execution of our product development and market penetration strategy will face a number of challenges. As a result, we may experience variability in our overall results, and in our quarter to quarter revenue.\nIn September 2013, we received the Untitled Letter from the FDA stating that Grafix and Ovation did not meet the definition of a 361 HCT/P. Among the grounds for the FDA's position were our marketing claims, including wound healing claims for Grafix. We revised all of our marketing claims for Grafix and resolved all issues with the Untitled Letter, which included the discontinuance of Ovation in 2014. Grafix remains on the market as a 361 HCT/P. Production of Ovation was discontinued in the third quarter of 2014 and we sold or shipped to consignees all of our remaining Ovation inventory by the end of October 2014.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2014, we executed marketing and distribution agreements with the Stryker and Arthrex for the distribution of BIO4 and Cartiform, respectively. Sales under these exclusive distribution arrangements commenced in 2015.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (\"GAAP\") requires management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported. Due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making those assumptions, actual results could differ from those estimates. We believe that the most significant estimates that affect our financial statements are those that relate to the fair value of our available for sale investments, the amounts of our deferred tax assets and liabilities and related valuation allowance, the net realizable value of inventory and related allowance for obsolescence, the ultimate realizability of our accounts receivable and estimates of collectability, the reserve for sales returns, and the fair value of our share-based awards. Note 2, \"Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,\" to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.\nThe policies and estimates discussed in this section are considered critical because they had or could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and because they require significant judgments, assumptions or estimates. We base our estimates on historical experience and other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates and such differences could be material. We have reviewed these critical accounting policies and related disclosures with the Audit Committee.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe recognize revenue from the sales of our products when (i) title and the risk of loss pass to the customer; (ii) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; (iii) sales amounts are fixed and determinable; and (iv) collectability is reasonably assured. Due to the nature of the products and the manufacturing process, we generally do not allow sales returns or refunds unless the product is returned in the original shipping container and is determined to be salable.\nTitle and the risk of loss generally passes to the customer upon receipt of the product by our customer when acceptance of ownership risks occurs. Many of our customers accept the risks of ownership only when they use (implant) our product; for shipments to these customers, title and risk of loss passes upon product use and prior to such use we classify products shipped to these customers as consignment inventory pending receipt of such notice.\nBased on our collection history with certain customers, collectability is not reasonably assured until actual cash payment is received. Thus, we recognize revenue for those customers when cash is received.\nWe record deferred revenue when we receive payments prior to the time we recognize revenue.\nInvestments and Other Comprehensive Income\nInvestments consist primarily of marketable securities with a total portfolio duration of approximately two years. Investments classified as available for sale are valued at their fair value, with unrealized gains and losses reported as a separate component of stockholders' equity in accumulated other comprehensive income. All realized gains and losses on our investments available for sale are recognized in results of operations when earned, as other income (expense), net.\nInvestments classified as available for sale are evaluated periodically to determine whether a decline in their value is \"other than temporary.\" The term \"other than temporary\" is not intended to\nindicate a permanent decline in value; rather, it means that the prospects for near term recovery of value is not necessarily favorable, or that there is a lack of evidence to support fair values equal to, or greater than, the carrying value of the security. We review criteria such as the magnitude and duration of the decline, as well as the reasons for the decline, to predict whether the loss in value is other than temporary. If a decline in value is determined to be other than temporary, the carrying value of the security is reduced and a corresponding charge to earnings is recognized.\nTrade Accounts Receivable\nAccounts receivable are reported at their net realizable value. We consider receivables outstanding longer than the time specified in the respective customer's contract to be past due. In making the determination of the appropriate allowance for doubtful accounts, management considers prior experience with customers, analysis of accounts receivable aging reports, changes in customer payment patterns, and historical write-offs.\nInventory Valuation\nInventory consists of raw materials, products in process, finished goods available for sale and products held by customers under consignment sales arrangements. We determine our inventory values using the first-in, first-out method. Inventory is valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value and excludes units that we anticipate distributing for clinical evaluation.\nValuation of Long-lived Assets\nWe review the carrying value of long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or group of assets may not be fully recoverable. Factors that would require an impairment assessment include, among other things, a significant change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used, a continual decline in our operating performance, or a fundamental change in our business condition. If an impairment indicator is present, we evaluate recoverability by a comparison of the carrying amount of the assets to future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the assets. Assets are grouped at the lowest level for which there is identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows generated by other asset groups. If the total of the expected undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset, an impairment loss is recognized for the difference between the fair value and carrying value of the asset group. Fair value is generally determined by estimates of discounted cash flows. The discount rate used in any estimate of discounted cash flows would be the rate required for a similar investment of like risk. There were no impairment losses recognized during the years 2017, 2016 or 2015.\nFair Value Accounting\nWe disclose the fair value of our financial assets in our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Fair value is defined as the price at which an asset could be exchanged or a liability transferred (an exit price) in an orderly transaction between knowledgeable, willing parties in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability. Where available, fair value is based on observable market prices or parameters or derived from such prices or parameters. Where observable prices or inputs are not available, valuation models are applied.\nWe estimated the fair value of stock options using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. Fair value is amortized on an accelerated basis over the requisite service periods of the awards. We generally issue stock option awards that vest over four years and have a ten-year contractual life. The\nfair value of stock options granted during each of the years was estimated using the following weighted-average assumptions:\nTable 11: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>Year ended\nDecember 31, </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <th>\n</th> <th> </th> <th>2017 </th> <th> </th> <th>2016 </th> <th> </th> <th>2015 </th> <th> </th> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest rate\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>1.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>1.8 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Dividend yield\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>0.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>0.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Term (in years)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6.2 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Volatility\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>71.9 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>67.4 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>69.4 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nInterest Rate-The risk-free interest rate was determined using the yield available for zero-coupon United States government issues with a remaining term approximating the expected life of the options.\nDividend-On September 16, 2015, we declared a non-recurring, special cash dividend to shareholders. We do not expect to pay a dividend in the foreseeable future, and as such, the expected dividend yield is zero.\nTerm-Since the Company has limited option exercise history, it has generally elected to estimate the expected life of an award based upon the SEC-approved \"simplified method\" noted under the provisions of Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 107 with the continued use of this method extended under the provisions of Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 110.\nVolatility-Expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of the Company's common stock, which we believe will be indicative of future experience.\nResearch and Development Costs\nOur R&D costs are expensed as incurred. R&D consists of expenses incurred in identifying, developing and testing tissue-based products. These expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses for personnel, fees paid to professional service providers for independent monitoring and analysis of our clinical studies, costs of contract research, costs of facilities, and costs of manufacturing clinical study materials and quality control supplies.\nIncome Taxes\nSignificant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes and income tax assets and liabilities, including evaluating uncertainties in the application of accounting principles and complex tax laws.\nDeferred tax liabilities and assets are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences of temporary differences, income tax credits and net operating loss carryforwards. Temporary differences are primarily the result of the differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their financial reporting values. Deferred tax liabilities and assets are measured by applying the enacted statutory tax rates applicable to the future years in which deferred tax liabilities or assets are expected to be settled or realized. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized. Income tax expense, if any, consists of the taxes payable for the current period and the change during the period in deferred tax assets and liabilities.\nWe recognize the impact of a tax position in our consolidated financial statements if that position is more likely than not to be sustained upon an examination based on the technical merits of the position. Although we believe that we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions, we can provide no assurance that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be materially different. We make adjustments to these reserves when facts and circumstances change, such as the closing of a tax\naudit or the refinement of an estimate. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences will affect the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made and could have a material impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The provision for income taxes includes the effects of any reserves that we believe are appropriate, as well as the related net interest and penalties.\nOn December 22, 2017, the President of the United States signed into law the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the \"Tax Act\") which included significant changes to the existing income tax laws for domestic corporations. Key features of the Tax Act effective in 2018 include:\n\u2022 Reduction of the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%;\n\u2022 Elimination of the alternative minimum tax (\"AMT\");\n\u2022 Refundability of AMT credit carryforwards as of December 31, 2017\n\u2022 Changes in the deductibility of certain aspects of executive compensation;\n\u2022 Changes in the deductibility of certain entertainment and recreation expenses; and\n\u2022 Changes in incentive tax breaks for U.S. production activities.\nAs a result of the refundability of the AMT credit carryforwards, we recorded a receivable of $1.5 million as of December 31, 2017. Because of our existing Federal net operating loss carryforwards and current expectations as to the recovery of our net deferred tax assets, we believe that the Tax Act will not have significant additional impacts on our financial results and financial position, including on our liquidity, for the foreseeable future. See Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nRecent and Pending Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for a full description of recent accounting pronouncements and our expectation of their impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nResults of Operations\nThe following tables setting forth selected financial data for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, 2015 and 2014 have been prepared in accordance with GAAP:\nTable 12: <table> <tr>

The agreement with Mesoblast provided for the receipt of $50 million in initial consideration and up to an additional $50 million in payments upon Mesoblast achieving certain clinical and regulatory milestones. In addition, we are entitled to earn single to low double-digit percentage cash royalties on future sales by Mesoblast of Prochymal and other products utilizing the acquired technology. Our former therapeutics business generated royalty revenue and related expenses in 2014.

As a result, the amount of product revenue and percentage of total in 2015 and 2014 represent sales of Grafix products only.\nAnnual Comparisons for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, 2015 and 2014\nRevenue\nRevenue was $118.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, which increased $9.1 million, or 8.4%, compared with revenue of $109.4 million in 2016. The increase in revenue was due to the following:\n\u2022 Grafix/Stravix revenue increased $3.0 million, or 3.7%, primarily due to increased market awareness and acceptance as we increased selling efforts.\n\u2022 BIO4 revenue increased $4.7 million, or 24.3%, primarily due to increased market presence through our distribution arrangement with Stryker.\n\u2022 Cartiform revenue increased $1.5 million, or 20.0%, primarily due to increased market presence through our distribution arrangement with Arthrex.\nRevenue was $109.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, which increased $29.7 million, or 37.2%, compared with revenue of $79.7 million in 2015.\n\u2022 Grafix/Stravix revenue increased $20.3 million, or 32.7%, due to continued marketing and sale of the products, increased Medicare coverage, and an increase in the size of our sales force. The Stravix product line was launched in late 2015.\n\u2022 BIO4 revenue increased $11.6 million, or 147.2%, primarily due to increased market awareness through our distribution arrangement with Stryker.\n\u2022 Cartiform revenue increased $2.4 million, or 47.2%, primarily due to increased market awareness through our distribution arrangement with Arthrex.\nRevenue was $79.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, which increased $28.9 million, or 56.8%, compared with revenue of $50.8 million in 2014.\n\u2022 Grafix revenue increased $26.0 million, or 72.0%, primarily due to expansion of our in-house sales and marketing teams, as well as increased sales from our third-party product distributors. In addition, Grafix obtained Medicare coverage in 2015, which further aided sales.\n\u2022 Commercial sales of BIO4 began in the second half of 2014. In the fourth quarter of 2014, we entered into an agreement with Stryker for the exclusive distribution of BIO4. The initial commercial sales of BIO4 under the distribution agreement began in the first quarter of 2015 resulting in an increase of revenue of $7.2 million in 2015 compared to 2014.\n\u2022 Commercial sales of our Cartiform product began in 2012. In the fourth quarter 2014, we entered into an agreement with Arthrex for the exclusive distribution of Cartiform. The initial commercial sales of Cartiform under the distribution agreement began in the first quarter of 2015 resulting in an increase in revenue of $3.4 million compared to 2014.\n\u2022 Production of Ovation was discontinued in the third quarter of 2014 and we sold or shipped to consignees all of our remaining Ovation inventory by the fourth quarter of 2014.\nGross Profit and Gross Margin\nGross profit is affected by a number of factors including product mix, cost of labor and raw materials, unit volumes, pricing, competition, new products, new customer programs, and capacity utilization. In the case of new products and new customer programs, profitability normally lags revenue growth due to product start-up costs, lower manufacturing volumes in the start-up phase, operational inefficiencies, and under-absorbed overhead. Gross margin can improve over time if manufacturing\nvolumes increase and if our utilization rates and overhead absorption improves. As a result of these and other factors, our gross margin may vary from period to period.\nGross profit was $85.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, which increased $7.2 million, or 9.1%, compared with gross profit of $78.6 million in 2016. Gross margin improved to 72.4% for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared with 71.9% in 2016. The primary reason for the increase in gross profit was an increase in pricing in late 2016, along with higher sales. Gross margin also improved as a result of manufacturing efficiencies from higher production volume.\nGross profit was $78.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, which increased $26.0 million, or 49.3%, compared with gross profit of $52.7 million in 2015. Gross margin improved to 71.9% for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared with 66.1% in 2015. The primary reason for the increase in gross profit was higher sales volume. Gross margin improved as a result of manufacturing efficiencies from higher production volume, the addition of a contract manufacturer for certain cadaveric tissue (which decreased production costs), and, in connection with the Restatement, the reversal of the recognition of revenue from two distributors in 2015, which we changed from the accrual basis of accounting to the cash basis of accounting, but continued to recognize the costs as products were shipped.\nGross profit was $52.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, which increased $11.7 million, or 28.7%, compared with gross profit of $40.9 million in 2014. Gross profit increased primarily due to higher sales volume. Gross margin decreased to 66.1% for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared with 80.6% in 2014. As noted above, in connection with the Restatement, we reversed the recognition of revenue from two distributors in 2015, which we changed from the accrual basis of accounting to the cash basis of accounting, but continued to recognize the costs as products were shipped.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nOur R&D expenses of $4.1 million in 2017 and $6.3 million in 2016 were primarily related to four clinical studies in 2017 and 2016. R&D expenses declined in 2017 compared to 2016, primarily due to the cancellation of three clinical studies in the fourth quarter of 2016 that began in 2015 and 2016 as we re-evaluated our market opportunities and research priorities.\nOur R&D expenses of $6.3 million in 2016 and $4.9 million in 2015 were primarily related to four clinical studies that began in 2015 and 2016. R&D expenses increased in 2016 compared to 2015, primarily due to the addition of clinical studies during 2016.\nOur R&D expenses of $4.9 million in 2015 with $3.4 million in 2014. The increase of $1.5 million in 2015 compared to 2014 was primarily related to clinical studies that began in 2015 to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of Grafix for the treatment of complex, diabetic foot wounds.\nSales and Marketing Expenses\nSales and marketing expenses totaled $61.5 million, or 50.1% of sales, during the year ended December 31, 2017, compared with $59.1million, or 54.0% of sales for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in sales and marketing expense of $2.4 million was primarily due to higher labor costs, including commissions.\nSales and marketing expenses totaled $59.1 million, or 54.0% of sales, during the year ended December 31, 2016, compared with $56.6 million, or 71.0% of sales for the year ended December 31, 2015. The $2.5 million increase in sales and marketing expense was primarily due to higher labor costs, including commissions.\nSales and marketing expenses totaled $56.6 million, or 71.0% of sales, during the year ended December 31, 2015, compared with $36.4 million, or 71.6% of sales for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase in sales and marketing expense of $20.2 million was primarily due to higher labor costs, including commissions of $13.8 million, and higher travel related costs of $2.7 million, higher contract services of $0.9 million, and higher costs in general as we expanded our sales, marketing and reimbursement support capabilities.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses totaled $22.1 million, or 18.7% of sales, during the year ended December 31, 2017, compared with $17.4 million, or 15.9% of sales, for the year ended December 31, 2016. This increase of $4.7 million was due to higher labor costs of $2.7 million, as we added finance, human resources, and information technology personnel to support operations, and higher professional fees of $1.9 million, primarily related to the Restatement and the related legal proceedings. In 2017, general and administrative expenses included $9.5 million of expenses for professional fees related to the Restatement and the related legal proceedings.\nGeneral and administrative expenses totaled $17.4 million, or 15.9% of sales, during the year ended December 31, 2016, compared with $9.5 million, or 11.9% of sales for the year ended December 31, 2015. This increase of $7.9 million was primarily due to higher professional fees, primarily related to the Restatement and the related legal matters. In 2016, general and administrative expenses included $8.1 million of expenses for professional fees related to the Restatement and the related legal proceedings.\nGeneral and administrative expenses totaled $9.5 million, or 11.9% of sales, during the year ended December 31, 2015, compared with $8.1 million, or 16.0% of sales for the year ended December 31, 2014. This increase of $1.4 million was primarily due to higher professional fees. In 2015, general and administrative expenses included $0.5 million of expenses for professional fees related to the Restatement and the related legal proceedings.\nSettlement of SEC and Shareholder Actions\nIn November 2017, we paid a civil penalty in the amount of $1.5 million as part of the SEC settlement with regard to the SEC investigation previously discussed, all of which was recorded as expenses in the fourth quarter of 2015. As discussed above, we are a party to a securities class action and multiple shareholder derivative actions. On March 11, 2018, we entered into a memorandum of understanding to settle the securities class action lawsuit. By the terms of the memorandum, the Company agreed in principle to a total payment of $18.5 million in cash. A definitive settlement agreement resulting from the memorandum is expected to be entered into in the second quarter of 2018 and will require court approval. Of the $18.5 million settlement payment, we expect to be reimbursed approximately $4.8 million from our insurance carrier, which we recorded as a receivable in 2015. As a result, we recorded the net amount of $13.7 million as a pretax expense in the fourth quarter of 2015.\nOther Income (Expense), net\nOther expense, net in 2017 was $0.6 million, a decrease of $1.2 million compared to other income, net of $0.4 million in 2016. The decrease is primarily due to a loss recognized in 2017 on the sale of Mesoblast Limited common stock.\nOther income, net in 2016 was $0.4 million, an increase of $2.1 million compared to other expense net of $1.7 million in 2015. The increase is primarily due to a loss recognized in 2015 related to Mesoblast Limited common stock.\nOther expense, net in 2015 was $1.7 million, which was comparable to other expense net of $1.8 million in 2014.\nIncome Taxes\nIncome tax benefit from continuing operations for 2017 was $1.4 million primarily due to the release of the valuation allowance on the AMT carryforwards, offset by state tax expense where the Company did not have state credit or net operating losses available.\nIncome tax expense from continuing operations for 2016 was $0.1 million primarily due to state tax obligations.\nIncome tax expense from continuing operations for 2015 was $0.5 million and was primarily due to an uncertain tax position relating to state taxes, compared to the expense from continuing operations of $0.1 million in 2014, which consisted primarily of AMT and state taxes.\nBecause realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon future earnings, a full valuation allowance has been recorded on the net deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, which relate primarily to net operating loss and various business tax credit carryforwards. In the event that we become profitable, we have general business credits (before a 100% valuation allowance) of approximately $0.4 million that may be utilized to reduce our federal tax. As discussed above under \"Critical Accounting Policies-Income Taxes,\" the Tax Act enacted on December 22, 2017 reduced the U.S. corporate income tax rate from a maximum of 35% to 21% and reduced the valuation allowance previously recognized on AMT credit carryforwards, which will be refundable credits.\nMesoblast Income (Loss) from Discontinued Operations\nAs noted above, in October 2013, we sold our therapeutics business to Mesoblast. The agreement with Mesoblast provided for the receipt of $50 million in initial consideration and up to an additional $50 million in payments upon Mesoblast achieving certain clinical and regulatory milestones. In addition, we are entitled to earn royalties on future sales by Mesoblast of Prochymal and other products utilizing the acquired technology. We received all of the initial consideration by April 2014, consisting of $35 million in cash and $15 million of Mesoblast Limited common stock which we classified as a trading security. The Mesoblast Limited common stock was subject to a holding period which was ultimately extended to May 2015. During this holding period, Mesoblast Limited provided us limited protection against a decline in the market value of the stock. In May 2015, concurrent with the expiration of the holding period, Mesoblast paid us $6.2 million representing the decline in the market value of the stock through that date. Later in 2015, we sold all of the Mesoblast Limited common stock for $6.8 million, resulting in a realized loss of $2.6 million, which was recorded in other income (expense), net in our consolidated statement of comprehensive income (loss) for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nAs noted above, in connection with the sale of our therapeutics business to Mesoblast, we are entitled to receive contingent consideration as a result of Mesoblast achieving certain milestones. In July 2017, we received contingent consideration of $10.0 million in Mesoblast Limited common stock and $350 thousand in cash as a milestone payment. We recorded $10.0 million, net of $0.3 million in tax, in discontinued operations in 2017. All of the Mesoblast Limited common stock was sold in 2017, resulting in a loss of approximately $1.9 million, which was reported in other income (expense), net in our consolidated statement of comprehensive income (loss) for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nSelected Unaudited Quarterly Financial Data\nThe following table sets forth selected financial data for each of the periods indicated.
