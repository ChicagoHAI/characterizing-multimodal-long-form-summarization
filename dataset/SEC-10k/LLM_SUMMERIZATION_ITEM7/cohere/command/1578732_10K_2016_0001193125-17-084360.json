MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes thereto included elsewhere herein. The following discussion contains, in addition to historical information, forward-looking statements that include risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including those factors set forth under Item 1A - \u201cRisk Factors\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOverview\nOur Business\nWe are a leading national brokerage firm specializing in commercial real estate investment sales, financing, research and advisory services. We have been the top commercial real estate investment broker in the United States based on the number of investment transactions over the last 10 years. As of December 31, 2016, we had over 1,700 investment sales and financing professionals operating in 82 offices who provide real estate brokerage and financing services to sellers and buyers of commercial real estate. We also offer market research, consulting and advisory services to our clients. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we closed 8,995 sales, financing and other transactions with total volume of approximately $42.3 billion, an increase from 8,715 sales, financing and other transactions with total volume of approximately $37.8 billion in 2015.\nWe generate revenues by collecting real estate brokerage commissions upon the sale, and fees upon the financing of, commercial properties and by providing consulting and advisory services. Real estate brokerage commissions are typically based upon the value of the property, and financing fees are typically based upon the size of the loan. During the year ended December 31, 2016, approximately 92% of our revenues were generated from real estate brokerage commissions, 6% from financing fees and 2% from other revenues, including consulting and advisory services.\nFactors Affecting Our Business\nOur business and our operating results, financial condition and liquidity are significantly affected by the number and size of commercial real estate investment sales and financing transactions we close in any period. The number and size of these transactions are affected by both internal and external factors. Internally, we are affected by our ability to recruit and retain investment sales and financing professionals, identify and contract properties for sale and properties that need financing and refinancing. Externally we are affected by four main factors including the economy, commercial real estate supply and demand, capital markets and investment activity.\nThe Economy\nOur business is dependent on economic conditions within the markets in which we operate. Changes in the economy on a global, national, regional or local basis can have a positive or a negative impact on our business. Economic indicators and projections related to job growth, unemployment, interest rates, construction and vacancies can have a positive or a negative impact on our business. Overall market conditions can have an effect on investor sentiment and, ultimately, the demand for our services from investors in real estate. Our national footprint allows us to support our clients in balancing the opportunities and risks of changing regional economic conditions. We believe the U.S. economy is showing durability and growth. The U.S. saw continued moderate growth, favorable unemployment levels and strengthened wage growth during 2016. Sentiment about economic expansion in 2017 has recently become more favorable as seen in the recent rise in the stock market, U.S. Federal Reserve interest rate increases and the possible impact of policies of the Trump administration.\nCommercial Real Estate Supply and Demand\nOur business is dependent on the willingness of investors to invest in or sell commercial real estate, which is affected by factors beyond our control. These factors include the supply of commercial real estate coupled with user demand for these properties and the performance of real estate assets when compared with other investments alternatives, such as stocks and bonds. Despite the economic recovery over the past eight years, we believe an investment in real estate continues to be a compelling investment for investors as real estate fundamentals generally remain balanced. The moderate economic growth has generated demand and reasonable construction levels for most property types has been the basis of the longevity and durability of the current real estate cycle. We believe the maturing cycle, combined with the current uncertainty around forecasted growth, rising inflation, higher interest rate trends have required investors and lenders to recalibrate their underwriting assumptions in the short-term and have resulted in a slowdown in sales. Furthermore, many investors are delaying transactions in anticipation of more clarity regarding tax reform, regulatory easing and economic initiatives. We believe a positive boost to investor sentiment is possible with clarity on government policies and growth initiatives. We believe that these factors should continue to support long-term commercial real estate investor demand and, therefore, demand for our brokerage and financing services.\nCapital Markets\nCredit and liquidity issues in the financial markets have a direct impact on the flow of capital to the commercial real estate market. Real estate purchases are often financed with debt and, as a result, credit and liquidity impact transaction activity and prices. Changes in interest rates, as well as steady and protracted movements of interest rates in one direction, whether interest rates increase or decrease, could adversely or positively affect the operations and income potential of commercial real estate properties. These changes also influence the demand of investors for commercial real estate investments. We believe indications from the U.S. Federal Reserve of future rate increases, the uncertainty as to the impact of new fiscal policies and the recent sharp increase in longer term interest rates has created a short-term headwind for real estate transactions. We continue to see disciplined underwriting from lenders as well as ample liquidity in the market. However, we have seen transactions taking longer to close in late 2016 or transactions being delayed or renegotiated due to market conditions.\nInvestment Activity\nWe rely on investors to buy and sell properties in order generate commissions. Investors' desires to engage in real estate transactions are dependent on many factors that are beyond our control. The economy, supply and demand for properly positioned properties, available credit and market events impact investor sentiment and, therefore, transaction velocity. In addition, our private clients are often motivated to buy, sell and/or refinance properties due to personal circumstances such as death, divorce, partnership breakups and estate planning. We believe that we are in a maturing real estate cycle. In 2016, the sales transaction market declined after several years of robust recovery, which combined with rising interest rates is hampering sales activity. At the same time, many investors have signaled a wait-and-see attitude toward investment decisions in anticipation of the Trump administration's tax reform, regulatory easing and infrastructure initiatives as the timing and scope are unclear but once passed into law are likely to be supportive of economic expansion and real estate markets. We believe that the healthy property fundamentals and lack of over-leveraging during the past several years support an active, but more tempered, market environment.\nSeasonality\nOur real estate brokerage commissions and financing fees have tended to be seasonal and, combined with other factors, can affect an investor's ability to compare our financial condition and results of operations on a quarter-by-quarter basis. Historically, this seasonality has generally caused our revenue, operating income, net income and cash flows from operating activities to be lower in the first half of the year and higher in the second half of the year, particularly in the fourth quarter. The concentration of earnings and cash flows in the last six\nmonths of the year, particularly in the fourth quarter, is due to an industry-wide focus of clients to complete transactions towards the end of the calendar year. This historical trend can be disrupted both positively and negatively by major economic or political events impacting investor sentiment for a particular property type or location, volatility in financial markets, current and future projections of interest rates, attractiveness of other asset classes, market liquidity and the extent of limitations or availability of capital allocations for larger property buyers, among others. Private client investors may accelerate or delay transactions due to personal or business related reasons unrelated to economic events. In addition, our operating margins are typically lower during the second half of each year due to our commission structure for some of our senior investment sales and financing professionals. These senior investment sales and financing professionals are on a graduated commission schedule that resets annually in which higher commissions are paid for higher sales volumes. Our historical pattern of seasonality may or may not continue to the same degree experienced in prior years.\nOperating Segments\nWe follow the guidance for segment reporting, which requires reporting information on operating segments in interim and annual financial statements. An operating segment is defined as a component of an enterprise that engages in business activities from which it may earn revenues and incur expenses whose separate financial information is available and is evaluated regularly by the Chief Operating Decision Maker (\u201cCODM\u201d) or decision making group, to perform resource allocations and performance assessments. The CODMs are the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer. The CODMs review aggregated financial information presented on an office-by-office basis for purposes of making operating decisions, assessing financial performance and allocating resources. Based on the evaluation of our financial information, management believes that the Company's offices represent individual operating segments with similar economic characteristics that meet the criteria for aggregation into a single reportable segment for financial reporting purposes.\nKey Financial Measures and Indicators\nRevenues\nOur revenues are primarily generated from our real estate investment sales business. In addition to real estate brokerage commissions, we generate revenues from financing fees and from other revenues, which are primarily comprised of consulting and advisory fees.\nOur business is transaction oriented and, as such, we rely on investment sales and financing professionals to continually develop leads, identify properties to sell, market those properties and close sales in a timely manner to generate a consistent flow of revenue. While our sales volume is impacted by the seasonality factors discussed above, the timing of closings is also dependent on many market and personal factors unique to a particular client or transaction, particularly clients transacting in the $1-$10 million private client market segment. These factors can cause transactions to be accelerated or delayed beyond our control. Further, commission rates earned are generally inversely related to the value of the property sold. As a result of our expansion into the middle and larger transaction market segments, we have seen our overall commission rates fluctuate from period-to-period as a result of changes in the relative mix of the number and volume of transactions closed in the middle and larger transaction market segments as compared to the $1-$10 million private client market segment. These factors may result in period-to-period variations in our revenues different from historical patterns.\nA small percentage of our transactions include retainer fees and/or breakage fees. Retainer fees are credited against a success-based fee upon the closing of a transaction or a breakage fee. Transactions that are terminated before completion will sometimes generate breakage fees, which are usually calculated as a set amount or a percentage of the fee that we would have received had the transaction closed.\nReal estate brokerage commissions\nWe earn real estate brokerage commissions by acting as a broker for commercial real estate owners seeking to sell or investors seeking to buy properties. Revenues from real estate brokerage commissions are typically recognized at the close of escrow.\nFinancing fees\nWe earn financing fees by securing financing on purchase transactions or by securing refinancing of our clients' existing mortgage debt. We recognize financing fee revenues at the time the loan closes and we have no remaining significant obligations for performance in connection with the transaction. To a lesser extent, we also earn ancillary fees associated with financing activities.\nOther revenues\nOther revenues include fees generated from consulting and advisory services performed by our investment sales professionals, as well as referral fees from other real estate brokers. Revenues from these services are recognized as they are performed and completed.\nOperating Expenses\nOur operating expenses consist of cost of services, selling, general and administrative expenses and depreciation and amortization. The significant components of our expenses are further described below.\nCost of services\nThe majority of our cost of services expense is commission expense. Commission expenses are directly attributable to providing services to our clients for investment sales and financing services. Most of our investment sales and financing professionals are independent contractors and are paid commissions; however, there are some who are initially paid a salary and certain of our financing professionals are employees and, as such, costs of services also include employee-related compensation, employer taxes and benefits for those employees. The commission rates we pay to our investment sales and financing professionals vary based on individual contracts negotiated and are generally higher for the more experienced professionals. Some of our most senior investment sales and financing professionals also have the ability to earn additional commissions after meeting certain annual revenue thresholds. These additional commissions are recognized as cost of services in the period in which they are earned as they relate to specific transactions closed. Payment of a portion of these additional commissions are generally deferred for a period of three years, at the Company's election, and paid at the beginning of the fourth calendar year. Cost of services also includes referral fees paid to other real estate brokers where the Company is the principal service provider. Cost of services, therefore, can vary based on the commission structure of the independent contractors that closed transactions in any particular period.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses\nThe largest expense component within selling, general and administrative expenses is personnel expenses for our management team and sales and support staff. In addition, these costs include facilities costs (excluding depreciation and amortization), staff related expenses, sales, marketing, legal, telecommunication, network, data sources and other administrative expenses. Also included in selling, general and administrative are expenses for stock-based compensation to non-employee directors, employees and independent contractors (i.e. investment sales and financing professionals) under the 2013 Omnibus Equity Incentive Plan (\u201c2013 Plan\u201d) and the 2013 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (\u201c2013 ESPP Plan\u201d).\nDepreciation and amortization expense\nDepreciation and amortization expense consists of depreciation and amortization recorded on our computer software and hardware and furniture, fixture and equipment. Depreciation and amortization are provided over estimated useful lives ranging from three to seven years for owned assets or over the lesser of the asset estimated useful lives or the related lease term for leasehold improvements.\nOther Income (Expense), Net\nOther income (expense), net primarily consists of net gains or losses on our deferred compensation plan assets, interest income and realized gains and losses on our marketable securities, available-for-sale, foreign currency gains and losses and other non-operating gains and losses.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense primarily consists of interest expense associated with the SARs liability, notes payable to former stockholders and our credit agreement.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nWe are subject to U.S. and Canadian federal taxes and individual state and local taxes based on the income generated in the jurisdictions in which we operate. Our effective tax rate fluctuates as a result of the change in the mix of our activities in the jurisdictions in which we operate due to differing tax rates in those jurisdictions. Our provision for income taxes excludes the windfall benefits from shares issued in connection with our 2013 Plan and 2013 ESPP Plan.\nResults of Operations\nFollowing is a discussion of our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014. The tables included in the period comparisons below provide summaries of our results of operations. The period-to-period comparisons of financial results are not necessarily indicative of future results.\nKey Operating Metrics\nWe regularly review a number of key metrics to evaluate our business, measure our performance, identify trends affecting our business, formulate financial projections and make strategic decisions. During the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, we closed more than 8,900, 8,700 and 7,600 sales, financing and other transactions with total volume of approximately $42.3 billion, $37.8 billion and $33.1 billion, respectively.

Total revenues increased primarily as a result of increases in real estate brokerage commissions, which contributed to substantially all of the total increase. A slight increase in financing fees, partially offset by a decrease in other revenues contributed the remaining change in total revenues.\nReal estate brokerage commissions. Revenues from real estate brokerage commissions increased to $662.2 million in 2016 from $632.6 million in 2015, an increase of $29.6 million or 4.7%. The increase was driven by a combination of the growth in the number of investment sales transactions (2.3%) and average transaction size (9.9%), partially offset by a decrease in average commission rates (15 basis points) due to a larger proportion of our transactions that closed in the >$20 million larger transaction market segment, which generate lower commission rates.\nFinancing fees. Revenues from financing fees increased to $43.4 million in 2016 from $42.6 million in 2015, an increase of $0.9 million or 2.1%. The increase was driven by an increase in the number of loan transactions (3.1%) due to an increase in the average number of financing professionals (15.3%), partially offset by a decrease in average fee rates (2 basis points) due in part to fees from certain larger loan transactions during 2016 as compared to 2015. Larger loan transactions generally earn a lower fee percentage.\nOther revenues. Other revenues decreased to $11.8 million in 2016 from $13.9 million in 2015, a decrease of $2.1 million or 15.3%. The decrease was primarily driven by a decrease in consulting and advisory services during 2016 as compared to 2015.\nOperating expenses\nOur total operating expenses were $610.9 million in 2016 compared to $574.4 million in 2015, an increase of $36.5 million, or 6.4%. Expenses increased primarily due to an increase in cost of services, which is predominantly variable commissions paid to our investment sales professionals and compensation-related costs related to our financing activities. Selling, general and administrative costs and to a lesser extent depreciation and amortization increased as well, as described below.\nCost of services. Cost of services in 2016 increased $21.4 million, or 5.0%, to $444.8 million from $423.4 million in 2015. The increase was primarily due to increased commission expenses driven by increased revenues. Cost of services as a percent of total revenues increased to 62.0% for 2016 compared to 61.4% in 2015 primarily due to an increase in proportion of transactions closed by our more senior investment sales professionals who are compensated generally at higher commission rates, partially offset by a reduction in referral fees.\nSelling, general and administrative expense. Selling, general and administrative expense in 2016 increased $14.1 million, or 9.5%, to $161.8 million from $147.7 million in 2015. Increases in our selling, general and administrative expense have been driven by our growth and investments in technology, sales and marketing tools and marketing and expansion of our services supporting our investment sales and financing professionals. These initiatives have primarily driven (i) a $6.7 million increase in sales and promotional marketing expenses to support increased sales activity and our annual sales recognition event; (ii) a $6.1 million increase in facilities expenses due to expansion of existing offices; (iii) a $5.7 million increase in salaries and related benefits as a result of increases in headcount in corporate and sales office support in connection with our growth and expansion of services supporting our investment sales and financing professionals; (iv) a $2.7 million increase in other expense categories, net, primarily driven by our expansion and growth. In addition, selling, general and administrative expense increased $2.5 million due to legal costs and accruals, partly driven by settlement of outstanding litigation and recoveries from a settlement with an insurance carrier during the twelve months ended December 31, 2015, which reduced legal costs in that period. These increases were offset by a $9.6 million decrease in management performance-related compensation driven by reduced bonus accruals due to management exceeding performance criteria during 2015.\nDepreciation and amortization expense. Depreciation and amortization expense increased to $4.4 million in 2016 from $3.3 million in 2015, an increase of $1.1 million, or 32.7%. The increase is primarily driven by our expansion and growth and investment in technology to redesign sales and marketing tools.\nOther income (expense), net\nOther income (expense), net increased to $2.1 million in 2016 from $0.4 million in 2015. The increase was primarily driven by an increase in the value of our foreign currency gains related to our Canadian operations, interest income on our investments in marketable securities, available-for-sale and deferred compensation plan assets held in the rabbi trust. The increase was partially offset by realized losses on our investments in marketable securities, available-for-sale, due to a security sold during 2016, which no longer met our investment policy criteria.\nInterest expense\nThere were no significant changes in interest expenses in 2016 as compared to 2015.\nProvision for income taxes\nThe provision for income taxes was $42.4 million for 2016 as compared to $47.0 million in 2015, a decrease of $4.6 million or 9.7%. The effective tax rate for 2016 was 39.6%, compared with 41.5% in 2015. The decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to the change in the Company's effective state tax rate on deferred taxes in 2015, which was minimal in 2016, lower net operating losses for our Canadian operations in 2016, which are subject to a full valuation allowance and other permanent items, primarily gains on company owned variable life insurance policies.\nThe provisions for income taxes excludes the difference in book and tax deductions associated with the settlement of shares under the Company's 2013 Plan and disqualifying dispositions of shares issued from our 2013 ESPP Plan. Such tax benefits, which aggregated $2.7 million in 2016 and $6.2 million in 2015, respectively, were recorded directly to additional paid-in capital.\nComparison of Year Ended December 31, 2015 and

Total revenues increased primarily as a result of increases in real estate brokerage commissions of $107.6 million, which contributed 92.1% of the total increase. An increase in financing fees of $8.7 million and to a lesser extent, an increase in other revenues of $0.6 million, contributed the remaining increase in total revenues.\nReal estate brokerage commissions. Revenues from real estate brokerage commissions increased to $632.6 million in 2015 from $525.0 million in 2014, an increase of $107.6 million or 20.5%. The increase was primarily driven by an increase in the number of investment sales transactions (13.3%) and an increase in average commission rates (7.4%). The rise in average commission rates is due to an increase in the proportion of our $1-$10 million private client market segment transactions as compared to larger transactions in the middle and larger transaction market segments. Transactions in the private client market segment generally earn higher commission rates than the middle and larger transaction market segments.\nFinancing fees. Revenues from financing fees increased to $42.6 million in 2015 from $33.9 million in 2014, an increase of $8.7 million or 25.6%. The increase was driven by an increase in the number of loan transactions (20.2%) due to an increase in the number of financing professionals combined with an increase in their productivity levels and an increase in average transaction size (7.6%). Average commission rates decreased slightly primarily due to the increase in the average transaction size.\nOther revenues. Other revenues increased to $13.9 million in 2015 from $13.4 million in 2014, an increase of $0.6 million or 4.2%.\nOperating expenses\nOur total operating expenses were $574.4 million in 2015 compared to $487.6 million in 2014, an increase of $86.8 million, or 17.8%. Expenses increased primarily due to an increase in cost of services, which is predominantly variable commissions paid to our investment sales and financing professionals and compensation-related costs related to our financing activities, but declined as a percentage of revenues. Selling, general and administrative costs increased as well, as described below.\nCost of services. Cost of services in 2015 increased $73.3 million, or 20.9% to $423.4 million from $350.1 million in 2014. The increase was primarily due to increased commission expenses driven by increased revenues. Cost of services as a percent of total revenues remained consistent at 61.4% in 2015 compared to 61.2% in 2014.\nSelling, general and administrative expense. Selling, general and administrative expense in 2015 increased $13.4 million, or 10.0%, to $147.7 million from $134.3 million in 2014. The increase was primarily due to (i) a $4.4 million increase in management performance-related compensation driven by our improved operating results; (ii) a $4.1 million increase in salaries and related benefits as a result of higher headcount in corporate and office support in connection with our growth; (iii) a $4.0 million increase in sales and promotional expenses driven by an increase in our annual sales recognition event and marketing expenses to support increased sales activity; (iv) a $2.1 million, net increase in stock-based compensation expense driven by increases resulting from incremental share-based awards granted since the fourth quarter of 2014 and immediate vesting of certain RSU awards under the provisions of the RSU agreement, partially offset by a decrease in the Company's stock price as RSU grants to the Company's independent contractors are required to be measured at fair value; (v) a $2.0 million increase in facilities expenses due to office expansion; and (vi) a $1.8 million net increase in other expense categories primarily driven by our expansion and business growth. The increases were partially offset by a $5.0 million decrease in legal costs due to the settlement of outstanding litigation and recoveries from a settlement with an insurance carrier.\nDepreciation and amortization expense. There were no significant changes in depreciation and amortization expenses in 2015 as compared to 2014.\nOther income, net\nOther income, net increased to $0.4 million in 2015 from $28,000 in 2014. The increase was primarily from interest income and realized gains on our investments in marketable securities, available-for-sale. The increase was partially offset by foreign currency losses related to our Canadian operations and a decrease in the value of our deferred compensation plan assets held in the rabbi trust.\nInterest expense\nThere were no significant changes in interest expenses in 2015 as compared to 2014.\nProvision for income taxes\nThe provision for income taxes was $47.0 million for 2015 as compared to $33.5 million in 2014, an increase of $13.6 million or 40.6%. The effective tax rate for 2015 was 41.5%, compared with 40.3% in 2014.\nThe increase in the effective tax rate was primarily due to the change in the Company's effective state tax rate on deferred taxes and the valuation allowance related to our Canadian net operating loss carryforwards.\nThe provisions for income taxes excluded the excess tax deduction associated with the settlement of shares under the Company's 2013 Plan, disqualifying dispositions of shares issued from our 2013 ESPP Plan and a tax deduction associated with IPO transaction costs because such tax benefits, which aggregated $6.2 million in 2015 and $5.2 million in 2014 were recorded as credits to additional paid-in capital.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measure\nIn this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we include a non-GAAP financial measure, adjusted earnings before interest income/expense, taxes, depreciation and amortization and stock-based compensation, or Adjusted EBITDA. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income before (i) interest income and other, including net realized (losses) gains on marketable securities, available-for-sale and cash and cash equivalents, (ii) interest expense, (iii) provision for income taxes, (iv) depreciation and amortization and (v) stock-based compensation expense. We use Adjusted EBITDA in our business operations to evaluate the performance of our business, develop budgets and measure our performance against those budgets, among other things. We also believe that analysts and investors use Adjusted EBITDA as a supplemental measure to evaluate our overall operating performance. However, Adjusted EBITDA has material limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation, or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\u201cU.S. GAAP\u201d). We find Adjusted EBITDA as a useful tool to assist in evaluating performance because Adjusted EBITDA eliminates items related to capital structure, taxes and non-cash stock-based compensation charges. In light of the foregoing limitations, we do not rely solely on Adjusted EBITDA as a performance measure and also consider our U.S. GAAP results. Adjusted EBITDA is not a measurement of our financial performance under U.S. GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to net income, operating income or any other measures calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Because Adjusted EBITDA is not calculated in the same manner by all companies, it may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures used by other companies.\nA reconciliation of the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure, net income, to Adjusted EBITDA is as follows (in thousands):\nTable 46: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2014 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2013 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2012 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net income\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>64,657 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>66,350 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>49,531 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>8,206 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>27,934 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Adjustments:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest income and other (1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,761 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,373 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(50 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>356 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(166 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest expense\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,533 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,726 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,651 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>105 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Provision for income taxes\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>42,445 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>47,018 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>33,452 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13,735 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>21,507 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,387 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,305 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,206 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,043 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,981 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Stock-based compensation (2)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,035 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,114 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,034 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>35,841 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,448 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Adjusted EBITDA (3)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>118,296 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>124,140 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>92,824 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>61,286 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>59,708 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 47: <table> <tr> <td>(1) </td> <td>Other for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 consists of $(121) and $132 of net realized (losses) gains on marketable securities available-for-sale and cash and cash equivalents.

In order to enhance yield to us, we have invested a portion of our cash in money market funds and in fixed and variable income debt securities, in accordance with our investment policy approved by the board of directors. Although we have historically funded our operations through operating cash flows, there can be no assurance that we can continue to meet our cash requirements entirely through our operations, cash and cash equivalents, proceeds from the sale of marketable securities, available-for-sale or availability under our credit agreement.\nCash held in our Canadian operations aggregated $404,000 and $763,000 at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nCash Flows\nOur total cash and cash equivalents balance increased by $91.2 million to $187.4 million at December 31, 2016, compared to $96.2 million at December 31, 2015.

Cash flows provided by operating activities were $74.5 million in 2016 compared to $72.1 million in 2015. Net cash provided by operating activities is driven by our net income adjusted for non-cash items and changes in operating assets and liabilities. The $2.4 million increase in cash flows provided by operating activities in 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 was primarily due to the net effect of the growth of our business, differences in timing of payments and receipts, a reduction in the deferral of certain discretionary commissions, lower bonus accruals and a reduction of advances to the Company's investment sales and financing professionals.\n2015 Compared to 2014. Cash flows provided by operating activities were $72.1 million in 2015 compared to $71.4 million in 2014. Net cash provided by operating activities is driven by our net income adjusted for non-cash items and changes in operating assets and liabilities. The $0.7 million increase in cash flows provided by operating activities in 2015 compared to the same period in 2014 was primarily due to the growth in our business along with differences in timing of payments and receipts and bonus accruals related to our increased operating results.\nInvesting Activities\n2016 Compared to 2015. Cash flows provided by investing activities were $19.8 million in 2016 compared to cash flows used in investing activities of $126.9 million in 2015. The change in cash flows provided by investing activities in 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 was primarily due to $29.7 million in net proceeds from the sale of marketable securities, available-for-sale for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to $119.9 million in net purchases for the same period in 2015.\n2015 Compared to 2014. Cash flows used for investing activities were $126.9 million in 2015 compared to $17.2 million in 2014. The increase in cash flows used for investing activities in 2015 compared to the same period in 2014 was primarily due to $119.9 million in net purchases of marketable securities, available-for-sale for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $14.7 million for the same period in 2014.\nFinancing Activities\n2016 Compared to 2015. Cash flows used in financing activities were $3.1 million in 2016 compared to cash flows provided by financing activities of $1.8 million in 2015. The change in cash flows used in financing activities in 2016 compared to the same period in 2015, was primarily impacted by net changes in stock-based award activity, including excess tax benefit from stock-based award activity and taxes paid related to net share settlement of stock-based awards. See Note 10 - \u201cStock-Based Compensation Plans\u201d our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\n2015 Compared to 2014. Cash flows provided by financing activities were $1.8 million in 2015 compared to cash flows used in financing activities of $6.0 million in 2014. The change in cash flows provided by financing activities in 2015 compared to the same period in 2014, was primarily impacted by net changes in stock-based award activity, including excess tax benefit from stock-based award activity. See Note 10 - \u201cStock-Based Compensation Plans\u201d our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nLiquidity\nWe believe that our existing balances of cash and cash equivalents, cash flows expected to be generated from our operations, proceeds from the sale of marketable securities, available-for-sale and borrowings available under the Credit Agreement (defined below) will be sufficient to satisfy our operating requirements for at least the next twelve months. If we need to raise additional capital through public or private debt or equity financings, strategic relationships or other arrangements, this capital might not be available to us in a timely manner, on acceptable terms or at all. Our failure to raise sufficient capital, when needed, could prevent us from funding acquisitions or otherwise financing our growth or operations. In addition, our notes payable to former stockholders and SARs liability have provisions, which could accelerate repayment of outstanding principal and accrued interest and adversely impact our liquidity.\nCredit Agreement\nOn June 18, 2014, we entered into the Credit Agreement with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association (\u201cBank\u201d), dated as of June 1, 2014 (the \u201cCredit Agreement\u201d). The Credit Agreement is intended to provide for future liquidity needs, if needed. The Credit Agreement provides for a $60.0 million principal amount senior secured revolving credit facility that is guaranteed by all of the Company's domestic subsidiaries (the \u201cCredit Facility\u201d), which, as amended, matures on June 1, 2019. We may borrow, repay and reborrow amounts under the Credit Facility until its maturity date, at which time all amounts outstanding under the Credit Facility must be repaid in full. We must pay a commitment fee of up to 0.1% per annum, payable quarterly, based on the amount of unutilized commitments under the Credit Facility.\nThe Credit Facility includes a $10.0 million sublimit for the issuance of standby letters of credit, of which $533,000 was utilized at December 31, 2016. As of December 31, 2016, there were no amounts outstanding under the Credit Agreement.\nBorrowings under the Credit Facility bear interest, at our option, at either the (i) Base Rate (defined as the highest of (a) the Bank's prime rate, (b) the Federal Funds Rate plus 1.5% and (c) one-month LIBOR plus 1.5%), or (ii) at a variable rate between 0.875% and 1.125% above LIBOR, based upon the total funded debt to EBITDA ratio.\nThe Credit Facility contains customary covenants, including financial covenants (which require us, on a combined basis with our guarantors, to maintain (i) an EBITDAR Coverage Ratio (as defined in the Credit Agreement) of not less than 1.25:1.0 as of each quarter end on a rolling 4-quarter basis and (ii) total funded debt to EBITDA not greater than 2.0:1.0), reporting requirements and events of default. The Credit Facility is secured by substantially all of our assets, including pledges of 100% of the stock or other equity interest of each subsidiary except to the extent such property constitutes the capital stock of a controlled foreign corporation (as defined in the Internal Revenue Code), in which case no such pledge is required.\nSee Note 14 - \u201cCommitments and Contingencies\u201d of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the Credit Agreement.\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nThe contractual obligations and other commitments consisted of the following at December 31, 2016 (in thousands):\nTable 51: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Less than\n1 Year </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1-3 Years </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3-5 Years </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>More Than\n5 Years </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Other (7) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating lease obligations (1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>76,335 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>16,328 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>26,996 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>19,825 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>13,186 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> SARs liability (principal and interest) (2)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>31,966 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,366 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,217 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,866 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>23,517 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Notes payable (principal and interest) (3)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11,315 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,472 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,946 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,897 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Deferred commissions payable (4)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>36,236 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16,844 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>19,392 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Deferred compensation liability (5)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,012 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>607 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,520 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,439 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>153 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,293 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other (6)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,725 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,550 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>175 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>166,589 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>40,167 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>54,246 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>32,027 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>36,856 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,293 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 52: <table> <tr> <td>(1) </td> <td>See Note 14 - \u201cCommitments and Contingencies\u201d of our Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 53: <table> <tr> <td>(2) </td> <td>Forecasted principal payments are based on each participant estimated retirement age and contractual interest rate of 4.446% on January 1, 2017 and reflects required payments that resulted from the retirement of certain executives.

However, to date, we do not believe that general inflation has had a material impact upon our operations.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nWe prepare our financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. In applying many of these accounting principles, we make assumptions, estimates and/or judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses in our consolidated financial statements. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. These assumptions, estimates and/or judgments, however, are often subjective and our actual results may change negatively or positively based on changing circumstances or changes in our analyses. If actual amounts are ultimately different from our estimates, the revisions are included in our results of operations for the period in which the actual amounts become known.\nWe believe that the critical accounting policies discussed below involve a greater degree of judgment or complexity than our other accounting policies. Accordingly, these are the policies we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our consolidated financial condition and results of operations. See the notes to our consolidated financial statements for a summary of our significant accounting policies.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe generate real estate brokerage commissions by acting as a broker for real estate owners or investors seeking to buy or sell commercial properties. Revenues from real estate brokerage commissions and financing fees from securing financing on purchase transactions as well as fees earned from refinancing its clients' existing mortgage debt and other financing activities are recognized in principally all cases on the close of escrow or when the loan closes.\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe initially value restricted stock units and restricted stock awards based on the grant date closing price of our common stock and recognize the related expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for the entire award, subject to periodic adjustments to ensure that the cumulative amount of expense recognized through the end of any reporting period is at least equal to the portion of the grant date value of the award that has vested through that date. Awards made to our independent contractors, who are primarily our investment sales professionals, are accounted for as liability awards and require remeasurement to fair value at the end of each reporting period. Compensation expense is adjusted for estimated forfeitures and is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the award. We may be required to use judgment in determining the service period for awards granted based on contract terms. Forfeiture assumptions for all stock-based awards are based on historical forfeitures for different classes of service providers. Assumptions are evaluated on a quarterly basis and updated as necessary. After adoption of ASU 2016-09, Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting on January 1, 2017, the Company will change its accounting for forfeitures to as they occur.\nWe estimate the grant-date fair value for issuances under the 2013 ESPP Plan using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. We determined that the plan was a compensatory plan and the Company is required to expense the fair value of the awards over each six-month offering period. We use judgments and assumptions in determining the value of the awards. We calculate the expected volatility based on the historical volatility of our common stock and the risk-free interest rate based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant, both consistent with the term of the offering period. We incorporate no forfeiture rate and include no expected dividend yield as the Company has not paid, and currently does not intend to pay, a regular dividend.\nIncome Taxes\nWe account for income taxes under the asset and liability method. We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences attributable to (1) differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis, and (2) operating losses and tax credit\ncarryforwards. We measure existing deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which we expect to have temporary differences realized or settled. We recognize in the provision for income taxes the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates in the period that includes the enactment date. Valuation allowances are provided against deferred tax assets when it is more-likely-than-not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized.\nBecause of the nature of our business, which includes activity in the U.S. and Canada, incorporating numerous states and provinces as well as local jurisdictions, our tax position can be complex. As such, we use estimates to determine state tax apportionment, foreign and local taxes, recognized and unrecognized tax positions, tax related interest and penalties, valuation allowances and other permanent items, all which impact our effective tax rate. Changes in these estimates are as a result of changes in the mix of our activity in the various jurisdictions in which we operate and changes in the nature and extent of other estimates.\nWe evaluate the tax positions taken quarterly. The threshold for recognizing the benefits of tax return positions in the financial statements is \u201cmore likely than not\u201d to be sustained by the taxing authority and requires measurement of a tax position meeting the more-likely-than-not criterion, based on the largest benefit that is more than 50% likely to be realized.\nWe recognize interest and penalties incurred as income tax expense.\nPrior to the IPO, we were part of a consolidated federal income tax return and various combined and consolidated state tax returns that were filed by our previous parent. We had a tax-sharing agreement whereby we provided for income taxes in our consolidated statements of net and comprehensive income using an effective tax rate of 43.5%.\nInvestments in Marketable Securities, Available-for-sale\nWe maintain a portfolio of cash equivalents and investments in a variety of fixed and variable rate securities, including U.S. treasuries, U.S. government sponsored entities, corporate debt securities, asset-backed securities and other. We consider our investment in marketable securities to be available-for-sale. Accordingly, these investments are recorded at their fair values, with unrealized gains or losses recorded in other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax. We determine the appropriate classification of investments in marketable securities at the time of purchase. Interest, along with accretion and amortization of purchase premiums and discounts, which are recorded over the remaining weighted average life of the security, are included in other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of net and comprehensive income.\nWe regularly review our investment portfolio to determine if any security is other-than-temporarily impaired, which would require us to record an impairment charge in the period any such determination is made. In making this judgment, we evaluate, among other items, the time frame and extent to which the fair market value of a security is less than its amortized cost and our intent and ability to sell, or whether we will more likely than not be required to sell, the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis. The assumptions and judgments may change based on changes in our operations or future plans.\nLitigation\nWe are subject to various legal proceeding and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business, some of which involve claims for damages that are substantial in amount. Most of these litigation matters are covered by insurance which contain deductibles, exclusions, claim limits and aggregate policy limits. While the ultimate liability for these legal proceeding cannot be determined, we use judgment in the evaluation claims and the need for accrual for loss contingencies quarterly. We record an accrual for litigation related losses where we determine the likelihood of loss is both probable and estimable. We accrue legal fees for litigation as the legal services are provided.\nLeases\nWe lease all of our facilities under operating lease agreements. Lease agreements may contain periods of free rent or reduced rent or contain predetermined fixed increases in the minimum rent. We recognize the minimum lease payments as rent expense on a straight-line basis over the noncancellable term of the lease. We record the difference between the amount charged to rent expense and the rent paid as a deferred rent obligation. We typically lease general purpose built-out office space, which reverts to the lessor upon termination of the lease. Any payments for improvements, net of incentives received, are recorded as prepaid rent. Prepaid rent is amortized using the straight-line method over the expected lease term as a charge to rent expense.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nFor information regarding recent accounting pronouncements, see Note 2 - \u201cAccounting Policies\u201d of our Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.", "summary": "- The table represents the ratio of dollar sales to unit sales for a particular product over several time periods.\n- The table contains the following columns:\n- Month, in which the sales data is aggregated\n- Dollar Sales, the total dollar sales for the product in a given month\n- Unit Sales, the total number of units sold for the product in a given month\n- The table also contains an additional column, which shows the percentage of total sales that the dollar sales for a given month constitute.\n- The percentage is calculated by dividing the dollar sales for the month by the total dollar sales for the entire table and multiplying the result by 100.\n- Overall, the table shows the monthly revenue and unit sales for a particular product, as well as the percentage of total sales that each month's revenue constitutes. \n\nWould you like help with anything else regarding this table?", "item_7_tables": "Table 41: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes thereto included elsewhere herein. The following discussion contains, in addition to historical information, forward-looking statements that include risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including those factors set forth under Item 1A - \u201cRisk Factors\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOverview\nOur Business\nWe are a leading national brokerage firm specializing in commercial real estate investment sales, financing, research and advisory services. We have been the top commercial real estate investment broker in the United States based on the number of investment transactions over the last 10 years. As of December 31, 2016, we had over 1,700 investment sales and financing professionals operating in 82 offices who provide real estate brokerage and financing services to sellers and buyers of commercial real estate. We also offer market research, consulting and advisory services to our clients. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we closed 8,995 sales, financing and other transactions with total volume of approximately $42.3 billion, an increase from 8,715 sales, financing and other transactions with total volume of approximately $37.8 billion in 2015.\nWe generate revenues by collecting real estate brokerage commissions upon the sale, and fees upon the financing of, commercial properties and by providing consulting and advisory services. Real estate brokerage commissions are typically based upon the value of the property, and financing fees are typically based upon the size of the loan. During the year ended December 31, 2016, approximately 92% of our revenues were generated from real estate brokerage commissions, 6% from financing fees and 2% from other revenues, including consulting and advisory services.\nFactors Affecting Our Business\nOur business and our operating results, financial condition and liquidity are significantly affected by the number and size of commercial real estate investment sales and financing transactions we close in any period. The number and size of these transactions are affected by both internal and external factors. Internally, we are affected by our ability to recruit and retain investment sales and financing professionals, identify and contract properties for sale and properties that need financing and refinancing. Externally we are affected by four main factors including the economy, commercial real estate supply and demand, capital markets and investment activity.\nThe Economy\nOur business is dependent on economic conditions within the markets in which we operate. Changes in the economy on a global, national, regional or local basis can have a positive or a negative impact on our business. Economic indicators and projections related to job growth, unemployment, interest rates, construction and vacancies can have a positive or a negative impact on our business. Overall market conditions can have an effect on investor sentiment and, ultimately, the demand for our services from investors in real estate. Our national footprint allows us to support our clients in balancing the opportunities and risks of changing regional economic conditions. We believe the U.S. economy is showing durability and growth. The U.S. saw continued moderate growth, favorable unemployment levels and strengthened wage growth during 2016. Sentiment about economic expansion in 2017 has recently become more favorable as seen in the recent rise in the stock market, U.S. Federal Reserve interest rate increases and the possible impact of policies of the Trump administration.\nCommercial Real Estate Supply and Demand\nOur business is dependent on the willingness of investors to invest in or sell commercial real estate, which is affected by factors beyond our control. These factors include the supply of commercial real estate coupled with user demand for these properties and the performance of real estate assets when compared with other investments alternatives, such as stocks and bonds. Despite the economic recovery over the past eight years, we believe an investment in real estate continues to be a compelling investment for investors as real estate fundamentals generally remain balanced. The moderate economic growth has generated demand and reasonable construction levels for most property types has been the basis of the longevity and durability of the current real estate cycle. We believe the maturing cycle, combined with the current uncertainty around forecasted growth, rising inflation, higher interest rate trends have required investors and lenders to recalibrate their underwriting assumptions in the short-term and have resulted in a slowdown in sales. Furthermore, many investors are delaying transactions in anticipation of more clarity regarding tax reform, regulatory easing and economic initiatives. We believe a positive boost to investor sentiment is possible with clarity on government policies and growth initiatives. We believe that these factors should continue to support long-term commercial real estate investor demand and, therefore, demand for our brokerage and financing services.\nCapital Markets\nCredit and liquidity issues in the financial markets have a direct impact on the flow of capital to the commercial real estate market. Real estate purchases are often financed with debt and, as a result, credit and liquidity impact transaction activity and prices. Changes in interest rates, as well as steady and protracted movements of interest rates in one direction, whether interest rates increase or decrease, could adversely or positively affect the operations and income potential of commercial real estate properties. These changes also influence the demand of investors for commercial real estate investments. We believe indications from the U.S. Federal Reserve of future rate increases, the uncertainty as to the impact of new fiscal policies and the recent sharp increase in longer term interest rates has created a short-term headwind for real estate transactions. We continue to see disciplined underwriting from lenders as well as ample liquidity in the market. However, we have seen transactions taking longer to close in late 2016 or transactions being delayed or renegotiated due to market conditions.\nInvestment Activity\nWe rely on investors to buy and sell properties in order generate commissions. Investors' desires to engage in real estate transactions are dependent on many factors that are beyond our control. The economy, supply and demand for properly positioned properties, available credit and market events impact investor sentiment and, therefore, transaction velocity. In addition, our private clients are often motivated to buy, sell and/or refinance properties due to personal circumstances such as death, divorce, partnership breakups and estate planning. We believe that we are in a maturing real estate cycle. In 2016, the sales transaction market declined after several years of robust recovery, which combined with rising interest rates is hampering sales activity. At the same time, many investors have signaled a wait-and-see attitude toward investment decisions in anticipation of the Trump administration's tax reform, regulatory easing and infrastructure initiatives as the timing and scope are unclear but once passed into law are likely to be supportive of economic expansion and real estate markets. We believe that the healthy property fundamentals and lack of over-leveraging during the past several years support an active, but more tempered, market environment.\nSeasonality\nOur real estate brokerage commissions and financing fees have tended to be seasonal and, combined with other factors, can affect an investor's ability to compare our financial condition and results of operations on a quarter-by-quarter basis. Historically, this seasonality has generally caused our revenue, operating income, net income and cash flows from operating activities to be lower in the first half of the year and higher in the second half of the year, particularly in the fourth quarter. The concentration of earnings and cash flows in the last six\nmonths of the year, particularly in the fourth quarter, is due to an industry-wide focus of clients to complete transactions towards the end of the calendar year. This historical trend can be disrupted both positively and negatively by major economic or political events impacting investor sentiment for a particular property type or location, volatility in financial markets, current and future projections of interest rates, attractiveness of other asset classes, market liquidity and the extent of limitations or availability of capital allocations for larger property buyers, among others. Private client investors may accelerate or delay transactions due to personal or business related reasons unrelated to economic events. In addition, our operating margins are typically lower during the second half of each year due to our commission structure for some of our senior investment sales and financing professionals. These senior investment sales and financing professionals are on a graduated commission schedule that resets annually in which higher commissions are paid for higher sales volumes. Our historical pattern of seasonality may or may not continue to the same degree experienced in prior years.\nOperating Segments\nWe follow the guidance for segment reporting, which requires reporting information on operating segments in interim and annual financial statements. An operating segment is defined as a component of an enterprise that engages in business activities from which it may earn revenues and incur expenses whose separate financial information is available and is evaluated regularly by the Chief Operating Decision Maker (\u201cCODM\u201d) or decision making group, to perform resource allocations and performance assessments. The CODMs are the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer. The CODMs review aggregated financial information presented on an office-by-office basis for purposes of making operating decisions, assessing financial performance and allocating resources. Based on the evaluation of our financial information, management believes that the Company's offices represent individual operating segments with similar economic characteristics that meet the criteria for aggregation into a single reportable segment for financial reporting purposes.\nKey Financial Measures and Indicators\nRevenues\nOur revenues are primarily generated from our real estate investment sales business. In addition to real estate brokerage commissions, we generate revenues from financing fees and from other revenues, which are primarily comprised of consulting and advisory fees.\nOur business is transaction oriented and, as such, we rely on investment sales and financing professionals to continually develop leads, identify properties to sell, market those properties and close sales in a timely manner to generate a consistent flow of revenue. While our sales volume is impacted by the seasonality factors discussed above, the timing of closings is also dependent on many market and personal factors unique to a particular client or transaction, particularly clients transacting in the $1-$10 million private client market segment. These factors can cause transactions to be accelerated or delayed beyond our control. Further, commission rates earned are generally inversely related to the value of the property sold. As a result of our expansion into the middle and larger transaction market segments, we have seen our overall commission rates fluctuate from period-to-period as a result of changes in the relative mix of the number and volume of transactions closed in the middle and larger transaction market segments as compared to the $1-$10 million private client market segment. These factors may result in period-to-period variations in our revenues different from historical patterns.\nA small percentage of our transactions include retainer fees and/or breakage fees. Retainer fees are credited against a success-based fee upon the closing of a transaction or a breakage fee. Transactions that are terminated before completion will sometimes generate breakage fees, which are usually calculated as a set amount or a percentage of the fee that we would have received had the transaction closed.\nReal estate brokerage commissions\nWe earn real estate brokerage commissions by acting as a broker for commercial real estate owners seeking to sell or investors seeking to buy properties. Revenues from real estate brokerage commissions are typically recognized at the close of escrow.\nFinancing fees\nWe earn financing fees by securing financing on purchase transactions or by securing refinancing of our clients' existing mortgage debt. We recognize financing fee revenues at the time the loan closes and we have no remaining significant obligations for performance in connection with the transaction. To a lesser extent, we also earn ancillary fees associated with financing activities.\nOther revenues\nOther revenues include fees generated from consulting and advisory services performed by our investment sales professionals, as well as referral fees from other real estate brokers. Revenues from these services are recognized as they are performed and completed.\nOperating Expenses\nOur operating expenses consist of cost of services, selling, general and administrative expenses and depreciation and amortization. The significant components of our expenses are further described below.\nCost of services\nThe majority of our cost of services expense is commission expense. Commission expenses are directly attributable to providing services to our clients for investment sales and financing services. Most of our investment sales and financing professionals are independent contractors and are paid commissions; however, there are some who are initially paid a salary and certain of our financing professionals are employees and, as such, costs of services also include employee-related compensation, employer taxes and benefits for those employees. The commission rates we pay to our investment sales and financing professionals vary based on individual contracts negotiated and are generally higher for the more experienced professionals. Some of our most senior investment sales and financing professionals also have the ability to earn additional commissions after meeting certain annual revenue thresholds. These additional commissions are recognized as cost of services in the period in which they are earned as they relate to specific transactions closed. Payment of a portion of these additional commissions are generally deferred for a period of three years, at the Company's election, and paid at the beginning of the fourth calendar year. Cost of services also includes referral fees paid to other real estate brokers where the Company is the principal service provider. Cost of services, therefore, can vary based on the commission structure of the independent contractors that closed transactions in any particular period.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses\nThe largest expense component within selling, general and administrative expenses is personnel expenses for our management team and sales and support staff. In addition, these costs include facilities costs (excluding depreciation and amortization), staff related expenses, sales, marketing, legal, telecommunication, network, data sources and other administrative expenses. Also included in selling, general and administrative are expenses for stock-based compensation to non-employee directors, employees and independent contractors (i.e. investment sales and financing professionals) under the 2013 Omnibus Equity Incentive Plan (\u201c2013 Plan\u201d) and the 2013 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (\u201c2013 ESPP Plan\u201d).\nDepreciation and amortization expense\nDepreciation and amortization expense consists of depreciation and amortization recorded on our computer software and hardware and furniture, fixture and equipment. Depreciation and amortization are provided over estimated useful lives ranging from three to seven years for owned assets or over the lesser of the asset estimated useful lives or the related lease term for leasehold improvements.\nOther Income (Expense), Net\nOther income (expense), net primarily consists of net gains or losses on our deferred compensation plan assets, interest income and realized gains and losses on our marketable securities, available-for-sale, foreign currency gains and losses and other non-operating gains and losses.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense primarily consists of interest expense associated with the SARs liability, notes payable to former stockholders and our credit agreement.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nWe are subject to U.S. and Canadian federal taxes and individual state and local taxes based on the income generated in the jurisdictions in which we operate. Our effective tax rate fluctuates as a result of the change in the mix of our activities in the jurisdictions in which we operate due to differing tax rates in those jurisdictions. Our provision for income taxes excludes the windfall benefits from shares issued in connection with our 2013 Plan and 2013 ESPP Plan.\nResults of Operations\nFollowing is a discussion of our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014. The tables included in the period comparisons below provide summaries of our results of operations. The period-to-period comparisons of financial results are not necessarily indicative of future results.\nKey Operating Metrics\nWe regularly review a number of key metrics to evaluate our business, measure our performance, identify trends affecting our business, formulate financial projections and make strategic decisions. During the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, we closed more than 8,900, 8,700 and 7,600 sales, financing and other transactions with total volume of approximately $42.3 billion, $37.8 billion and $33.1 billion, respectively. Such key metrics for real estate brokerage and financing activities are as follows:\n\nComparison of Year Ended December 31, 2016 and 2015\nBelow are key operating results for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the results for the year ended December 31, 2015 (dollars in thousands):\n\n (1) Adjusted EBITDA is not a measurement of our financial performance under U.S. GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to net income, operating income or any other measures derived in accordance with U.S. GAAP. For a definition of Adjusted EBITDA and a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income, see \u201cNon-GAAP Financial Measure.\u201d \nRevenues\nOur total revenues were $717.5 million in 2016 compared to $689.1 million in 2015, an increase of $28.4 million or 4.1%. Total revenues increased primarily as a result of increases in real estate brokerage commissions, which contributed to substantially all of the total increase. A slight increase in financing fees, partially offset by a decrease in other revenues contributed the remaining change in total revenues.\nReal estate brokerage commissions. Revenues from real estate brokerage commissions increased to $662.2 million in 2016 from $632.6 million in 2015, an increase of $29.6 million or 4.7%. The increase was driven by a combination of the growth in the number of investment sales transactions (2.3%) and average transaction size (9.9%), partially offset by a decrease in average commission rates (15 basis points) due to a larger proportion of our transactions that closed in the >$20 million larger transaction market segment, which generate lower commission rates.\nFinancing fees. Revenues from financing fees increased to $43.4 million in 2016 from $42.6 million in 2015, an increase of $0.9 million or 2.1%. The increase was driven by an increase in the number of loan transactions (3.1%) due to an increase in the average number of financing professionals (15.3%), partially offset by a decrease in average fee rates (2 basis points) due in part to fees from certain larger loan transactions during 2016 as compared to 2015. Larger loan transactions generally earn a lower fee percentage.\nOther revenues. Other revenues decreased to $11.8 million in 2016 from $13.9 million in 2015, a decrease of $2.1 million or 15.3%. The decrease was primarily driven by a decrease in consulting and advisory services during 2016 as compared to 2015.\nOperating expenses\nOur total operating expenses were $610.9 million in 2016 compared to $574.4 million in 2015, an increase of $36.5 million, or 6.4%. Expenses increased primarily due to an increase in cost of services, which is predominantly variable commissions paid to our investment sales professionals and compensation-related costs related to our financing activities. Selling, general and administrative costs and to a lesser extent depreciation and amortization increased as well, as described below.\nCost of services. Cost of services in 2016 increased $21.4 million, or 5.0%, to $444.8 million from $423.4 million in 2015. The increase was primarily due to increased commission expenses driven by increased revenues. Cost of services as a percent of total revenues increased to 62.0% for 2016 compared to 61.4% in 2015 primarily due to an increase in proportion of transactions closed by our more senior investment sales professionals who are compensated generally at higher commission rates, partially offset by a reduction in referral fees.\nSelling, general and administrative expense. Selling, general and administrative expense in 2016 increased $14.1 million, or 9.5%, to $161.8 million from $147.7 million in 2015. Increases in our selling, general and administrative expense have been driven by our growth and investments in technology, sales and marketing tools and marketing and expansion of our services supporting our investment sales and financing professionals. These initiatives have primarily driven (i) a $6.7 million increase in sales and promotional marketing expenses to support increased sales activity and our annual sales recognition event; (ii) a $6.1 million increase in facilities expenses due to expansion of existing offices; (iii) a $5.7 million increase in salaries and related benefits as a result of increases in headcount in corporate and sales office support in connection with our growth and expansion of services supporting our investment sales and financing professionals; (iv) a $2.7 million increase in other expense categories, net, primarily driven by our expansion and growth. In addition, selling, general and administrative expense increased $2.5 million due to legal costs and accruals, partly driven by settlement of outstanding litigation and recoveries from a settlement with an insurance carrier during the twelve months ended December 31, 2015, which reduced legal costs in that period. These increases were offset by a $9.6 million decrease in management performance-related compensation driven by reduced bonus accruals due to management exceeding performance criteria during 2015.\nDepreciation and amortization expense. Depreciation and amortization expense increased to $4.4 million in 2016 from $3.3 million in 2015, an increase of $1.1 million, or 32.7%. The increase is primarily driven by our expansion and growth and investment in technology to redesign sales and marketing tools.\nOther income (expense), net\nOther income (expense), net increased to $2.1 million in 2016 from $0.4 million in 2015. The increase was primarily driven by an increase in the value of our foreign currency gains related to our Canadian operations, interest income on our investments in marketable securities, available-for-sale and deferred compensation plan assets held in the rabbi trust. The increase was partially offset by realized losses on our investments in marketable securities, available-for-sale, due to a security sold during 2016, which no longer met our investment policy criteria.\nInterest expense\nThere were no significant changes in interest expenses in 2016 as compared to 2015.\nProvision for income taxes\nThe provision for income taxes was $42.4 million for 2016 as compared to $47.0 million in 2015, a decrease of $4.6 million or 9.7%. The effective tax rate for 2016 was 39.6%, compared with 41.5% in 2015. The decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to the change in the Company's effective state tax rate on deferred taxes in 2015, which was minimal in 2016, lower net operating losses for our Canadian operations in 2016, which are subject to a full valuation allowance and other permanent items, primarily gains on company owned variable life insurance policies.\nThe provisions for income taxes excludes the difference in book and tax deductions associated with the settlement of shares under the Company's 2013 Plan and disqualifying dispositions of shares issued from our 2013 ESPP Plan. Such tax benefits, which aggregated $2.7 million in 2016 and $6.2 million in 2015, respectively, were recorded directly to additional paid-in capital.\nComparison of Year Ended December 31, 2015 and 2014\nBelow are key operating results for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the results for the year ended December 31, 2014 (dollars in thousands):\n\n (1) Adjusted EBITDA is not a measurement of our financial performance under U.S. GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to net income, operating income or any other measures derived in accordance with U.S. GAAP. For a definition of Adjusted EBITDA and a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income, see \u201cNon-GAAP Financial Measure.\u201d \nRevenues\nOur total revenues were $689.1 million in 2015 compared to $572.2 million in 2014, an increase of $116.9 million, or 20.4%. Total revenues increased primarily as a result of increases in real estate brokerage commissions of $107.6 million, which contributed 92.1% of the total increase. An increase in financing fees of $8.7 million and to a lesser extent, an increase in other revenues of $0.6 million, contributed the remaining increase in total revenues.\nReal estate brokerage commissions. Revenues from real estate brokerage commissions increased to $632.6 million in 2015 from $525.0 million in 2014, an increase of $107.6 million or 20.5%. The increase was primarily driven by an increase in the number of investment sales transactions (13.3%) and an increase in average commission rates (7.4%). The rise in average commission rates is due to an increase in the proportion of our $1-$10 million private client market segment transactions as compared to larger transactions in the middle and larger transaction market segments. Transactions in the private client market segment generally earn higher commission rates than the middle and larger transaction market segments.\nFinancing fees. Revenues from financing fees increased to $42.6 million in 2015 from $33.9 million in 2014, an increase of $8.7 million or 25.6%. The increase was driven by an increase in the number of loan transactions (20.2%) due to an increase in the number of financing professionals combined with an increase in their productivity levels and an increase in average transaction size (7.6%). Average commission rates decreased slightly primarily due to the increase in the average transaction size.\nOther revenues. Other revenues increased to $13.9 million in 2015 from $13.4 million in 2014, an increase of $0.6 million or 4.2%.\nOperating expenses\nOur total operating expenses were $574.4 million in 2015 compared to $487.6 million in 2014, an increase of $86.8 million, or 17.8%. Expenses increased primarily due to an increase in cost of services, which is predominantly variable commissions paid to our investment sales and financing professionals and compensation-related costs related to our financing activities, but declined as a percentage of revenues. Selling, general and administrative costs increased as well, as described below.\nCost of services. Cost of services in 2015 increased $73.3 million, or 20.9% to $423.4 million from $350.1 million in 2014. The increase was primarily due to increased commission expenses driven by increased revenues. Cost of services as a percent of total revenues remained consistent at 61.4% in 2015 compared to 61.2% in 2014.\nSelling, general and administrative expense. Selling, general and administrative expense in 2015 increased $13.4 million, or 10.0%, to $147.7 million from $134.3 million in 2014. The increase was primarily due to (i) a $4.4 million increase in management performance-related compensation driven by our improved operating results; (ii) a $4.1 million increase in salaries and related benefits as a result of higher headcount in corporate and office support in connection with our growth; (iii) a $4.0 million increase in sales and promotional expenses driven by an increase in our annual sales recognition event and marketing expenses to support increased sales activity; (iv) a $2.1 million, net increase in stock-based compensation expense driven by increases resulting from incremental share-based awards granted since the fourth quarter of 2014 and immediate vesting of certain RSU awards under the provisions of the RSU agreement, partially offset by a decrease in the Company's stock price as RSU grants to the Company's independent contractors are required to be measured at fair value; (v) a $2.0 million increase in facilities expenses due to office expansion; and (vi) a $1.8 million net increase in other expense categories primarily driven by our expansion and business growth. The increases were partially offset by a $5.0 million decrease in legal costs due to the settlement of outstanding litigation and recoveries from a settlement with an insurance carrier.\nDepreciation and amortization expense. There were no significant changes in depreciation and amortization expenses in 2015 as compared to 2014.\nOther income, net\nOther income, net increased to $0.4 million in 2015 from $28,000 in 2014. The increase was primarily from interest income and realized gains on our investments in marketable securities, available-for-sale. The increase was partially offset by foreign currency losses related to our Canadian operations and a decrease in the value of our deferred compensation plan assets held in the rabbi trust.\nInterest expense\nThere were no significant changes in interest expenses in 2015 as compared to 2014.\nProvision for income taxes\nThe provision for income taxes was $47.0 million for 2015 as compared to $33.5 million in 2014, an increase of $13.6 million or 40.6%. The effective tax rate for 2015 was 41.5%, compared with 40.3% in 2014.\nThe increase in the effective tax rate was primarily due to the change in the Company's effective state tax rate on deferred taxes and the valuation allowance related to our Canadian net operating loss carryforwards.\nThe provisions for income taxes excluded the excess tax deduction associated with the settlement of shares under the Company's 2013 Plan, disqualifying dispositions of shares issued from our 2013 ESPP Plan and a tax deduction associated with IPO transaction costs because such tax benefits, which aggregated $6.2 million in 2015 and $5.2 million in 2014 were recorded as credits to additional paid-in capital.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measure\nIn this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we include a non-GAAP financial measure, adjusted earnings before interest income/expense, taxes, depreciation and amortization and stock-based compensation, or Adjusted EBITDA. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income before (i) interest income and other, including net realized (losses) gains on marketable securities, available-for-sale and cash and cash equivalents, (ii) interest expense, (iii) provision for income taxes, (iv) depreciation and amortization and (v) stock-based compensation expense. We use Adjusted EBITDA in our business operations to evaluate the performance of our business, develop budgets and measure our performance against those budgets, among other things. We also believe that analysts and investors use Adjusted EBITDA as a supplemental measure to evaluate our overall operating performance. However, Adjusted EBITDA has material limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation, or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\u201cU.S. GAAP\u201d). We find Adjusted EBITDA as a useful tool to assist in evaluating performance because Adjusted EBITDA eliminates items related to capital structure, taxes and non-cash stock-based compensation charges. In light of the foregoing limitations, we do not rely solely on Adjusted EBITDA as a performance measure and also consider our U.S. GAAP results. Adjusted EBITDA is not a measurement of our financial performance under U.S. GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to net income, operating income or any other measures calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Because Adjusted EBITDA is not calculated in the same manner by all companies, it may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures used by other companies.\nA reconciliation of the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure, net income, to Adjusted EBITDA is as follows (in thousands):\n\n (1) Other for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 consists of $(121) and $132 of net realized (losses) gains on marketable securities available-for-sale and cash and cash equivalents. The year ended December 31, 2013 includes employer taxes related to DSUs and restricted stock in connection with IPO. \n (2) The year ended December 31, 2013 includes non-cash stock-based compensation charges of $30.9 million in connection with the IPO. \n (3) The decrease in Adjusted EBITDA for 2016 compared to 2015 is primarily due to a higher proportion of operating expenses compared to revenues. \nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur primary sources of liquidity are cash and cash equivalents, cash flows from operations, marketable securities, available-for-sale and, if necessary borrowings under our credit agreement. In order to enhance yield to us, we have invested a portion of our cash in money market funds and in fixed and variable income debt securities, in accordance with our investment policy approved by the board of directors. Although we have historically funded our operations through operating cash flows, there can be no assurance that we can continue to meet our cash requirements entirely through our operations, cash and cash equivalents, proceeds from the sale of marketable securities, available-for-sale or availability under our credit agreement.\nCash held in our Canadian operations aggregated $404,000 and $763,000 at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nCash Flows\nOur total cash and cash equivalents balance increased by $91.2 million to $187.4 million at December 31, 2016, compared to $96.2 million at December 31, 2015. The following table sets forth our summary cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 (in thousands):\n Operating Activities\n2016 Compared to 2015. Cash flows provided by operating activities were $74.5 million in 2016 compared to $72.1 million in 2015. Net cash provided by operating activities is driven by our net income adjusted for non-cash items and changes in operating assets and liabilities. The $2.4 million increase in cash flows provided by operating activities in 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 was primarily due to the net effect of the growth of our business, differences in timing of payments and receipts, a reduction in the deferral of certain discretionary commissions, lower bonus accruals and a reduction of advances to the Company's investment sales and financing professionals.\n2015 Compared to 2014. Cash flows provided by operating activities were $72.1 million in 2015 compared to $71.4 million in 2014. Net cash provided by operating activities is driven by our net income adjusted for non-cash items and changes in operating assets and liabilities. The $0.7 million increase in cash flows provided by operating activities in 2015 compared to the same period in 2014 was primarily due to the growth in our business along with differences in timing of payments and receipts and bonus accruals related to our increased operating results.\nInvesting Activities\n2016 Compared to 2015. Cash flows provided by investing activities were $19.8 million in 2016 compared to cash flows used in investing activities of $126.9 million in 2015. The change in cash flows provided by investing activities in 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 was primarily due to $29.7 million in net proceeds from the sale of marketable securities, available-for-sale for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to $119.9 million in net purchases for the same period in 2015.\n2015 Compared to 2014. Cash flows used for investing activities were $126.9 million in 2015 compared to $17.2 million in 2014. The increase in cash flows used for investing activities in 2015 compared to the same period in 2014 was primarily due to $119.9 million in net purchases of marketable securities, available-for-sale for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $14.7 million for the same period in 2014.\nFinancing Activities\n2016 Compared to 2015. Cash flows used in financing activities were $3.1 million in 2016 compared to cash flows provided by financing activities of $1.8 million in 2015. The change in cash flows used in financing activities in 2016 compared to the same period in 2015, was primarily impacted by net changes in stock-based award activity, including excess tax benefit from stock-based award activity and taxes paid related to net share settlement of stock-based awards. See Note 10 - \u201cStock-Based Compensation Plans\u201d our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\n2015 Compared to 2014. Cash flows provided by financing activities were $1.8 million in 2015 compared to cash flows used in financing activities of $6.0 million in 2014. The change in cash flows provided by financing activities in 2015 compared to the same period in 2014, was primarily impacted by net changes in stock-based award activity, including excess tax benefit from stock-based award activity. See Note 10 - \u201cStock-Based Compensation Plans\u201d our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nLiquidity\nWe believe that our existing balances of cash and cash equivalents, cash flows expected to be generated from our operations, proceeds from the sale of marketable securities, available-for-sale and borrowings available under the Credit Agreement (defined below) will be sufficient to satisfy our operating requirements for at least the next twelve months. If we need to raise additional capital through public or private debt or equity financings, strategic relationships or other arrangements, this capital might not be available to us in a timely manner, on acceptable terms or at all. Our failure to raise sufficient capital, when needed, could prevent us from funding acquisitions or otherwise financing our growth or operations. In addition, our notes payable to former stockholders and SARs liability have provisions, which could accelerate repayment of outstanding principal and accrued interest and adversely impact our liquidity.\nCredit Agreement\nOn June 18, 2014, we entered into the Credit Agreement with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association (\u201cBank\u201d), dated as of June 1, 2014 (the \u201cCredit Agreement\u201d). The Credit Agreement is intended to provide for future liquidity needs, if needed. The Credit Agreement provides for a $60.0 million principal", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes thereto included elsewhere herein. The following discussion contains, in addition to historical information, forward-looking statements that include risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including those factors set forth under Item 1A - \u201cRisk Factors\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOverview\nOur Business\nWe are a leading national brokerage firm specializing in commercial real estate investment sales, financing, research and advisory services. We have been the top commercial real estate investment broker in the United States based on the number of investment transactions over the last 10 years. As of December 31, 2016, we had over 1,700 investment sales and financing professionals operating in 82 offices who provide real estate brokerage and financing services to sellers and buyers of commercial real estate. We also offer market research, consulting and advisory services to our clients. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we closed 8,995 sales, financing and other transactions with total volume of approximately $42.3 billion, an increase from 8,715 sales, financing and other transactions with total volume of approximately $37.8 billion in 2015.\nWe generate revenues by collecting real estate brokerage commissions upon the sale, and fees upon the financing of, commercial properties and by providing consulting and advisory services. Real estate brokerage commissions are typically based upon the value of the property, and financing fees are typically based upon the size of the loan. During the year ended December 31, 2016, approximately 92% of our revenues were generated from real estate brokerage commissions, 6% from financing fees and 2% from other revenues, including consulting and advisory services.\nFactors Affecting Our Business\nOur business and our operating results, financial condition and liquidity are significantly affected by the number and size of commercial real estate investment sales and financing transactions we close in any period. The number and size of these transactions are affected by both internal and external factors. Internally, we are affected by our ability to recruit and retain investment sales and financing professionals, identify and contract properties for sale and properties that need financing and refinancing. Externally we are affected by four main factors including the economy, commercial real estate supply and demand, capital markets and investment activity.\nThe Economy\nOur business is dependent on economic conditions within the markets in which we operate. Changes in the economy on a global, national, regional or local basis can have a positive or a negative impact on our business. Economic indicators and projections related to job growth, unemployment, interest rates, construction and vacancies can have a positive or a negative impact on our business. Overall market conditions can have an effect on investor sentiment and, ultimately, the demand for our services from investors in real estate. Our national footprint allows us to support our clients in balancing the opportunities and risks of changing regional economic conditions. We believe the U.S. economy is showing durability and growth. The U.S. saw continued moderate growth, favorable unemployment levels and strengthened wage growth during 2016. Sentiment about economic expansion in 2017 has recently become more favorable as seen in the recent rise in the stock market, U.S. Federal Reserve interest rate increases and the possible impact of policies of the Trump administration.\nCommercial Real Estate Supply and Demand\nOur business is dependent on the willingness of investors to invest in or sell commercial real estate, which is affected by factors beyond our control. These factors include the supply of commercial real estate coupled with user demand for these properties and the performance of real estate assets when compared with other investments alternatives, such as stocks and bonds. Despite the economic recovery over the past eight years, we believe an investment in real estate continues to be a compelling investment for investors as real estate fundamentals generally remain balanced. The moderate economic growth has generated demand and reasonable construction levels for most property types has been the basis of the longevity and durability of the current real estate cycle. We believe the maturing cycle, combined with the current uncertainty around forecasted growth, rising inflation, higher interest rate trends have required investors and lenders to recalibrate their underwriting assumptions in the short-term and have resulted in a slowdown in sales. Furthermore, many investors are delaying transactions in anticipation of more clarity regarding tax reform, regulatory easing and economic initiatives. We believe a positive boost to investor sentiment is possible with clarity on government policies and growth initiatives. We believe that these factors should continue to support long-term commercial real estate investor demand and, therefore, demand for our brokerage and financing services.\nCapital Markets\nCredit and liquidity issues in the financial markets have a direct impact on the flow of capital to the commercial real estate market. Real estate purchases are often financed with debt and, as a result, credit and liquidity impact transaction activity and prices. Changes in interest rates, as well as steady and protracted movements of interest rates in one direction, whether interest rates increase or decrease, could adversely or positively affect the operations and income potential of commercial real estate properties. These changes also influence the demand of investors for commercial real estate investments. We believe indications from the U.S. Federal Reserve of future rate increases, the uncertainty as to the impact of new fiscal policies and the recent sharp increase in longer term interest rates has created a short-term headwind for real estate transactions. We continue to see disciplined underwriting from lenders as well as ample liquidity in the market. However, we have seen transactions taking longer to close in late 2016 or transactions being delayed or renegotiated due to market conditions.\nInvestment Activity\nWe rely on investors to buy and sell properties in order generate commissions. Investors' desires to engage in real estate transactions are dependent on many factors that are beyond our control. The economy, supply and demand for properly positioned properties, available credit and market events impact investor sentiment and, therefore, transaction velocity. In addition, our private clients are often motivated to buy, sell and/or refinance properties due to personal circumstances such as death, divorce, partnership breakups and estate planning. We believe that we are in a maturing real estate cycle. In 2016, the sales transaction market declined after several years of robust recovery, which combined with rising interest rates is hampering sales activity. At the same time, many investors have signaled a wait-and-see attitude toward investment decisions in anticipation of the Trump administration's tax reform, regulatory easing and infrastructure initiatives as the timing and scope are unclear but once passed into law are likely to be supportive of economic expansion and real estate markets. We believe that the healthy property fundamentals and lack of over-leveraging during the past several years support an active, but more tempered, market environment.\nSeasonality\nOur real estate brokerage commissions and financing fees have tended to be seasonal and, combined with other factors, can affect an investor's ability to compare our financial condition and results of operations on a quarter-by-quarter basis. Historically, this seasonality has generally caused our revenue, operating income, net income and cash flows from operating activities to be lower in the first half of the year and higher in the second half of the year, particularly in the fourth quarter. The concentration of earnings and cash flows in the last six\nmonths of the year, particularly in the fourth quarter, is due to an industry-wide focus of clients to complete transactions towards the end of the calendar year. This historical trend can be disrupted both positively and negatively by major economic or political events impacting investor sentiment for a particular property type or location, volatility in financial markets, current and future projections of interest rates, attractiveness of other asset classes, market liquidity and the extent of limitations or availability of capital allocations for larger property buyers, among others. Private client investors may accelerate or delay transactions due to personal or business related reasons unrelated to economic events. In addition, our operating margins are typically lower during the second half of each year due to our commission structure for some of our senior investment sales and financing professionals. These senior investment sales and financing professionals are on a graduated commission schedule that resets annually in which higher commissions are paid for higher sales volumes. Our historical pattern of seasonality may or may not continue to the same degree experienced in prior years.\nOperating Segments\nWe follow the guidance for segment reporting, which requires reporting information on operating segments in interim and annual financial statements. An operating segment is defined as a component of an enterprise that engages in business activities from which it may earn revenues and incur expenses whose separate financial information is available and is evaluated regularly by the Chief Operating Decision Maker (\u201cCODM\u201d) or decision making group, to perform resource allocations and performance assessments. The CODMs are the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer. The CODMs review aggregated financial information presented on an office-by-office basis for purposes of making operating decisions, assessing financial performance and allocating resources. Based on the evaluation of our financial information, management believes that the Company's offices represent individual operating segments with similar economic characteristics that meet the criteria for aggregation into a single reportable segment for financial reporting purposes.\nKey Financial Measures and Indicators\nRevenues\nOur revenues are primarily generated from our real estate investment sales business. In addition to real estate brokerage commissions, we generate revenues from financing fees and from other revenues, which are primarily comprised of consulting and advisory fees.\nOur business is transaction oriented and, as such, we rely on investment sales and financing professionals to continually develop leads, identify properties to sell, market those properties and close sales in a timely manner to generate a consistent flow of revenue. While our sales volume is impacted by the seasonality factors discussed above, the timing of closings is also dependent on many market and personal factors unique to a particular client or transaction, particularly clients transacting in the $1-$10 million private client market segment. These factors can cause transactions to be accelerated or delayed beyond our control. Further, commission rates earned are generally inversely related to the value of the property sold. As a result of our expansion into the middle and larger transaction market segments, we have seen our overall commission rates fluctuate from period-to-period as a result of changes in the relative mix of the number and volume of transactions closed in the middle and larger transaction market segments as compared to the $1-$10 million private client market segment. These factors may result in period-to-period variations in our revenues different from historical patterns.\nA small percentage of our transactions include retainer fees and/or breakage fees. Retainer fees are credited against a success-based fee upon the closing of a transaction or a breakage fee. Transactions that are terminated before completion will sometimes generate breakage fees, which are usually calculated as a set amount or a percentage of the fee that we would have received had the transaction closed.\nReal estate brokerage commissions\nWe earn real estate brokerage commissions by acting as a broker for commercial real estate owners seeking to sell or investors seeking to buy properties. Revenues from real estate brokerage commissions are typically recognized at the close of escrow.\nFinancing fees\nWe earn financing fees by securing financing on purchase transactions or by securing refinancing of our clients' existing mortgage debt. We recognize financing fee revenues at the time the loan closes and we have no remaining significant obligations for performance in connection with the transaction. To a lesser extent, we also earn ancillary fees associated with financing activities.\nOther revenues\nOther revenues include fees generated from consulting and advisory services performed by our investment sales professionals, as well as referral fees from other real estate brokers. Revenues from these services are recognized as they are performed and completed.\nOperating Expenses\nOur operating expenses consist of cost of services, selling, general and administrative expenses and depreciation and amortization. The significant components of our expenses are further described below.\nCost of services\nThe majority of our cost of services expense is commission expense. Commission expenses are directly attributable to providing services to our clients for investment sales and financing services. Most of our investment sales and financing professionals are independent contractors and are paid commissions; however, there are some who are initially paid a salary and certain of our financing professionals are employees and, as such, costs of services also include employee-related compensation, employer taxes and benefits for those employees. The commission rates we pay to our investment sales and financing professionals vary based on individual contracts negotiated and are generally higher for the more experienced professionals. Some of our most senior investment sales and financing professionals also have the ability to earn additional commissions after meeting certain annual revenue thresholds. These additional commissions are recognized as cost of services in the period in which they are earned as they relate to specific transactions closed. Payment of a portion of these additional commissions are generally deferred for a period of three years, at the Company's election, and paid at the beginning of the fourth calendar year. Cost of services also includes referral fees paid to other real estate brokers where the Company is the principal service provider. Cost of services, therefore, can vary based on the commission structure of the independent contractors that closed transactions in any particular period.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses\nThe largest expense component within selling, general and administrative expenses is personnel expenses for our management team and sales and support staff. In addition, these costs include facilities costs (excluding depreciation and amortization), staff related expenses, sales, marketing, legal, telecommunication, network, data sources and other administrative expenses. Also included in selling, general and administrative are expenses for stock-based compensation to non-employee directors, employees and independent contractors (i.e. investment sales and financing professionals) under the 2013 Omnibus Equity Incentive Plan (\u201c2013 Plan\u201d) and the 2013 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (\u201c2013 ESPP Plan\u201d).\nDepreciation and amortization expense\nDepreciation and amortization expense consists of depreciation and amortization recorded on our computer software and hardware and furniture, fixture and equipment. Depreciation and amortization are provided over estimated useful lives ranging from three to seven years for owned assets or over the lesser of the asset estimated useful lives or the related lease term for leasehold improvements.\nOther Income (Expense), Net\nOther income (expense), net primarily consists of net gains or losses on our deferred compensation plan assets, interest income and realized gains and losses on our marketable securities, available-for-sale, foreign currency gains and losses and other non-operating gains and losses.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense primarily consists of interest expense associated with the SARs liability, notes payable to former stockholders and our credit agreement.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nWe are subject to U.S. and Canadian federal taxes and individual state and local taxes based on the income generated in the jurisdictions in which we operate. Our effective tax rate fluctuates as a result of the change in the mix of our activities in the jurisdictions in which we operate due to differing tax rates in those jurisdictions. Our provision for income taxes excludes the windfall benefits from shares issued in connection with our 2013 Plan and 2013 ESPP Plan.\nResults of Operations\nFollowing is a discussion of our results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014. The tables included in the period comparisons below provide summaries of our results of operations. The period-to-period comparisons of financial results are not necessarily indicative of future results.\nKey Operating Metrics\nWe regularly review a number of key metrics to evaluate our business, measure our performance, identify trends affecting our business, formulate financial projections and make strategic decisions. During the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, we closed more than 8,900, 8,700 and 7,600 sales, financing and other transactions with total volume of approximately $42.3 billion, $37.8 billion and $33.1 billion, respectively. Such key metrics for real estate brokerage and financing activities are as follows:\nTable 41: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

measurement of our financial performance under U.S. GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to net income, operating income or any other measures derived in accordance with U.S. GAAP. For a definition of Adjusted EBITDA and a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income, see \u201cNon-GAAP Financial Measure.\u201d \nRevenues\nOur total revenues were $717.5 million in 2016 compared to $689.1 million in 2015, an increase of $28.4 million or 4.1%. Total revenues increased primarily as a result of increases in real estate brokerage commissions, which contributed to substantially all of the total increase. A slight increase in financing fees, partially offset by a decrease in other revenues contributed the remaining change in total revenues.\nReal estate brokerage commissions. Revenues from real estate brokerage commissions increased to $662.2 million in 2016 from $632.6 million in 2015, an increase of $29.6 million or 4.7%. The increase was driven by a combination of the growth in the number of investment sales transactions (2.3%) and average transaction size (9.9%), partially offset by a decrease in average commission rates (15 basis points) due to a larger proportion of our transactions that closed in the >$20 million larger transaction market segment, which generate lower commission rates.\nFinancing fees. Revenues from financing fees increased to $43.4 million in 2016 from $42.6 million in 2015, an increase of $0.9 million or 2.1%. The increase was driven by an increase in the number of loan transactions (3.1%) due to an increase in the average number of financing professionals (15.3%), partially offset by a decrease in average fee rates (2 basis points) due in part to fees from certain larger loan transactions during 2016 as compared to 2015. Larger loan transactions generally earn a lower fee percentage.\nOther revenues. Other revenues decreased to $11.8 million in 2016 from $13.9 million in 2015, a decrease of $2.1 million or 15.3%. The decrease was primarily driven by a decrease in consulting and advisory services during 2016 as compared to 2015.\nOperating expenses\nOur total operating expenses were $610.9 million in 2016 compared to $574.4 million in 2015, an increase of $36.5 million, or 6.4%. Expenses increased primarily due to an increase in cost of services, which is predominantly variable commissions paid to our investment sales professionals and compensation-related costs related to our financing activities. Selling, general and administrative costs and to a lesser extent depreciation and amortization increased as well, as described below.\nCost of services. Cost of services in 2016 increased $21.4 million, or 5.0%, to $444.8 million from $423.4 million in 2015. The increase was primarily due to increased commission expenses driven by increased revenues. Cost of services as a percent of total revenues increased to 62.0% for 2016 compared to 61.4% in 2015 primarily due to an increase in proportion of transactions closed by our more senior investment sales professionals who are compensated generally at higher commission rates, partially offset by a reduction in referral fees.\nSelling, general and administrative expense. Selling, general and administrative expense in 2016 increased $14.1 million, or 9.5%, to $161.8 million from $147.7 million in 2015. Increases in our selling, general and administrative expense have been driven by our growth and investments in technology, sales and marketing tools and marketing and expansion of our services supporting our investment sales and financing professionals. These initiatives have primarily driven (i) a $6.7 million increase in sales and promotional marketing expenses to support increased sales activity and our annual sales recognition event; (ii) a $6.1 million increase in facilities expenses due to expansion of existing offices; (iii) a $5.7 million increase in salaries and related benefits as a result of increases in headcount in corporate and sales office support in connection with our growth and expansion of services supporting our investment sales and financing professionals; (iv) a $2.7 million increase in other expense categories, net, primarily driven by our expansion and growth. In addition, selling, general and administrative expense increased $2.5 million due to legal costs and accruals, partly driven by settlement of outstanding litigation and recoveries from a settlement with an insurance carrier during the twelve months ended December 31, 2015, which reduced legal costs in that period. These increases were offset by a $9.6 million decrease in management performance-related compensation driven by reduced bonus accruals due to management exceeding performance criteria during 2015.\nDepreciation and amortization expense. Depreciation and amortization expense increased to $4.4 million in 2016 from $3.3 million in 2015, an increase of $1.1 million, or 32.7%. The increase is primarily driven by our expansion and growth and investment in technology to redesign sales and marketing tools.\nOther income (expense), net\nOther income (expense), net increased to $2.1 million in 2016 from $0.4 million in 2015. The increase was primarily driven by an increase in the value of our foreign currency gains related to our Canadian operations, interest income on our investments in marketable securities, available-for-sale and deferred compensation plan assets held in the rabbi trust. The increase was partially offset by realized losses on our investments in marketable securities, available-for-sale, due to a security sold during 2016, which no longer met our investment policy criteria.\nInterest expense\nThere were no significant changes in interest expenses in 2016 as compared to 2015.\nProvision for income taxes\nThe provision for income taxes was $42.4 million for 2016 as compared to $47.0 million in 2015, a decrease of $4.6 million or 9.7%. The effective tax rate for 2016 was 39.6%, compared with 41.5% in 2015. The decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to the change in the Company's effective state tax rate on deferred taxes in 2015, which was minimal in 2016, lower net operating losses for our Canadian operations in 2016, which are subject to a full valuation allowance and other permanent items, primarily gains on company owned variable life insurance policies.\nThe provisions for income taxes excludes the difference in book and tax deductions associated with the settlement of shares under the Company's 2013 Plan and disqualifying dispositions of shares issued from our 2013 ESPP Plan. Such tax benefits, which aggregated $2.7 million in 2016 and $6.2 million in 2015, respectively, were recorded directly to additional paid-in capital.\nComparison of Year Ended December 31, 2015 and

is not a measurement of our financial performance under U.S. GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to net income, operating income or any other measures derived in accordance with U.S. GAAP. For a definition of Adjusted EBITDA and a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income, see \u201cNon-GAAP Financial Measure.\u201d \nRevenues\nOur total revenues were $689.1 million in 2015 compared to $572.2 million in 2014, an increase of $116.9 million, or 20.4%. Total revenues increased primarily as a result of increases in real estate brokerage commissions of $107.6 million, which contributed 92.1% of the total increase. An increase in financing fees of $8.7 million and to a lesser extent, an increase in other revenues of $0.6 million, contributed the remaining increase in total revenues.\nReal estate brokerage commissions. Revenues from real estate brokerage commissions increased to $632.6 million in 2015 from $525.0 million in 2014, an increase of $107.6 million or 20.5%. The increase was primarily driven by an increase in the number of investment sales transactions (13.3%) and an increase in average commission rates (7.4%). The rise in average commission rates is due to an increase in the proportion of our $1-$10 million private client market segment transactions as compared to larger transactions in the middle and larger transaction market segments. Transactions in the private client market segment generally earn higher commission rates than the middle and larger transaction market segments.\nFinancing fees. Revenues from financing fees increased to $42.6 million in 2015 from $33.9 million in 2014, an increase of $8.7 million or 25.6%. The increase was driven by an increase in the number of loan transactions (20.2%) due to an increase in the number of financing professionals combined with an increase in their productivity levels and an increase in average transaction size (7.6%). Average commission rates decreased slightly primarily due to the increase in the average transaction size.\nOther revenues. Other revenues increased to $13.9 million in 2015 from $13.4 million in 2014, an increase of $0.6 million or 4.2%.\nOperating expenses\nOur total operating expenses were $574.4 million in 2015 compared to $487.6 million in 2014, an increase of $86.8 million, or 17.8%. Expenses increased primarily due to an increase in cost of services, which is predominantly variable commissions paid to our investment sales and financing professionals and compensation-related costs related to our financing activities, but declined as a percentage of revenues. Selling, general and administrative costs increased as well, as described below.\nCost of services. Cost of services in 2015 increased $73.3 million, or 20.9% to $423.4 million from $350.1 million in 2014. The increase was primarily due to increased commission expenses driven by increased revenues. Cost of services as a percent of total revenues remained consistent at 61.4% in 2015 compared to 61.2% in 2014.\nSelling, general and administrative expense. Selling, general and administrative expense in 2015 increased $13.4 million, or 10.0%, to $147.7 million from $134.3 million in 2014. The increase was primarily due to (i) a $4.4 million increase in management performance-related compensation driven by our improved operating results; (ii) a $4.1 million increase in salaries and related benefits as a result of higher headcount in corporate and office support in connection with our growth; (iii) a $4.0 million increase in sales and promotional expenses driven by an increase in our annual sales recognition event and marketing expenses to support increased sales activity; (iv) a $2.1 million, net increase in stock-based compensation expense driven by increases resulting from incremental share-based awards granted since the fourth quarter of 2014 and immediate vesting of certain RSU awards under the provisions of the RSU agreement, partially offset by a decrease in the Company's stock price as RSU grants to the Company's independent contractors are required to be measured at fair value; (v) a $2.0 million increase in facilities expenses due to office expansion; and (vi) a $1.8 million net increase in other expense categories primarily driven by our expansion and business growth. The increases were partially offset by a $5.0 million decrease in legal costs due to the settlement of outstanding litigation and recoveries from a settlement with an insurance carrier.\nDepreciation and amortization expense. There were no significant changes in depreciation and amortization expenses in 2015 as compared to 2014.\nOther income, net\nOther income, net increased to $0.4 million in 2015 from $28,000 in 2014. The increase was primarily from interest income and realized gains on our investments in marketable securities, available-for-sale. The increase was partially offset by foreign currency losses related to our Canadian operations and a decrease in the value of our deferred compensation plan assets held in the rabbi trust.\nInterest expense\nThere were no significant changes in interest expenses in 2015 as compared to 2014.\nProvision for income taxes\nThe provision for income taxes was $47.0 million for 2015 as compared to $33.5 million in 2014, an increase of $13.6 million or 40.6%. The effective tax rate for 2015 was 41.5%, compared with 40.3% in 2014.\nThe increase in the effective tax rate was primarily due to the change in the Company's effective state tax rate on deferred taxes and the valuation allowance related to our Canadian net operating loss carryforwards.\nThe provisions for income taxes excluded the excess tax deduction associated with the settlement of shares under the Company's 2013 Plan, disqualifying dispositions of shares issued from our 2013 ESPP Plan and a tax deduction associated with IPO transaction costs because such tax benefits, which aggregated $6.2 million in 2015 and $5.2 million in 2014 were recorded as credits to additional paid-in capital.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measure\nIn this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we include a non-GAAP financial measure, adjusted earnings before interest income/expense, taxes, depreciation and amortization and stock-based compensation, or Adjusted EBITDA. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income before (i) interest income and other, including net realized (losses) gains on marketable securities, available-for-sale and cash and cash equivalents, (ii) interest expense, (iii) provision for income taxes, (iv) depreciation and amortization and (v) stock-based compensation expense. We use Adjusted EBITDA in our business operations to evaluate the performance of our business, develop budgets and measure our performance against those budgets, among other things. We also believe that analysts and investors use Adjusted EBITDA as a supplemental measure to evaluate our overall operating performance. However, Adjusted EBITDA has material limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation, or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\u201cU.S. GAAP\u201d). We find Adjusted EBITDA as a useful tool to assist in evaluating performance because Adjusted EBITDA eliminates items related to capital structure, taxes and non-cash stock-based compensation charges. In light of the foregoing limitations, we do not rely solely on Adjusted EBITDA as a performance measure and also consider our U.S. GAAP results. Adjusted EBITDA is not a measurement of our financial performance under U.S. GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to net income, operating income or any other measures calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Because Adjusted EBITDA is not calculated in the same manner by all companies, it may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures used by other companies.\nA reconciliation of the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure, net income, to Adjusted EBITDA is as follows (in thousands):\nTable 46: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2014 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2013 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2012 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net income\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>64,657 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>66,350 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>49,531 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>8,206 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>27,934 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Adjustments:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest income and other (1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,761 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,373 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(50 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>356 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(166 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest expense\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,533 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,726 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,651 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>105 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Provision for income taxes\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>42,445 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>47,018 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>33,452 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13,735 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>21,507 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,387 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,305 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,206 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,043 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,981 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Stock-based compensation (2)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,035 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,114 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,034 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>35,841 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,448 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Adjusted EBITDA (3)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>118,296 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>124,140 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>92,824 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>61,286 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>59,708 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n (1) Other for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 consists of $(121) and $132 of net realized (losses) gains on marketable securities available-for-sale and cash and cash equivalents. The year ended December 31, 2013 includes employer taxes related to DSUs and restricted stock in connection with IPO. \n (2) The year ended December 31, 2013 includes non-cash stock-based compensation charges of $30.9 million in connection with the IPO. \n (3) The decrease in Adjusted EBITDA for 2016 compared to 2015 is primarily due to a higher proportion of operating expenses compared to revenues. \nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur primary sources of liquidity are cash and cash equivalents, cash flows from operations, marketable securities, available-for-sale and, if necessary borrowings under our credit agreement. In order to enhance yield to us, we have invested a portion of our cash in money market funds and in fixed and variable income debt securities, in accordance with our investment policy approved by the board of directors. Although we have historically funded our operations through operating cash flows, there can be no assurance that we can continue to meet our cash requirements entirely through our operations, cash and cash equivalents, proceeds from the sale of marketable securities, available-for-sale or availability under our credit agreement.\nCash held in our Canadian operations aggregated $404,000 and $763,000 at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.\nCash Flows\nOur total cash and cash equivalents balance increased by $91.2 million to $187.4 million at December 31, 2016, compared to $96.2 million at December 31, 2015.

Cash flows provided by operating activities were $74.5 million in 2016 compared to $72.1 million in 2015. Net cash provided by operating activities is driven by our net income adjusted for non-cash items and changes in operating assets and liabilities. The $2.4 million increase in cash flows provided by operating activities in 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 was primarily due to the net effect of the growth of our business, differences in timing of payments and receipts, a reduction in the deferral of certain discretionary commissions, lower bonus accruals and a reduction of advances to the Company's investment sales and financing professionals.\n2015 Compared to 2014. Cash flows provided by operating activities were $72.1 million in 2015 compared to $71.4 million in 2014. Net cash provided by operating activities is driven by our net income adjusted for non-cash items and changes in operating assets and liabilities. The $0.7 million increase in cash flows provided by operating activities in 2015 compared to the same period in 2014 was primarily due to the growth in our business along with differences in timing of payments and receipts and bonus accruals related to our increased operating results.\nInvesting Activities\n2016 Compared to 2015. Cash flows provided by investing activities were $19.8 million in 2016 compared to cash flows used in investing activities of $126.9 million in 2015. The change in cash flows provided by investing activities in 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 was primarily due to $29.7 million in net proceeds from the sale of marketable securities, available-for-sale for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to $119.9 million in net purchases for the same period in 2015.\n2015 Compared to 2014. Cash flows used for investing activities were $126.9 million in 2015 compared to $17.2 million in 2014. The increase in cash flows used for investing activities in 2015 compared to the same period in 2014 was primarily due to $119.9 million in net purchases of marketable securities, available-for-sale for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $14.7 million for the same period in 2014.\nFinancing Activities\n2016 Compared to 2015. Cash flows used in financing activities were $3.1 million in 2016 compared to cash flows provided by financing activities of $1.8 million in 2015. The change in cash flows used in financing activities in 2016 compared to the same period in 2015, was primarily impacted by net changes in stock-based award activity, including excess tax benefit from stock-based award activity and taxes paid related to net share settlement of stock-based awards.
