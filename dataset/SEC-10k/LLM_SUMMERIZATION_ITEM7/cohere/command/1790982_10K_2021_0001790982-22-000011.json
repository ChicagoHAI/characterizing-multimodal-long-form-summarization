Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\n(dollars in millions, except per-share amounts and per-metric ton amounts; shipments in thousands of metric tons (kmt))\nReferences to (i) ParentCo\u201d refer to Arconic Inc., a Delaware corporation, and its consolidated subsidiaries (through March 31, 2020, at which time it was renamed Howmet Aerospace Inc.), and (ii) 2016 Separation Transaction\u201d refer to the November 1, 2016 separation of Alcoa Inc., a Pennsylvania corporation, into two standalone, publicly-traded companies, Arconic Inc. and Alcoa Corporation.\nOverview\nOur Business\nArconic Corporation ( Arconic\u201d or the Company\u201d) is a manufacturer of fabricated aluminum products, including sheet and plate, extrusions, and architectural products and systems, with a primary focus on the ground transportation, aerospace, building and construction, industrial products, and packaging end markets. The Company has 21 primary operating locations in 8 countries around the world, situated in the United States, Canada, China, France, Germany, Hungary, Russia, and the United Kingdom.\nThe Separation\nOn February 8, 2019, ParentCo announced that its Board of Directors approved a plan to separate into two standalone, publicly-traded companies (the Separation\u201d). The spin-off company, later named Arconic Corporation, was to include the rolled aluminum products, aluminum extrusions, and architectural products operations of ParentCo, as well as the Latin America extrusions operations sold in April 2018, (collectively, the Arconic Corporation Businesses\u201d). The existing publicly traded company, ParentCo, was to continue to own the engine products, engineered structures, fastening systems, and forged wheels operations (collectively, the Howmet Aerospace Businesses\u201d).\nThe Separation was subject to a number of conditions, including, but not limited to: final approval by ParentCo's Board of Directors (see below); receipt of an opinion of legal counsel (received on March 31, 2020) regarding the qualification of the\ndistribution, together with certain related transactions, as a reorganization\u201d within the meaning of Sections 335 and 368(a)(1)(D) of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code (i.e., a transaction that is generally tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes); and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC\u201d) declaring effective a Registration Statement on Form 10, as amended, filed with the SEC on February 13, 2020 (effectiveness was declared by the SEC on February 13, 2020).\nOn February 5, 2020, ParentCo's Board of Directors approved the completion of the Separation by means of a pro rata distribution by ParentCo of all of the outstanding shares of common stock of Arconic to ParentCo common stockholders of record as of the close of business on March 19, 2020 (the Record Date\u201d). At the time of the Separation, ParentCo common stockholders were to receive one share of Arconic common stock for every four shares of ParentCo common stock (the Separation Ratio\u201d) held as of the Record Date (ParentCo common stockholders were to receive cash in lieu of fractional shares).\nIn connection with the Separation, as of March 31, 2020, Arconic and Howmet Aerospace entered into several agreements to implement the legal and structural separation between the two companies; govern the relationship between Arconic and Howmet Aerospace after the completion of the Separation; and allocate between Arconic and Howmet Aerospace various assets, liabilities, and obligations, including, among other things, employee benefits, environmental liabilities, intellectual property, and tax-related assets and liabilities. These agreements included a Separation and Distribution Agreement, Tax Matters Agreement, Employee Matters Agreement, and certain Patent, Know-How, Trade Secret License and Trademark License Agreements. The Separation and Distribution Agreement identified the assets to be transferred, the liabilities to be assumed, and the contracts to be transferred to each of Arconic and Howmet Aerospace as part of the Separation, and provided for when and how these transfers and assumptions were to occur.\nOn April 1, 2020 (the Separation Date\u201d), the Separation was completed and became effective at 12:01 a.m. Eastern Daylight Time. To effect the Separation, ParentCo undertook a series of transactions to separate the net assets and certain legal entities of ParentCo, resulting in a cash payment of $728 to ParentCo by Arconic from a portion of the aggregate net proceeds of previously executed financing arrangements (see Financing Activities in Liquidity and Capital Resources below). In connection with the Separation, 109,021,376 shares of Arconic common stock were distributed to ParentCo stockholders. This was determined by applying the Separation Ratio to the 436,085,504 shares of ParentCo's outstanding common stock as of the Record Date. Regular-way\u201d trading of Arconic's common stock began with the opening of the New York Stock Exchange on April 1, 2020 under the ticker symbol ARNC.\u201d Arconic's common stock has a par value of $0.01 per share.\nParentCo incurred costs to evaluate, plan, and execute the Separation, and Arconic was allocated a pro rata portion of these costs based on segment revenue (see Cost Allocations below). ParentCo recognized $38 from January 2020 through March 2020 and $78 in 2019 for such costs, of which $18 and $40, respectively, was allocated to Arconic. The allocated amounts were included in Selling, general administrative, and other expenses on Arconic's Statement of Consolidated Operations.\nBasis of Presentation. The Consolidated Financial Statements of Arconic are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP). In accordance with GAAP, certain situations require management to make estimates based on judgments and assumptions, which may affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements. They also may affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates upon subsequent resolution of identified matters. These estimates are based on historical experience and, in some cases, assumptions based on current and future market experience, including considerations related to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. Management has made its best estimates using all relevant information available at the time, but it is possible that these estimates will differ from actual results and affect the Consolidated Financial Statements in future periods and potentially require adverse adjustments to the recoverability of goodwill and long-lived assets, the realizability of deferred tax assets and other judgments and estimations and assumptions that may be impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.\nPrior to the Separation Date, Arconic did not operate as a separate, standalone entity. Arconic's operations were included in ParentCo's financial results. Accordingly, for all periods prior to the Separation Date, the Consolidated Financial Statements of Arconic were prepared from ParentCo's historical accounting records and were presented on a standalone basis as if the Arconic Corporation Businesses had been conducted independently from ParentCo. Such Consolidated Financial Statements include the historical operations that were considered to comprise the Arconic Corporation Businesses, as well as certain assets and liabilities that were historically held at ParentCo's corporate level but were specifically identifiable or otherwise attributable to Arconic.\nCost Allocations. The description and information on cost allocations is applicable for all periods included in Arconic's Consolidated Financial Statements prior to the Separation Date.\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements of Arconic include general corporate expenses of ParentCo that were not historically charged to the Arconic Corporation Businesses for certain support functions that were provided on a centralized\nbasis, such as expenses related to finance, audit, legal, information technology, human resources, communications, compliance, facilities, employee benefits and compensation, and research and development activities. These general corporate expenses were included on Arconic's Statement of Consolidated Operations within Cost of goods sold, Selling, general administrative and other expenses, and Research and development expenses. These expenses were allocated to Arconic on the basis of direct usage when identifiable, with the remainder allocated based on the Arconic Corporation Businesses' segment revenue as a percentage of ParentCo's total segment revenue, as reported in the respective periods.\nAll external debt not directly attributable to Arconic was excluded from Arconic's Consolidated Balance Sheet. Financing costs related to these debt obligations were allocated to Arconic based on the ratio of capital invested by ParentCo in the Arconic Corporation Businesses to the total capital invested by ParentCo in both the Arconic Corporation Businesses and the Howmet Aerospace Businesses, and were included on Arconic's Statement of Consolidated Operations within Interest expense.\nThe following table reflects the allocations described above:\nTable 16: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of goods sold(1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>14 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling, general administrative, and other expenses(2)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>25 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>115 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Research and development expenses </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Provision for depreciation and amortization </td> <td> </td> <td>1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Restructuring and other charges\n</td> <td> </td> <td>2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense\n</td> <td> </td> <td>28 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>115 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other (income), net\n</td> <td> </td> <td>(5) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(6) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n__________________\n(1) For all periods presented, amount principally relates to an allocation of expenses for ParentCo's retained pension and other postretirement benefit obligations associated with closed and sold operations.\n(2) In 2020 (January through March) and 2019, amount includes an allocation of $18 and $40, respectively, for costs incurred by ParentCo associated with the Separation (see above).\nManagement believes the assumptions regarding the allocation of ParentCo's general corporate expenses and financing costs were reasonable.\nNevertheless, the Consolidated Financial Statements of Arconic may not include all of the actual expenses that would have been incurred and may not reflect Arconic's consolidated results of operations, financial position, and cash flows had it been a standalone company during the periods prior to the Separation Date. Actual costs that would have been incurred if Arconic had been a standalone company would depend on multiple factors, including organizational structure, capital structure, and strategic decisions made in various areas, including information technology and infrastructure. Transactions between Arconic and ParentCo, including sales to the Howmet Aerospace Businesses, were presented as related party transactions in Arconic's Consolidated Financial Statements and were considered to be effectively settled for cash at the time the transaction was recorded. The total net effect of the settlement of these transactions was reflected on Arconic's Statement of Consolidated Cash Flows as a financing activity and on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheet as Parent Company net investment.\nManagement Review of 2021 and Outlook for the Future\nArconic had a strong first full year of operations as a stand-alone company in 2021, despite the challenges of an array of headwinds. Segment adjusted EBITDA* grew 17% over 2021 driven by most of our end-markets showing double-digit revenue growth despite aerospace volumes being down. The Company was able to optimize its product mix to help compensate for changes in automotive demand related to semiconductor chip shortages and changes in staffing availability due to the pandemic. We implemented actions to offset inflation in alloying materials, energy prices and freight costs through increased pricing and productivity measures. In the Rolled Products segment, 2021 Segment Adjusted EBITDA exceeded 2019 levels (which were prior to pandemic impacts), despite the lower aerospace and automotive build rates. We secured long-term contracts for over $2,000 in aerospace sales, signed agreements for approximately $1,500 in North American packaging sales from 2022-2024, and captured content on 23 new automotive or light commercial vehicle platforms including a number of full-electric vehicles. We executed on a capital allocation strategy to reduce liabilities associated with pension and other postretirement benefits and effectively manage environmental obligations, positioning the Company for expected future growth in cash generation. We also repurchased $161 of shares of the Company's common stock and initiated two organic capital projects in the Rolled Products segment that are expected to drive future EBITDA growth starting in 2023.\nIn 2021, Sales of $7,504 rose 32% from 2020, reflecting higher aluminum prices and volume improvements in all our end markets except aerospace. The Company recorded a net loss of $397, or $3.65 per share, compared to a net loss of $109, or $1.00 per share, in 2020. The 2021 results included a pre-tax charge of $549 ($423 after-tax) for the settlement of certain employee retirement benefits related to the partial annuitization of U.S. pension plan obligations in April 2021, and a pre-tax charge of $65 ($65 after-tax) for the impairment of goodwill associated with the Extrusions reporting unit in the fourth quarter of 2021.\nWe ended the year with a cash balance of $335, and total liquidity of $1,125 (comprised of Cash and cash equivalents of $335 and undrawn availability of $790 under the Company's ABL Credit Agreement). We increased the aggregate principal amount of the Company's ABL Credit Agreement on February 16, 2022 from $800 to $1,200, reflecting the increase in collateral base due to volume growth and higher aluminum prices.\nAs we look forward to 2022 and beyond, we anticipate volumes will benefit from the ongoing ramp up of our Tennessee can sheet operations, improvement in the aerospace end-market, and growth in ground transportation as our automotive customers anticipate that semiconductor chip availability is expected to ease throughout the year. Based on current internal and external projections of build rates and leading indicators in the markets we serve, our expectations for sales by major end market, excluding the impact of changes in aluminum prices, in 2022 follow. For the ground transportation end market, we expect sales to increase by approximately 10% to 15% in 2022 compared with 2021, driven by our customers expecting improvements in semiconductor chip availability. Automotive sales are expected to increase from 2021 levels, while commercial transportation sales are expected to remain strong but are not expected to grow at the same pace as they did in 2021. For the industrial products end market, we anticipate sales to grow by approximately 5% to 10% in 2022 compared with 2021, driven by continued strong pricing and demand due to the impact of ongoing U.S. trade actions. Our volume growth may be constrained by the need to pivot capacity that served industrial products in 2021 back to ground transportation later in 2022. For the building and construction end market, we anticipate sales to increase by approximately 5% to 10% in 2022 compared with 2021, driven by increased non-residential construction activity, but expected to be challenged in the near term related to supply chain constraints, pricing, and labor issues creating uncertainty for our customers. For the packaging end market, we expect sales to increase by approximately 40% to 45% in 2022 compared with 2021, as North American can sheet ramps up to full capacity in the first half of 2022 and facilities in Russia and China continue to serve strong global markets. For the aerospace end market, we expect sales to grow by approximately 25% to 35% from 2021, as the supply chain is expected to be destocked in 2022 and aircraft build rates are expected to increase.\n* See Reconciliation of Total Segment Adjusted EBITDA to Consolidated Net (Loss) Income Attributable to Arconic Corporation within Segment Information under Results of Operations below.\nLegal Proceedings Involving our Samara Facility\nOur subsidiaries that own and operate our facility located in Samara, Russia are, and have been since the Separation, subject to proceedings initiated by Russian regulatory authorities as a result of alleged violations of Russian Federal Law No. 57-FZ. In connection with these proceedings, authorities have imposed injunctions prohibiting, among other actions, the payment of dividends, placement of bonds, amendments to organizational documents, and changes to the subsidiaries' chief executive officer and board of directors. See Note T to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d under the caption Contingencies and Commitments-Contingencies-Litigation-Federal Antimonopoly Service Of The Russian Federation Litigation\u201d for additional information regarding the proceedings. The proceedings and underlying claims may not be resolved favorably, are likely to continue to be delayed, may be resolved in a manner that results in permanent injunctions similar to or more restrictive than the current injunctions, and could result in a decision or a requirement to divest some or all of the assets located at the Samara facility.\nApproximately $79, or 24%, of Arconic's Cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2021 is currently held in Russia and is not available for dividends. Cash and cash equivalents held in Russia represented 7% of Arconic's total liquidity at December 31, 2021. In addition, approximately $968, or 16% of third-party sales (including packaging, industrial products, aerospace, and defense), and approximately $87, or 13% of Segment Adjusted EBITDA, for the Rolled Products segment for the year ended December 31, 2021 were generated by our Samara, Russia facility. We cannot at this time reasonably estimate the likelihood or timing of any resolution of the regulatory proceedings or underlying claims, whether such resolution would include the removal of the injunctions or the imposition of additional restrictions, or whether we would divest assets related to the Samara facility. The potential impacts of an unfavorable resolution of the proceedings and underlying claims include:\n\u2022continued unavailability of funds for the payment of dividends to Arconic Corporation;\n\u2022decreases in or loss of third-party sales and Segment Adjusted EBITDA generated by our Samara facility;\n\u2022restrictions on capital investments in the facility;\n\u2022losses on any potential divestiture;\n\u2022the inability of other Arconic facilities to assume capacity to offset decreases in sales or Segment Adjusted EBIDTA or to assume potential divested capacity; and\n\u2022increased expenses related to relocation of capacity to other facilities.\nAny of the foregoing could have a significant indirect impact on the performance of our other locations. In addition, any impact on our ability to fulfill delivery obligations could subject us to reputational harm and potential litigation involving customers and suppliers. Continued restrictions on our operation of the Samara facility would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nCOVID-19 Pandemic\nOur operations and financial results have been, and may continue to be, adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, several of our automotive and aerospace customers temporarily suspended operations at different points throughout 2020. While many of our customers have resumed operations as it relates to the COVID-19 pandemic, we are unable to estimate with certainty at this time the status, frequency, or duration of any potential reoccurrences of customer shutdowns, or the duration or extent of resumed operations. Due to the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on our customers, we are experiencing, and expect to continue experiencing, lower demand and volume for our products. These trends may lead to charges, impairments and other adverse financial impacts over time. The impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity, and/or cash flows will be magnified if the disruption from the COVID-19 pandemic continues for an extended period.\nWe believe that our diverse end markets and geographic composition mitigate a portion of the impact on the Company from any singular area of decline. Additionally, our operating footprint benefits from a highly variable cost structure and we are actively managing operations to effectively flex activity to respond to changing automotive and aerospace market conditions. However, the geographic locations in which our products are manufactured, distributed or sold are in varying stages of continued restrictions or lifting of restrictions, and the status of restrictions in certain areas may change on short notice. Because we rely on supply chain continuity, restrictions in one location may materially impact operations in multiple locations, and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in one location may have a disproportionate effect on our operations in the future.\nThe safety of our employees is our highest priority. We heightened measures at all of our locations to maintain strict hygiene, increase social distancing, and enable employees to work remotely where possible. In response to market conditions we implemented a series of proactive actions starting in April 2020 to mitigate the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company, including the following:\n\u2022deferred initiating a dividend on common stock;\n\u2022reduced the CEO's salary and the Board of Directors' cash compensation by 30%*;\n\u2022reduced salaries for senior-level management by 20% and for all other salaried employees by 10%*;\n\u2022restructuring of the salaried workforce, reduction of 10%;\n\u2022idling of various production facilities based on market conditions within the regions where the Company operates;\n\u2022decreasing production and operating with a reduced labor force through shortened work weeks, shift reductions, layoffs, and the elimination of temporary workers and contractors at U.S.-based rolling and extrusion facilities;\n\u2022implementing a combination of modified schedules, adjusted work hours, lower costs, and/or delayed raises at all rolling mill facilities in Europe, China and Russia;\n\u2022suspended the 401(k) match program for U.S. salaried employees*; and\n\u2022reducing capital expenditures by approximately $50, or approximately 30%.\n*Effective September 1, 2020, the Company restored both the salaries of all salaried employees and the 401(k) match of all salaried U.S. employees, including executive officers, to the levels in effect prior to the actions described above. Also effective September 1, 2020, the Company restored the annual cash retainers payable to the non-employee members of the Company's Board of Directors to the levels in effect prior to the previous reduction described above.\nThe foregoing measures from our cash conservation program resulted in actual cost savings of approximately $160, comprised of $100 in temporary savings (i.e., 2020 only) and $60 in permanent savings, as well as an additional $50 for capital expenditure reductions, from April 2020 through December 2020. In 2021, an additional $40 in permanent savings were realized under this program. While we anticipate incremental cost savings in future periods related to the measures that resulted in permanent cost savings during 2021 and 2020, we may not achieve such savings. In addition, we may determine that it is necessary to modify or rescind cost-saving actions, in which case certain of the realized permanent cost savings may not continue and/or any anticipated incremental cost savings would not be fully realized. Further disruptions and uncertainties related to the COVID-19 pandemic could require us to take additional cost-saving actions or to modify or rescind current cost-saving actions, make additional modifications to our strategic plans and/or incur additional expenses as part of our continued response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The cost-savings measures taken to date, and any cost-cutting measures we may need to\ntake in the future, could have a material and adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity, and/or cash flows.\nWhile we are continuing to evaluate the impact of this global event, our liquidity and financial position remains strong despite the COVID-19 pandemic's impact to our business. Our business is flexible and we have demonstrated a robust and agile cash management program, and together with potential future cash conservation actions, we believe we have adequate liquidity to operate the Company over the next twelve months.\nThe timing for the Company and/or our customers resuming operations and the levels of operations experienced before the COVID-19 pandemic depend on numerous factors beyond the Company's control, including, among other things: the revision of governmental quarantine, shelter in place or similar social distancing orders or guidelines; the occurrence and magnitude of future outbreaks; the availability of vaccines or other medical remedies and preventive measures; the location of facilities; and determinations regarding, among other things, health and safety, demand for specific products, and broader economic conditions. We are continuing to evaluate the impact this global event may have on the Company's future results of operations, financial condition, liquidity, and cash flows.\nSee Part I. Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d for additional information regarding the continuing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operations.\nResults of Operations\nThe discussion and analysis that follows includes a comparison of Arconic's results of operations between the 2021 and 2020 annual periods for both the total company and each reportable segment. Please refer to the Results of Operations section included in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Part II Item 7 of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020 (filed on February 23, 2021) for a discussion and analysis of Arconic's results of operations between the 2020 and 2019 annual periods for both the total company and each reportable segment.\nEarnings Summary\nSales. Sales were $7,504 in 2021 compared to $5,675 in 2020, an increase of $1,829, or 32%. The increase was principally due to higher aluminum prices driven by a rise in both the average LME price and regional premiums, improved volumes in all end markets except aerospace as recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic continues, and higher product pricing. These positive impacts were slightly offset by both lower volume and unfavorable product mix due to depressed sales to the aerospace end market, the negative impact of the semiconductor chip shortage affecting the automotive component of the ground transportation end market, and labor shortages at several North America operations due to COVID-19-related quarantines.\nIn March 2021, the Company entered into a settlement agreement with a customer related to the terms of an existing long-term contract. As a result, the customer agreed to pay Arconic $18, which will be recognized over the applicable three-year period. Accordingly, the Company's sales in 2021 included $12 associated with this settlement.\nCost of Goods Sold. COGS was $6,573 in 2021 compared to $4,862 in 2020, an increase of $1,711, or 35%. COGS as a percentage of Sales was 87.6% in 2021 compared to 85.7% in 2020. This percentage was negatively impacted by higher aluminum prices (underlying metal price is contractually passed-through to most customers at cost), unfavorable product mix driven by depressed sales to the aerospace end market, and the impact of the semiconductor chip shortage affecting the automotive component of the ground transportation market. These negative impacts were partially offset by higher product pricing. Net cost savings principally resulting from operational productivity and the absence of below normal absorption of fixed costs that occurred in 2020 driven by significantly lower production levels as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, were offset by higher costs for labor (see Labor costs below), energy, transportation, and alloying materials.\nSelling, General Administrative, and Other Expenses. SG&A expenses were $247, or 3.3% of Sales, in 2021 compared to $258, or 4.5% of Sales, in 2020. The decrease of $11, or 4%, was largely attributable to the absence of an allocation ($18) of costs incurred for the Separation (see Cost Allocations under The Separation above), somewhat offset by higher labor costs (see Labor costs below).\nResearch and Development Expenses. R&D expenses were $34 in 2021 compared to $36 in 2020. The decrease was primarily driven by cost reduction efforts initiated in 2020.\nLabor costs-The following description is applicable to COGS, SG&A, and R&D in the aggregate. Beginning in April 2020, management implemented a series of proactive actions to mitigate the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the\nCompany. Many of these actions impacted both business unit and corporate employees resulting in the Company experiencing lower labor costs in 2020. These actions included the following:\n\u2022idled various production facilities based on market conditions within the regions where the Company operates;\n\u2022decreased production and operating with a reduced labor force through shortened work weeks, shift reductions, layoffs, and the elimination of temporary workers and contractors at U.S.-based rolling and extrusion facilities;\n\u2022implemented a combination of modified schedules, adjusted work hours, lower costs, and/or delayed raises at all rolling mill facilities in Europe, China, and Russia;\n\u2022reduced the CEO's salary and the Board of Directors' cash compensation by 30%;\n\u2022reduced salaries for senior-level management by 20% and for all other salaried employees by 10%; and\n\u2022suspended the 401(k) match program for U.S. salaried employees.\nEffective September 1, 2020, the Company restored both the salaries of all salaried employees and the 401(k) match of all salaried U.S. employees, including executive officers, to the levels in effect prior to the actions described above. Also effective September 1, 2020, the Company restored the annual cash retainers payable to the non-employee members of the Company's Board of Directors to the levels in effect prior to the previous reduction described above. Additionally, by the end of 2020 and throughout 2021, the Company's production facilities were operating at significantly higher levels compared to earlier in 2020. As a result, the Company experienced higher labor costs in 2021 compared to 2020.\nProvision for Depreciation and Amortization. The provision for depreciation and amortization was $253 in 2021 compared to $251 in 2020. The increase of $2 was mainly caused by new depreciation for assets placed into service in the second half of 2020 related to an automotive and industrial product expansion at the Company's Tennessee rolling facility, somewhat offset by the absence of an impairment of abandoned projects and plant equipment ($6) and the absence of depreciation on assets that were impaired in prior periods, including certain assets at the Company's primary research and development facility.\nImpairment of Goodwill. In 2021, the Company recognized a charge of $65 in connection with its annual review of goodwill for impairment related to the Extrusions reporting unit. In accordance with Arconic's accounting policy, this review is performed in the fourth quarter each calendar year. Accordingly, this charge was recognized in the fourth quarter of 2021. See Goodwill in Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates below for additional information.\nRestructuring and Other Charges. In 2021 and 2020, Restructuring and other charges were comprised of a net charge of $624 and $188, respectively. See Note E to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information.\nInterest Expense. Interest expense was $100 in 2021 compared to $118 in 2020. The decrease of $18, or 15%, was primarily due to the absence of both a $28 allocation of ParentCo's financing costs in the period prior to Separation (see Cost Allocations under The Separation above) and $19 for the write-off and immediate expensing of debt issuance costs as a result of a debt refinancing in May 2020, partially offset by a higher amount of interest associated with both a $700 debt offering executed in May 2020 and a $600 debt offering completed in February 2020 and new interest related to a $300 debt offering executed in March 2021. See Financing Activities under Liquidity and Capital Resources below for additional information related to these financing transactions.\nOther Expenses, Net. Other expenses, net was $67 in 2021 compared to $70 in 2020. See Note G to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information.\n(Benefit) Provision for Income Taxes. The Company's effective tax rate, including discrete items, was 13.5% (benefit on a loss) in 2021 and 0.9% (provision on a loss) in 2020. See Note I to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II Item 8 of this Form 10-K for a reconciliation of the effective tax rate for each of these years to the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21%.\nSegment Information\nArconic's operations consist of three reportable segments: Rolled Products, Building and Construction Systems, and Extrusions. Segment performance under the Company's management reporting system is evaluated based on several factors; however, the primary measure of performance is Segment Adjusted EBITDA (Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization).\nThe Company calculates Segment Adjusted EBITDA as Total sales (third-party and intersegment) minus each of (i) Cost of goods sold, (ii) Selling, general administrative, and other expenses, and (iii) and Research and development expenses, plus Stock-based compensation expense and Metal price lag. Arconic's Segment Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies' reportable segments.\nSegment Adjusted EBITDA for all reportable segments totaled $757 in 2021, $648 in 2020, and $757 in 2019. The following information provides Sales and Segment Adjusted EBITDA for each reportable segment for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2021. See Note D to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information.\nRolled Products\nTable 17: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Third-party sales </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>6,187 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,335 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,609 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Intersegment sales </td> <td> </td> <td>33 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>19 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>25 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Total sales </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>6,220 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,354 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,634 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Segment Adjusted EBITDA </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>655 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>527 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>640 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Third-party aluminum shipments (kmt) </td> <td> </td> <td>1,404 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,179 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,390 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOverview. The Rolled Products segment produces aluminum sheet and plate for a variety of end markets. Sheet and plate are sold directly to customers and through distributors related to the aerospace, ground transportation, packaging, building and construction, and industrial products (mainly used in the production of machinery and equipment and consumer durables) end markets. While the customer base for flat-rolled products is large, a significant amount of sales of sheet and plate is to a relatively small number of customers. Prices for these products are generally based on the price of metal plus a premium for adding value to the aluminum to produce a semi-finished product, resulting in a business model in which the underlying price of metal is contractually passed-through to customers. Generally, the sales and costs and expenses of this segment are transacted in the local currency of the respective operations, which are the U.S. dollar and, to a lesser extent, each of the following: the Russian ruble, Chinese yuan, the euro, and the British pound.\nSales. Third-party sales for the Rolled Products segment increased $1,852, or 43%, in 2021 compared to 2020. The improvement was largely attributable to higher aluminum prices (see below), a net increase in volumes (see below), and favorable product pricing. These positive impacts were slightly offset by unfavorable product mix driven by depressed sales to the aerospace end market, which provides for the highest revenue per metric ton in this segment's commercial portfolio, and labor shortages at several North America operations due to COVID-19-related quarantines.\nThe higher aluminum prices were mostly driven by a 45% rise in the average LME aluminum price and sharp increases in regional premiums, including a 118% improvement in the average Midwest premium (United States).\nThe net increase in volumes was largely attributable to most end markets served by this segment, including ground transportation (improvement in the automotive component of this market was lessened by the global semiconductor chip shortage), industrial products, and packaging. Each of these end markets have experienced varying levels of recovery from the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, volume related to the industrial products end market was favorably impacted by a U.S. trade case, which reached a final determination in March 2021, that imposes significant duties on the import of common alloy aluminum sheet. These higher volumes were slightly offset by decreased volume in the aerospace end market due to the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Year over year, all of the negative volume impact related to the aerospace end market was experienced in the first half of 2021.\nIn March 2021, the Company entered into a settlement agreement with a customer related to the terms of an existing long-term contract. As a result, the customer agreed to pay Arconic $18, which will be recognized over the applicable three-year period. Accordingly, in 2021, Rolled Products' sales included $12 associated with this settlement.\nSegment Adjusted EBITDA. Segment Adjusted EBITDA for the Rolled Products segment increased $128, or 24%, in 2021 compared to 2020. The improvement was primarily due to a net increase in volumes, favorable product pricing, and net cost savings (see below). These positive impacts were somewhat offset by unfavorable product mix driven by depressed sales to the aerospace end market, which historically provided for the highest margin per metric ton in this segment's commercial portfolio. In the 2021 fourth quarter, this segment recorded a net adjustment of $10 (approximately $7 of which relates to prior quarters in 2021) related to write-downs of scrap inventory. The out-of-period amounts were not material to any interim or annual period.\nNet cost savings were principally the result of the absence of below normal absorption of fixed costs that occurred in 2020 due to significantly lower production levels as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as operational productivity. These positive impacts were partially offset by higher costs for labor (see Labor costs under Results of Operations above) and direct materials, including energy, transportation, and alloying materials.\nBuilding and Construction Systems\nTable 18: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Third-party sales </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,011 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>963 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,118 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Segment Adjusted EBITDA </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>130 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>137 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>126 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOverview. The Building and Construction Systems segment manufactures products that are used primarily in the non-residential building and construction end market. These products include integrated aluminum architectural systems and architectural extrusions, which are sold directly to customers and through distributors. A limited amount of this segment's product sales is directly impacted by metal pricing, which is a pass-through to the related customers. Generally, the sales and costs and expenses of this segment are transacted in the local currency of the respective operations, which are the U.S. dollar and, to a lesser extent, each of the following: the euro, the British pound, and Canadian dollar.\nSales. Third-party sales for the Building and Construction Systems segment increased $48, or 5%, in 2021 compared to 2020. The improvement was primarily due to higher product pricing across the entire portfolio, increased metal pass-through pricing due to significant increases in aluminum prices, and favorable foreign currency movements due to a stronger euro. These positive impacts were somewhat offset by lower volumes due to decreased demand in North America as a result of the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nSegment Adjusted EBITDA. Segment Adjusted EBITDA for the Building and Construction Systems segment decreased $7, or 5%, in 2021 compared to 2020. The decline was principally driven by higher costs for direct materials, including aluminum and labor (see Labor costs under Results of Operations above), and lower volumes, mostly offset by higher product pricing.\nExtrusions\nTable 19: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Third-party sales </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>306 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>381 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>550 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Segment Adjusted EBITDA </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(28) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(16) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(9) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Third-party aluminum shipments (kmt) </td> <td> </td> <td>35 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>40 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>60 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOverview. The Extrusions segment produces a range of extruded and machined parts for the aerospace, ground transportation, and industrial products end markets. These products are sold directly to customers and through distributors. Prices for these products are generally based on the price of metal plus a premium for adding value to the aluminum to produce a semi-finished product, resulting in a business model in which the underlying price of metal is contractually passed-through to customers. Generally, the sales and costs and expenses of this segment are transacted in the local currency of the respective operations, which are the U.S. dollar and, to a lesser extent, the euro.\nIn the 2021 first quarter, management approved the idling of the casthouse at the Lafayette (Indiana) plant. Additionally, in the 2021 second quarter, management approved the idling of the remaining operations (primarily small presses) at the Chandler (Arizona) plant. These actions were deemed necessary to address the ongoing depressed demand related to the aerospace end market and identified operational inefficiencies in the Extrusions portfolio. The Lafayette casthouse action will occur in multiple phases and is expected to be completed by mid-2022. Ultimately, the casthouse function will be outsourced to third-party vendors. The Chandler action was completed in the 2021 third quarter. The commercial operations related to Chandler have been integrated into Lafayette for the foreseeable future. In 2021, the Company incurred certain charges related to these decisions such as inventory write-downs, severance costs, and customer qualification costs. These items were not material, individually or in the aggregate, and were reported in Corporate (i.e., not included in Extrusion's Segment Adjusted EBITDA). The Company may temporarily restart one or more of the presses at Chandler over short periods of time to address customer demand requirements.\nSales. Third-party sales for the Extrusions segment decreased $75, or 20%, in 2021 compared to 2020. The decline was largely attributable to a net decrease in volumes, somewhat offset by higher aluminum prices. The net decrease in volumes was mainly caused by a drop in demand in the aerospace end market due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on air travel, partially offset by improved demand in the ground transportation and industrial products end markets. Most of the negative volume impact related to the aerospace end market was experienced in the first half of 2021.\nSegment Adjusted EBITDA. Segment Adjusted EBITDA for the Extrusions segment decreased $12 in 2021 compared to 2020. The decline was mostly related to a net decrease in volumes and higher costs for direct materials and labor (see Labor\ncosts under Results of Operations above), partially offset by the absence of costs ($12) related to both inventory write-downs and customer settlements.\nReconciliation of Total Segment Adjusted EBITDA to Consolidated Net (Loss) Income Attributable to Arconic Corporation\nTable 20: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>For the year ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Segment Adjusted EBITDA(1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>757 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>648 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>757 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unallocated amounts: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Corporate expenses(1),(2)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>(33) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(24) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(53) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Stock-based compensation expense </td> <td> </td> <td>(22) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(23) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(40) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Metal price lag(3)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>(16) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(27) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(39) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Provision for depreciation and amortization </td> <td> </td> <td>(253) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(251) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(252) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impairment of goodwill\n</td> <td> </td> <td>(65) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Restructuring and other charges(4)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>(624) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(188) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(87) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other(1),(5)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>(36) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(55) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(71) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating (loss) income\n</td> <td> </td> <td>(292) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>80 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>215 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense </td> <td> </td> <td>(100) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(118) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(115) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other (expenses) income, net(1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>(67) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(70) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Benefit (Provision) for income taxes\n</td> <td> </td> <td>62 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>62 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income attributable to noncontrolling interest </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consolidated net (loss) income attributable to Arconic(2)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(397) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(109) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>177 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n_________________\n(1)In preparation for the Separation, effective January 1, 2020, certain U.S. defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans previously sponsored by ParentCo were separated into standalone plans for both Arconic and Howmet Aerospace. Additionally, effective April 1, 2020, Arconic assumed a portion of the obligations associated with certain non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans that included participants related to both the Arconic Businesses and the Howmet Aerospace Businesses, as well as legacy defined benefit pension plans assigned to the Company as a result of the Separation. As a result, beginning in the first quarter of 2020 for these U.S. plans and in the second quarter of 2020 for these non-U.S. plans, Arconic applied defined benefit plan accounting resulting in benefit plan expense being recorded in operating income (service cost) and nonoperating income (nonservice cost). In all historical periods prior to these respective timeframes, Arconic was considered a participating employer in ParentCo's defined benefit plans and, therefore, applied multiemployer plan accounting resulting in the Company's share of benefit plan expense being recorded entirely in operating income. Also, Arconic is the plan sponsor of certain other non-U.S. defined benefit plans that contain participants related only to the Arconic Businesses and, therefore, the related benefit plan expense was recorded in accordance with defined benefit plan accounting in all periods presented. The following table presents the total benefit plan expense (excluding settlements and curtailments) recorded by Arconic based on the foregoing in each period presented:\nTable 21: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>For the year ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Segment Adjusted EBITDA: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Rolled Products </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(18) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(17) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(62) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Building and Construction Systems </td> <td> </td> <td>(2) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(5) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Extrusions </td> <td> </td> <td>(7) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(7) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(18) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Segment total </td> <td> </td> <td>(27) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(26) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(85) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unallocated amounts: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Corporate expenses </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(15) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(9) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Subtotal </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(24) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other expenses, net </td> <td> </td> <td>(60) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(78) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(87) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(103) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(111) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(2)Corporate expenses are composed of general administrative and other expenses of operating the corporate headquarters and other global administrative facilities. The amounts presented for all periods prior to second quarter 2020 include an\nallocation of ParentCo's corporate expenses, including research and development expenses, for the portion of the period prior to the Separation Date (see the Cost Allocations section of The Separation under Overview above).\n(3)Metal price lag represents the financial impact of the timing difference between when aluminum prices included in Sales are recognized and when aluminum purchase prices included in Cost of goods sold are realized. This adjustment aims to remove the effect of the volatility in metal prices and the calculation of this impact considers applicable metal hedging transactions.\n(4)In 2021 and 2020, Restructuring and other charges includes a $584 and $199, respectively, charge for the settlement of certain employee retirement benefits virtually all of which were within the United States and the United Kingdom. See Note H to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information.\n(5)Other includes certain items that impact Cost of goods sold and Selling, general administrative, and other expenses on the Company's Statement of Consolidated Operations that are not included in Segment Adjusted EBITDA.\nEnvironmental Matters\nSee the Environmental Matters section of Note T to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nArconic's primary future cash needs are centered on operating activities, including working capital, as well as recurring and strategic capital expenditures. The Company's ability to fund its cash needs depends on its ongoing ability to generate and raise cash in the future. Although management believes that Arconic's future cash from operations, together with the Company's access to capital markets, will provide adequate resources to fund Arconic's operating and investing needs, the Company's access to, and the availability of, financing on acceptable terms in the future will be affected by many factors, including: (i) Arconic's credit rating; (ii) the liquidity of the overall capital markets; and (iii) the current state of the economy. There can be no assurances that the Company will continue to have access to capital markets on terms acceptable to Arconic.\nFor all periods prior to the Separation Date, ParentCo provided capital, cash management, and other treasury services to the Company. Only cash amounts specifically attributable to Arconic were reflected in the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements. Transfers of cash, both to and from ParentCo's centralized cash management system, were reflected as a component of Parent Company net investment in Arconic's Consolidated Financial Statements.\nCash provided from operations and financing activities is expected to be adequate to cover the Company's operational and business needs over the next 12 months. For an analysis of long-term liquidity, see Contractual Obligations and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements below.\nAt December 31, 2021, the Company's Cash and cash equivalents were $335, of which $199 was held outside the United States. Of this, approximately $79, or 24%, of total cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2021 was held in Russia. Cash and cash equivalents held in Russia represented 7% of Arconic's total liquidity at December 31, 2021. Cash and cash equivalents held in Russia are currently subject to injunctions imposed by regulatory authorities that prohibit the distribution of dividends. We cannot at this time reasonably estimate the likelihood or timeline of a resolution involving the removal of these injunctions, and accordingly cannot reasonably estimate when, if at all, the funds will be available for the payment of dividends to Arconic Corporation. We maintain a renewable intercompany loan facility that could be utilized but we have as yet not utilized this facility. In addition, Arconic has a number of commitments and obligations related to the Company's operations in various foreign jurisdictions, resulting in the need for cash outside the United States. Management continuously evaluates the Company's local and global cash needs for future business operations, which may influence future repatriation decisions.\nThe discussion and analysis that follows includes a comparison of Arconic's cash flows between the 2021 and 2020 annual periods. Please refer to the Liquidity and Capital Resources section included in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Part II Item 7 of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020 (filed on February 23, 2021) for a discussion and analysis of Arconic's cash flows between the 2020 and 2019 annual periods.\nOperating Activities\nCash used for operations was $407 in 2021 compared with cash provided from operations of $6 in 2020.\nIn 2021, cash used for operations was comprised of an unfavorable change in working capital of $505, pension contributions of $458 (see below), and a net loss of $397, partially offset by a positive add-back for non-cash transactions in\nearnings of $953. The impact in working capital was largely driven by higher volumes and higher aluminum prices due to an increase in both the average LME price and regional premiums.\nIn January 2021, the Company contributed a total of $200 to its two funded U.S. defined benefit pension plans, comprised of the estimated minimum required funding for 2021 of $183 and an additional $17.\nIn April 2021, the Company contributed a total of $250 to its two funded U.S. defined benefit pension plans to maintain the funding level of the remaining plan obligations not transferred under a group annuity contract (see U.S. Pension Plan Annuitizations in Note H to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information). This contribution was funded with the net proceeds from a March 2021 debt offering (see 2021 Debt Activity in Financing Activities below).\nAlso in April 2021, the Company received $9 as one of two installments related to a settlement agreement reached with a customer in March 2021. See Sales under Results of Operations above for additional information.\nIn 2020, cash provided from operations was comprised primarily of a positive add-back for non-cash transactions in earnings of $552 and a favorable change in noncurrent assets and liabilities of $56, mostly offset by pension contributions of $271, an unfavorable change in working capital of $222 (see below), and a net loss of $109.\nCash provided from operations for 2020 includes an unfavorable adjustment of $235 related to the change in the Company's customer and other receivables balances as of December 31, 2020 ($759) and 2019 ($520). The unfavorable adjustment (i.e., increase in receivables) was derived by calculating the difference in the receivables balances as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 after excluding the effects of divestitures and foreign currency translation. The $235 was negatively impacted by the fact that customer receivables related to the Arconic Corporation Businesses were no longer included in ParentCo's accounts receivable securitization program effective January 2, 2020. In periods prior to 2020, certain identified customer receivables related to the Arconic Corporation Businesses were sold on a revolving basis to a ParentCo subsidiary under this program and were considered to be effectively and immediately settled for cash. As of December 31, 2019, the amount of Arconic's outstanding customer receivables sold to ParentCo's subsidiary was $281. As a result, the Company's customer receivables balance as of December 31, 2019 reflects the settlement of the $281 even though the third-party customers had not yet paid their obligations to ParentCo, as Arconic no longer had the right to collect and receive cash from the related customers. Had customer receivables related to the Arconic Corporation Businesses not been included in ParentCo's program in 2019, the Company's customer receivables balance as of December 31, 2019 would have been higher by $281. Further, these outstanding receivables would have been collected by the Arconic Corporation Businesses from the third-party customers in 2020. Accordingly, the previously mentioned unfavorable change in working capital of $222 would have been a favorable change in working capital of $59. See Cash Management in Note A to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nFinancing Activities\nCash provided from financing activities was $135 in 2021 compared with $744 in 2020. The source of cash in 2021 was mostly due to $314 in net proceeds from the issuance of new indebtedness (see 2021 Debt Activity below), somewhat offset by $161 for the repurchase of 4,912,505 shares of the Company's common stock (see Share Repurchase Program below). In 2020, the source of cash was due to $2,343 in net proceeds (reflects additional debt issuance costs paid from cash on hand) from the issuance of new indebtedness (see 2020 Debt Activity below) and $216 in net cash funding provided by ParentCo prior to the Separation Date, partially offset by $1,100 for the repayment of debt (see 2020 Debt Activity below) and a $728 payment to ParentCo in connection with the Separation (see The Separation above).\n2021 Debt Activity-On March 3, 2021, the Company completed a Rule 144A (U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as amended) debt offering for an additional $300 aggregate principal amount of 6.125% Senior Secured Second-Lien Notes due 2028 (the Additional 2028 Notes\u201d). The Additional 2028 Notes were issued under the indenture governing Arconic's existing 6.125% Senior Secured Second-Lien Notes due 2028 (see 2020 Debt Activity below). Other than with respect to the date of issuance and issue price, the Additional 2028 Notes are treated as a single series with and have the same terms as the referenced existing notes. The Additional 2028 Notes were sold at 106.25% of par (i.e., a premium) and, after reflecting a discount to the initial purchasers of the Additional 2028 Notes, the Company received $315 in net proceeds from the debt offering. Arconic used the net proceeds of this issuance to fund an annuitization of certain U.S. defined benefit pension plan obligations (see Note H to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information). The premium ($19) and costs to complete the financing ($5) were deferred and are being amortized to interest expense over the term of the Additional 2028 Notes. The amortization of the premium is reflected as a reduction to interest expense and the amortization of the costs to complete the financing is reflected as an addition to interest expense. Interest on the Additional 2028 Notes is paid semi-annually in February and August, and commenced August 15, 2021.\n2020 Debt Activity-In connection with the capital structure to be established at the time of the Separation, Arconic secured $1,200 in third-party indebtedness. On February 7, 2020, the Company completed a Rule 144A (U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as amended) debt offering for $600 aggregate principal amount of 6.125% Senior Secured Second-Lien Notes due 2028 (the 2028 Notes\u201d). Arconic received $593 in net proceeds from the debt offering reflecting a discount to the initial purchasers of the 2028 Notes. Also, on March 25, 2020, the Company entered into a credit agreement, which provided a $600 Senior Secured First-Lien Term Loan B Facility (variable rate and seven-year term) (the Term Loan\u201d) and a $1,000 Senior Secured First-Lien Revolving Credit Facility (variable rate and five-year term) (the Credit Facility\u201d), with a syndicate of lenders and issuers named therein (the Credit Agreement\u201d). Arconic received $575 in net proceeds from the Term Loan reflecting upfront fees and costs to enter into the financing arrangement.\nThe Company used a portion of the $1,168 in net proceeds from the aggregate indebtedness to make a $728 payment to ParentCo on April 1, 2020 to fund the transfer of certain net assets from ParentCo to Arconic in connection with the completion of the Separation (see The Separation above). The payment to ParentCo was calculated as the difference between (i) the $1,168 of net proceeds from the aggregate indebtedness and (ii) the difference between a beginning cash balance at the Separation Date of $500, as provided for in the Separation and Distribution Agreement, and the amount of cash held by Arconic Businesses at March 31, 2020 ($60 - the sum of this amount and the aggregate indebtedness in (i) equals the sum of Cash and cash equivalents and Restricted cash on the Company's Combined Balance Sheet as of March 31, 2020).\nOn April 2, 2020, Arconic borrowed $500, which was subject to an interest rate equal to the sum of the three-month LIBOR plus a 2.0% applicable margin, under the Credit Facility. This borrowing was a proactive measure taken by the Company to bolster its liquidity and preserve financial flexibility in light of uncertainties resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic.\nOn May 13, 2020, Arconic executed a refinancing of its existing Credit Agreement in order to provide improved financial flexibility. The Company completed a Rule 144A (U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as amended) debt offering for $700 aggregate principal amount of 6.0% Senior Secured First-Lien Notes due 2025 (the 2025 Notes\u201d). Arconic received $691 in net proceeds from the debt offering reflecting a discount to the initial purchasers of the 2025 Notes. Additionally, the Company entered into a five-year credit agreement with a syndicate of lenders named therein and Deutsche Bank AG New York Branch, as administrative agent (the ABL Credit Agreement\u201d). The ABL Credit Agreement provides for a senior secured asset-based revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of $800 (the available balance as of December 31, 2021 was $790 - see ABL Credit Agreement in Note Q to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information), including a letter of credit sub-facility and a swingline loan sub-facility (the ABL Credit Facility\u201d). In addition, the ABL Credit Facility includes an accordion feature allowing Arconic to request one or more increases to the revolving commitments in an aggregate principal amount up to $350. Also, see Note V to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information.\nThe Company used the net proceeds from the new indebtedness, together with cash on hand, to prepay in full the obligations outstanding under both the Term Loan ($600) and Credit Facility ($500) and to terminate in full the commitments under the Credit Agreement.\nDescriptions of the 2028 Notes, 2025 Notes, and ABL Credit Agreement are set forth in Note Q to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nIn connection with the issuance of the 2028 Notes and the execution of the Credit Agreement, the Company paid $42 in discounts to the initial purchasers and/or upfront fees and costs (the debt issuance costs\u201d), of which $30 was attributable to the Term Loan and the Credit Facility. The debt issuance costs were initially deferred and were being amortized to interest expense over the respective terms of the 2028 Notes, the Term Loan, and the Credit Facility. In connection with the issuance of the 2025 Notes and the execution of the ABL Credit Agreement, Arconic paid $15 in discounts to the initial purchasers and/or upfront fees and costs (the new debt issuance costs\u201d). As a result of applying both debt modification and debt extinguishment accounting, as appropriate based on the lender mix for each debt instrument, to the debt refinancing, the Company was required to write off $16 of the $30 in debt issuance costs and immediately expense $3 of the $15 in new debt issuance costs. This $19 was reported within the year-to-date Interest expense on Arconic's Statement of Consolidated Operations. The remaining $14 in debt issuance costs continued to be deferred and the remaining $12 in new debt issuance costs were deferred; both are being amortized to interest expense over the respective terms of the 2025 Notes and the ABL Credit Agreement.\nShare Repurchase Program-On May 4, 2021, Arconic announced that its Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program authorizing the Company to repurchase shares of its outstanding common stock up to an aggregate transactional value of $300 over a two-year period expiring April 28, 2023. In 2021, Arconic repurchased 4,912,505 shares of the Company's common stock for $161 under this program. See Note K to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information.\nRatings-Arconic's cost of borrowing and ability to access the capital markets are affected not only by market conditions but also by the ratings assigned to Arconic and its debt by the major credit rating agencies. As of December 31, 2021, the following are the most recent ratings for Arconic and its outstanding debt.\nMoody's Investor Service (Moody's) has assigned a Ba3 rating to both the Company and the 2028 Notes and a Ba1 rating to the 2025 Notes. Additionally, Moody's has given these ratings a stable outlook.\nStandard and Poor's Global Ratings (S&P) has assigned a BB rating to the Company, a B+ rating to the 2028 Notes, and a BB+ rating to the 2025 Notes. Additionally, S&P has given these ratings a stable outlook.\nFitch Ratings (Fitch) has assigned a BB+ rating to both the Company and the 2028 Notes and a BBB- rating to both the 2025 Notes and the ABL Credit Facility. On September 22, 2021, Fitch revised the rating outlook from negative to stable.\nInvesting Activities\nCash used for investing activities was $181 in 2021 compared with $38 in 2020.\nThe use of cash in 2021 reflects capital expenditures of $184, more than half of which was attributable to sustaining spend at the U.S. rolling mills.\nThe use of cash in 2020 reflects capital expenditures of $163, mostly offset by $98 in net proceeds received from the sales of an extrusions plant in South Korea and a rolling mill in Brazil and additional proceeds of $25 (contingent consideration) received from the 2018 sale of the Texarkana (Texas) rolling mill.\nContractual Obligations and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nContractual Obligations. Arconic is required to make future payments under various contracts, including long-term purchase obligations, lease agreements, and financing arrangements. The Company also has commitments to make contributions to its funded pension plans, provide payments for pension (unfunded) and other postretirement benefit plans, and fund capital projects. As of December 31, 2021, a summary of Arconic's outstanding contractual obligations is as follows (these contractual obligations are grouped in the same manner as they are classified in the Statement of Consolidated Cash Flows in order to provide a better understanding of the nature of the obligations and to provide a basis for comparison to historical information):\nTable 22: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>2022 </td> <td> </td> <td>2023-2024 </td> <td> </td> <td>2025-2026 </td> <td> </td> <td>Thereafter </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating activities: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Raw material purchase obligations </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,606 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,268 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>284 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>54 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Energy-related purchase obligations </td> <td>75 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>24 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>21 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other purchase obligations </td> <td>12 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating leases </td> <td>150 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>40 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>53 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>29 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>28 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest related to debt </td> <td>505 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>97 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>194 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>131 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>83 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Pension contributions - funded plans </td> <td>185 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>32 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>75 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>78 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Pension benefit payments - unfunded plans </td> <td>74 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>37 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other postretirement benefit payments </td> <td>266 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>29 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>55 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>54 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>128 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Layoff and other restructuring payments </td> <td>3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Uncertain tax positions </td> <td>22 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>22 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Financing activities: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Debt </td> <td>1,600 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>700 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>900 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Dividends to stockholders </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investing activities: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capital projects </td> <td>211 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>177 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>34 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Totals </td> <td>$ </td> <td>6,709 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,673 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>736 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,078 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,222 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nObligations for Operating Activities\nRaw material purchase obligations consist mostly of aluminum with expiration dates ranging from less than one year to two years. Energy-related purchase obligations consist primarily of electricity and natural gas contracts with expiration dates ranging from one year to ten years. Many of these purchase obligations contain variable pricing components, and, as a result, actual cash payments may differ from the estimates provided in the preceding table.\nOperating leases represent multi-year obligations for certain land and buildings, plant equipment, vehicles, and computer equipment.\nInterest related to debt is based on stated interest rates on debt with maturities that extend to 2028 (see the 2021 Debt Activity and 2020 Debt Activity sections of Financing Activities under Liquidity and Capital Resources above).\nPension contributions (funded plans) and pension (unfunded plans) and other postretirement benefit payments are based on actuarial estimates using current assumptions for, among others, discount rates, long-term rate of return on plan assets, rate of compensation increases, and/or health care cost trend rates. It is Arconic's policy to contribute amounts to funded pension plans sufficient to meet the minimum requirements set forth in applicable country employee benefit and tax regulations, including ERISA for U.S. plans. Management has determined that it is not practicable to present pension contributions (funded plans) and both pension (unfunded plans) and other postretirement benefit payments beyond 2026 and 2031, respectively.\nLayoff and other restructuring payments relate virtually all to severance costs.\nUncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken on an income tax return may result in additional payments to tax authorities. As of December 31, 2021, no interest and penalties were accrued related to such positions. The total amount of uncertain tax positions is included in the Thereafter\u201d column as Arconic is not able to reasonably estimate the timing of potential future payments. If a tax authority agrees with the tax position taken or expected to be taken or the applicable statute of limitations expires, then additional payments will not be necessary.\nObligations for Financing Activities\nThe debt amount in the preceding table represents the principal amounts of all outstanding long-term debt, which have maturities that extend to 2028 (see the 2021 Debt Activity and 2020 Debt Activity sections of Financing Activities under Liquidity and Capital Resources above).\nAs of December 31, 2021, Arconic had 105,326,885 outstanding shares of common stock. Dividends on common stock are subject to authorization by the Company's Board of Directors. Arconic did not declare or pay any dividends from April 1, 2020 through December 31, 2021.\nIn May 2021, Arconic's Board of Directors authorized a common stock repurchase program under which the Company may purchase shares of its outstanding common stock up to an aggregate transactional value of $300, depending on cash availability, market conditions, and other factors. This program has a predetermined expiration date of April 28, 2023; however, the Company is under no contractual obligation to make such repurchases. Accordingly, amounts have not been included in the preceding table. In 2021, the Company repurchased 4,912,505 shares of its common stock for $161. See the Common Stock section of Note K to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nObligations for Investing Activities\nCapital projects in the preceding table only include amounts approved by management as of December 31, 2021. Funding levels may vary in future years based on anticipated construction schedules of the projects. It is expected that significant expansion projects will be funded through various sources, including cash provided from operations. Total capital expenditures are anticipated to be approximately $280 in 2022.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements. Arconic Corporation has outstanding bank guarantees, letters of credit, and surety bonds related to outstanding responsibilities and obligations. See the Commitments section of Note T to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe preparation of Arconic's Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make certain estimates based on judgments and assumptions regarding uncertainties that may affect the amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements and disclosed in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Areas that require such estimates include the review of properties, plants, and\nequipment and goodwill for impairment, and accounting for each of the following: environmental and litigation matters; pension and other postretirement employee benefit obligations; stock-based compensation; and income taxes.\nManagement uses historical experience and all available information to make these estimates, and actual results may differ from those used to prepare Arconic's Consolidated Financial Statements at any given time. Despite these inherent limitations, management believes that Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and the Consolidated Financial Statements, including the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, provide a meaningful and fair perspective of the Company.\nA summary of Arconic's significant accounting policies is included in Note B to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Management believes that the application of these policies on a consistent basis enables Arconic to provide the users of the Consolidated Financial Statements with useful and reliable information about Arconic's operating results and financial condition.\nPrior to the Separation Date, Arconic did not operate as a separate, standalone entity. Arconic's operations were included in ParentCo's financial results. Accordingly, for all periods prior to the Separation Date, the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements were prepared from ParentCo's historical accounting records and were presented on a standalone basis as if the Arconic Corporation Businesses had been conducted independently from ParentCo. Such Consolidated Financial Statements include the historical operations that were considered to comprise the Arconic Corporation Businesses, as well as certain assets and liabilities that were historically held at ParentCo's corporate level but were specifically identifiable or otherwise attributable to Arconic. The Critical Accounting Policies described below reflect any incremental judgments and assumptions made by management in the preparation of the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements prior to the Separation Date (see The Separation in Overview above for additional information).\nProperties, Plants, and Equipment. Properties, plants, and equipment are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets is determined by comparing the estimated undiscounted net cash flows of the related operations (asset group) to the carrying value of the associated assets. An impairment loss would be recognized when the carrying value of the assets exceeds the estimated undiscounted net cash flows of the asset group. The amount of the impairment loss to be recorded is calculated as the excess of the carrying value of the assets over their fair value, with fair value determined using the best information available, which generally is a discounted cash flow (DCF) model. The determination of what constitutes an asset group, the associated estimated undiscounted net cash flows, and the estimated useful lives of the assets also require significant judgments.\nGoodwill. Goodwill is not amortized; it is reviewed for impairment annually (in the fourth quarter) or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist or if a decision is made to sell, exit, or realign a business. A significant amount of judgment is involved in determining if an indicator of impairment has occurred. Such indicators may include, among others, deterioration in general economic conditions, negative developments in equity and credit markets, adverse changes in the markets in which an entity operates, increases in input costs that have a negative effect on earnings and cash flows, or a trend of negative or declining cash flows over multiple periods. The fair value that could be realized in an actual transaction may differ from that used to evaluate goodwill for impairment.\nGoodwill is allocated among and evaluated for impairment at the reporting unit level, which is defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment. Arconic has three reporting units-the Rolled Products segment, the Building and Construction Systems segment, and the Extrusions segment-all of which contained goodwill at the time of the Company's annual 2021 review of goodwill for impairment. Immediately preceding this review, the carrying value of goodwill for Rolled Products, Building and Construction Systems, and Extrusions was $254, $70, and $65, respectively.\nIn reviewing goodwill for impairment, an entity has the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not (greater than 50%) that the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If an entity elects to perform a qualitative assessment and determines that an impairment is more likely than not, the entity is then required to perform a quantitative impairment test (described below), otherwise no further analysis is required. An entity also may elect not to perform the qualitative assessment and, instead, proceed directly to the quantitative impairment test. The ultimate outcome of the goodwill impairment review for a reporting unit should be the same whether an entity chooses to perform the qualitative assessment or proceeds directly to the quantitative impairment test.\nArconic determines annually, based on facts and circumstances, which of its reporting units will be subject to the qualitative assessment. For those reporting units where a qualitative assessment is either not performed or for which the conclusion is that an impairment is more likely than not, a quantitative impairment test will be performed. Arconic's policy is that a quantitative impairment test be performed for each reporting unit at least once during every three-year period.\nUnder the qualitative assessment, various events and circumstances (or factors) that would affect the estimated fair value of a reporting unit are identified (similar to impairment indicators above). These factors are then classified by the type of impact they would have on the estimated fair value using positive, neutral, and adverse categories based on current business conditions. Additionally, an assessment of the level of impact that a particular factor would have on the estimated fair value is determined using high, medium, and low weighting. Furthermore, management considers the results of the most recent quantitative impairment test completed for a reporting unit and compares the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) between the current and prior years for each reporting unit.\nUnder the quantitative impairment test, the evaluation of the recoverability of goodwill involves comparing the current fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value, including goodwill. Arconic uses a DCF model to estimate the current fair value of its reporting units when testing for impairment, as management believes forecasted cash flows are the best indicator of such fair value. Several significant assumptions and estimates are involved in the application of the DCF model to forecast operating cash flows, including sales growth (volumes and pricing), production costs, capital spending, working capital levels, and discount rate. Certain of these assumptions may vary significantly among the reporting units. Cash flow forecasts are generally based on approved business unit operating plans for the early years and historical relationships in later years. The WACC rate for the individual reporting units is estimated by management with the assistance of valuation experts. In the event the estimated fair value of a reporting unit per the DCF model is less than the carrying value, Arconic would recognize an impairment charge equal to the excess of the reporting unit's carrying value over its fair value without exceeding the total amount of goodwill applicable to that reporting unit.\nDuring the 2021 annual review of goodwill for impairment, management proceeded directly to the quantitative impairment test for all three of the Company's reporting units. The result of this review indicated the estimated fair value for both the Rolled Products and Building and Construction Systems reporting units was substantially in excess of the respective carrying value, resulting in no impairment. Conversely, the estimated fair value for the Extrusions reporting unit was lower than the associated carrying value by an amount greater than the carrying value of the Extrusions reporting unit's goodwill. Accordingly, Arconic recorded an impairment charge of $65 in the fourth quarter of 2021. As a result, the Extrusions reporting unit no longer contains any goodwill.\nThe impairment of the Extrusion reporting unit's goodwill resulted from a combination of market-based factors, including continued delays in aerospace market improvement, the expectation that significant cost inflation will extend beyond 2021 resulting in increasingly limited ability for management to drive margin expansion, and a longer than previously anticipated shift in product mix to lower margin industrial products to replace most of the lost aerospace volume. Further, current market factors also resulted in a 150-basis point increase in the WACC compared to the fourth quarter of 2020. Accordingly, given the factors noted above, the estimated fair value of the Extrusions reporting unit was less than the carrying value resulting in a full impairment of its goodwill.\nThe annual review in 2020 and 2019 indicated that goodwill was not impaired for any of Arconic's reporting units and there were no triggering events since that time that necessitated an interim quantitative impairment test for any of the Company's reporting units. That said, in light of the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic (i.e., stock market volatility, customer demand disruption, etc.), the Company did perform periodic qualitative assessments throughout 2020 in which management concluded that no impairment existed and, therefore, no further analysis was required.\nEnvironmental Matters. Expenditures for current operations are expensed or capitalized, as appropriate. Expenditures relating to existing conditions caused by past operations, which will not contribute to future revenues, are expensed. Liabilities are recorded when remediation costs are probable and can be reasonably estimated. The liability may include costs such as site investigations, consultant fees, feasibility studies, outside contractors, and monitoring expenses. Estimates are generally not discounted or reduced by potential claims for recovery, which are recognized when probable and as agreements are reached with third parties. The estimates may also include costs related to other potentially responsible parties to the extent that Arconic has reason to believe such parties will not fully pay their proportionate share. The liability is continuously reviewed and adjusted to reflect current remediation progress, prospective estimates of required activity, and other factors that may be relevant, including changes in technology or regulations.\nLitigation Matters. For asserted claims and assessments, liabilities are recorded when an unfavorable outcome of a matter is deemed to be probable and the loss is reasonably estimable. Management determines the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome based on many factors such as, among others, the nature of the matter, available defenses and case strategy, progress of the matter, views and opinions of legal counsel and other advisors, applicability and success of appeals processes, and the outcome of similar historical matters. Once an unfavorable outcome is deemed probable, management weighs the probability of estimated losses, and the most reasonable loss estimate is recorded. If an unfavorable outcome of a matter is deemed to be reasonably possible, the matter is disclosed and no liability is recorded. With respect to unasserted claims or assessments, management must first determine the probability an assertion will be made is likely; then a determination as to the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to reasonably estimate the potential loss is made. Legal matters are reviewed on a\ncontinuous basis to determine if there has been a change in management's judgment regarding the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome or the estimate of a potential loss.\nPension and Other Postretirement Benefits. For all periods prior to January 1, 2020 (see below), certain employees attributable to the Arconic Corporation Businesses participated in defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans sponsored by ParentCo (the Shared Plans\u201d), which also included participants attributable to non-Arconic Corporation Businesses. Arconic accounted for the portion of the Shared Plans related to its employees as multiemployer benefit plans. Accordingly, Arconic did not record an asset or liability to recognize any portion of the funded status of the Shared Plans. However, the related expense recorded by the Company was based primarily on pensionable compensation and estimated interest costs related to participants attributable to the Arconic Corporation Businesses.\nPrior to the Separation Date, certain other ParentCo plans that were entirely attributable to employees of the Arconic Corporation Businesses ( Direct Plans\u201d) were accounted for as defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans. Accordingly, the funded and unfunded position of each Direct Plan was recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Actuarial gains and losses that have not yet been recognized in earnings were recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income, net of taxes, until they were amortized as a component of net periodic benefit cost. The determination of benefit obligations and recognition of expenses related to the Direct Plans is dependent on various assumptions, including discount rates, long-term expected rates of return on plan assets, and future compensation increases. ParentCo's management developed each assumption using relevant company experience in conjunction with market-related data for each individual location in which such plans exist.\nIn preparation for the Separation, effective January 1, 2020, certain of the Shared Plans were separated into standalone plans for both Arconic ( New Direct Plans\u201d) and ParentCo (see Note H to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II Item 8 of this Form 10-K). Additionally, effective April 1, 2020, certain of the other remaining Shared Plans were assumed by Arconic ( Additional New Direct Plans\u201d) (see Note H to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II Item 8 of this Form 10-K). Accordingly, beginning on the respective effective dates, the New Direct Plans and the Additional New Direct Plans are accounted for as defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans. Additionally, the Direct Plans continue to be accounted for as defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans.\nThe following table summarizes the total expenses (excluding settlements and curtailments) recognized by Arconic related to the pension and other postretirement benefits described above:\nTable 23: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Pension benefits </td> <td> </td> <td>Other postretirement benefits </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Type of Plan </td> <td> </td> <td>Type of Expense </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cumulative Direct Plans </td> <td> </td> <td>Net periodic benefit cost* </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>68 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>82 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>19 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>22 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Shared Plans </td> <td> </td> <td>Multiemployer contribution expense </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>61 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>21 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Shared Plans </td> <td> </td> <td>Cost allocation </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>20 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>68 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>81 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>86 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>19 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>22 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>25 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n__________________\n* In 2021, 2020, and 2019, net periodic benefit cost for pension benefits was comprised of service cost of $21, $21, and $3, respectively, and non-service cost of $47, $61, and $2, respectively. In 2021 and 2020, net periodic benefit cost for other postretirement benefits was comprised of service cost of $6 and $5, respectively, and non-service cost of $13 and $17, respectively.\nLiabilities and expenses for pension and other postretirement benefits are determined using actuarial methodologies and incorporate significant assumptions, including the interest rate used to discount the future estimated liability, the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, and several assumptions relating to the employee workforce (compensation increases, health care cost trend rates, retirement age, and mortality).\nThe interest rate used to discount future estimated liabilities is determined using a Company-specific yield curve model (above-median) developed with the assistance of an external actuary. The cash flows of the projected benefit obligations are discounted using a single equivalent rate derived from yields on high quality corporate bonds, which represent a broad diversification of issuers in various sectors. The yield curve model parallels the projected plan cash flows, which have a weighted average duration of 13 years, and the underlying cash flows of the bonds included in the model exceed the cash flows needed to satisfy the plan obligations multiple times. If a deep market of high quality corporate bonds does not exist in a country, then the yield on government bonds is used. In 2021, the weighted average discount rate used to determine benefit\nobligations for pension plans was 2.76% and for other postretirement benefit plans was 2.90%. The impact on the combined pension and other postretirement benefit liabilities of a change in the weighted average discount rate of 1/4 of 1% would be approximately $100 and either a charge or credit of approximately $1 to pretax earnings in the following year.\nThe expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is generally applied to a five-year market-related value of plan assets (the fair value at the plan measurement date is used for certain non-U.S. plans). The process used by management to develop this assumption is one that relies on forward-looking investment returns by asset class. Management incorporates expected future investment returns on current and planned asset allocations using information from various external investment managers and consultants, as well as management's own judgment. For 2021, management used 4.91% as its weighted-average expected long-term rate of return, which was based on the prevailing and planned strategic asset allocations, as well as estimates of future returns by asset class. For 2022, management anticipates that the weighted-average expected long-term rate of return will be in the range of 5.00% to 6.00%. A change in the assumption for the weighted average expected long-term rate of return on plan assets of 1/4 of 1% would impact pretax earnings by approximately $5 for 2021.\nStock-Based Compensation. For all periods prior to the Separation Date, eligible employees attributable to the Arconic Corporation Businesses participated in ParentCo's stock-based compensation plan. The compensation expense recorded by Arconic included the expense associated with these employees, as well as the expense associated with an allocation of stock-based compensation expense for ParentCo's corporate employees (see Cost Allocations in The Separation under Overview above). From the Separation Date through December 31, 2020, Arconic recorded stock-based compensation expense for all of the Company's employees eligible to participate in Arconic's stock-based compensation plan. The following describes the manner in which stock-based compensation expense was initially determined for both Arconic and ParentCo.\nCompensation expense for employee equity grants is recognized using the non-substantive vesting period approach, in which the expense is recognized ratably over the requisite service period based on the grant date fair value. The fair value of stock options is estimated on the date of grant using a lattice-pricing model. The fair value of performance stock units containing a market condition is valued using a Monte Carlo valuation model. Determining the fair value at the grant date requires judgment, including estimates for the average risk-free interest rate, dividend yield, volatility, and exercise behavior. These assumptions may differ significantly between grant dates because of changes in the actual results of these inputs that occur over time.\nIn 2021, 2020, and 2019, Arconic recognized stock-based compensation expense of $22 ($17 after-tax), $23 ($18 after-tax), and $38 ($30 after-tax), respectively.\nIncome Taxes. The provision for income taxes is determined using the asset and liability approach of accounting for income taxes. Under this approach, the provision for income taxes represents income taxes paid or payable (or received or receivable) for the current year plus the change in deferred taxes during the year. Deferred taxes represent the future tax consequences expected to occur when the reported amounts of assets and liabilities are recovered or paid, and result from differences between the financial and tax bases of Arconic's assets and liabilities and are adjusted for changes in tax rates and tax laws when enacted.\nFor all periods prior to the Separation Date, the Arconic Corporation Businesses were included in the income tax filings of ParentCo. The provision for income taxes was determined in the same manner described above, but on a on a separate return methodology as if Arconic was a standalone taxpayer filing hypothetical income tax returns where applicable. Any additional accrued tax liability or refund arising as a result of this approach was assumed to be immediately settled with ParentCo as a component of Parent Company net investment. Deferred taxes were also determined in the same manner described above and were reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheet for net operating losses, credits or other attributes to the extent that such attributes were expected to transfer to Arconic upon the Separation. Any difference from attributes generated in a hypothetical return on a separate return basis was adjusted as a component of Parent Company net investment.\nValuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not (greater than 50%) that a tax benefit will not be realized. In evaluating the need for a valuation allowance, management considers all potential sources of taxable income, including income available in carryback periods, future reversals of taxable temporary differences, projections of taxable income, and income from tax planning strategies, as well as all available positive and negative evidence. Positive evidence includes factors such as a history of profitable operations, projections of future profitability within the carryforward period, including from tax planning strategies, and Arconic's experience with similar operations. Existing favorable contracts and the ability to sell products into established markets are additional positive evidence. Negative evidence includes items such as cumulative losses, projections of future losses, or carryforward periods that are not long enough to allow for the utilization of a deferred tax asset based on existing projections of income. Deferred tax assets for which no valuation allowance is recorded may not be realized upon changes in facts and circumstances, resulting in a future charge to establish a valuation allowance. Existing valuation allowances are re-examined under the same standards of positive and negative evidence. If it is determined\nthat it is more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will be realized, the appropriate amount of the valuation allowance, if any, is released. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are also re-measured to reflect changes in underlying tax rates due to law changes and the grant and lapse of tax holidays.\nArconic applies a tax law ordering approach when considering the need for a valuation allowance on net operating losses expected to offset Global Intangible Low Taxed Income (GILTI) income inclusions. Under this approach, reductions in cash tax savings are not considered as part of the valuation allowance assessment. Instead, future GILTI inclusions are considered a source of taxable income that support the realizability of deferred tax assets.\nTax benefits related to uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return are recorded when such benefits meet a more likely than not threshold. Otherwise, these tax benefits are recorded when a tax position has been effectively settled, which means that the statute of limitations has expired or the appropriate taxing authority has completed its examination even though the statute of limitations remains open. Interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions are recognized as part of the provision for income taxes and are accrued beginning in the period that such interest and penalties would be applicable under relevant tax law until such time that the related tax benefits are recognized.\nRecently Adopted Accounting Guidance\nSee the Recently Adopted Accounting Guidance section of Note B to

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\n(dollars in millions, except per-share amounts and per-metric ton amounts; shipments in thousands of metric tons (kmt))\nReferences to (i) ParentCo\u201d refer to Arconic Inc., a Delaware corporation, and its consolidated subsidiaries (through March 31, 2020, at which time it was renamed Howmet Aerospace Inc.), and (ii) 2016 Separation Transaction\u201d refer to the November 1, 2016 separation of Alcoa Inc., a Pennsylvania corporation, into two standalone, publicly-traded companies, Arconic Inc. and Alcoa Corporation.\nOverview\nOur Business\nArconic Corporation ( Arconic\u201d or the Company\u201d) is a manufacturer of fabricated aluminum products, including sheet and plate, extrusions, and architectural products and systems, with a primary focus on the ground transportation, aerospace, building and construction, industrial products, and packaging end markets. The Company has 21 primary operating locations in 8 countries around the world, situated in the United States, Canada, China, France, Germany, Hungary, Russia, and the United Kingdom.\nThe Separation\nOn February 8, 2019, ParentCo announced that its Board of Directors approved a plan to separate into two standalone, publicly-traded companies (the Separation\u201d). The spin-off company, later named Arconic Corporation, was to include the rolled aluminum products, aluminum extrusions, and architectural products operations of ParentCo, as well as the Latin America extrusions operations sold in April 2018, (collectively, the Arconic Corporation Businesses\u201d). The existing publicly traded company, ParentCo, was to continue to own the engine products, engineered structures, fastening systems, and forged wheels operations (collectively, the Howmet Aerospace Businesses\u201d).\nThe Separation was subject to a number of conditions, including, but not limited to: final approval by ParentCo's Board of Directors (see below); receipt of an opinion of legal counsel (received on March 31, 2020) regarding the qualification of the\ndistribution, together with certain related transactions, as a reorganization\u201d within the meaning of Sections 335 and 368(a)(1)(D) of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code (i.e., a transaction that is generally tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes); and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC\u201d) declaring effective a Registration Statement on Form 10, as amended, filed with the SEC on February 13, 2020 (effectiveness was declared by the SEC on February 13, 2020).\nOn February 5, 2020, ParentCo's Board of Directors approved the completion of the Separation by means of a pro rata distribution by ParentCo of all of the outstanding shares of common stock of Arconic to ParentCo common stockholders of record as of the close of business on March 19, 2020 (the Record Date\u201d). At the time of the Separation, ParentCo common stockholders were to receive one share of Arconic common stock for every four shares of ParentCo common stock (the Separation Ratio\u201d) held as of the Record Date (ParentCo common stockholders were to receive cash in lieu of fractional shares).\nIn connection with the Separation, as of March 31, 2020, Arconic and Howmet Aerospace entered into several agreements to implement the legal and structural separation between the two companies; govern the relationship between Arconic and Howmet Aerospace after the completion of the Separation; and allocate between Arconic and Howmet Aerospace various assets, liabilities, and obligations, including, among other things, employee benefits, environmental liabilities, intellectual property, and tax-related assets and liabilities. These agreements included a Separation and Distribution Agreement, Tax Matters Agreement, Employee Matters Agreement, and certain Patent, Know-How, Trade Secret License and Trademark License Agreements. The Separation and Distribution Agreement identified the assets to be transferred, the liabilities to be assumed, and the contracts to be transferred to each of Arconic and Howmet Aerospace as part of the Separation, and provided for when and how these transfers and assumptions were to occur.\nOn April 1, 2020 (the Separation Date\u201d), the Separation was completed and became effective at 12:01 a.m. Eastern Daylight Time. To effect the Separation, ParentCo undertook a series of transactions to separate the net assets and certain legal entities of ParentCo, resulting in a cash payment of $728 to ParentCo by Arconic from a portion of the aggregate net proceeds of previously executed financing arrangements (see Financing Activities in Liquidity and Capital Resources below). In connection with the Separation, 109,021,376 shares of Arconic common stock were distributed to ParentCo stockholders. This was determined by applying the Separation Ratio to the 436,085,504 shares of ParentCo's outstanding common stock as of the Record Date. Regular-way\u201d trading of Arconic's common stock began with the opening of the New York Stock Exchange on April 1, 2020 under the ticker symbol ARNC.\u201d Arconic's common stock has a par value of $0.01 per share.\nParentCo incurred costs to evaluate, plan, and execute the Separation, and Arconic was allocated a pro rata portion of these costs based on segment revenue (see Cost Allocations below). ParentCo recognized $38 from January 2020 through March 2020 and $78 in 2019 for such costs, of which $18 and $40, respectively, was allocated to Arconic. The allocated amounts were included in Selling, general administrative, and other expenses on Arconic's Statement of Consolidated Operations.\nBasis of Presentation. The Consolidated Financial Statements of Arconic are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP). In accordance with GAAP, certain situations require management to make estimates based on judgments and assumptions, which may affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements. They also may affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates upon subsequent resolution of identified matters. These estimates are based on historical experience and, in some cases, assumptions based on current and future market experience, including considerations related to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. Management has made its best estimates using all relevant information available at the time, but it is possible that these estimates will differ from actual results and affect the Consolidated Financial Statements in future periods and potentially require adverse adjustments to the recoverability of goodwill and long-lived assets, the realizability of deferred tax assets and other judgments and estimations and assumptions that may be impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.\nPrior to the Separation Date, Arconic did not operate as a separate, standalone entity. Arconic's operations were included in ParentCo's financial results. Accordingly, for all periods prior to the Separation Date, the Consolidated Financial Statements of Arconic were prepared from ParentCo's historical accounting records and were presented on a standalone basis as if the Arconic Corporation Businesses had been conducted independently from ParentCo. Such Consolidated Financial Statements include the historical operations that were considered to comprise the Arconic Corporation Businesses, as well as certain assets and liabilities that were historically held at ParentCo's corporate level but were specifically identifiable or otherwise attributable to Arconic.\nCost Allocations. The description and information on cost allocations is applicable for all periods included in Arconic's Consolidated Financial Statements prior to the Separation Date.\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements of Arconic include general corporate expenses of ParentCo that were not historically charged to the Arconic Corporation Businesses for certain support functions that were provided on a centralized\nbasis, such as expenses related to finance, audit, legal, information technology, human resources, communications, compliance, facilities, employee benefits and compensation, and research and development activities. These general corporate expenses were included on Arconic's Statement of Consolidated Operations within Cost of goods sold, Selling, general administrative and other expenses, and Research and development expenses. These expenses were allocated to Arconic on the basis of direct usage when identifiable, with the remainder allocated based on the Arconic Corporation Businesses' segment revenue as a percentage of ParentCo's total segment revenue, as reported in the respective periods.\nAll external debt not directly attributable to Arconic was excluded from Arconic's Consolidated Balance Sheet. Financing costs related to these debt obligations were allocated to Arconic based on the ratio of capital invested by ParentCo in the Arconic Corporation Businesses to the total capital invested by ParentCo in both the Arconic Corporation Businesses and the Howmet Aerospace Businesses, and were included on Arconic's Statement of Consolidated Operations within Interest expense.\nThe following table reflects the allocations described above:\n\n__________________\n(1) For all periods presented, amount principally relates to an allocation of expenses for ParentCo's retained pension and other postretirement benefit obligations associated with closed and sold operations.\n(2) In 2020 (January through March) and 2019, amount includes an allocation of $18 and $40, respectively, for costs incurred by ParentCo associated with the Separation (see above).\nManagement believes the assumptions regarding the allocation of ParentCo's general corporate expenses and financing costs were reasonable.\nNevertheless, the Consolidated Financial Statements of Arconic may not include all of the actual expenses that would have been incurred and may not reflect Arconic's consolidated results of operations, financial position, and cash flows had it been a standalone company during the periods prior to the Separation Date. Actual costs that would have been incurred if Arconic had been a standalone company would depend on multiple factors, including organizational structure, capital structure, and strategic decisions made in various areas, including information technology and infrastructure. Transactions between Arconic and ParentCo, including sales to the Howmet Aerospace Businesses, were presented as related party transactions in Arconic's Consolidated Financial Statements and were considered to be effectively settled for cash at the time the transaction was recorded. The total net effect of the settlement of these transactions was reflected on Arconic's Statement of Consolidated Cash Flows as a financing activity and on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheet as Parent Company net investment.\nManagement Review of 2021 and Outlook for the Future\nArconic had a strong first full year of operations as a stand-alone company in 2021, despite the challenges of an array of headwinds. Segment adjusted EBITDA* grew 17% over 2021 driven by most of our end-markets showing double-digit revenue growth despite aerospace volumes being down. The Company was able to optimize its product mix to help compensate for changes in automotive demand related to semiconductor chip shortages and changes in staffing availability due to the pandemic. We implemented actions to offset inflation in alloying materials, energy prices and freight costs through increased pricing and productivity measures. In the Rolled Products segment, 2021 Segment Adjusted EBITDA exceeded 2019 levels (which were prior to pandemic impacts), despite the lower aerospace and automotive build rates. We secured long-term contracts for over $2,000 in aerospace sales, signed agreements for approximately $1,500 in North American packaging sales from 2022-2024, and captured content on 23 new automotive or light commercial vehicle platforms including a number of full-electric vehicles. We executed on a capital allocation strategy to reduce liabilities associated with pension and other postretirement benefits and effectively manage environmental obligations, positioning the Company for expected future growth in cash generation. We also repurchased $161 of shares of the Company's common stock and initiated two organic capital projects in the Rolled Products segment that are expected to drive future EBITDA growth starting in 2023.\nIn 2021, Sales of $7,504 rose 32% from 2020, reflecting higher aluminum prices and volume improvements in all our end markets except aerospace. The Company recorded a net loss of $397, or $3.65 per share, compared to a net loss of $109, or $1.00 per share, in 2020. The 2021 results included a pre-tax charge of $549 ($423 after-tax) for the settlement of certain employee retirement benefits related to the partial annuitization of U.S. pension plan obligations in April 2021, and a pre-tax charge of $65 ($65 after-tax) for the impairment of goodwill associated with the Extrusions reporting unit in the fourth quarter of 2021.\nWe ended the year with a cash balance of $335, and total liquidity of $1,125 (comprised of Cash and cash equivalents of $335 and undrawn availability of $790 under the Company's ABL Credit Agreement). We increased the aggregate principal amount of the Company's ABL Credit Agreement on February 16, 2022 from $800 to $1,200, reflecting the increase in collateral base due to volume growth and higher aluminum prices.\nAs we look forward to 2022 and beyond, we anticipate volumes will benefit from the ongoing ramp up of our Tennessee can sheet operations, improvement in the aerospace end-market, and growth in ground transportation as our automotive customers anticipate that semiconductor chip availability is expected to ease throughout the year. Based on current internal and external projections of build rates and leading indicators in the markets we serve, our expectations for sales by major end market, excluding the impact of changes in aluminum prices, in 2022 follow. For the ground transportation end market, we expect sales to increase by approximately 10% to 15% in 2022 compared with 2021, driven by our customers expecting improvements in semiconductor chip availability. Automotive sales are expected to increase from 2021 levels, while commercial transportation sales are expected to remain strong but are not expected to grow at the same pace as they did in 2021. For the industrial products end market, we anticipate sales to grow by approximately 5% to 10% in 2022 compared with 2021, driven by continued strong pricing and demand due to the impact of ongoing U.S. trade actions. Our volume growth may be constrained by the need to pivot capacity that served industrial products in 2021 back to ground transportation later in 2022. For the building and construction end market, we anticipate sales to increase by approximately 5% to 10% in 2022 compared with 2021, driven by increased non-residential construction activity, but expected to be challenged in the near term related to supply chain constraints, pricing, and labor issues creating uncertainty for our customers. For the packaging end market, we expect sales to increase by approximately 40% to 45% in 2022 compared with 2021, as North American can sheet ramps up to full capacity in the first half of 2022 and facilities in Russia and China continue to serve strong global markets. For the aerospace end market, we expect sales to grow by approximately 25% to 35% from 2021, as the supply chain is expected to be destocked in 2022 and aircraft build rates are expected to increase.\n* See Reconciliation of Total Segment Adjusted EBITDA to Consolidated Net (Loss) Income Attributable to Arconic Corporation within Segment Information under Results of Operations below.\nLegal Proceedings Involving our Samara Facility\nOur subsidiaries that own and operate our facility located in Samara, Russia are, and have been since the Separation, subject to proceedings initiated by Russian regulatory authorities as a result of alleged violations of Russian Federal Law No. 57-FZ. In connection with these proceedings, authorities have imposed injunctions prohibiting, among other actions, the payment of dividends, placement of bonds, amendments to organizational documents, and changes to the subsidiaries' chief executive officer and board of directors. See Note T to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d under the caption Contingencies and Commitments-Contingencies-Litigation-Federal Antimonopoly Service Of The Russian Federation Litigation\u201d for additional information regarding the proceedings. The proceedings and underlying claims may not be resolved favorably, are likely to continue to be delayed, may be resolved in a manner that results in permanent injunctions similar to or more restrictive than the current injunctions, and could result in a decision or a requirement to divest some or all of the assets located at the Samara facility.\nApproximately $79, or 24%, of Arconic's Cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2021 is currently held in Russia and is not available for dividends. Cash and cash equivalents held in Russia represented 7% of Arconic's total liquidity at December 31, 2021. In addition, approximately $968, or 16% of third-party sales (including packaging, industrial products, aerospace, and defense), and approximately $87, or 13% of Segment Adjusted EBITDA, for the Rolled Products segment for the year ended December 31, 2021 were generated by our Samara, Russia facility. We cannot at this time reasonably estimate the likelihood or timing of any resolution of the regulatory proceedings or underlying claims, whether such resolution would include the removal of the injunctions or the imposition of additional restrictions, or whether we would divest assets related to the Samara facility. The potential impacts of an unfavorable resolution of the proceedings and underlying claims include:\n\u2022continued unavailability of funds for the payment of dividends to Arconic Corporation;\n\u2022decreases in or loss of third-party sales and Segment Adjusted EBITDA generated by our Samara facility;\n\u2022restrictions on capital investments in the facility;\n\u2022losses on any potential divestiture;\n\u2022the inability of other Arconic facilities to assume capacity to offset decreases in sales or Segment Adjusted EBIDTA or to assume potential divested capacity; and\n\u2022increased expenses related to relocation of capacity to other facilities.\nAny of the foregoing could have a significant indirect impact on the performance of our other locations. In addition, any impact on our ability to fulfill delivery obligations could subject us to reputational harm and potential litigation involving customers and suppliers. Continued restrictions on our operation of the Samara facility would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nCOVID-19 Pandemic\nOur operations and financial results have been, and may continue to be, adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, several of our automotive and aerospace customers temporarily suspended operations at different points throughout 2020. While many of our customers have resumed operations as it relates to the COVID-19 pandemic, we are unable to estimate with certainty at this time the status, frequency, or duration of any potential reoccurrences of customer shutdowns, or the duration or extent of resumed operations. Due to the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on our customers, we are experiencing, and expect to continue experiencing, lower demand and volume for our products. These trends may lead to charges, impairments and other adverse financial impacts over time. The impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity, and/or cash flows will be magnified if the disruption from the COVID-19 pandemic continues for an extended period.\nWe believe that our diverse end markets and geographic composition mitigate a portion of the impact on the Company from any singular area of decline. Additionally, our operating footprint benefits from a highly variable cost structure and we are actively managing operations to effectively flex activity to respond to changing automotive and aerospace market conditions. However, the geographic locations in which our products are manufactured, distributed or sold are in varying stages of continued restrictions or lifting of restrictions, and the status of restrictions in certain areas may change on short notice. Because we rely on supply chain continuity, restrictions in one location may materially impact operations in multiple locations, and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in one location may have a disproportionate effect on our operations in the future.\nThe safety of our employees is our highest priority. We heightened measures at all of our locations to maintain strict hygiene, increase social distancing, and enable employees to work remotely where possible. In response to market conditions we implemented a series of proactive actions starting in April 2020 to mitigate the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company, including the following:\n\u2022deferred initiating a dividend on common stock;\n\u2022reduced the CEO's salary and the Board of Directors' cash compensation by 30%*;\n\u2022reduced salaries for senior-level management by 20% and for all other salaried employees by 10%*;\n\u2022restructuring of the salaried workforce, reduction of 10%;\n\u2022idling of various production facilities based on market conditions within the regions where the Company operates;\n\u2022decreasing production and operating with a reduced labor force through shortened work weeks, shift reductions, layoffs, and the elimination of temporary workers and contractors at U.S.-based rolling and extrusion facilities;\n\u2022implementing a combination of modified schedules, adjusted work hours, lower costs, and/or delayed raises at all rolling mill facilities in Europe, China and Russia;\n\u2022suspended the 401(k) match program for U.S. salaried employees*; and\n\u2022reducing capital expenditures by approximately $50, or approximately 30%.\n*Effective September 1, 2020, the Company restored both the salaries of all salaried employees and the 401(k) match of all salaried U.S. employees, including executive officers, to the levels in effect prior to the actions described above. Also effective September 1, 2020, the Company restored the annual cash retainers payable to the non-employee members of the Company's Board of Directors to the levels in effect prior to the previous reduction described above.\nThe foregoing measures from our cash conservation program resulted in actual cost savings of approximately $160, comprised of $100 in temporary savings (i.e., 2020 only) and $60 in permanent savings, as well as an additional $50 for capital expenditure reductions, from April 2020 through December 2020. In 2021, an additional $40 in permanent savings were realized under this program. While we anticipate incremental cost savings in future periods related to the measures that resulted in permanent cost savings during 2021 and 2020, we may not achieve such savings. In addition, we may determine that it is necessary to modify or rescind cost-saving actions, in which case certain of the realized permanent cost savings may not continue and/or any anticipated incremental cost savings would not be fully realized. Further disruptions and uncertainties related to the COVID-19 pandemic could require us to take additional cost-saving actions or to modify or rescind current cost-saving actions, make additional modifications to our strategic plans and/or incur additional expenses as part of our continued response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The cost-savings measures taken to date, and any cost-cutting measures we may need to\ntake in the future, could have a material and adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity, and/or cash flows.\nWhile we are continuing to evaluate the impact of this global event, our liquidity and financial position remains strong despite the COVID-19 pandemic's impact to our business. Our business is flexible and we have demonstrated a robust and agile cash management program, and together with potential future cash conservation actions, we believe we have adequate liquidity to operate the Company over the next twelve months.\nThe timing for the Company and/or our customers resuming operations and the levels of operations experienced before the COVID-19 pandemic depend on numerous factors beyond the Company's control, including, among other things: the revision of governmental quarantine, shelter in place or similar social distancing orders or guidelines; the occurrence and magnitude of future outbreaks; the availability of vaccines or other medical remedies and preventive measures; the location of facilities; and determinations regarding, among other things, health and safety, demand for specific products, and broader economic conditions. We are continuing to evaluate the impact this global event may have on the Company's future results of operations, financial condition, liquidity, and cash flows.\nSee Part I. Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d for additional information regarding the continuing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operations.\nResults of Operations\nThe discussion and analysis that follows includes a comparison of Arconic's results of operations between the 2021 and 2020 annual periods for both the total company and each reportable segment. Please refer to the Results of Operations section included in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Part II Item 7 of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020 (filed on February 23, 2021) for a discussion and analysis of Arconic's results of operations between the 2020 and 2019 annual periods for both the total company and each reportable segment.\nEarnings Summary\nSales. Sales were $7,504 in 2021 compared to $5,675 in 2020, an increase of $1,829, or 32%. The increase was principally due to higher aluminum prices driven by a rise in both the average LME price and regional premiums, improved volumes in all end markets except aerospace as recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic continues, and higher product pricing. These positive impacts were slightly offset by both lower volume and unfavorable product mix due to depressed sales to the aerospace end market, the negative impact of the semiconductor chip shortage affecting the automotive component of the ground transportation end market, and labor shortages at several North America operations due to COVID-19-related quarantines.\nIn March 2021, the Company entered into a settlement agreement with a customer related to the terms of an existing long-term contract. As a result, the customer agreed to pay Arconic $18, which will be recognized over the applicable three-year period. Accordingly, the Company's sales in 2021 included $12 associated with this settlement.\nCost of Goods Sold. COGS was $6,573 in 2021 compared to $4,862 in 2020, an increase of $1,711, or 35%. COGS as a percentage of Sales was 87.6% in 2021 compared to 85.7% in 2020. This percentage was negatively impacted by higher aluminum prices (underlying metal price is contractually passed-through to most customers at cost), unfavorable product mix driven by depressed sales to the aerospace end market, and the impact of the semiconductor chip shortage affecting the automotive component of the ground transportation market. These negative impacts were partially offset by higher product pricing. Net cost savings principally resulting from operational productivity and the absence of below normal absorption of fixed costs that occurred in 2020 driven by significantly lower production levels as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, were offset by higher costs for labor (see Labor costs below), energy, transportation, and alloying materials.\nSelling, General Administrative, and Other Expenses. SG&A expenses were $247, or 3.3% of Sales, in 2021 compared to $258, or 4.5% of Sales, in 2020. The decrease of $11, or 4%, was largely attributable to the absence of an allocation ($18) of costs incurred for the Separation (see Cost Allocations under The Separation above), somewhat offset by higher labor costs (see Labor costs below).\nResearch and Development Expenses. R&D expenses were $34 in 2021 compared to $36 in 2020. The decrease was primarily driven by cost reduction efforts initiated in 2020.\nLabor costs-The following description is applicable to COGS, SG&A, and R&D in the aggregate. Beginning in April 2020, management implemented a series of proactive actions to mitigate the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the\nCompany. Many of these actions impacted both business unit and corporate employees resulting in the Company experiencing lower labor costs in 2020. These actions included the following:\n\u2022idled various production facilities based on market conditions within the regions where the Company operates;\n\u2022decreased production and operating with a reduced labor force through shortened work weeks, shift reductions, layoffs, and the elimination of temporary workers and contractors at U.S.-based rolling and extrusion facilities;\n\u2022implemented a combination of modified schedules, adjusted work hours, lower costs, and/or delayed raises at all rolling mill facilities in Europe, China, and Russia;\n\u2022reduced the CEO's salary and the Board of Directors' cash compensation by 30%;\n\u2022reduced salaries for senior-level management by 20% and for all other salaried employees by 10%; and\n\u2022suspended the 401(k) match program for U.S. salaried employees.\nEffective September 1, 2020, the Company restored both the salaries of all salaried employees and the 401(k) match of all salaried U.S. employees, including executive officers, to the levels in effect prior to the actions described above. Also effective September 1, 2020, the Company restored the annual cash retainers payable to the non-employee members of the Company's Board of Directors to the levels in effect prior to the previous reduction described above. Additionally, by the end of 2020 and throughout 2021, the Company's production facilities were operating at significantly higher levels compared to earlier in 2020. As a result, the Company experienced higher labor costs in 2021 compared to 2020.\nProvision for Depreciation and Amortization. The provision for depreciation and amortization was $253 in 2021 compared to $251 in 2020. The increase of $2 was mainly caused by new depreciation for assets placed into service in the second half of 2020 related to an automotive and industrial product expansion at the Company's Tennessee rolling facility, somewhat offset by the absence of an impairment of abandoned projects and plant equipment ($6) and the absence of depreciation on assets that were impaired in prior periods, including certain assets at the Company's primary research and development facility.\nImpairment of Goodwill. In 2021, the Company recognized a charge of $65 in connection with its annual review of goodwill for impairment related to the Extrusions reporting unit. In accordance with Arconic's accounting policy, this review is performed in the fourth quarter each calendar year. Accordingly, this charge was recognized in the fourth quarter of 2021. See Goodwill in Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates below for additional information.\nRestructuring and Other Charges. In 2021 and 2020, Restructuring and other charges were comprised of a net charge of $624 and $188, respectively. See Note E to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information.\nInterest Expense. Interest expense was $100 in 2021 compared to $118 in 2020. The decrease of $18, or 15%, was primarily due to the absence of both a $28 allocation of ParentCo's financing costs in the period prior to Separation (see Cost Allocations under The Separation above) and $19 for the write-off and immediate expensing of debt issuance costs as a result of a debt refinancing in May 2020, partially offset by a higher amount of interest associated with both a $700 debt offering executed in May 2020 and a $600 debt offering completed in February 2020 and new interest related to a $300 debt offering executed in March 2021. See Financing Activities under Liquidity and Capital Resources below for additional information related to these financing transactions.\nOther Expenses, Net. Other expenses, net was $67 in 2021 compared to $70 in 2020. See Note G to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information.\n(Benefit) Provision for Income Taxes. The Company's effective tax rate, including discrete items, was 13.5% (benefit on a loss) in 2021 and 0.9% (provision on a loss) in 2020. See Note I to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II Item 8 of this Form 10-K for a reconciliation of the effective tax rate for each of these years to the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21%.\nSegment Information\nArconic's operations consist of three reportable segments: Rolled Products, Building and Construction Systems, and Extrusions. Segment performance under the Company's management reporting system is evaluated based on several factors; however, the primary measure of performance is Segment Adjusted EBITDA (Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization).\nThe Company calculates Segment Adjusted EBITDA as Total sales (third-party and intersegment) minus each of (i) Cost of goods sold, (ii) Selling, general administrative, and other expenses, and (iii) and Research and development expenses, plus Stock-based compensation expense and Metal price lag. Arconic's Segment Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies' reportable segments.\nSegment Adjusted EBITDA for all reportable segments totaled $757 in 2021, $648 in 2020, and $757 in 2019. The following information provides Sales and Segment Adjusted EBITDA for each reportable segment for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2021. See Note D to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information.\nRolled Products\n\nOverview. The Rolled Products segment produces aluminum sheet and plate for a variety of end markets. Sheet and plate are sold directly to customers and through distributors related to the aerospace, ground transportation, packaging, building and construction, and industrial products (mainly used in the production of machinery and equipment and consumer durables) end markets. While the customer base for flat-rolled products is large, a significant amount of sales of sheet and plate is to a relatively small number of customers. Prices for these products are generally based on the price of metal plus a premium for adding value to the aluminum to produce a semi-finished product, resulting in a business model in which the underlying price of metal is contractually passed-through to customers. Generally, the sales and costs and expenses of this segment are transacted in the local currency of the respective operations, which are the U.S. dollar and, to a lesser extent, each of the following: the Russian ruble, Chinese yuan, the euro, and the British pound.\nSales. Third-party sales for the Rolled Products segment increased $1,852, or 43%, in 2021 compared to 2020. The improvement was largely attributable to higher aluminum prices (see below), a net increase in volumes (see below), and favorable product pricing. These positive impacts were slightly offset by unfavorable product mix driven by depressed sales to the aerospace end market, which provides for the highest revenue per metric ton in this segment's commercial portfolio, and labor shortages at several North America operations due to COVID-19-related quarantines.\nThe higher aluminum prices were mostly driven by a 45% rise in the average LME aluminum price and sharp increases in regional premiums, including a 118% improvement in the average Midwest premium (United States).\nThe net increase in volumes was largely attributable to most end markets served by this segment, including ground transportation (improvement in the automotive component of this market was lessened by the global semiconductor chip shortage), industrial products, and packaging. Each of these end markets have experienced varying levels of recovery from the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, volume related to the industrial products end market was favorably impacted by a U.S. trade case, which reached a final determination in March 2021, that imposes significant duties on the import of common alloy aluminum sheet. These higher volumes were slightly offset by decreased volume in the aerospace end market due to the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Year over year, all of the negative volume impact related to the aerospace end market was experienced in the first half of 2021.\nIn March 2021, the Company entered into a settlement agreement with a customer related to the terms of an existing long-term contract. As a result, the customer agreed to pay Arconic $18, which will be recognized over the applicable three-year period. Accordingly, in 2021, Rolled Products' sales included $12 associated with this settlement.\nSegment Adjusted EBITDA. Segment Adjusted EBITDA for the Rolled Products segment increased $128, or 24%, in 2021 compared to 2020. The improvement was primarily due to a net increase in volumes, favorable product pricing, and net cost savings (see below). These positive impacts were somewhat offset by unfavorable product mix driven by depressed sales to the aerospace end market, which historically provided for the highest margin per metric ton in this segment's commercial portfolio. In the 2021 fourth quarter, this segment recorded a net adjustment of $10 (approximately $7 of which relates to prior quarters in 2021) related to write-downs of scrap inventory. The out-of-period amounts were not material to any interim or annual period.\nNet cost savings were principally the result of the absence of below normal absorption of fixed costs that occurred in 2020 due to significantly lower production levels as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as operational productivity. These positive impacts were partially offset by higher costs for labor (see Labor costs under Results of Operations above) and direct materials, including energy, transportation, and alloying materials.\nBuilding and Construction Systems\n\nOverview. The Building and Construction Systems segment manufactures products that are used primarily in the non-residential building and construction end market. These products include integrated aluminum architectural systems and architectural extrusions, which are sold directly to customers and through distributors. A limited amount of this segment's product sales is directly impacted by metal pricing, which is a pass-through to the related customers. Generally, the sales and costs and expenses of this segment are transacted in the local currency of the respective operations, which are the U.S. dollar and, to a lesser extent, each of the following: the euro, the British pound, and Canadian dollar.\nSales. Third-party sales for the Building and Construction Systems segment increased $48, or 5%, in 2021 compared to 2020. The improvement was primarily due to higher product pricing across the entire portfolio, increased metal pass-through pricing due to significant increases in aluminum prices, and favorable foreign currency movements due to a stronger euro. These positive impacts were somewhat offset by lower volumes due to decreased demand in North America as a result of the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nSegment Adjusted EBITDA. Segment Adjusted EBITDA for the Building and Construction Systems segment decreased $7, or 5%, in 2021 compared to 2020. The decline was principally driven by higher costs for direct materials, including aluminum and labor (see Labor costs under Results of Operations above), and lower volumes, mostly offset by higher product pricing.\nExtrusions\n\nOverview. The Extrusions segment produces a range of extruded and machined parts for the aerospace, ground transportation, and industrial products end markets. These products are sold directly to customers and through distributors. Prices for these products are generally based on the price of metal plus a premium for adding value to the aluminum to produce a semi-finished product, resulting in a business model in which the underlying price of metal is contractually passed-through to customers. Generally, the sales and costs and expenses of this segment are transacted in the local currency of the respective operations, which are the U.S. dollar and, to a lesser extent, the euro.\nIn the 2021 first quarter, management approved the idling of the casthouse at the Lafayette (Indiana) plant. Additionally, in the 2021 second quarter, management approved the idling of the remaining operations (primarily small presses) at the Chandler (Arizona) plant. These actions were deemed necessary to address the ongoing depressed demand related to the aerospace end market and identified operational inefficiencies in the Extrusions portfolio. The Lafayette casthouse action will occur in multiple phases and is expected to be completed by mid-2022. Ultimately, the casthouse function will be outsourced to third-party vendors. The Chandler action was completed in the 2021 third quarter. The commercial operations related to Chandler have been integrated into Lafayette for the foreseeable future. In 2021, the Company incurred certain charges related to these decisions such as inventory write-downs, severance costs, and customer qualification costs. These items were not material, individually or in the aggregate, and were reported in Corporate (i.e., not included in Extrusion's Segment Adjusted EBITDA). The Company may temporarily restart one or more of the presses at Chandler over short periods of time to address customer demand requirements.\nSales. Third-party sales for the Extrusions segment decreased $75, or 20%, in 2021 compared to 2020. The decline was largely attributable to a net decrease in volumes, somewhat offset by higher aluminum prices. The net decrease in volumes was mainly caused by a drop in demand in the aerospace end market due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on air travel, partially offset by improved demand in the ground transportation and industrial products end markets. Most of the negative volume impact related to the aerospace end market was experienced in the first half of 2021.\nSegment Adjusted EBITDA. Segment Adjusted EBITDA for the Extrusions segment decreased $12 in 2021 compared to 2020. The decline was mostly related to a net decrease in volumes and higher costs for direct materials and labor (see Labor\ncosts under Results of Operations above), partially offset by the absence of costs ($12) related to both inventory write-downs and customer settlements.\nReconciliation of Total Segment Adjusted EBITDA to Consolidated Net (Loss) Income Attributable to Arconic Corporation\n\n_________________\n(1)In preparation for the Separation, effective January 1, 2020, certain U.S. defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans previously sponsored by ParentCo were separated into standalone plans for both Arconic and Howmet Aerospace. Additionally, effective April 1, 2020, Arconic assumed a portion of the obligations associated with certain non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans that included participants related to both the Arconic Businesses and the Howmet Aerospace Businesses, as well as legacy defined benefit pension plans assigned to the Company as a result of the Separation. As a result, beginning in the first quarter of 2020 for these U.S. plans and in the second quarter of 2020 for these non-U.S. plans, Arconic applied defined benefit plan accounting resulting in benefit plan expense being recorded in operating income (service cost) and nonoperating income (nonservice cost). In all historical periods prior to these respective timeframes, Arconic was considered a participating employer in ParentCo's defined benefit plans and, therefore, applied multiemployer plan accounting resulting in the Company's share of benefit plan expense being recorded entirely in operating income. Also, Arconic is the plan sponsor of certain other non-U.S. defined benefit plans that contain participants related only to the Arconic Businesses and, therefore, the related benefit plan expense was recorded in accordance with defined benefit plan accounting in all periods presented. The following table presents the total benefit plan expense (excluding settlements and curtailments) recorded by Arconic based on the foregoing in each period presented:\n\n(2)Corporate expenses are composed of general administrative and other expenses of operating the corporate headquarters and other global administrative facilities. The amounts presented for all periods prior to second quarter 2020 include an\nallocation of ParentCo's corporate expenses, including research and development expenses, for the portion of the period prior to the Separation Date (see the Cost Allocations section of The Separation under Overview above).\n(3)Metal price lag represents the financial impact of the timing difference between when aluminum prices included in Sales are recognized and when aluminum purchase prices included in Cost of goods sold are realized. This adjustment aims to remove the effect of the volatility in metal prices and the calculation of this impact considers applicable metal hedging transactions.\n(4)In 2021 and 2020, Restructuring and other charges includes a $584 and $199, respectively, charge for the settlement of certain employee retirement benefits virtually all of which were within the United States and the United Kingdom. See Note H to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information.\n(5)Other includes certain items that impact Cost of goods sold and Selling, general administrative, and other expenses on the Company's Statement of Consolidated Operations that are not included in Segment Adjusted EBITDA.\nEnvironmental Matters\nSee the Environmental Matters section of Note T to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nArconic's primary future cash needs are centered on operating activities, including working capital, as well as recurring and strategic capital expenditures. The Company's ability to fund its cash needs depends on its ongoing ability to generate and raise cash in the future. Although management believes that Arconic's future cash from operations, together with the Company's access to capital markets, will provide adequate resources to fund Arconic's operating and investing needs, the Company's access to, and the availability of, financing on acceptable terms in the future will be affected by many factors, including: (i) Arconic's credit rating; (ii) the liquidity of the overall capital markets; and (iii) the current state of the economy. There can be no assurances that the Company will continue to have access to capital markets on terms acceptable to Arconic.\nFor all periods prior to the Separation Date, ParentCo provided capital, cash management, and other treasury services to the Company. Only cash amounts specifically attributable to Arconic were reflected in the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements. Transfers of cash, both to and from ParentCo's centralized cash management system, were reflected as a component of Parent Company net investment in Arconic's Consolidated Financial Statements.\nCash provided from operations and financing activities is expected to be adequate to cover the Company's operational and business needs over the next 12 months. For an analysis of long-term liquidity, see Contractual Obligations and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements below.\nAt December 31, 2021, the Company's Cash and cash equivalents were $335, of which $199 was held outside the United States. Of this, approximately $79, or 24%, of total cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2021 was held in Russia. Cash and cash equivalents held in Russia represented 7% of Arconic's total liquidity at December 31, 2021. Cash and cash equivalents held in Russia are currently subject to injunctions imposed by regulatory authorities that prohibit the distribution of dividends. We cannot at this time reasonably estimate the likelihood or timeline of a resolution involving the removal of these injunctions, and accordingly cannot reasonably estimate when, if at all, the funds will be available for the payment of dividends to Arconic Corporation. We maintain a renewable intercompany loan facility that could be utilized but we have as yet not utilized this facility. In addition, Arconic has a number of commitments and obligations related to the Company's operations in various foreign jurisdictions, resulting in the need for cash outside the United States. Management continuously evaluates the Company's local and global cash needs for future business operations, which may influence future repatriation decisions.\nThe discussion and analysis that follows includes a comparison of Arconic's cash flows between the 2021 and 2020 annual periods. Please refer to the Liquidity and Capital Resources section included in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Part II Item 7 of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020 (filed on February 23, 2021) for a discussion and analysis of Arconic's cash flows between the 2020 and 2019 annual periods.\nOperating Activities\nCash used for operations was $407 in 2021 compared with cash provided from operations of $6 in 2020.\nIn 2021, cash used for operations was comprised of an unfavorable change in working capital of $505, pension contributions of $458 (see below), and a net loss of $397, partially offset by a positive add-back for non-cash transactions in\nearnings of $953. The impact in working capital was largely driven by higher volumes and higher aluminum prices due to an increase in both the average LME price and regional premiums.\nIn January 2021, the Company contributed a total of $200 to its two funded U.S. defined benefit pension plans, comprised of the estimated minimum required funding for 2021 of $183 and an additional $17.\nIn April 2021, the Company contributed a total of $250 to its two funded U.S. defined benefit pension plans to maintain the funding level of the remaining plan obligations not transferred under a group annuity contract (see U.S. Pension Plan Annuitizations in Note H to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information). This contribution was funded with the net proceeds from a March 2021 debt offering (see 2021 Debt Activity in Financing Activities below).\nAlso in April 2021, the Company received $9 as one of two installments related to a settlement agreement reached with a customer in March 2021. See Sales under Results of Operations above for additional information.\nIn 2020, cash provided from operations was comprised primarily of a positive add-back for non-cash transactions in earnings of $552 and a favorable change in noncurrent assets and liabilities of $56, mostly offset by pension contributions of $271, an unfavorable change in working capital of $222 (see below), and a net loss of $109.\nCash provided from operations for 2020 includes an unfavorable adjustment of $235 related to the change in the Company's customer and other receivables balances as of December 31, 2020 ($759) and 2019 ($520). The unfavorable adjustment (i.e., increase in receivables) was derived by calculating the difference in the receivables balances as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 after excluding the effects of divestitures and foreign currency translation. The $235 was negatively impacted by the fact that customer receivables related to the Arconic Corporation Businesses were no longer included in ParentCo's accounts receivable securitization program effective January 2, 2020. In periods prior to 2020, certain identified customer receivables related to the Arconic Corporation Businesses were sold on a revolving basis to a ParentCo subsidiary under this program and were considered to be effectively and immediately settled for cash. As of December 31, 2019, the amount of Arconic's outstanding customer receivables sold to ParentCo's subsidiary was $281. As a result, the Company's customer receivables balance as of December 31, 2019 reflects the settlement of the $281 even though the third-party customers had not yet paid their obligations to ParentCo, as Arconic no longer had the right to collect and receive cash from the related customers. Had customer receivables related to the Arconic Corporation Businesses not been included in ParentCo's program in 2019, the Company's customer receivables balance as of December 31, 2019 would have been higher by $281. Further, these outstanding receivables would have been collected by the Arconic Corporation Businesses from the third-party customers in 2020. Accordingly, the previously mentioned unfavorable change in working capital of $222 would have been a favorable change in working capital of $59. See Cash Management in Note A to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nFinancing Activities\nCash provided from financing activities was $135 in 2021 compared with $744 in 2020. The source of cash in 2021 was mostly due to $314 in net proceeds from the issuance of new indebtedness (see 2021 Debt Activity below), somewhat offset by $161 for the repurchase of 4,912,505 shares of the Company's common stock (see Share Repurchase Program below). In 2020, the source of cash was due to $2,343 in net proceeds (reflects additional debt issuance costs paid from cash on hand) from the issuance of new indebtedness (see 2020 Debt Activity below) and $216 in net cash funding provided by ParentCo prior to the Separation Date, partially offset by $1,100 for the repayment of debt (see 2020 Debt Activity below) and a $728 payment to ParentCo in connection with the Separation (see The Separation above).\n2021 Debt Activity-On March 3, 2021, the Company completed a Rule 144A (U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as amended) debt offering for an additional $300 aggregate principal amount of 6.125% Senior Secured Second-Lien Notes due 2028 (the Additional 2028 Notes\u201d). The Additional 2028 Notes were issued under the indenture governing Arconic's existing 6.125% Senior Secured Second-Lien Notes due 2028 (see 2020 Debt Activity below). Other than with respect to the date of issuance and issue price, the Additional 2028 Notes are treated as a single series with and have the same terms as the referenced existing notes. The Additional 2028 Notes were sold at 106.25% of par (i.e., a premium) and, after reflecting a discount to the initial purchasers of the Additional 2028 Notes, the Company received $315 in net proceeds from the debt offering. Arconic used the net proceeds of this issuance to fund an annuitization of certain U.S. defined benefit pension plan obligations (see Note H to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information). The premium ($19) and costs to complete the financing ($5) were deferred and are being amortized to interest expense over the term of the Additional 2028 Notes. The amortization of the premium is reflected as a reduction to interest expense and the amortization of the costs to complete the financing is reflected as an addition to interest expense. Interest on the Additional 2028 Notes is paid semi-annually in February and August, and commenced August 15, 2021.\n2020 Debt Activity-In connection with the capital structure to be established at the time of the Separation, Arconic secured $1,200 in third-party indebtedness. On February 7, 2020, the Company completed a Rule 144A (U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as amended) debt offering for $600 aggregate principal amount of 6.125% Senior Secured Second-Lien Notes due 2028 (the 2028 Notes\u201d). Arconic received $593 in net proceeds from the debt offering reflecting a discount to the initial purchasers of the 2028 Notes. Also, on March 25, 2020, the Company entered into a credit agreement, which provided a $600 Senior Secured First-Lien Term Loan B Facility (variable rate and seven-year term) (the Term Loan\u201d) and a $1,000 Senior Secured First-Lien Revolving Credit Facility (variable rate and five-year term) (the Credit Facility\u201d), with a syndicate of lenders and issuers named therein (the Credit Agreement\u201d). Arconic received $575 in net proceeds from the Term Loan reflecting upfront fees and costs to enter into the financing arrangement.\nThe Company used a portion of the $1,168 in net proceeds from the aggregate indebtedness to make a $728 payment to ParentCo on April 1, 2020 to fund the transfer of certain net assets from ParentCo to Arconic in connection with the completion of the Separation (see The Separation above). The payment to ParentCo was calculated as the difference between (i) the $1,168 of net proceeds from the aggregate indebtedness and (ii) the difference between a beginning cash balance at the Separation Date of $500, as provided for in the Separation and Distribution Agreement, and the amount of cash held by Arconic Businesses at March 31, 2020 ($60 - the sum of this amount and the aggregate indebtedness in (i) equals the sum of Cash and cash equivalents and Restricted cash on the Company's Combined Balance Sheet as of March 31, 2020).\nOn April 2, 2020, Arconic borrowed $500, which was subject to an interest rate equal to the sum of the three-month LIBOR plus a 2.0% applicable margin, under the Credit Facility. This", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\n(dollars in millions, except per-share amounts and per-metric ton amounts; shipments in thousands of metric tons (kmt))\nReferences to (i) ParentCo\u201d refer to Arconic Inc., a Delaware corporation, and its consolidated subsidiaries (through March 31, 2020, at which time it was renamed Howmet Aerospace Inc.), and (ii) 2016 Separation Transaction\u201d refer to the November 1, 2016 separation of Alcoa Inc., a Pennsylvania corporation, into two standalone, publicly-traded companies, Arconic Inc. and Alcoa Corporation.\nOverview\nOur Business\nArconic Corporation ( Arconic\u201d or the Company\u201d) is a manufacturer of fabricated aluminum products, including sheet and plate, extrusions, and architectural products and systems, with a primary focus on the ground transportation, aerospace, building and construction, industrial products, and packaging end markets. The Company has 21 primary operating locations in 8 countries around the world, situated in the United States, Canada, China, France, Germany, Hungary, Russia, and the United Kingdom.\nThe Separation\nOn February 8, 2019, ParentCo announced that its Board of Directors approved a plan to separate into two standalone, publicly-traded companies (the Separation\u201d). The spin-off company, later named Arconic Corporation, was to include the rolled aluminum products, aluminum extrusions, and architectural products operations of ParentCo, as well as the Latin America extrusions operations sold in April 2018, (collectively, the Arconic Corporation Businesses\u201d). The existing publicly traded company, ParentCo, was to continue to own the engine products, engineered structures, fastening systems, and forged wheels operations (collectively, the Howmet Aerospace Businesses\u201d).\nThe Separation was subject to a number of conditions, including, but not limited to: final approval by ParentCo's Board of Directors (see below); receipt of an opinion of legal counsel (received on March 31, 2020) regarding the qualification of the\ndistribution, together with certain related transactions, as a reorganization\u201d within the meaning of Sections 335 and 368(a)(1)(D) of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code (i.e., a transaction that is generally tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes); and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC\u201d) declaring effective a Registration Statement on Form 10, as amended, filed with the SEC on February 13, 2020 (effectiveness was declared by the SEC on February 13, 2020).\nOn February 5, 2020, ParentCo's Board of Directors approved the completion of the Separation by means of a pro rata distribution by ParentCo of all of the outstanding shares of common stock of Arconic to ParentCo common stockholders of record as of the close of business on March 19, 2020 (the Record Date\u201d). At the time of the Separation, ParentCo common stockholders were to receive one share of Arconic common stock for every four shares of ParentCo common stock (the Separation Ratio\u201d) held as of the Record Date (ParentCo common stockholders were to receive cash in lieu of fractional shares).\nIn connection with the Separation, as of March 31, 2020, Arconic and Howmet Aerospace entered into several agreements to implement the legal and structural separation between the two companies; govern the relationship between Arconic and Howmet Aerospace after the completion of the Separation; and allocate between Arconic and Howmet Aerospace various assets, liabilities, and obligations, including, among other things, employee benefits, environmental liabilities, intellectual property, and tax-related assets and liabilities. These agreements included a Separation and Distribution Agreement, Tax Matters Agreement, Employee Matters Agreement, and certain Patent, Know-How, Trade Secret License and Trademark License Agreements. The Separation and Distribution Agreement identified the assets to be transferred, the liabilities to be assumed, and the contracts to be transferred to each of Arconic and Howmet Aerospace as part of the Separation, and provided for when and how these transfers and assumptions were to occur.\nOn April 1, 2020 (the Separation Date\u201d), the Separation was completed and became effective at 12:01 a.m. Eastern Daylight Time. To effect the Separation, ParentCo undertook a series of transactions to separate the net assets and certain legal entities of ParentCo, resulting in a cash payment of $728 to ParentCo by Arconic from a portion of the aggregate net proceeds of previously executed financing arrangements (see Financing Activities in Liquidity and Capital Resources below). In connection with the Separation, 109,021,376 shares of Arconic common stock were distributed to ParentCo stockholders. This was determined by applying the Separation Ratio to the 436,085,504 shares of ParentCo's outstanding common stock as of the Record Date. Regular-way\u201d trading of Arconic's common stock began with the opening of the New York Stock Exchange on April 1, 2020 under the ticker symbol ARNC.\u201d Arconic's common stock has a par value of $0.01 per share.\nParentCo incurred costs to evaluate, plan, and execute the Separation, and Arconic was allocated a pro rata portion of these costs based on segment revenue (see Cost Allocations below). ParentCo recognized $38 from January 2020 through March 2020 and $78 in 2019 for such costs, of which $18 and $40, respectively, was allocated to Arconic. The allocated amounts were included in Selling, general administrative, and other expenses on Arconic's Statement of Consolidated Operations.\nBasis of Presentation. The Consolidated Financial Statements of Arconic are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP). In accordance with GAAP, certain situations require management to make estimates based on judgments and assumptions, which may affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements. They also may affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates upon subsequent resolution of identified matters. These estimates are based on historical experience and, in some cases, assumptions based on current and future market experience, including considerations related to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. Management has made its best estimates using all relevant information available at the time, but it is possible that these estimates will differ from actual results and affect the Consolidated Financial Statements in future periods and potentially require adverse adjustments to the recoverability of goodwill and long-lived assets, the realizability of deferred tax assets and other judgments and estimations and assumptions that may be impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.\nPrior to the Separation Date, Arconic did not operate as a separate, standalone entity. Arconic's operations were included in ParentCo's financial results. Accordingly, for all periods prior to the Separation Date, the Consolidated Financial Statements of Arconic were prepared from ParentCo's historical accounting records and were presented on a standalone basis as if the Arconic Corporation Businesses had been conducted independently from ParentCo. Such Consolidated Financial Statements include the historical operations that were considered to comprise the Arconic Corporation Businesses, as well as certain assets and liabilities that were historically held at ParentCo's corporate level but were specifically identifiable or otherwise attributable to Arconic.\nCost Allocations. The description and information on cost allocations is applicable for all periods included in Arconic's Consolidated Financial Statements prior to the Separation Date.\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements of Arconic include general corporate expenses of ParentCo that were not historically charged to the Arconic Corporation Businesses for certain support functions that were provided on a centralized\nbasis, such as expenses related to finance, audit, legal, information technology, human resources, communications, compliance, facilities, employee benefits and compensation, and research and development activities. These general corporate expenses were included on Arconic's Statement of Consolidated Operations within Cost of goods sold, Selling, general administrative and other expenses, and Research and development expenses. These expenses were allocated to Arconic on the basis of direct usage when identifiable, with the remainder allocated based on the Arconic Corporation Businesses' segment revenue as a percentage of ParentCo's total segment revenue, as reported in the respective periods.\nAll external debt not directly attributable to Arconic was excluded from Arconic's Consolidated Balance Sheet. Financing costs related to these debt obligations were allocated to Arconic based on the ratio of capital invested by ParentCo in the Arconic Corporation Businesses to the total capital invested by ParentCo in both the Arconic Corporation Businesses and the Howmet Aerospace Businesses, and were included on Arconic's Statement of Consolidated Operations within Interest expense.\nThe following table reflects the allocations described above:\nTable 16: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of goods sold(1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>14 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling, general administrative, and other expenses(2)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>25 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>115 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Research and development expenses </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Provision for depreciation and amortization </td> <td> </td> <td>1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Restructuring and other charges\n</td> <td> </td> <td>2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense\n</td> <td> </td> <td>28 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>115 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other (income), net\n</td> <td> </td> <td>(5) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(6) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n__________________\n(1) For all periods presented, amount principally relates to an allocation of expenses for ParentCo's retained pension and other postretirement benefit obligations associated with closed and sold operations.\n(2) In 2020 (January through March) and 2019, amount includes an allocation of $18 and $40, respectively, for costs incurred by ParentCo associated with the Separation (see above).\nManagement believes the assumptions regarding the allocation of ParentCo's general corporate expenses and financing costs were reasonable.\nNevertheless, the Consolidated Financial Statements of Arconic may not include all of the actual expenses that would have been incurred and may not reflect Arconic's consolidated results of operations, financial position, and cash flows had it been a standalone company during the periods prior to the Separation Date. Actual costs that would have been incurred if Arconic had been a standalone company would depend on multiple factors, including organizational structure, capital structure, and strategic decisions made in various areas, including information technology and infrastructure. Transactions between Arconic and ParentCo, including sales to the Howmet Aerospace Businesses, were presented as related party transactions in Arconic's Consolidated Financial Statements and were considered to be effectively settled for cash at the time the transaction was recorded. The total net effect of the settlement of these transactions was reflected on Arconic's Statement of Consolidated Cash Flows as a financing activity and on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheet as Parent Company net investment.\nManagement Review of 2021 and Outlook for the Future\nArconic had a strong first full year of operations as a stand-alone company in 2021, despite the challenges of an array of headwinds. Segment adjusted EBITDA* grew 17% over 2021 driven by most of our end-markets showing double-digit revenue growth despite aerospace volumes being down. The Company was able to optimize its product mix to help compensate for changes in automotive demand related to semiconductor chip shortages and changes in staffing availability due to the pandemic. We implemented actions to offset inflation in alloying materials, energy prices and freight costs through increased pricing and productivity measures. In the Rolled Products segment, 2021 Segment Adjusted EBITDA exceeded 2019 levels (which were prior to pandemic impacts), despite the lower aerospace and automotive build rates. We secured long-term contracts for over $2,000 in aerospace sales, signed agreements for approximately $1,500 in North American packaging sales from 2022-2024, and captured content on 23 new automotive or light commercial vehicle platforms including a number of full-electric vehicles. We executed on a capital allocation strategy to reduce liabilities associated with pension and other postretirement benefits and effectively manage environmental obligations, positioning the Company for expected future growth in cash generation. We also repurchased $161 of shares of the Company's common stock and initiated two organic capital projects in the Rolled Products segment that are expected to drive future EBITDA growth starting in 2023.\nIn 2021, Sales of $7,504 rose 32% from 2020, reflecting higher aluminum prices and volume improvements in all our end markets except aerospace. The Company recorded a net loss of $397, or $3.65 per share, compared to a net loss of $109, or $1.00 per share, in 2020. The 2021 results included a pre-tax charge of $549 ($423 after-tax) for the settlement of certain employee retirement benefits related to the partial annuitization of U.S. pension plan obligations in April 2021, and a pre-tax charge of $65 ($65 after-tax) for the impairment of goodwill associated with the Extrusions reporting unit in the fourth quarter of 2021.\nWe ended the year with a cash balance of $335, and total liquidity of $1,125 (comprised of Cash and cash equivalents of $335 and undrawn availability of $790 under the Company's ABL Credit Agreement). We increased the aggregate principal amount of the Company's ABL Credit Agreement on February 16, 2022 from $800 to $1,200, reflecting the increase in collateral base due to volume growth and higher aluminum prices.\nAs we look forward to 2022 and beyond, we anticipate volumes will benefit from the ongoing ramp up of our Tennessee can sheet operations, improvement in the aerospace end-market, and growth in ground transportation as our automotive customers anticipate that semiconductor chip availability is expected to ease throughout the year. Based on current internal and external projections of build rates and leading indicators in the markets we serve, our expectations for sales by major end market, excluding the impact of changes in aluminum prices, in 2022 follow. For the ground transportation end market, we expect sales to increase by approximately 10% to 15% in 2022 compared with 2021, driven by our customers expecting improvements in semiconductor chip availability. Automotive sales are expected to increase from 2021 levels, while commercial transportation sales are expected to remain strong but are not expected to grow at the same pace as they did in 2021. For the industrial products end market, we anticipate sales to grow by approximately 5% to 10% in 2022 compared with 2021, driven by continued strong pricing and demand due to the impact of ongoing U.S. trade actions. Our volume growth may be constrained by the need to pivot capacity that served industrial products in 2021 back to ground transportation later in 2022. For the building and construction end market, we anticipate sales to increase by approximately 5% to 10% in 2022 compared with 2021, driven by increased non-residential construction activity, but expected to be challenged in the near term related to supply chain constraints, pricing, and labor issues creating uncertainty for our customers. For the packaging end market, we expect sales to increase by approximately 40% to 45% in 2022 compared with 2021, as North American can sheet ramps up to full capacity in the first half of 2022 and facilities in Russia and China continue to serve strong global markets. For the aerospace end market, we expect sales to grow by approximately 25% to 35% from 2021, as the supply chain is expected to be destocked in 2022 and aircraft build rates are expected to increase.\n* See Reconciliation of Total Segment Adjusted EBITDA to Consolidated Net (Loss) Income Attributable to Arconic Corporation within Segment Information under Results of Operations below.\nLegal Proceedings Involving our Samara Facility\nOur subsidiaries that own and operate our facility located in Samara, Russia are, and have been since the Separation, subject to proceedings initiated by Russian regulatory authorities as a result of alleged violations of Russian Federal Law No. 57-FZ. In connection with these proceedings, authorities have imposed injunctions prohibiting, among other actions, the payment of dividends, placement of bonds, amendments to organizational documents, and changes to the subsidiaries' chief executive officer and board of directors. See Note T to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\u201d under the caption Contingencies and Commitments-Contingencies-Litigation-Federal Antimonopoly Service Of The Russian Federation Litigation\u201d for additional information regarding the proceedings. The proceedings and underlying claims may not be resolved favorably, are likely to continue to be delayed, may be resolved in a manner that results in permanent injunctions similar to or more restrictive than the current injunctions, and could result in a decision or a requirement to divest some or all of the assets located at the Samara facility.\nApproximately $79, or 24%, of Arconic's Cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2021 is currently held in Russia and is not available for dividends. Cash and cash equivalents held in Russia represented 7% of Arconic's total liquidity at December 31, 2021. In addition, approximately $968, or 16% of third-party sales (including packaging, industrial products, aerospace, and defense), and approximately $87, or 13% of Segment Adjusted EBITDA, for the Rolled Products segment for the year ended December 31, 2021 were generated by our Samara, Russia facility. We cannot at this time reasonably estimate the likelihood or timing of any resolution of the regulatory proceedings or underlying claims, whether such resolution would include the removal of the injunctions or the imposition of additional restrictions, or whether we would divest assets related to the Samara facility. The potential impacts of an unfavorable resolution of the proceedings and underlying claims include:\n\u2022continued unavailability of funds for the payment of dividends to Arconic Corporation;\n\u2022decreases in or loss of third-party sales and Segment Adjusted EBITDA generated by our Samara facility;\n\u2022restrictions on capital investments in the facility;\n\u2022losses on any potential divestiture;\n\u2022the inability of other Arconic facilities to assume capacity to offset decreases in sales or Segment Adjusted EBIDTA or to assume potential divested capacity; and\n\u2022increased expenses related to relocation of capacity to other facilities.\nAny of the foregoing could have a significant indirect impact on the performance of our other locations. In addition, any impact on our ability to fulfill delivery obligations could subject us to reputational harm and potential litigation involving customers and suppliers. Continued restrictions on our operation of the Samara facility would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nCOVID-19 Pandemic\nOur operations and financial results have been, and may continue to be, adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, several of our automotive and aerospace customers temporarily suspended operations at different points throughout 2020. While many of our customers have resumed operations as it relates to the COVID-19 pandemic, we are unable to estimate with certainty at this time the status, frequency, or duration of any potential reoccurrences of customer shutdowns, or the duration or extent of resumed operations. Due to the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on our customers, we are experiencing, and expect to continue experiencing, lower demand and volume for our products. These trends may lead to charges, impairments and other adverse financial impacts over time. The impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity, and/or cash flows will be magnified if the disruption from the COVID-19 pandemic continues for an extended period.\nWe believe that our diverse end markets and geographic composition mitigate a portion of the impact on the Company from any singular area of decline. Additionally, our operating footprint benefits from a highly variable cost structure and we are actively managing operations to effectively flex activity to respond to changing automotive and aerospace market conditions. However, the geographic locations in which our products are manufactured, distributed or sold are in varying stages of continued restrictions or lifting of restrictions, and the status of restrictions in certain areas may change on short notice. Because we rely on supply chain continuity, restrictions in one location may materially impact operations in multiple locations, and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in one location may have a disproportionate effect on our operations in the future.\nThe safety of our employees is our highest priority. We heightened measures at all of our locations to maintain strict hygiene, increase social distancing, and enable employees to work remotely where possible. In response to market conditions we implemented a series of proactive actions starting in April 2020 to mitigate the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company, including the following:\n\u2022deferred initiating a dividend on common stock;\n\u2022reduced the CEO's salary and the Board of Directors' cash compensation by 30%*;\n\u2022reduced salaries for senior-level management by 20% and for all other salaried employees by 10%*;\n\u2022restructuring of the salaried workforce, reduction of 10%;\n\u2022idling of various production facilities based on market conditions within the regions where the Company operates;\n\u2022decreasing production and operating with a reduced labor force through shortened work weeks, shift reductions, layoffs, and the elimination of temporary workers and contractors at U.S.-based rolling and extrusion facilities;\n\u2022implementing a combination of modified schedules, adjusted work hours, lower costs, and/or delayed raises at all rolling mill facilities in Europe, China and Russia;\n\u2022suspended the 401(k) match program for U.S. salaried employees*; and\n\u2022reducing capital expenditures by approximately $50, or approximately 30%.\n*Effective September 1, 2020, the Company restored both the salaries of all salaried employees and the 401(k) match of all salaried U.S. employees, including executive officers, to the levels in effect prior to the actions described above. Also effective September 1, 2020, the Company restored the annual cash retainers payable to the non-employee members of the Company's Board of Directors to the levels in effect prior to the previous reduction described above.\nThe foregoing measures from our cash conservation program resulted in actual cost savings of approximately $160, comprised of $100 in temporary savings (i.e., 2020 only) and $60 in permanent savings, as well as an additional $50 for capital expenditure reductions, from April 2020 through December 2020. In 2021, an additional $40 in permanent savings were realized under this program. While we anticipate incremental cost savings in future periods related to the measures that resulted in permanent cost savings during 2021 and 2020, we may not achieve such savings. In addition, we may determine that it is necessary to modify or rescind cost-saving actions, in which case certain of the realized permanent cost savings may not continue and/or any anticipated incremental cost savings would not be fully realized. Further disruptions and uncertainties related to the COVID-19 pandemic could require us to take additional cost-saving actions or to modify or rescind current cost-saving actions, make additional modifications to our strategic plans and/or incur additional expenses as part of our continued response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The cost-savings measures taken to date, and any cost-cutting measures we may need to\ntake in the future, could have a material and adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity, and/or cash flows.\nWhile we are continuing to evaluate the impact of this global event, our liquidity and financial position remains strong despite the COVID-19 pandemic's impact to our business. Our business is flexible and we have demonstrated a robust and agile cash management program, and together with potential future cash conservation actions, we believe we have adequate liquidity to operate the Company over the next twelve months.\nThe timing for the Company and/or our customers resuming operations and the levels of operations experienced before the COVID-19 pandemic depend on numerous factors beyond the Company's control, including, among other things: the revision of governmental quarantine, shelter in place or similar social distancing orders or guidelines; the occurrence and magnitude of future outbreaks; the availability of vaccines or other medical remedies and preventive measures; the location of facilities; and determinations regarding, among other things, health and safety, demand for specific products, and broader economic conditions. We are continuing to evaluate the impact this global event may have on the Company's future results of operations, financial condition, liquidity, and cash flows.\nSee Part I. Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d for additional information regarding the continuing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operations.\nResults of Operations\nThe discussion and analysis that follows includes a comparison of Arconic's results of operations between the 2021 and 2020 annual periods for both the total company and each reportable segment. Please refer to the Results of Operations section included in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Part II Item 7 of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020 (filed on February 23, 2021) for a discussion and analysis of Arconic's results of operations between the 2020 and 2019 annual periods for both the total company and each reportable segment.\nEarnings Summary\nSales. Sales were $7,504 in 2021 compared to $5,675 in 2020, an increase of $1,829, or 32%. The increase was principally due to higher aluminum prices driven by a rise in both the average LME price and regional premiums, improved volumes in all end markets except aerospace as recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic continues, and higher product pricing. These positive impacts were slightly offset by both lower volume and unfavorable product mix due to depressed sales to the aerospace end market, the negative impact of the semiconductor chip shortage affecting the automotive component of the ground transportation end market, and labor shortages at several North America operations due to COVID-19-related quarantines.\nIn March 2021, the Company entered into a settlement agreement with a customer related to the terms of an existing long-term contract. As a result, the customer agreed to pay Arconic $18, which will be recognized over the applicable three-year period. Accordingly, the Company's sales in 2021 included $12 associated with this settlement.\nCost of Goods Sold. COGS was $6,573 in 2021 compared to $4,862 in 2020, an increase of $1,711, or 35%. COGS as a percentage of Sales was 87.6% in 2021 compared to 85.7% in 2020. This percentage was negatively impacted by higher aluminum prices (underlying metal price is contractually passed-through to most customers at cost), unfavorable product mix driven by depressed sales to the aerospace end market, and the impact of the semiconductor chip shortage affecting the automotive component of the ground transportation market. These negative impacts were partially offset by higher product pricing. Net cost savings principally resulting from operational productivity and the absence of below normal absorption of fixed costs that occurred in 2020 driven by significantly lower production levels as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, were offset by higher costs for labor (see Labor costs below), energy, transportation, and alloying materials.\nSelling, General Administrative, and Other Expenses. SG&A expenses were $247, or 3.3% of Sales, in 2021 compared to $258, or 4.5% of Sales, in 2020. The decrease of $11, or 4%, was largely attributable to the absence of an allocation ($18) of costs incurred for the Separation (see Cost Allocations under The Separation above), somewhat offset by higher labor costs (see Labor costs below).\nResearch and Development Expenses. R&D expenses were $34 in 2021 compared to $36 in 2020. The decrease was primarily driven by cost reduction efforts initiated in 2020.\nLabor costs-The following description is applicable to COGS, SG&A, and R&D in the aggregate. Beginning in April 2020, management implemented a series of proactive actions to mitigate the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the\nCompany. Many of these actions impacted both business unit and corporate employees resulting in the Company experiencing lower labor costs in 2020. These actions included the following:\n\u2022idled various production facilities based on market conditions within the regions where the Company operates;\n\u2022decreased production and operating with a reduced labor force through shortened work weeks, shift reductions, layoffs, and the elimination of temporary workers and contractors at U.S.-based rolling and extrusion facilities;\n\u2022implemented a combination of modified schedules, adjusted work hours, lower costs, and/or delayed raises at all rolling mill facilities in Europe, China, and Russia;\n\u2022reduced the CEO's salary and the Board of Directors' cash compensation by 30%;\n\u2022reduced salaries for senior-level management by 20% and for all other salaried employees by 10%; and\n\u2022suspended the 401(k) match program for U.S. salaried employees.\nEffective September 1, 2020, the Company restored both the salaries of all salaried employees and the 401(k) match of all salaried U.S. employees, including executive officers, to the levels in effect prior to the actions described above. Also effective September 1, 2020, the Company restored the annual cash retainers payable to the non-employee members of the Company's Board of Directors to the levels in effect prior to the previous reduction described above. Additionally, by the end of 2020 and throughout 2021, the Company's production facilities were operating at significantly higher levels compared to earlier in 2020. As a result, the Company experienced higher labor costs in 2021 compared to 2020.\nProvision for Depreciation and Amortization. The provision for depreciation and amortization was $253 in 2021 compared to $251 in 2020. The increase of $2 was mainly caused by new depreciation for assets placed into service in the second half of 2020 related to an automotive and industrial product expansion at the Company's Tennessee rolling facility, somewhat offset by the absence of an impairment of abandoned projects and plant equipment ($6) and the absence of depreciation on assets that were impaired in prior periods, including certain assets at the Company's primary research and development facility.\nImpairment of Goodwill. In 2021, the Company recognized a charge of $65 in connection with its annual review of goodwill for impairment related to the Extrusions reporting unit. In accordance with Arconic's accounting policy, this review is performed in the fourth quarter each calendar year. Accordingly, this charge was recognized in the fourth quarter of 2021. See Goodwill in Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates below for additional information.\nRestructuring and Other Charges. In 2021 and 2020, Restructuring and other charges were comprised of a net charge of $624 and $188, respectively. See Note E to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information.\nInterest Expense. Interest expense was $100 in 2021 compared to $118 in 2020. The decrease of $18, or 15%, was primarily due to the absence of both a $28 allocation of ParentCo's financing costs in the period prior to Separation (see Cost Allocations under The Separation above) and $19 for the write-off and immediate expensing of debt issuance costs as a result of a debt refinancing in May 2020, partially offset by a higher amount of interest associated with both a $700 debt offering executed in May 2020 and a $600 debt offering completed in February 2020 and new interest related to a $300 debt offering executed in March 2021. See Financing Activities under Liquidity and Capital Resources below for additional information related to these financing transactions.\nOther Expenses, Net. Other expenses, net was $67 in 2021 compared to $70 in 2020. See Note G to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information.\n(Benefit) Provision for Income Taxes. The Company's effective tax rate, including discrete items, was 13.5% (benefit on a loss) in 2021 and 0.9% (provision on a loss) in 2020. See Note I to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II Item 8 of this Form 10-K for a reconciliation of the effective tax rate for each of these years to the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21%.\nSegment Information\nArconic's operations consist of three reportable segments: Rolled Products, Building and Construction Systems, and Extrusions. Segment performance under the Company's management reporting system is evaluated based on several factors; however, the primary measure of performance is Segment Adjusted EBITDA (Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization).\nThe Company calculates Segment Adjusted EBITDA as Total sales (third-party and intersegment) minus each of (i) Cost of goods sold, (ii) Selling, general administrative, and other expenses, and (iii) and Research and development expenses, plus Stock-based compensation expense and Metal price lag. Arconic's Segment Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies' reportable segments.\nSegment Adjusted EBITDA for all reportable segments totaled $757 in 2021, $648 in 2020, and $757 in 2019. The following information provides Sales and Segment Adjusted EBITDA for each reportable segment for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2021. See Note D to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information.\nRolled Products\nTable 17: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Third-party sales </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>6,187 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,335 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,609 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Intersegment sales </td> <td> </td> <td>33 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>19 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>25 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Total sales </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>6,220 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,354 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,634 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Segment Adjusted EBITDA </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>655 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>527 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>640 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Third-party aluminum shipments (kmt) </td> <td> </td> <td>1,404 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,179 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,390 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOverview. The Rolled Products segment produces aluminum sheet and plate for a variety of end markets. Sheet and plate are sold directly to customers and through distributors related to the aerospace, ground transportation, packaging, building and construction, and industrial products (mainly used in the production of machinery and equipment and consumer durables) end markets. While the customer base for flat-rolled products is large, a significant amount of sales of sheet and plate is to a relatively small number of customers. Prices for these products are generally based on the price of metal plus a premium for adding value to the aluminum to produce a semi-finished product, resulting in a business model in which the underlying price of metal is contractually passed-through to customers. Generally, the sales and costs and expenses of this segment are transacted in the local currency of the respective operations, which are the U.S. dollar and, to a lesser extent, each of the following: the Russian ruble, Chinese yuan, the euro, and the British pound.\nSales. Third-party sales for the Rolled Products segment increased $1,852, or 43%, in 2021 compared to 2020. The improvement was largely attributable to higher aluminum prices (see below), a net increase in volumes (see below), and favorable product pricing. These positive impacts were slightly offset by unfavorable product mix driven by depressed sales to the aerospace end market, which provides for the highest revenue per metric ton in this segment's commercial portfolio, and labor shortages at several North America operations due to COVID-19-related quarantines.\nThe higher aluminum prices were mostly driven by a 45% rise in the average LME aluminum price and sharp increases in regional premiums, including a 118% improvement in the average Midwest premium (United States).\nThe net increase in volumes was largely attributable to most end markets served by this segment, including ground transportation (improvement in the automotive component of this market was lessened by the global semiconductor chip shortage), industrial products, and packaging. Each of these end markets have experienced varying levels of recovery from the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, volume related to the industrial products end market was favorably impacted by a U.S. trade case, which reached a final determination in March 2021, that imposes significant duties on the import of common alloy aluminum sheet. These higher volumes were slightly offset by decreased volume in the aerospace end market due to the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Year over year, all of the negative volume impact related to the aerospace end market was experienced in the first half of 2021.\nIn March 2021, the Company entered into a settlement agreement with a customer related to the terms of an existing long-term contract. As a result, the customer agreed to pay Arconic $18, which will be recognized over the applicable three-year period. Accordingly, in 2021, Rolled Products' sales included $12 associated with this settlement.\nSegment Adjusted EBITDA. Segment Adjusted EBITDA for the Rolled Products segment increased $128, or 24%, in 2021 compared to 2020. The improvement was primarily due to a net increase in volumes, favorable product pricing, and net cost savings (see below). These positive impacts were somewhat offset by unfavorable product mix driven by depressed sales to the aerospace end market, which historically provided for the highest margin per metric ton in this segment's commercial portfolio. In the 2021 fourth quarter, this segment recorded a net adjustment of $10 (approximately $7 of which relates to prior quarters in 2021) related to write-downs of scrap inventory. The out-of-period amounts were not material to any interim or annual period.\nNet cost savings were principally the result of the absence of below normal absorption of fixed costs that occurred in 2020 due to significantly lower production levels as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as operational productivity. These positive impacts were partially offset by higher costs for labor (see Labor costs under Results of Operations above) and direct materials, including energy, transportation, and alloying materials.\nBuilding and Construction Systems\nTable 18: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Third-party sales </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,011 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>963 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,118 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Segment Adjusted EBITDA </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>130 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>137 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>126 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOverview. The Building and Construction Systems segment manufactures products that are used primarily in the non-residential building and construction end market. These products include integrated aluminum architectural systems and architectural extrusions, which are sold directly to customers and through distributors. A limited amount of this segment's product sales is directly impacted by metal pricing, which is a pass-through to the related customers. Generally, the sales and costs and expenses of this segment are transacted in the local currency of the respective operations, which are the U.S. dollar and, to a lesser extent, each of the following: the euro, the British pound, and Canadian dollar.\nSales. Third-party sales for the Building and Construction Systems segment increased $48, or 5%, in 2021 compared to 2020. The improvement was primarily due to higher product pricing across the entire portfolio, increased metal pass-through pricing due to significant increases in aluminum prices, and favorable foreign currency movements due to a stronger euro. These positive impacts were somewhat offset by lower volumes due to decreased demand in North America as a result of the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nSegment Adjusted EBITDA. Segment Adjusted EBITDA for the Building and Construction Systems segment decreased $7, or 5%, in 2021 compared to 2020. The decline was principally driven by higher costs for direct materials, including aluminum and labor (see Labor costs under Results of Operations above), and lower volumes, mostly offset by higher product pricing.\nExtrusions\nTable 19: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Third-party sales </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>306 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>381 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>550 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Segment Adjusted EBITDA </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(28) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(16) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(9) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Third-party aluminum shipments (kmt) </td> <td> </td> <td>35 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>40 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>60 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOverview. The Extrusions segment produces a range of extruded and machined parts for the aerospace, ground transportation, and industrial products end markets. These products are sold directly to customers and through distributors. Prices for these products are generally based on the price of metal plus a premium for adding value to the aluminum to produce a semi-finished product, resulting in a business model in which the underlying price of metal is contractually passed-through to customers. Generally, the sales and costs and expenses of this segment are transacted in the local currency of the respective operations, which are the U.S. dollar and, to a lesser extent, the euro.\nIn the 2021 first quarter, management approved the idling of the casthouse at the Lafayette (Indiana) plant. Additionally, in the 2021 second quarter, management approved the idling of the remaining operations (primarily small presses) at the Chandler (Arizona) plant. These actions were deemed necessary to address the ongoing depressed demand related to the aerospace end market and identified operational inefficiencies in the Extrusions portfolio. The Lafayette casthouse action will occur in multiple phases and is expected to be completed by mid-2022. Ultimately, the casthouse function will be outsourced to third-party vendors. The Chandler action was completed in the 2021 third quarter. The commercial operations related to Chandler have been integrated into Lafayette for the foreseeable future. In 2021, the Company incurred certain charges related to these decisions such as inventory write-downs, severance costs, and customer qualification costs. These items were not material, individually or in the aggregate, and were reported in Corporate (i.e., not included in Extrusion's Segment Adjusted EBITDA). The Company may temporarily restart one or more of the presses at Chandler over short periods of time to address customer demand requirements.\nSales. Third-party sales for the Extrusions segment decreased $75, or 20%, in 2021 compared to 2020. The decline was largely attributable to a net decrease in volumes, somewhat offset by higher aluminum prices. The net decrease in volumes was mainly caused by a drop in demand in the aerospace end market due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on air travel, partially offset by improved demand in the ground transportation and industrial products end markets. Most of the negative volume impact related to the aerospace end market was experienced in the first half of 2021.\nSegment Adjusted EBITDA. Segment Adjusted EBITDA for the Extrusions segment decreased $12 in 2021 compared to 2020. The decline was mostly related to a net decrease in volumes and higher costs for direct materials and labor (see Labor\ncosts under Results of Operations above), partially offset by the absence of costs ($12) related to both inventory write-downs and customer settlements.\nReconciliation of Total Segment Adjusted EBITDA to Consolidated Net (Loss) Income Attributable to Arconic Corporation\nTable 20: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>For the year ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Segment Adjusted EBITDA(1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>757 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>648 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>757 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unallocated amounts: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Corporate expenses(1),(2)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>(33) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(24) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(53) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Stock-based compensation expense </td> <td> </td> <td>(22) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(23) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(40) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Metal price lag(3)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>(16) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(27) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(39) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Provision for depreciation and amortization </td> <td> </td> <td>(253) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(251) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(252) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impairment of goodwill\n</td> <td> </td> <td>(65) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Restructuring and other charges(4)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>(624) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(188) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(87) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other(1),(5)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>(36) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(55) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(71) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating (loss) income\n</td> <td> </td> <td>(292) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>80 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>215 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense </td> <td> </td> <td>(100) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(118) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(115) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other (expenses) income, net(1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>(67) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(70) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Benefit (Provision) for income taxes\n</td> <td> </td> <td>62 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>62 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income attributable to noncontrolling interest </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consolidated net (loss) income attributable to Arconic(2)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(397) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(109) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>177 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n_________________\n(1)In preparation for the Separation, effective January 1, 2020, certain U.S. defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans previously sponsored by ParentCo were separated into standalone plans for both Arconic and Howmet Aerospace. Additionally, effective April 1, 2020, Arconic assumed a portion of the obligations associated with certain non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans that included participants related to both the Arconic Businesses and the Howmet Aerospace Businesses, as well as legacy defined benefit pension plans assigned to the Company as a result of the Separation. As a result, beginning in the first quarter of 2020 for these U.S. plans and in the second quarter of 2020 for these non-U.S. plans, Arconic applied defined benefit plan accounting resulting in benefit plan expense being recorded in operating income (service cost) and nonoperating income (nonservice cost). In all historical periods prior to these respective timeframes, Arconic was considered a participating employer in ParentCo's defined benefit plans and, therefore, applied multiemployer plan accounting resulting in the Company's share of benefit plan expense being recorded entirely in operating income. Also, Arconic is the plan sponsor of certain other non-U.S. defined benefit plans that contain participants related only to the Arconic Businesses and, therefore, the related benefit plan expense was recorded in accordance with defined benefit plan accounting in all periods presented. The following table presents the total benefit plan expense (excluding settlements and curtailments) recorded by Arconic based on the foregoing in each period presented:\nTable 21: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>For the year ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Segment Adjusted EBITDA: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Rolled Products </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(18) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(17) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(62) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Building and Construction Systems </td> <td> </td> <td>(2) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(5) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Extrusions </td> <td> </td> <td>(7) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(7) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(18) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Segment total </td> <td> </td> <td>(27) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(26) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(85) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unallocated amounts: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Corporate expenses </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(15) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(9) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Subtotal </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(24) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other expenses, net </td> <td> </td> <td>(60) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(78) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(87) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(103) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(111) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(2)Corporate expenses are composed of general administrative and other expenses of operating the corporate headquarters and other global administrative facilities. The amounts presented for all periods prior to second quarter 2020 include an\nallocation of ParentCo's corporate expenses, including research and development expenses, for the portion of the period prior to the Separation Date (see the Cost Allocations section of The Separation under Overview above).\n(3)Metal price lag represents the financial impact of the timing difference between when aluminum prices included in Sales are recognized and when aluminum purchase prices included in Cost of goods sold are realized. This adjustment aims to remove the effect of the volatility in metal prices and the calculation of this impact considers applicable metal hedging transactions.\n(4)In 2021 and 2020, Restructuring and other charges includes a $584 and $199, respectively, charge for the settlement of certain employee retirement benefits virtually all of which were within the United States and the United Kingdom. See Note H to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information.\n(5)Other includes certain items that impact Cost of goods sold and Selling, general administrative, and other expenses on the Company's Statement of Consolidated Operations that are not included in Segment Adjusted EBITDA.\nEnvironmental Matters\nSee the Environmental Matters section of Note T to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nArconic's primary future cash needs are centered on operating activities, including working capital, as well as recurring and strategic capital expenditures. The Company's ability to fund its cash needs depends on its ongoing ability to generate and raise cash in the future. Although management believes that Arconic's future cash from operations, together with the Company's access to capital markets, will provide adequate resources to fund Arconic's operating and investing needs, the Company's access to, and the availability of, financing on acceptable terms in the future will be affected by many factors, including: (i) Arconic's credit rating; (ii) the liquidity of the overall capital markets; and (iii) the current state of the economy. There can be no assurances that the Company will continue to have access to capital markets on terms acceptable to Arconic.\nFor all periods prior to the Separation Date, ParentCo provided capital, cash management, and other treasury services to the Company. Only cash amounts specifically attributable to Arconic were reflected in the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements. Transfers of cash, both to and from ParentCo's centralized cash management system, were reflected as a component of Parent Company net investment in Arconic's Consolidated Financial Statements.\nCash provided from operations and financing activities is expected to be adequate to cover the Company's operational and business needs over the next 12 months. For an analysis of long-term liquidity, see Contractual Obligations and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements below.\nAt December 31, 2021, the Company's Cash and cash equivalents were $335, of which $199 was held outside the United States. Of this, approximately $79, or 24%, of total cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2021 was held in Russia. Cash and cash equivalents held in Russia represented 7% of Arconic's total liquidity at December 31, 2021. Cash and cash equivalents held in Russia are currently subject to injunctions imposed by regulatory authorities that prohibit the distribution of dividends. We cannot at this time reasonably estimate the likelihood or timeline of a resolution involving the removal of these injunctions, and accordingly cannot reasonably estimate when, if at all, the funds will be available for the payment of dividends to Arconic Corporation. We maintain a renewable intercompany loan facility that could be utilized but we have as yet not utilized this facility. In addition, Arconic has a number of commitments and obligations related to the Company's operations in various foreign jurisdictions, resulting in the need for cash outside the United States. Management continuously evaluates the Company's local and global cash needs for future business operations, which may influence future repatriation decisions.\nThe discussion and analysis that follows includes a comparison of Arconic's cash flows between the 2021 and 2020 annual periods. Please refer to the Liquidity and Capital Resources section included in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Part II Item 7 of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020 (filed on February 23, 2021) for a discussion and analysis of Arconic's cash flows between the 2020 and 2019 annual periods.\nOperating Activities\nCash used for operations was $407 in 2021 compared with cash provided from operations of $6 in 2020.\nIn 2021, cash used for operations was comprised of an unfavorable change in working capital of $505, pension contributions of $458 (see below), and a net loss of $397, partially offset by a positive add-back for non-cash transactions in\nearnings of $953. The impact in working capital was largely driven by higher volumes and higher aluminum prices due to an increase in both the average LME price and regional premiums.\nIn January 2021, the Company contributed a total of $200 to its two funded U.S. defined benefit pension plans, comprised of the estimated minimum required funding for 2021 of $183 and an additional $17.\nIn April 2021, the Company contributed a total of $250 to its two funded U.S. defined benefit pension plans to maintain the funding level of the remaining plan obligations not transferred under a group annuity contract (see U.S. Pension Plan Annuitizations in Note H to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information). This contribution was funded with the net proceeds from a March 2021 debt offering (see 2021 Debt Activity in Financing Activities below).\nAlso in April 2021, the Company received $9 as one of two installments related to a settlement agreement reached with a customer in March 2021. See Sales under Results of Operations above for additional information.\nIn 2020, cash provided from operations was comprised primarily of a positive add-back for non-cash transactions in earnings of $552 and a favorable change in noncurrent assets and liabilities of $56, mostly offset by pension contributions of $271, an unfavorable change in working capital of $222 (see below), and a net loss of $109.\nCash provided from operations for 2020 includes an unfavorable adjustment of $235 related to the change in the Company's customer and other receivables balances as of December 31, 2020 ($759) and 2019 ($520). The unfavorable adjustment (i.e., increase in receivables) was derived by calculating the difference in the receivables balances as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 after excluding the effects of divestitures and foreign currency translation. The $235 was negatively impacted by the fact that customer receivables related to the Arconic Corporation Businesses were no longer included in ParentCo's accounts receivable securitization program effective January 2, 2020. In periods prior to 2020, certain identified customer receivables related to the Arconic Corporation Businesses were sold on a revolving basis to a ParentCo subsidiary under this program and were considered to be effectively and immediately settled for cash. As of December 31, 2019, the amount of Arconic's outstanding customer receivables sold to ParentCo's subsidiary was $281. As a result, the Company's customer receivables balance as of December 31, 2019 reflects the settlement of the $281 even though the third-party customers had not yet paid their obligations to ParentCo, as Arconic no longer had the right to collect and receive cash from the related customers. Had customer receivables related to the Arconic Corporation Businesses not been included in ParentCo's program in 2019, the Company's customer receivables balance as of December 31, 2019 would have been higher by $281. Further, these outstanding receivables would have been collected by the Arconic Corporation Businesses from the third-party customers in 2020. Accordingly, the previously mentioned unfavorable change in working capital of $222 would have been a favorable change in working capital of $59. See Cash Management in Note A to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nFinancing Activities\nCash provided from financing activities was $135 in 2021 compared with $744 in 2020. The source of cash in 2021 was mostly due to $314 in net proceeds from the issuance of new indebtedness (see 2021 Debt Activity below), somewhat offset by $161 for the repurchase of 4,912,505 shares of the Company's common stock (see Share Repurchase Program below). In 2020, the source of cash was due to $2,343 in net proceeds (reflects additional debt issuance costs paid from cash on hand) from the issuance of new indebtedness (see 2020 Debt Activity below) and $216 in net cash funding provided by ParentCo prior to the Separation Date, partially offset by $1,100 for the repayment of debt (see 2020 Debt Activity below) and a $728 payment to ParentCo in connection with the Separation (see The Separation above).\n2021 Debt Activity-On March 3, 2021, the Company completed a Rule 144A (U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as amended) debt offering for an additional $300 aggregate principal amount of 6.125% Senior Secured Second-Lien Notes due 2028 (the Additional 2028 Notes\u201d). The Additional 2028 Notes were issued under the indenture governing Arconic's existing 6.125% Senior Secured Second-Lien Notes due 2028 (see 2020 Debt Activity below). Other than with respect to the date of issuance and issue price, the Additional 2028 Notes are treated as a single series with and have the same terms as the referenced existing notes. The Additional 2028 Notes were sold at 106.25% of par (i.e., a premium) and, after reflecting a discount to the initial purchasers of the Additional 2028 Notes, the Company received $315 in net proceeds from the debt offering. Arconic used the net proceeds of this issuance to fund an annuitization of certain U.S. defined benefit pension plan obligations (see Note H to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information). The premium ($19) and costs to complete the financing ($5) were deferred and are being amortized to interest expense over the term of the Additional 2028 Notes. The amortization of the premium is reflected as a reduction to interest expense and the amortization of the costs to complete the financing is reflected as an addition to interest expense. Interest on the Additional 2028 Notes is paid semi-annually in February and August, and commenced August 15, 2021.\n2020 Debt Activity-In connection with the capital structure to be established at the time of the Separation, Arconic secured $1,200 in third-party indebtedness. On February 7, 2020, the Company completed a Rule 144A (U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as amended) debt offering for $600 aggregate principal amount of 6.125% Senior Secured Second-Lien Notes due 2028 (the 2028 Notes\u201d). Arconic received $593 in net proceeds from the debt offering reflecting a discount to the initial purchasers of the 2028 Notes. Also, on March 25, 2020, the Company entered into a credit agreement, which provided a $600 Senior Secured First-Lien Term Loan B Facility (variable rate and seven-year term) (the Term Loan\u201d) and a $1,000 Senior Secured First-Lien Revolving Credit Facility (variable rate and five-year term) (the Credit Facility\u201d), with a syndicate of lenders and issuers named therein (the Credit Agreement\u201d). Arconic received $575 in net proceeds from the Term Loan reflecting upfront fees and costs to enter into the financing arrangement.\nThe Company used a portion of the $1,168 in net proceeds from the aggregate indebtedness to make a $728 payment to ParentCo on April 1, 2020 to fund the transfer of certain net assets from ParentCo to Arconic in connection with the completion of the Separation (see The Separation above). The payment to ParentCo was calculated as the difference between (i) the $1,168 of net proceeds from the aggregate indebtedness and (ii) the difference between a beginning cash balance at the Separation Date of $500, as provided for in the Separation and Distribution Agreement, and the amount of cash held by Arconic Businesses at March 31, 2020 ($60 - the sum of this amount and the aggregate indebtedness in (i) equals the sum of Cash and cash equivalents and Restricted cash on the Company's Combined Balance Sheet as of March 31, 2020).\nOn April 2, 2020, Arconic borrowed $500, which was subject to an interest rate equal to the sum of the three-month LIBOR plus a 2.0% applicable margin, under the Credit Facility.
