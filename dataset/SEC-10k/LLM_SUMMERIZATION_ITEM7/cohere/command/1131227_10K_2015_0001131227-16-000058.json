This discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our current views with respect to future events and financial performance. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements or as a result of certain factors such as those set forth in our Forward Looking Statements disclaimer on page ii of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nGeneral\nDuring 2015, oil prices have remained in a trading range of $35 to $65 per barrel and an average of $49 with a more recent price in the $28 to $40 range. The drop in oil price is due to surplus oil, driven in part by a significant rise in U.S. shale oil production as well as other previously unavailable sources of supply and OPEC suppliers in the Middle East and Russia not reducing their output. In addition, economic weakness in many regions of the world, notably Europe and China, has reduced the previously expected oil consumption growth rate. As a result of lower oil prices, major and independent oil companies with deepwater operations have significantly reduced their capital spending budgets, which are the principal demand drivers for our services. Less spending by our customers combined with a global oversupply of OSVs, including high-spec OSVs in our core markets, for the current market conditions, have resulted in reductions in both our dayrates and utilization.\nWe believe that the long-term nature of deepwater projects insulates them, somewhat, from a short-term fall in oil prices and that many sanctioned or on-going projects will proceed. However, deepwater activities will be affected by lower prices, even if they are affected less than other activities. We have experienced and continue to experience requests by our deepwater customers for price reductions in order to help mitigate the impact that lower prices are having and will continue to have on oil company operating results and cashflows. In addition, sustained low prices have caused un-sanctioned projects to be delayed or cancelled altogether, which could be manifested in less activity later, even if oil prices recover. Many of our operations are in support of deepwater projects that are in their final stages or of projects that do not involve deepwater and are more susceptible to immediate wind-down. We cannot predict whether, to what extent, or when oil prices will improve.\nIn the GoM, 18 high-spec OSVs have been delivered into the domestic market during 2015, including five of our own. We expect an additional 18 high-spec OSVs to be delivered into domestic service during 2016 and 2017. We do not anticipate significant growth in the supply of high-spec OSVs beyond the currently anticipated level of 210 of such vessels by the first quarter of 2017. During the fourth quarter of 2015, there was an average of roughly 48 floating rigs available in the GoM, while an average of 39 were working. As of February 17, 2016, there were 50 rigs available and 35 were working. However, ten floating rigs have contracts that will expire during 2016 and one rig is scheduled to leave the region. We do not know whether the remaining rigs will receive contract renewals for operations in the GoM. We expect three new rigs to arrive in the GoM during 2016. Once a rig arrives in the GoM, it can take several months to commence work and, therefore, we do not know the timing of when operations of newly arrived rigs will begin. Given these market conditions, we anticipate our average dayrates and utilization levels to be adversely affected compared to our 2015 and 2014 results. However, the GoM is one of the premier deepwater markets in the world and we are committed to supporting our customers in this market. We feel that once the current supply and demand fundamentals return to normal conditions our results from operations will improve.\nIn recognition of these weak market conditions, we stacked 28 OSVs on various dates from October 1, 2014 through December 31, 2015. Post year-end, we have stacked an additional five new generation OSVs to date. These 33 stacked vessels represent 49% of our fleetwide vessel headcount, but only 33% of our total OSV and MPSV deadweight tonnage. By stacking vessels, we expect to significantly reduce our cash outlays and lower our risk profile; however, we will have fewer revenue-producing units in service that can contribute to our results and contribute cash flows to cover our fixed costs and commitments. We may choose to stack additional vessels should market conditions warrant.\nIn Mexico, while the energy reform continues to progress, questions remain on the timing of the incremental activity expected in the deepwater GoM given the current oil price environment. PEMEX budget reductions have resulted in contract cancellations and slower than expected growth in the market for our vessels in Mexico. We have\nnoticed that PEMEX is reviewing its vessel needs and, in certain circumstances, is not exercising options for vessels that are currently operating in its chartered fleet. We expect that certain of our Mexican-flagged vessels will be affected and will likely be stacked, if not renewed. Nevertheless, we consider Mexico to be a long-term market for our services, especially in light of energy reforms being carried out there. Despite current oil prices, we recently observed improved bidding results from several international companies related to shallow water auctions in Mexico. We will continue to explore opportunities to place additional vessels into Mexico to support PEMEX in its ongoing shallow water activity and non-PEMEX customers in support of future shelf and deepwater activity there. In 2014, PEMEX announced its intention to use only vessels that are less that 15 years old. We and other market participants in Mexico, however, have successfully challenged this restriction, but PEMEX may renew its attempt in the future.\nIn Brazil, Petrobras generally appears to be moving towards an \"all Brazilian flag\" vessel fleet, which will limit opportunities in Brazil for foreign flag vessels, except where highly specialized services are required. In January 2016, we placed one of our newbuild HOSMAX 310 class OSVs into Brazilian registry. We will continue to monitor this market to charter our vessels to Petrobras or other companies operating in that region.\nMarket conditions\nAs of February 17, 2016, we had 17% of our new generation OSV vessel-days contracted for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2016. Our forward OSV contract coverage for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2017 currently stands at 3%. MPSV contract coverage for the fiscal years ending December 31, 2016 and 2017 is currently 5% and 0%, respectively.\nThe principal threat facing all of our markets is the fall in oil prices and resultant reduction in capital spending by our customers.\nOur Vessels\nAll of our current vessels are qualified under the Jones Act to engage in U.S. coastwise trade, except for seven foreign-flagged new generation OSVs, two foreign-flagged well-stimulation vessels and two foreign-flagged MPSVs. As of December 31, 2015, our 32 active new generation OSVs, six MPSVs and four managed OSVs were operating in domestic and international areas as noted in the following table:\nTable 102: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating Areas\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Domestic\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>GoM\n</td> <td>27\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other U.S. coastlines(1)\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>32\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Foreign\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Mexico\n</td> <td>8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Middle East\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Europe\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>10\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Active Vessels(2)\n</td> <td>42\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 103: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 104: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>Includes one owned vessel and four managed vessels that are currently supporting the military.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 105: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(2)\n</td> <td>Excluded from this table are 28 new generation OSVs and one non-core conventional OSV that were stacked as of December 31, 2015.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> OSV Newbuild Program #5. Recently, we announced the expansion of our fifth OSV newbuild program to enhance the four remaining MPSVs to be delivered. These enhancements include additional accommodations, additional ROV workspaces, additional crane lifting capacities and, for the final two MPSVs, a 60 foot mid-body section. Our fifth OSV newbuild program now consists of four 300 class OSVs, five 310 class OSVs, ten 320 class OSVs, three 310 class MPSVs and two 400 class MPSVs. As of February 17, 2016, we had delivered and placed in service 20 vessels under such newbuild program. Delivery of the four remaining vessels under this 24-vessel domestic newbuild program is expected to occur on various dates during 2016 and 2017. We expect to own and operate 62 new generation OSVs as of December 31, 2016, as well as manage four vessels for the U.S. Navy. These aggregate OSV vessel additions result in a projected average new generation OSV fleet complement of 61.9 and 62.0 for fiscal years 2016 and 2017, respectively. With the addition of the four MPSVs, we expect to own and operate eight and ten MPSVs as of December 31, 2016 and 2017, respectively. These MPSV additions result in a projected average MPSV fleet complement of 6.9, 8.7 and 10.0 vessels for the fiscal years 2016, 2017 and 2018, respectively. The aggregate cost of our fifth OSV newbuild program, excluding construction period interest, is expected to be approximately\n$1,335.0 million, approximately 90% of which has already been incurred. For further information regarding our fifth OSV newbuild program, please refer to the Capital Expenditures and Related Commitments section.\nOperating Costs\nOur operating costs are primarily a function of fleet size, areas of operations and utilization levels. The most significant direct operating costs are wages paid to vessel crews, maintenance and repairs, and marine insurance. Because most of these expenses are incurred regardless of vessel utilization, our direct operating costs as a percentage of revenues may fluctuate considerably with changes in dayrates and utilization. Since October 1, 2014, we have stacked 33 vessels. By removing these vessels from our active operating fleet, we have been able to significantly reduce our operating costs, including crew costs. If market conditions worsen, we may elect to stack additional vessels. Our fixed operating costs are now spread over 29 owned and operated vessels and four vessels managed for the U.S. Navy.\nIn certain foreign markets in which we operate, we are susceptible to higher operating costs, such as materials and supplies, crew wages, maintenance and repairs, taxes, importation duties, and insurance costs. Difficulties and costs of staffing international operations, including vessel crews, and language and cultural differences generally contribute to a higher cost structure in foreign locations compared to our domestic operations. We may not be able to recover higher international operating costs through higher dayrates charged to our customers. Therefore, when we increase our international complement of vessels, our gross margins may fluctuate depending on the foreign areas of operation and the complement of vessels operating domestically.\nIn addition to the operating costs described above, we incur fixed charges related to the depreciation of our fleet and amortization of costs for routine drydock inspections and maintenance and repairs necessary to ensure compliance with applicable regulations and to maintain certifications for our vessels with the USCG and various classification societies. The aggregate number of drydockings and other repairs undertaken in a given period determines the level of maintenance and repair expenses and marine inspection amortization charges. We capitalize costs incurred for drydock inspection and regulatory compliance and amortize such costs over the period between such drydockings, typically 30 months. Applicable maritime regulations require us to drydock our vessels twice in a five-year period for inspection and routine maintenance and repair. If we undertake a disproportionately large number of drydockings in a particular fiscal period, comparative results may be affected. While we can defer required drydockings of stacked vessels, we will be required to conduct such deferred drydockings prior to such vessels returning to service, which could delay their return to active service.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nOur consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. In many cases, the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by generally accepted accounting principles. In other circumstances, we are required to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that we believe are reasonable based upon available information. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and various other factors that we believe are reasonable based upon the information available. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions. We believe that of our significant accounting policies discussed in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements, the following may involve estimates that are inherently more subjective.\nCarrying Value of Vessels. We depreciate our OSVs and MPSVs over estimated useful lives of 25 years each. Salvage value for our new generation marine equipment is typically 25% of the originally recorded cost for these asset types. In assigning depreciable lives to these assets, we have considered the effects of both physical deterioration largely caused by wear and tear due to operating use and other economic and regulatory factors that could impact commercial viability. To date, our experience confirms that these policies are reasonable, although there may be events or changes in circumstances in the future that indicate that recovery of the carrying amount of our vessels might not be possible.\nWe presently review our vessels for impairment using the following asset groups: New Generation OSVs, MPSVs and Conventional OSV. As of December 31, 2015, we only had one remaining conventional OSV, which remains cold-stacked and has a net book value of only $0.4 million. Management has concluded that these groupings are currently appropriate because our vessels are highly relevant and mobile and are consistent based on the operating and marketing characteristics desired by our customers. When analyzing asset groups for impairment, we consider both historical and projected operating cash flows, operating income, and EBITDA based on current operating environment and future conditions that we can reasonably anticipate, such as inflation or prospective wage costs. These projections are based on, but not limited to, job location, current market dayrates included in recent sales proposals,\nutilization and contract coverage; along with anticipated market drivers, such as drilling rig movements, results of offshore lease sales and discussions with our customers regarding their ongoing drilling plans. We also consider recent vessel sales and recent vessel appraisals.\nIf events or changes in circumstances as set forth above indicate that the asset group's carrying amount may not be recoverable, we would then be required to estimate the undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset group and its eventual disposition. If the sum of the expected future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the vessel, we would be required to reduce the carrying amount to fair value. Examples of events or changes in circumstances that could indicate that the recoverability of the carrying amount of our asset groups should be assessed might include a significant change in regulations such as OPA 90, a significant decrease in the market value of the asset group and current period operating or cash flow losses combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses or a projection or forecast that demonstrates continuing losses associated with the asset group.\nWe reviewed ASC 360 regarding triggering events that would require an impairment analysis and concluded that there were no such events in 2015 or 2014. Our review gave consideration to the current market conditions, which include the recent commodity price decline, a reduction in certain projected capital budgets for our customers and our competitors' filings. While we expect this environment to have a negative impact on vessel utilization and dayrates, we view the deepwater and ultra deepwater projects of our customers, which are the principal markets for our vessel fleet, to be somewhat insulated from short-term commodity price cycles compared to onshore shale and shallow shelf offshore exploration and production activities. However, continued commodity price declines or protracted extensions of the current price cycle could result in additional delays or cancellations of deepwater projects, which may adversely affect long-term fleet utilization. We recently updated our analysis of whether a triggering event has occurred and we concluded that one has not. While the Company has historically operated its vessels predominately in the GoM, we will continue to deploy vessels to international markets as conditions warrant. Our technologically advanced vessels are capable of working in and are effectively mobilized to different markets, so neither the geographic location of vessels, nor reduced drilling activity in a particular exploration area is considered on its own as an impairment trigger. In addition, since we consider cyclicality and volatility to be normal for our industry, we do not consider strategically stacking vessels that we intend to reactivate to be a triggering event. We believe that the fair values of all of our asset groups exceed their carrying values. In order for the fair values of any of our assets to be below their respective carrying values, current and projected effective dayrates would have to be significantly below the lowest levels experienced in the Company's history. In addition, those market conditions would have to be sustained for the remaining economic useful lives of each vessel class, which is also unlikely.\nRecertification Costs. Our vessels are required by regulation to be recertified after certain periods of time. These recertification costs are incurred while the vessel is in drydock where other routine repairs and maintenance are performed and, at times, major replacements and improvements are performed. We expense routine repairs and maintenance as they are incurred. Recertification costs can be accounted for in one of two ways: (1) defer and amortize or (2) expense as incurred. We defer and amortize recertification costs over the length of time that the recertification is expected to last, which is generally 30 months. Major replacements and improvements, which extend the vessel's economic useful life or functional operating capability, are capitalized and depreciated over the vessel's remaining economic useful life. Inherent in this process are judgments we make regarding whether the specific cost incurred is capitalizable and the period that the incurred cost will benefit.\nMobilization Costs. Vessels will routinely move to and from international and domestic operating areas. Mobilization costs associated with relocating vessels typically include fuel, crew costs, vessel modifications, materials and supplies, importation taxes or other pre-positioning expenses required by the customer. The extent of mobilization costs incurred to relocate a vessel is directly related to the customer contract terms and area of operation. Some of our charter agreements provide for us to recover mobilization costs through billings to our customers. Unless mobilization costs are rebillable to customers, we expense these costs as incurred.\nRevenue Recognition. We charter our vessels to customers under time charters based on a daily rate of hire and recognize revenue as earned on a daily basis during the contract period of the specific vessel.\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts. Our customers are primarily national oil companies, major and independent, domestic and international, oil and gas and oil service companies. Our customers are granted credit on a short-term basis and related credit risks are considered minimal. We usually do not require collateral. We provide an estimate for uncollectible accounts based primarily on management's judgment. Management uses the relative age of receivable balances, historical losses, current economic conditions and individual evaluations of each customer to make adjustments to the allowance for doubtful accounts. Our historical losses have not been significant. However,\nbecause amounts due from individual customers can be significant, future adjustments to the allowance can be material if one or more individual customer's balances are deemed uncollectible.\nIncome Taxes. We follow accounting standards for income taxes that require the use of the liability method of computing deferred income taxes. Under this method, deferred income taxes are provided for the temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of our assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The assessment of the realization of deferred tax assets, particularly those related to tax net operating loss carryforwards and foreign tax credit carryforwards, involves the use of management's judgment to determine whether it is more likely than not that we will realize such tax benefits in the future prior to their expiration. We continue to review our projected operating results related to the realization of these foreign tax credit carryforwards and if current market conditions persist or worsen through 2018, we may not realize the full benefit of these carryforwards. In addition, each reporting period, we assess and adjust for any significant changes to our liability for unrecognized income tax benefits. We account for any interest and penalties relating to uncertain tax positions in general and administrative expenses.\nStock-Based Compensation Expense. All equity-settled share-based payments to employees and directors, including grants of stock options and restricted stock units, are recognized in the income statement based on their fair values at the date of grant. All cash-settled share-based payments to employees and directors are recognized in the income statement based on their fair values at the end of the reporting period.\nLegal Contingencies. We are involved in a variety of claims, lawsuits, investigations and proceedings, as described in Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements. We determine whether an estimated loss from a contingency should be accrued by assessing whether a loss is deemed probable and can be reasonably estimated. We assess our potential liability by analyzing our litigation and regulatory matters using available information. We develop our views on estimated losses in consultation with outside counsel handling our defense in these matters, which involves an analysis of potential results, assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies. Should developments in any of these matters cause a change in our determination such that we expect an unfavorable outcome and result in the need to recognize a material accrual, or should any of these matters result in a final adverse judgment or be settled for a significant amount, they could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the period or periods in which such change in determination, judgment or settlement occurs.\nResults of Operations\nThe tables below set forth the average dayrates, utilization rates and effective dayrates for our new generation OSVs and the average number and size of such vessels owned during the periods indicated. These vessels generate a substantial portion of our revenues and operating profit. Excluded from the OSV information below is the results of operations for our MPSVs, our shore-base facility, and vessel management services, including the four vessels managed for the U.S. Navy. The Company does not provide average or effective dayrates for its MPSVs. MPSV dayrates are impacted by highly variable customer-required cost-of-sales associated with ancillary equipment and services, such as ROVs, accomodation units and cranes, which are typically recovered through higher dayrates charged to the customer. Due to the fact that each of our MPSVs have a workload capacity and significantly higher income generating potential than each of the Company's new generation OSVs, the utilization and dayrate levels of our MPSVs could have a very large impact on our results of operations. For this reason, our consolidated operating results, on a period-to-period basis, are disproportionately impacted by the level of dayrates and utilization achieved by our six MPSVs.\nTable 106: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Offshore Supply Vessels:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average number of new generation OSVs(1)\n</td> <td>60.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>57.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>50.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average number of active new generation OSVs(2)\n</td> <td>42.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>56.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>50.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average new generation OSV fleet capacity (DWT)\n</td> <td>206,030\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>177,033\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>132,564\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average new generation OSV capacity (DWT)\n</td> <td>3,436\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,076\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,609\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average new generation OSV utilization rate(3)\n</td> <td>54.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>79.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>83.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effective new generation OSV utilization rate(4)\n</td> <td>77.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>80.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>84.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average new generation OSV dayrate(5)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>26,278\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>27,416\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>26,605\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effective dayrate(6)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>14,295\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>21,823\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>22,268\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 107: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 108: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>We owned 60 new generation OSVs as of December 31, 2015.

Revenues for 2015 decreased by $158.7 million, or 25.0%, to $476.1 million compared to $634.8 million for 2014. Our weighted-average active operating fleet for 2015 was approximately 48 vessels compared to 61 vessels for 2014. The decrease in revenues was primarily due to soft market conditions in the GoM, which led to our decision to stack 28 new generation OSVs on various dates between October 1, 2014 and December 31, 2015. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2015, we had an average of 18.0 vessels stacked compared to 0.8 vessels stacked in the prior-year period. This decrease in revenue was partially offset by $54.0 million in revenue earned from the full or partial-period contribution of 14 vessels that were placed in service under our fifth OSV newbuild program since December 2013. Revenue from our MPSV fleet decreased $40.7 million, or 23.2%, for 2015 compared to 2014. Our new generation OSV average dayrates were $26,278 for 2015 compared to $27,416 for 2014, a decrease of $1,138, or 4.2%. Our new generation OSV utilization was 54.4% for 2015 compared to 79.6% for 2014. This decrease in utilization is primarily due to soft market conditions for high-spec OSVs operating in the GoM and the incremental vessels that were stacked during 2015 compared to 2014. Our new generation OSVs incurred 238 days of aggregate downtime for regulatory drydockings and were stacked for an aggregate of 6,587 days during the twelve months ended December 31, 2015. Excluding stacked vessel days, our new generation OSV effective utilization was 77.8% and 80.7% during the twelve months ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Domestic revenues decreased by $162.1 million during 2015 compared to 2014 due to lower dayrates earned by vessels operating in our fleet during the twelve months ended December 31, 2015 and the stacking of vessels in late 2014 through 2015. Foreign revenues increased by $3.3 million primarily due to the full or partial-period contribution of 11 OSVs and two MPSVs that relocated to foreign regions on various dates since 2013. Foreign revenues comprised 31.0% of our total revenues for 2015 compared to 22.8% for 2014.\nOperating expenses. Operating expenses were $219.3 million, a decrease of $77.2 million, or 26.1%, for 2015 compared to $296.5 million for 2014. Operating expenses were driven lower by vessels that were removed from our active fleet count since late 2014, which resulted in a substantial reduction in mariner headcount. This decrease was partially offset by $25.7 million of operating costs related to the full or partial-period contribution from vessels added to our fleet since December 2013. Aggregate cash operating expenses are projected to be in the range of $170.0 million to $185.0 million for 2016. Such cash operating expense estimate is exclusive of any additional repositioning expenses we may incur in connection with the potential relocation of more of our vessels into international markets or back to the GoM, and any customer-required cost-of-sales related to future contract fixtures that are typically recovered through higher dayrates.\nDepreciation and Amortization. Depreciation and amortization expense was $6.4 million, or 5.6%, lower for 2015 compared to 2014. Depreciation increased by $11.3 million primarily due to the contribution of 14 vessels that were placed in service on various dates since December 2013. The depreciation increase was more than offset by a decrease in amortization expense of $17.7 million, primarily due to $6.8 million of incremental amortization recorded for the accelerated regulatory drydocking of vessels during 2014 along with lower amortization from the sale of four vessels to the U.S. Navy in 2015 and the deferral of planned drydockings for stacked vessels. Depreciation and amortization expense is expected to continue to increase from current levels as the vessels under our current newbuild program are placed in service and when any newly constructed vessels undergo their initial 30-month and 60-month recertifications.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses. General and administrative expenses of $48.3 million decreased by $5.9 million, or 11.0%, during 2015 compared to 2014. The decrease in G&A expenses was primarily due to lower shoreside compensation and short-term incentive compensation expense and a reduction in bad debt reserves. General and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues were 10.1% for 2015 compared to 8.5% for 2014. Our general and administrative expenses are expected to be in the approximate range of $47.0 to $52.0 million for 2016.\nGain on Sale of Assets. During 2015, we completed the sale of four 250EDF class OSVs, the HOS Arrowhead, the HOS Black Powder, the HOS Eagleview and the HOS Westwind, to the U.S. Navy for cash consideration of $152.0 million. The sale resulted in a pre-tax gain of approximately $44.1 million ($27.6 million after-tax or $0.76 per diluted share). During 2014, we sold a non-core 220 class OSV that resulted in an aggregate gain of approximately $0.8 million ($0.5 million after-tax or $0.01 per diluted share).\nOperating Income. Operating income decreased by $25.9 million to $143.5 million during 2015 compared to 2014 for the reasons discussed above. Operating income as a percentage of revenues was 30.2% for 2015 compared to 26.7% for 2014. Excluding the gain on sale of assets, our operating income for 2015 would have been $99.5 million, or 20.9% of revenues and for 2014 would have been $168.6 million, or 26.6% of revenues.\nInterest Expense. Interest expense increased $8.8 million during 2015 compared to 2014 primarily due to capitalizing a lower percentage of interest compared to the prior-year period. During 2015, we capitalized interest of $24.7 million, or roughly 38% of our total interest costs, compared to capitalized interest of $33.2 million, or roughly 52% of our total interest costs, for 2014.\nInterest Income. Interest income increased by $0.4 million to $1.5 million for 2015 compared to $1.1 million for 2014. Our average cash balance decreased to $269.9 million for 2015 compared to $307.9 million for 2014. The average interest rate earned on our invested cash balances was approximately 0.5% and 0.4% during the fiscal years ended December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively. The decrease in average cash balance was primarily due to cash outflows associated with our fifth OSV newbuild program in 2014 and 2015 and lower revenue earned by active vessels operating in our fleet. These decreases were partially offset by cash inflows from the sale of four vessels to the U.S. Navy in 2015.\nIncome Tax Expense. Our effective tax rate was 37.3% for 2015 and 2014. During 2015 and 2014, our income tax expense primarily consisted of deferred taxes. Our income tax rate is different from the federal statutory rate primarily due to expected state tax liabilities and items not deductible for federal income tax purposes.\nIncome from Continuing Operations. Operating performance decreased year-over-year by $21.1 million for reported income from continuing operations of $66.8 million for 2015 compared to $87.9 million for 2014. Excluding the gain on sale of assets from both periods presented, income from continuing operations would have been $39.2 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015 compared to $87.4 million for the same period in 2014. This decrease in income from continuing operations for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015 was primarily driven by lower revenues due to soft market conditions discussed above that were partially offset by the gain on the sale of four vessels to the U.S. Navy in 2015.\nYEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2014 COMPARED TO YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2013\nSummarized financial information for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, is shown below in the following table (in thousands, except percentage changes):\nTable 116: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase (Decrease)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$ Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenues:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Domestic\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>490,314\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>415,898\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>74,416\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Foreign\n</td> <td>144,479\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>132,247\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12,232\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>634,793\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>548,145\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>86,648\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating expenses\n</td> <td>296,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>239,239\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>57,261\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>115,450\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>85,962\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>29,488\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>34.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General and administrative expenses\n</td> <td>54,245\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>53,428\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>817\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>466,195\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>378,629\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>87,566\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain on sale of assets\n</td> <td>822\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,587\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(765\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(48.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income\n</td> <td>169,420\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>171,103\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,683\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss on early extinguishment of debt\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25,776\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(25,776\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(100.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense\n</td> <td>30,733\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>47,352\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(16,619\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(35.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest income\n</td> <td>1,086\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,515\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,429\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(56.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax expense\n</td> <td>52,367\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>36,320\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16,047\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>44.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income from continuing operations\n</td> <td>87,907\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>64,078\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23,829\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>37.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income from discontinued operations, net of tax\n</td> <td>618\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>47,315\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(46,697\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(98.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>88,525\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>111,393\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(22,868\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(20.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 117: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenues. Revenues for 2014 increased by $86.6 million, or 15.8%, to $634.8 million compared to $548.1 million for 2013. Our weighted-average active operating fleet for 2014 was approximately 61 vessels compared to 54 vessels for 2013. These higher revenues primarily resulted from the full or partial-period contribution of 20 vessels that were placed in service under our fifth OSV newbuild program since 2013 or returned to service under our 200 class OSV retrofit program since 2012 and, to a lesser extent, an increase in revenues from the MPSV fleet. Vessels placed in-service under our fifth OSV newbuild program and our OSV retrofit program accounted for increases of $102.5 million and $17.7 million, respectively, in revenues during 2014 compared to 2013. Revenue from our MPSVs that were in service during each of the twelve months ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 increased by $35.3 million, or 27.5%, primarily due to higher spot dayrates earned by one of our MPSVs performing flotel services in the GoM. These higher revenues were partially offset by a $73.4 million decrease in revenue for our remaining vessels that were in service during each of the twelve months ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 due to soft market conditions and 128 incremental days out-of-service for regulatory drydockings compared to 2013. Our new generation OSV average dayrates were $27,416 for 2014 compared to $26,605 for 2013, an increase of $811, or 3.0%. Our new generation OSV utilization was 79.6% for 2014 compared to 83.7% for 2013. This decrease in utilization was primarily due to soft spot market conditions for our high-spec OSVs operating in the GoM and the incremental vessel-days out-of-service for regulatory drydockings during 2014 compared to 2013. Domestic revenues increased by $74.4 million during 2014 due to the full or partial-period contribution of 14 vessels added to our fleet under our fifth OSV newbuild program on various dates during 2013 and 2014. Foreign revenues increased by $12.2 million primarily due to the relocation of an MPSV from the GoM to foreign markets during 2014. Foreign revenues comprised 22.8% of our total revenues for 2014 compared to 24.1% for 2013.\nOperating expenses. Operating expenses were $296.5 million, an increase of $57.3 million, or 23.9%, for 2014 compared to $239.2 million for 2013. Newly constructed vessels under our fifth OSV newbuild program and upgraded vessels placed in service under our 200 class OSV retrofit program during 2013 and 2014 accounted for approximately $55.0 million of the higher operating costs.\nDepreciation and Amortization. Depreciation and amortization expense was $29.5 million, or 34.3%, higher for 2014 compared to 2013. This increase is primarily due to the full or partial-period contribution of 14 newbuild vessels that were placed in service on various dates during 2013 and 2014, as well as the higher cost basis of six vessels\nredelivered under our 200 class OSV retrofit program in 2013. The increase in amortization is primarily due to a higher per-vessel average in shipyard costs for vessel regulatory drydockings given the shift in our fleet mix to a higher percentage of much larger high-spec vessels and, to a lesser extent, incremental amortization recorded for the accelerated regulatory drydocking of vessels during 2014.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses. General and administrative expenses of $54.2 million increased by $0.8 million, or 1.5%, during 2014 compared to 2013. This increase in G&A expenses was primarily the result of the growth of our shoreside support team related to our on-going newbuild program and expanding international operations. This increase was partially offset due to the valuation of our stock-based compensation expense, which was driven lower by the recent decline in our stock price, and lower shoreside incentive compensation expense. General and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues were 8.5% for 2014 compared to 9.7% for 2013.\nGain on Sale of Assets. During 2014, we sold a non-core 220 class OSV that resulted in an aggregate gain of approximately $0.8 million ($0.5 million after-tax or $0.01 per diluted share). During 2013, we sold certain non-core marine assets, including two 220 class OSVs, that resulted in an aggregate gain of approximately $1.6 million ($1.0 million after-tax or $0.03 per diluted share).\nOperating Income. Operating income decreased by $1.7 million to $169.4 million during 2014 compared to 2013 for the reasons discussed above. Operating income as a percentage of revenues was 26.7% for 2014 compared to 31.2% for 2013.\nLoss on Early Extinguishment of Debt. On March 14, 2013, we commenced a cash tender offer for all of the $250.0 million in aggregate principal amount of our 2017 senior notes. Approximately 94% of such senior notes were validly tendered during the designated tender period, which ended on March 27, 2013. The remaining 2017 senior notes were redeemed on May 13, 2013. During 2013, we recorded a loss on early extinguishment of debt of approximately $25.8 million ($16.1 million after-tax or $0.44 per diluted share), which was comprised of the tender offer costs, the write-off of unamortized financing costs and original issue discount, and a bond redemption premium. There was no such transaction in 2014.\nInterest Expense. Interest expense decreased $16.6 million during 2014 compared to 2013 primarily due to lower interest expense resulting from the November 2013 retirement of our convertible senior notes due 2026. During 2014, we capitalized interest of $33.2 million, or roughly 52% of our total interest costs, compared to capitalized interest of $31.2 million, or roughly 40% of our total interest costs, for 2013.\nInterest Income. Interest income decreased by $1.4 million to $1.1 million for 2014 compared to $2.5 million for 2013. Our average cash balance decreased to $307.9 million for 2014 compared to $663.4 million for 2013. The average interest rate earned on our invested cash balances was approximately 0.4% during the fiscal years ended December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013. The decrease in average cash balance was due to cash outflows associated with our fifth OSV newbuild program in 2014 and the retirement of all of our outstanding $250 million aggregate principal amount of 2026 convertible senior notes in November 2013.\nIncome Tax Expense. Our effective tax rate was 37.3% and 36.2% for 2014 and 2013, respectively. During 2014, our income tax expense primarily consisted of deferred taxes. Our income tax rate is different from the federal statutory rate primarily due to expected state tax liabilities and items not deductible for federal income tax purposes. The lower tax rate for 2013 was primarily attributable to the tax benefit taken in 2013 in connection with the re-pricing of the net deferred tax liabilities on the balance sheet as a result of the sale of the Downstream segment.\nIncome from Continuing Operations. Operating performance increased year-over-year by $23.8 million for reported income from continuing operations of $87.9 million for 2014 compared to $64.1 million for 2013. Excluding the after-tax loss on early extinguishment of debt, income from continuing operations would have been $80.2 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2013 compared to $87.9 million for the same period in 2014. This increase in income from continuing operations for 2014 was primarily due to higher operating income based on the full or partial- period contribution of 14 vessels placed in service under our fifth OSV newbuild program discussed above and a $15.2 million decrease in net interest expense. Income from continuing operations for 2013 was adversely impacted by a $25.8 million pre-tax loss on early extinguishment of debt in connection with the tender offer purchase and redemption of our 2017 senior notes.\nDiscontinued Operations. On August 29, 2013, we closed the sale of substantially all of our Downstream assets to Genesis Marine, LLC. As a result of this transaction, the current and historical operating results of these vessels for 2014 and 2013 have been restated and reflected as discontinued operations. Excluded from the sale were three older,\nlower-horsepower tugs considered to be non-core assets. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2014, these three tugs were sold for net cash proceeds of $1.6 million. These sales resulted in a pre-tax gain of approximately $0.9 million ($0.6 million after-tax or $0.02 per diluted share. Operating income during 2013 for this segment included a gain on sale of assets of approximately $60.0 million ($38.1 million after-tax or $1.04 per diluted share).\nThe following table details financial highlights for fiscal years ended December 31, 2014, and 2013, respectively, related to our Downstream segment that was sold in August 2013 (in thousands):\nTable 118: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenue\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>12\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>43,318\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain on sale of assets\n</td> <td>867\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>60,076\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income\n</td> <td>555\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>74,278\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income from discontinued operations, net of tax\n</td> <td>618\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>47,315\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur capital requirements have historically been financed with cash flows from operations, proceeds from issuances of our debt and common equity securities, borrowings under our credit facilities and cash received from the sale of assets. We require capital to fund on-going operations, remaining obligations under our expanded fifth OSV newbuild program, vessel recertifications, discretionary capital expenditures and debt service and may require capital to fund potential future vessel construction, retrofit or conversion projects, acquisitions or stock repurchases. The nature of our capital requirements and the types of our financing sources are not expected to change significantly for 2016.\nWe have reviewed all of our debt agreements as well as our liquidity position and projected future cash needs. Despite volatility in commodity markets, we remain confident in our current financial position, the strength of our balance sheet and the short- and long-term viability of our business model. To date, our liquidity has been impacted by such volatility through lower than normal cash flow from operations. However, including cash on-hand, we expect to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to cover all of our growth capital expenditures for the remaining four HOSMAX vessels under construction, commercial-related capital expenditures, and all of our annually recurring cash debt service, maintenance capital expenditures and cash income taxes through the completion of the newbuild program, as well as discretionary share repurchases from time to time, without ever having to use our currently undrawn revolving credit facility. We also believe that we will be able to fund all of the deferred maintenance capital expenditures that will be required upon reactivation of our stacked vessels when market conditions improve without having to draw on such facility. We have three tranches of funded unsecured debt outstanding that mature in fiscal years 2019, 2020 and 2021, respectively.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had total cash and cash equivalents of $259.8 million. We also have a $300 million revolving credit facility, expandable up to $500 million, which is undrawn as of February 26, 2016. On February 6, 2015, we amended and extended the maturity of our existing revolving credit facility to February 2020, provided that, if the 2019 convertible senior notes remain outstanding on March 1, 2019, the Company is required to maintain a specified minimum liquidity level until after the redemption or refinancing of the convertible senior notes, which mature on September 1, 2019. As of December 31, 2015, we had posted letters of credit for $0.5 million and had $299.5 million of credit available under our revolving credit facility. The full undrawn credit amount of such facility is available for all uses of proceeds, including working capital, if necessary. However, the primary intended use of the facility is the potential future construction or acquisition of assets that generate additional EBITDA.\nOn October 28, 2014, our Board of Directors authorized us to repurchase up to $150 million in shares of our common stock from time to time, $25 million of which was used to buy-back 891,396 shares during the fourth quarter of 2014. There were no such repurchases during the twelve months ended December 31, 2015. Any future repurchases under this program will be funded from our cash on-hand, cash flow from operations and/or cash proceeds from the divestiture of non-core assets. While we have an authorized share repurchase program, we will continue to prioritize our usage of cash appropriate to the current market cycle.\nAlthough we expect to continue generating positive working capital through our operations, events beyond our control, such as sustained low prices for oil and natural gas, a further significant decline in such commodity prices, renewed regulatory-driven delays in the issuance of drilling plans and permits in the GoM, declines in expenditures for exploration, development and production activity, any extended reduction in domestic consumption of refined\npetroleum products and other reasons discussed under the Forward Looking Statements on page ii and \"Item 1A - Risk Factors\" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, may affect our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Should such need for additional financing arise, we may not be able to access the capital markets on attractive terms at that time or otherwise obtain sufficient capital to meet our maturing debt obligations or finance growth opportunities that may arise. We will continue to closely monitor our liquidity position, as well as the state of the global capital and credit markets. See further discussion in the Contractual Obligations section below.\nCash Flows\nOperating Activities. We rely primarily on cash flows from operations to provide working capital for current and future operations. Cash flows from operating activities were $215.8 million in 2015, $163.1 million in 2014, and $207.1 million in 2013. Operating cash flows in 2015 were favorably impacted by a reduction in outstanding accounts receivable balances combined with lower cash outflows for regulatory drydocking expenses compared to the prior year, partially offset by lower cash inflows from soft market conditions. Cash flows from operations for 2015 reflect full or partial-period contributions from 14 vessels that were placed in service under our fifth OSV newbuild program on various dates during 2014 and 2015. Operating cash flows in 2014 included the impact of $43.6 million of costs related to regulatory recertifications for our vessels. Operating cash flows in 2014 were unfavorably affected by the soft market conditions for our OSVs operating in the GoM, partially offset by the full or partial-period contributions from 14 vessels that were placed in service under our fifth OSV newbuild program on various dates during 2013 and 2014. Operating cash flows in 2013 were favorably affected by the increased dayrates for our high-spec OSVs and MPSVs operating in the GoM and, to a lesser extent, the partial-period contributions from four new generation OSVs that were delivered under our fifth OSV newbuild program.\nInvesting Activities. Net cash used in investing activities was $141.3 million in 2015, $401.5 million in 2014, and $526.6 million in 2013. Cash utilized in 2015 consisted of construction costs incurred for our fifth OSV newbuild program partially offset by $152.0 million in aggregate proceeds from the sale of four 250EDF class OSVs to the U.S. Navy. The proceeds from the asset sale have been reinvested in the construction of vessels under our fifth OSV newbuild program. Cash utilized during 2014 primarily consisted of construction costs incurred for our fifth OSV newbuild program and capital improvements made to our existing operating fleet, partially offset by $7.2 million in aggregate net cash proceeds from the sale of non-core assets. Cash utilized during 2013 primarily consisted of construction costs incurred for our fifth OSV newbuild program and capital improvements made to our existing operating fleet, partially offset by $16.0 million in aggregate net cash proceeds from the sale of non-core assets.\nFinancing Activities. Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities was $1.0 million in 2015, $(19.7) million in 2014, and $(61.3) million in 2013. Net cash provided by financing activities in 2015 resulted from net proceeds from common shares issued pursuant to our employee stock-based incentive plan, partially offset by deferred financing costs related to the amendment and extension of our existing $300 million revolving credit facility. Net cash used in financing activities for 2014 primarily resulted from the repurchase of our common stock. See Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the common stock repurchase. Net cash used in financing activities for 2013 primarily resulted from the repurchase and retirement of our 2017 senior notes and the redemption of our 2026 convertible senior notes. These outflows were partially offset by the issuance of our 2021 senior notes.\nOn March 14, 2013, we commenced a tender offer and solicitation of consents relating to the repurchase of our existing 2017 senior notes. The tender offer expired on April 10, 2013. On March 28, 2013, we also completed the private placement of $450 million of 2021 senior notes, resulting in offering proceeds of approximately $442.4 million, net of transaction costs. In connection with the tender offer, related consent solicitation, and related redemption, we used $269.3 million of such proceeds to repurchase all of our outstanding $250 million aggregate principal amount of 2017 senior notes. As a result of the repurchase of the 2017 senior notes, we recorded a pre-tax loss on early extinguishment of debt of $25.8 million ($16.1 million after-tax or $0.44 per diluted share).\nOn November 15, 2013, we completed the conversion and redemption of all of our outstanding $250 million aggregate principal amount of 2026 convertible senior notes. We elected to redeem the 2026 convertible senior notes on November 15, 2013, or the Redemption Date, at a redemption price of 100% of the principal amount thereof and accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the Redemption Date. Holders of approximately $249.6 million in aggregate principal amount of the 2026 convertible senior notes elected to convert prior to the previously announced redemption date of November 15, 2013. The conversions of the 2026 convertible senior notes were settled based on the applicable conversion rate of 20.6260 shares of our common stock per $1,000 principal amount of notes, which equates to a conversion price of $48.48 per share, and on the volume-weighted average price of our common stock during the Observation Period (as defined in the Indenture governing the 2026 convertible senior notes) of October 8,\n2013 through November 11, 2013. We satisfied our conversion obligations to holders by paying cash equal to the aggregate principal amount of the 2026 convertible senior notes converted and delivering shares of our common stock in settlement of all conversion obligations in excess of the principal amount (except that we paid cash in lieu of issuing fractional shares). In total, we delivered 728,411 shares of our common stock to the converting holders, which were provided to us by the counterparties to the previously disclosed convertible note hedge transactions entered into in 2006 concurrently with the pricing of the 2026 convertible senior notes. This prevented the equity dilution that would otherwise have resulted from the share delivery requirements of the conversion. The number of shares of our common stock outstanding after the conversion was the same as immediately prior to the conversion. The remaining $0.4 million in aggregate principal amount of the 2026 convertible senior notes was redeemed on November 15, 2013 at a redemption price of 100% of the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the Redemption Date. The cash payment obligations related to the conversion and redemption were funded with cash on-hand.\nDiscontinued Operations. Net cash provided by discontinued operations was $4.0 million in 2014 and $244.1 million in 2013. Net cash provided by discontinued operations in 2014 primarily resulted from the sale of our final three older, lower-horsepower tugs. Net cash provided by discontinued operations in 2013 primarily resulted from the sale of substantially all of the assets related to the Downstream segment to Genesis Marine, LLC for approximately $230 million in gross cash proceeds. See Note 13 for further discussion regarding Discontinued Operations. The proceeds from the asset sale have been reinvested in the construction of vessels under our fifth OSV newbuild program.\nCommitments and Contractual Obligations\nThe following table sets forth our aggregate contractual obligations as of December 31, 2015 (in thousands).\nTable 119: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Contractual Obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Less than\n1 Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1-3 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3-5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Thereafter\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Vessel construction commitments(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>133,292\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>86,358\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>46,934\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>5.000% senior notes due 2021(2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>450,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>450,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>5.875% senior notes due 2020(3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>375,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>375,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>1.500% convertible senior notes due 2019(4)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>300,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>300,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest payments(5)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>240,891\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>49,031\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>98,063\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>82,547\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>11,250\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating leases(6)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>39,790\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,032\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,710\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,862\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>27,186\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,538,973\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>138,421\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>149,707\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>762,409\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>488,436\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 120: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 121: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>Vessel construction commitments reflect contractual milestone payments for our fifth OSV newbuild program.

The $300.0 million revolving credit facility remains undrawn as of February 26, 2016. With the revolving credit facility, we have the option of borrowing at a variable rate of interest equal to (i) London Interbank Offered Rate, or LIBOR, plus a margin of 2.0% to 3.0% or (ii) the greatest of the Prime Rate, the Federal Funds Effective Rate plus 1/2 of 1% or LIBOR, plus 1.0%; plus in each case an applicable margin. The applicable margin for each base rate is determined by a pricing grid, which is based on a new total debt-to-capitalization ratio, as defined in the credit agreement governing the revolving credit facility, as amended. The applicable LIBOR margin for the amended revolving credit facility ranges from 200 to 300 basis points. Unused commitment fees are payable quarterly at the annual rate of 37.5 to 50.0 basis points of the unused portion of the borrowing base of the new revolving credit facility, based on the defined total debt-to-capitalization ratio. For additional information with respect to our revolving credit facility, our 2020 senior notes, our 2021 senior notes, and our 2019 convertible senior notes, please refer to Note 6 of our consolidated financial statements included herein.\nThe credit agreement governing the revolving credit facility and the indentures governing our 2020 senior notes and 2021 senior notes impose certain operating and financial restrictions on us. Such restrictions affect, and in many cases limit or prohibit, among other things, our ability to incur additional indebtedness, make capital expenditures, redeem equity, create liens, sell assets and make dividend or other restricted payments. Based on our financial ratios for the year ended December 31, 2015, the full amount of the undrawn borrowing base under our revolving credit facility is available to us for all uses of proceeds, including working capital, if necessary. For the quarter ended December 31, 2015, we were in compliance with all of our debt covenants. We continuously review our debt covenants and report to our lenders our compliance with financial ratios on a quarterly basis. We also consider such covenants in evaluating transactions that will have an effect on our financial ratios.\nCapital Expenditures and Related Commitments\nThe following table sets forth the amounts incurred for our fifth OSV newbuild program, before construction period interest, during the year ended December 31, 2015 and since such program's inception, as well as the estimated total project costs for such program (in millions):\nTable 130: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>For the Year\nEnded\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Incurred\nSince\nInception\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Estimated\nProgram\nTotals(1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Projected\nDelivery\nDates(1)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Growth Capital Expenditures:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>OSV Newbuild Program #5(2)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>169.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,201.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,335.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2Q2013-4Q2017\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 131: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 132: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1)\n</td> <td>Estimated Program Totals and Projected Delivery Dates are based on internal estimates and are subject to change due to delays and possible cost overruns inherent in any large construction project, including, without limitations, shortages of equipment, lack of shipyard availability, unforeseen engineering problems, work stoppages, weather interference, unanticipated cost increases, the inability to obtain necessary certifications and approvals and shortages of materials, component equipment or skilled labor.

and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our historical consolidated financial statements and their notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our current views with respect to future events and financial performance. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements or as a result of certain factors such as those set forth in our Forward Looking Statements disclaimer on page ii of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nGeneral\nDuring 2015, oil prices have remained in a trading range of $35 to $65 per barrel and an average of $49 with a more recent price in the $28 to $40 range. The drop in oil price is due to surplus oil, driven in part by a significant rise in U.S. shale oil production as well as other previously unavailable sources of supply and OPEC suppliers in the Middle East and Russia not reducing their output. In addition, economic weakness in many regions of the world, notably Europe and China, has reduced the previously expected oil consumption growth rate. As a result of lower oil prices, major and independent oil companies with deepwater operations have significantly reduced their capital spending budgets, which are the principal demand drivers for our services. Less spending by our customers combined with a global oversupply of OSVs, including high-spec OSVs in our core markets, for the current market conditions, have resulted in reductions in both our dayrates and utilization.\nWe believe that the long-term nature of deepwater projects insulates them, somewhat, from a short-term fall in oil prices and that many sanctioned or on-going projects will proceed. However, deepwater activities will be affected by lower prices, even if they are affected less than other activities. We have experienced and continue to experience requests by our deepwater customers for price reductions in order to help mitigate the impact that lower prices are having and will continue to have on oil company operating results and cashflows. In addition, sustained low prices have caused un-sanctioned projects to be delayed or cancelled altogether, which could be manifested in less activity later, even if oil prices recover. Many of our operations are in support of deepwater projects that are in their final stages or of projects that do not involve deepwater and are more susceptible to immediate wind-down. We cannot predict whether, to what extent, or when oil prices will improve.\nIn the GoM, 18 high-spec OSVs have been delivered into the domestic market during 2015, including five of our own. We expect an additional 18 high-spec OSVs to be delivered into domestic service during 2016 and 2017. We do not anticipate significant growth in the supply of high-spec OSVs beyond the currently anticipated level of 210 of such vessels by the first quarter of 2017. During the fourth quarter of 2015, there was an average of roughly 48 floating rigs available in the GoM, while an average of 39 were working. As of February 17, 2016, there were 50 rigs available and 35 were working. However, ten floating rigs have contracts that will expire during 2016 and one rig is scheduled to leave the region. We do not know whether the remaining rigs will receive contract renewals for operations in the GoM. We expect three new rigs to arrive in the GoM during 2016. Once a rig arrives in the GoM, it can take several months to commence work and, therefore, we do not know the timing of when operations of newly arrived rigs will begin. Given these market conditions, we anticipate our average dayrates and utilization levels to be adversely affected compared to our 2015 and 2014 results. However, the GoM is one of the premier deepwater markets in the world and we are committed to supporting our customers in this market. We feel that once the current supply and demand fundamentals return to normal conditions our results from operations will improve.\nIn recognition of these weak market conditions, we stacked 28 OSVs on various dates from October 1, 2014 through December 31, 2015. Post year-end, we have stacked an additional five new generation OSVs to date. These 33 stacked vessels represent 49% of our fleetwide vessel headcount, but only 33% of our total OSV and MPSV deadweight tonnage. By stacking vessels, we expect to significantly reduce our cash outlays and lower our risk profile; however, we will have fewer revenue-producing units in service that can contribute to our results and contribute cash flows to cover our fixed costs and commitments. We may choose to stack additional vessels should market conditions warrant.\nIn Mexico, while the energy reform continues to progress, questions remain on the timing of the incremental activity expected in the deepwater GoM given the current oil price environment. PEMEX budget reductions have resulted in contract cancellations and slower than expected growth in the market for our vessels in Mexico. We have\nnoticed that PEMEX is reviewing its vessel needs and, in certain circumstances, is not exercising options for vessels that are currently operating in its chartered fleet. We expect that certain of our Mexican-flagged vessels will be affected and will likely be stacked, if not renewed. Nevertheless, we consider Mexico to be a long-term market for our services, especially in light of energy reforms being carried out there. Despite current oil prices, we recently observed improved bidding results from several international companies related to shallow water auctions in Mexico. We will continue to explore opportunities to place additional vessels into Mexico to support PEMEX in its ongoing shallow water activity and non-PEMEX customers in support of future shelf and deepwater activity there. In 2014, PEMEX announced its intention to use only vessels that are less that 15 years old. We and other market participants in Mexico, however, have successfully challenged this restriction, but PEMEX may renew its attempt in the future.\nIn Brazil, Petrobras generally appears to be moving towards an \"all Brazilian flag\" vessel fleet, which will limit opportunities in Brazil for foreign flag vessels, except where highly specialized services are required. In January 2016, we placed one of our newbuild HOSMAX 310 class OSVs into Brazilian registry. We will continue to monitor this market to charter our vessels to Petrobras or other companies operating in that region.\nMarket conditions\nAs of February 17, 2016, we had 17% of our new generation OSV vessel-days contracted for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2016. Our forward OSV contract coverage for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2017 currently stands at 3%. MPSV contract coverage for the fiscal years ending December 31, 2016 and 2017 is currently 5% and 0%, respectively.\nThe principal threat facing all of our markets is the fall in oil prices and resultant reduction in capital spending by our customers.\nOur Vessels\nAll of our current vessels are qualified under the Jones Act to engage in U.S. coastwise trade, except for seven foreign-flagged new generation OSVs, two foreign-flagged well-stimulation vessels and two foreign-flagged MPSVs. As of December 31, 2015, our 32 active new generation OSVs, six MPSVs and four managed OSVs were operating in domestic and international areas as noted in the following table:\n\n \n (1) Includes one owned vessel and four managed vessels that are currently supporting the military. \n (2) Excluded from this table are 28 new generation OSVs and one non-core conventional OSV that were stacked as of December 31, 2015.  OSV Newbuild Program #5. Recently, we announced the expansion of our fifth OSV newbuild program to enhance the four remaining MPSVs to be delivered. These enhancements include additional accommodations, additional ROV workspaces, additional crane lifting capacities and, for the final two MPSVs, a 60 foot mid-body section. Our fifth OSV newbuild program now consists of four 300 class OSVs, five 310 class OSVs, ten 320 class OSVs, three 310 class MPSVs and two 400 class MPSVs. As of February 17, 2016, we had delivered and placed in service 20 vessels under such newbuild program. Delivery of the four remaining vessels under this 24-vessel domestic newbuild program is expected to occur on various dates during 2016 and 2017. We expect to own and operate 62 new generation OSVs as of December 31, 2016, as well as manage four vessels for the U.S. Navy. These aggregate OSV vessel additions result in a projected average new generation OSV fleet complement of 61.9 and 62.0 for fiscal years 2016 and 2017, respectively. With the addition of the four MPSVs, we expect to own and operate eight and ten MPSVs as of December 31, 2016 and 2017, respectively. These MPSV additions result in a projected average MPSV fleet complement of 6.9, 8.7 and 10.0 vessels for the fiscal years 2016, 2017 and 2018, respectively. The aggregate cost of our fifth OSV newbuild program, excluding construction period interest, is expected to be approximately\n$1,335.0 million, approximately 90% of which has already been incurred. For further information regarding our fifth OSV newbuild program, please refer to the Capital Expenditures and Related Commitments section.\nOperating Costs\nOur operating costs are primarily a function of fleet size, areas of operations and utilization levels. The most significant direct operating costs are wages paid to vessel crews, maintenance and repairs, and marine insurance. Because most of these expenses are incurred regardless of vessel utilization, our direct operating costs as a percentage of revenues may fluctuate considerably with changes in dayrates and utilization. Since October 1, 2014, we have stacked 33 vessels. By removing these vessels from our active operating fleet, we have been able to significantly reduce our operating costs, including crew costs. If market conditions worsen, we may elect to stack additional vessels. Our fixed operating costs are now spread over 29 owned and operated vessels and four vessels managed for the U.S. Navy.\nIn certain foreign markets in which we operate, we are susceptible to higher operating costs, such as materials and supplies, crew wages, maintenance and repairs, taxes, importation duties, and insurance costs. Difficulties and costs of staffing international operations, including vessel crews, and language and cultural differences generally contribute to a higher cost structure in foreign locations compared to our domestic operations. We may not be able to recover higher international operating costs through higher dayrates charged to our customers. Therefore, when we increase our international complement of vessels, our gross margins may fluctuate depending on the foreign areas of operation and the complement of vessels operating domestically.\nIn addition to the operating costs described above, we incur fixed charges related to the depreciation of our fleet and amortization of costs for routine drydock inspections and maintenance and repairs necessary to ensure compliance with applicable regulations and to maintain certifications for our vessels with the USCG and various classification societies. The aggregate number of drydockings and other repairs undertaken in a given period determines the level of maintenance and repair expenses and marine inspection amortization charges. We capitalize costs incurred for drydock inspection and regulatory compliance and amortize such costs over the period between such drydockings, typically 30 months. Applicable maritime regulations require us to drydock our vessels twice in a five-year period for inspection and routine maintenance and repair. If we undertake a disproportionately large number of drydockings in a particular fiscal period, comparative results may be affected. While we can defer required drydockings of stacked vessels, we will be required to conduct such deferred drydockings prior to such vessels returning to service, which could delay their return to active service.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nOur consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. In many cases, the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by generally accepted accounting principles. In other circumstances, we are required to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that we believe are reasonable based upon available information. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and various other factors that we believe are reasonable based upon the information available. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions. We believe that of our significant accounting policies discussed in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements, the following may involve estimates that are inherently more subjective.\nCarrying Value of Vessels. We depreciate our OSVs and MPSVs over estimated useful lives of 25 years each. Salvage value for our new generation marine equipment is typically 25% of the originally recorded cost for these asset types. In assigning depreciable lives to these assets, we have considered the effects of both physical deterioration largely caused by wear and tear due to operating use and other economic and regulatory factors that could impact commercial viability. To date, our experience confirms that these policies are reasonable, although there may be events or changes in circumstances in the future that indicate that recovery of the carrying amount of our vessels might not be possible.\nWe presently review our vessels for impairment using the following asset groups: New Generation OSVs, MPSVs and Conventional OSV. As of December 31, 2015, we only had one remaining conventional OSV, which remains cold-stacked and has a net book value of only $0.4 million. Management has concluded that these groupings are currently appropriate because our vessels are highly relevant and mobile and are consistent based on the operating and marketing characteristics desired by our customers. When analyzing asset groups for impairment, we consider both historical and projected operating cash flows, operating income, and EBITDA based on current operating environment and future conditions that we can reasonably anticipate, such as inflation or prospective wage costs. These projections are based on, but not limited to, job location, current market dayrates included in recent sales proposals,\nutilization and contract coverage; along with anticipated market drivers, such as drilling rig movements, results of offshore lease sales and discussions with our customers regarding their ongoing drilling plans. We also consider recent vessel sales and recent vessel appraisals.\nIf events or changes in circumstances as set forth above indicate that the asset group's carrying amount may not be recoverable, we would then be required to estimate the undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset group and its eventual disposition. If the sum of the expected future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the vessel, we would be required to reduce the carrying amount to fair value. Examples of events or changes in circumstances that could indicate that the recoverability of the carrying amount of our asset groups should be assessed might include a significant change in regulations such as OPA 90, a significant decrease in the market value of the asset group and current period operating or cash flow losses combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses or a projection or forecast that demonstrates continuing losses associated with the asset group.\nWe reviewed ASC 360 regarding triggering events that would require an impairment analysis and concluded that there were no such events in 2015 or 2014. Our review gave consideration to the current market conditions, which include the recent commodity price decline, a reduction in certain projected capital budgets for our customers and our competitors' filings. While we expect this environment to have a negative impact on vessel utilization and dayrates, we view the deepwater and ultra deepwater projects of our customers, which are the principal markets for our vessel fleet, to be somewhat insulated from short-term commodity price cycles compared to onshore shale and shallow shelf offshore exploration and production activities. However, continued commodity price declines or protracted extensions of the current price cycle could result in additional delays or cancellations of deepwater projects, which may adversely affect long-term fleet utilization. We recently updated our analysis of whether a triggering event has occurred and we concluded that one has not. While the Company has historically operated its vessels predominately in the GoM, we will continue to deploy vessels to international markets as conditions warrant. Our technologically advanced vessels are capable of working in and are effectively mobilized to different markets, so neither the geographic location of vessels, nor reduced drilling activity in a particular exploration area is considered on its own as an impairment trigger. In addition, since we consider cyclicality and volatility to be normal for our industry, we do not consider strategically stacking vessels that we intend to reactivate to be a triggering event. We believe that the fair values of all of our asset groups exceed their carrying values. In order for the fair values of any of our assets to be below their respective carrying values, current and projected effective dayrates would have to be significantly below the lowest levels experienced in the Company's history. In addition, those market conditions would have to be sustained for the remaining economic useful lives of each vessel class, which is also unlikely.\nRecertification Costs. Our vessels are required by regulation to be recertified after certain periods of time. These recertification costs are incurred while the vessel is in drydock where other routine repairs and maintenance are performed and, at times, major replacements and improvements are performed. We expense routine repairs and maintenance as they are incurred. Recertification costs can be accounted for in one of two ways: (1) defer and amortize or (2) expense as incurred. We defer and amortize recertification costs over the length of time that the recertification is expected to last, which is generally 30 months. Major replacements and improvements, which extend the vessel's economic useful life or functional operating capability, are capitalized and depreciated over the vessel's remaining economic useful life. Inherent in this process are judgments we make regarding whether the specific cost incurred is capitalizable and the period that the incurred cost will benefit.\nMobilization Costs. Vessels will routinely move to and from international and domestic operating areas. Mobilization costs associated with relocating vessels typically include fuel, crew costs, vessel modifications, materials and supplies, importation taxes or other pre-positioning expenses required by the customer. The extent of mobilization costs incurred to relocate a vessel is directly related to the customer contract terms and area of operation. Some of our charter agreements provide for us to recover mobilization costs through billings to our customers. Unless mobilization costs are rebillable to customers, we expense these costs as incurred.\nRevenue Recognition. We charter our vessels to customers under time charters based on a daily rate of hire and recognize revenue as earned on a daily basis during the contract period of the specific vessel.\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts. Our customers are primarily national oil companies, major and independent, domestic and international, oil and gas and oil service companies. Our customers are granted credit on a short-term basis and related credit risks are considered minimal. We usually do not require collateral. We provide an estimate for uncollectible accounts based primarily on management's judgment. Management uses the relative age of receivable balances, historical losses, current economic conditions and individual evaluations of each customer to make adjustments to the allowance for doubtful accounts. Our historical losses have not been significant. However,\nbecause amounts due from individual customers can be significant, future adjustments to the allowance can be material if one or more individual customer's balances are deemed uncollectible.\nIncome Taxes. We follow accounting standards for income taxes that require the use of the liability method of computing deferred income taxes. Under this method, deferred income taxes are provided for the temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of our assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The assessment of the realization of deferred tax assets, particularly those related to tax net operating loss carryforwards and foreign tax credit carryforwards, involves the use of management's judgment to determine whether it is more likely than not that we will realize such tax benefits in the future prior to their expiration. We continue to review our projected operating results related to the realization of these foreign tax credit carryforwards and if current market conditions persist or worsen through 2018, we may not realize the full benefit of these carryforwards. In addition, each reporting period, we assess and adjust for any significant changes to our liability for unrecognized income tax benefits. We account for any interest and penalties relating to uncertain tax positions in general and administrative expenses.\nStock-Based Compensation Expense. All equity-settled share-based payments to employees and directors, including grants of stock options and restricted stock units, are recognized in the income statement based on their fair values at the date of grant. All cash-settled share-based payments to employees and directors are recognized in the income statement based on their fair values at the end of the reporting period.\nLegal Contingencies. We are involved in a variety of claims, lawsuits, investigations and proceedings, as described in Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements. We determine whether an estimated loss from a contingency should be accrued by assessing whether a loss is deemed probable and can be reasonably estimated. We assess our potential liability by analyzing our litigation and regulatory matters using available information. We develop our views on estimated losses in consultation with outside counsel handling our defense in these matters, which involves an analysis of potential results, assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies. Should developments in any of these matters cause a change in our determination such that we expect an unfavorable outcome and result in the need to recognize a material accrual, or should any of these matters result in a final adverse judgment or be settled for a significant amount, they could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the period or periods in which such change in determination, judgment or settlement occurs.\nResults of Operations\nThe tables below set forth the average dayrates, utilization rates and effective dayrates for our new generation OSVs and the average number and size of such vessels owned during the periods indicated. These vessels generate a substantial portion of our revenues and operating profit. Excluded from the OSV information below is the results of operations for our MPSVs, our shore-base facility, and vessel management services, including the four vessels managed for the U.S. Navy. The Company does not provide average or effective dayrates for its MPSVs. MPSV dayrates are impacted by highly variable customer-required cost-of-sales associated with ancillary equipment and services, such as ROVs, accomodation units and cranes, which are typically recovered through higher dayrates charged to the customer. Due to the fact that each of our MPSVs have a workload capacity and significantly higher income generating potential than each of the Company's new generation OSVs, the utilization and dayrate levels of our MPSVs could have a very large impact on our results of operations. For this reason, our consolidated operating results, on a period-to-period basis, are disproportionately impacted by the level of dayrates and utilization achieved by our six MPSVs.\n\n \n (1) We owned 60 new generation OSVs as of December 31, 2015. Our average number of new generation OSVs for the year ended December 31, 2015 reflects the deliveries of certain vessels under our fifth OSV newbuild program. Please refer to Our Vessels on page 6 of this Form 10-K for more information about vessel names and placed in-service dates. Excluded from this data is one conventional OSV that we consider to be a non-core asset. \n (2) In response to weak market conditions, we elected to stack 28 new generation OSVs on various dates since October 2014. Subsequent to year-end, we have stacked an additional five new generation OSVs. Active new generation OSVs represent vessels that are immediately available for service during each respective period. \n (3) Utilization rates are average rates based on a 365-day year. Vessels are considered utilized when they are generating revenues. \n (4) Effective utilization rate is based on a denominator comprised only of vessel-days available for service by the active fleet, which excludes the impact of stacked vessel days. \n (5) Average new generation OSV dayrates represent average revenue per day, which includes charter hire, crewing services and net brokerage revenues, based on the number of days during the period that the OSVs generated revenues. \n (6) Effective dayrate represents the average dayrate multiplied by the average utilization rate. \nYEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2015 COMPARED TO YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2014\nSummarized financial information for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, is shown below in the following table (in thousands, except percentage changes):\n\n \nRevenues. Revenues for 2015 decreased by $158.7 million, or 25.0%, to $476.1 million compared to $634.8 million for 2014. Our weighted-average active operating fleet for 2015 was approximately 48 vessels compared to 61 vessels for 2014. The decrease in revenues was primarily due to soft market conditions in the GoM, which led to our decision to stack 28 new generation OSVs on various dates between October 1, 2014 and December 31, 2015. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2015, we had an average of 18.0 vessels stacked compared to 0.8 vessels stacked in the prior-year period. This decrease in revenue was partially offset by $54.0 million in revenue earned from the full or partial-period contribution of 14 vessels that were placed in service under our fifth OSV newbuild program since December 2013. Revenue from our MPSV fleet decreased $40.7 million, or 23.2%, for 2015 compared to 2014. Our new generation OSV average dayrates were $26,278 for 2015 compared to $27,416 for 2014, a decrease of $1,138, or 4.2%. Our new generation OSV utilization was 54.4% for 2015 compared to 79.6% for 2014. This decrease in utilization is primarily due to soft market conditions for high-spec OSVs operating in the GoM and the incremental vessels that were stacked during 2015 compared to 2014. Our new generation OSVs incurred 238 days of aggregate downtime for regulatory drydockings and were stacked for an aggregate of 6,587 days during the twelve months ended December 31, 2015. Excluding stacked vessel days, our new generation OSV effective utilization was 77.8% and 80.7% during the twelve months ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Domestic revenues decreased by $162.1 million during 2015 compared to 2014 due to lower dayrates earned by vessels operating in our fleet during the twelve months ended December 31, 2015 and the stacking of vessels in late 2014 through 2015. Foreign revenues increased by $3.3 million primarily due to the full or partial-period contribution of 11 OSVs and two MPSVs that relocated to foreign regions on various dates since 2013. Foreign revenues comprised 31.0% of our total revenues for 2015 compared to 22.8% for 2014.\nOperating expenses. Operating expenses were $219.3 million, a decrease of $77.2 million, or 26.1%, for 2015 compared to $296.5 million for 2014. Operating expenses were driven lower by vessels that were removed from our active fleet count since late 2014, which resulted in a substantial reduction in mariner headcount. This decrease was partially offset by $25.7 million of operating costs related to the full or partial-period contribution from vessels added to our fleet since December 2013. Aggregate cash operating expenses are projected to be in the range of $170.0 million to $185.0 million for 2016. Such cash operating expense estimate is exclusive of any additional repositioning expenses we may incur in connection with the potential relocation of more of our vessels into international markets or back to the GoM, and any customer-required cost-of-sales related to future contract fixtures that are typically recovered through higher dayrates.\nDepreciation and Amortization. Depreciation and amortization expense was $6.4 million, or 5.6%, lower for 2015 compared to 2014. Depreciation increased by $11.3 million primarily due to the contribution of 14 vessels that were placed in service on various dates since December 2013. The depreciation increase was more than offset by a decrease in amortization expense of $17.7 million, primarily due to $6.8 million of incremental amortization recorded for the accelerated regulatory drydocking of vessels during 2014 along with lower amortization from the sale of four vessels to the U.S. Navy in 2015 and the deferral of planned drydockings for stacked vessels. Depreciation and amortization expense is expected to continue to increase from current levels as the vessels under our current newbuild program are placed in service and when any newly constructed vessels undergo their initial 30-month and 60-month recertifications.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses. General and administrative expenses of $48.3 million decreased by $5.9 million, or 11.0%, during 2015 compared to 2014. The decrease in G&A expenses was primarily due to lower shoreside compensation and short-term incentive compensation expense and a reduction in bad debt reserves. General and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues were 10.1% for 2015 compared to 8.5% for 2014. Our general and administrative expenses are expected to be in the approximate range of $47.0 to $52.0 million for 2016.\nGain on Sale of Assets. During 2015, we completed the sale of four 250EDF class OSVs, the HOS Arrowhead, the HOS Black Powder, the HOS Eagleview and the HOS Westwind, to the U.S. Navy for cash consideration of $152.0 million. The sale resulted in a pre-tax gain of approximately $44.1 million ($27.6 million after-tax or $0.76 per diluted share). During 2014, we sold a non-core 220 class OSV that resulted in an aggregate gain of approximately $0.8 million ($0.5 million after-tax or $0.01 per diluted share).\nOperating Income. Operating income decreased by $25.9 million to $143.5 million during 2015 compared to 2014 for the reasons discussed above. Operating income as a percentage of revenues was 30.2% for 2015 compared to 26.7% for 2014. Excluding the gain on sale of assets, our operating income for 2015 would have been $99.5 million, or 20.9% of revenues and for 2014 would have been $168.6 million, or 26.6% of revenues.\nInterest Expense. Interest expense increased $8.8 million during 2015 compared to 2014 primarily due to capitalizing a lower percentage of interest compared to the prior-year period. During 2015, we capitalized interest of $24.7 million, or roughly 38% of our total interest costs, compared to capitalized interest of $33.2 million, or roughly 52% of our total interest costs, for 2014.\nInterest Income. Interest income increased by $0.4 million to $1.5 million for 2015 compared to $1.1 million for 2014. Our average cash balance decreased to $269.9 million for 2015 compared to $307.9 million for 2014. The average interest rate earned on our invested cash balances was approximately 0.5% and 0.4% during the fiscal years ended December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively. The decrease in average cash balance was primarily due to cash outflows associated with our fifth OSV newbuild program in 2014 and 2015 and lower revenue earned by active vessels operating in our fleet. These decreases were partially offset by cash inflows from the sale of four vessels to the U.S. Navy in 2015.\nIncome Tax Expense. Our effective tax rate was 37.3% for 2015 and 2014. During 2015 and 2014, our income tax expense primarily consisted of deferred taxes. Our income tax rate is different from the federal statutory rate primarily due to expected state tax liabilities and items not deductible for federal income tax purposes.\nIncome from Continuing Operations. Operating performance decreased year-over-year by $21.1 million for reported income from continuing operations of $66.8 million for 2015 compared to $87.9 million for 2014. Excluding the gain on sale of assets from both periods presented, income from continuing operations would have been $39.2 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015 compared to $87.4 million for the same period in 2014. This decrease in income from continuing operations for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015 was primarily driven by lower revenues due to soft market conditions discussed above that were partially offset by the gain on the sale of four vessels to the U.S. Navy in 2015.\nYEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2014 COMPARED TO YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2013\nSummarized financial information for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, is shown below in the following table (in thousands, except percentage changes):\n\n \nRevenues. Revenues for 2014 increased by $86.6 million, or 15.8%, to $634.8 million compared to $548.1 million for 2013. Our weighted-average active operating fleet for 2014 was approximately 61 vessels compared to 54 vessels for 2013. These higher revenues primarily resulted from the full or partial-period contribution of 20 vessels that were placed in service under our fifth OSV newbuild program since 2013 or returned to service under our 200 class OSV retrofit program since 2012 and, to a lesser extent, an increase in revenues from the MPSV fleet. Vessels placed in-service under our fifth OSV newbuild program and our OSV retrofit program accounted for increases of $102.5 million and $17.7 million, respectively, in revenues during 2014 compared to 2013. Revenue from our MPSVs that were in service during each of the twelve months ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 increased by $35.3 million, or 27.5%, primarily due to higher spot dayrates earned by one of our MPSVs performing flotel services in the GoM. These higher revenues were partially offset by a $73.4 million decrease in revenue for our remaining vessels that were in service during each of the twelve months ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 due to soft market conditions and 128 incremental days out-of-service for regulatory drydockings compared to 2013. Our new generation OSV average dayrates were $27,416 for 2014 compared to $26,605 for 2013, an increase of $811, or 3.0%. Our new generation OSV utilization was 79.6% for 2014 compared to 83.7% for 2013. This decrease in utilization was primarily due to soft spot market conditions for our high-spec OSVs operating in the GoM and the incremental vessel-days out-of-service for regulatory drydockings during 2014 compared to 2013. Domestic revenues increased by $74.4 million during 2014 due to the full or partial-period contribution of 14 vessels added to our fleet under our fifth OSV newbuild program on various dates during 2013 and 2014. Foreign revenues increased by $12.2 million primarily due to the relocation of an MPSV from the GoM to foreign markets during 2014. Foreign revenues comprised 22.8% of our total revenues for 2014 compared to 24.1% for 2013.\nOperating expenses. Operating expenses were $296.5 million, an increase of $57.3 million, or 23.9%, for 2014 compared to $239.2 million for 2013. Newly constructed vessels under our fifth OSV newbuild program and upgraded vessels placed in service under our 200 class OSV retrofit program during 2013 and 2014 accounted for approximately $55.0 million of the higher operating costs.\nDepreciation and Amortization. Depreciation and amortization expense was $29.5 million, or 34.3%, higher for 2014 compared to 2013. This increase is primarily due to the full or partial-period contribution of 14 newbuild vessels that were placed in service on various dates during 2013 and 2014, as well as the higher cost basis of six vessels\nredelivered under our 200 class OSV retrofit program in 2013. The increase in amortization is primarily due to a higher per-vessel average in shipyard costs for vessel regulatory drydockings given the shift in our fleet mix to a higher percentage of much larger high-spec vessels and, to a lesser extent, incremental amortization recorded for the accelerated regulatory drydocking of vessels during 2014.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses. General and administrative expenses of $54.2 million increased by $0.8 million, or 1.5%, during 2014 compared to 2013. This increase in G&A expenses was primarily the result of the growth of our shoreside support team related to our on-going newbuild program and expanding international operations. This increase was partially offset due to the valuation of our stock-based compensation expense, which was driven lower by the recent decline in our stock price, and lower shoreside incentive compensation expense. General and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues were 8.5% for 2014 compared to 9.7% for 2013.\nGain on Sale of Assets. During 2014, we sold a non-core 220 class OSV that resulted in an aggregate gain of approximately $0.8 million ($0.5 million after-tax or $0.01 per diluted share). During 2013, we sold certain non-core marine assets, including two 220 class OSVs, that resulted in an aggregate gain of approximately $1.6 million ($1.0 million after-tax or $0.03 per diluted share).\nOperating Income. Operating income decreased by $1.7 million to $169.4 million during 2014 compared to 2013 for the reasons discussed above. Operating income as a percentage of revenues was 26.7% for 2014 compared to 31.2% for 2013.\nLoss on Early Extinguishment of Debt. On March 14, 2013, we commenced a cash tender offer for all of the $250.0 million in aggregate principal amount of our 2017 senior notes. Approximately 94% of such senior notes were validly tendered during the designated tender period, which ended on March 27, 2013. The remaining 2017 senior notes were redeemed on May 13, 2013. During 2013, we recorded a loss on early extinguishment of debt of approximately $25.8 million ($16.1 million after-tax or $0.44 per diluted share), which was comprised of the tender offer costs, the write-off of unamortized financing costs and original issue discount, and a bond redemption premium. There was no such transaction in 2014.\nInterest Expense. Interest expense decreased $16.6 million during 2014 compared to 2013 primarily due to lower interest expense resulting from the November 2013 retirement of our convertible senior notes due 2026. During 2014, we capitalized interest of $33.2 million, or roughly 52% of our total interest costs, compared to capitalized interest of $31.2 million, or roughly 40% of our total interest costs, for 2013.\nInterest Income. Interest income decreased by $1.4 million to $1.1 million for 2014 compared to $2.5 million for 2013. Our average cash balance decreased to $307.9 million for 2014 compared to $663.4 million for 2013. The average interest rate earned on our invested cash balances was approximately 0.4% during the fiscal years ended December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013. The decrease in average cash balance was due to cash outflows associated with our fifth OSV newbuild program in 2014 and the retirement of all of our outstanding $250 million aggregate principal amount of 2026 convertible senior notes in November 2013.\nIncome Tax Expense. Our effective tax rate was 37.3% and 36.2% for 2014 and 2013, respectively. During 2014, our income tax expense primarily consisted of deferred taxes. Our income tax rate is different from the federal statutory rate primarily due to expected state tax liabilities and items not deductible for federal income tax purposes. The lower tax rate for 2013 was primarily attributable to the tax benefit taken in 2013 in connection with the re-pricing of the net deferred tax liabilities on the balance sheet as a result of the sale of the Downstream segment.\nIncome from Continuing Operations. Operating performance increased year-over-year by $23.8 million for reported income from continuing operations of $87.9 million for 2014 compared to $64.1 million for 2013. Excluding the after-tax loss on early extinguishment of debt, income from continuing operations would have been $80.2 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2013 compared to $87.9 million for the same period in 2014. This increase in income from continuing operations for 2014 was primarily due to higher operating income based on the full or partial- period contribution of 14 vessels placed in service under our fifth OSV newbuild program discussed above and a $15.2 million decrease in net interest expense. Income from continuing operations for 2013 was adversely impacted by a $25.8 million pre-tax loss on early extinguishment of debt in connection with the tender offer purchase and redemption of our 2017 senior notes.\nDiscontinued Operations. On August 29, 2013, we closed the sale of substantially all of our Downstream assets to Genesis Marine, LLC. As a result of this transaction, the current and historical operating results of these vessels for 2014 and 2013 have been restated and reflected as discontinued operations. Excluded from the sale were three older,\nlower-horsepower tugs considered to be non-core assets. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2014, these three tugs were sold for net cash proceeds of $1.6 million. These sales resulted in a pre-tax gain of approximately $0.9 million ($0.6 million after-tax or $0.02 per diluted share. Operating income during 2013 for this segment included a gain on sale of assets of approximately $60.0 million ($38.1 million after-tax or $1.04 per diluted share).\nThe following table details financial highlights for fiscal years ended December 31, 2014, and 2013, respectively, related to our Downstream segment that was sold in August 2013 (in thousands):\n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur capital requirements have historically been financed with cash flows from operations, proceeds from issuances of our debt and common equity securities, borrowings under our credit facilities and cash received from the sale of assets. We require capital to fund on-going operations, remaining obligations under our expanded fifth OSV newbuild program, vessel recertifications, discretionary capital expenditures and debt service and may require capital to fund potential future vessel construction, retrofit or conversion projects, acquisitions or stock repurchases. The nature of our capital requirements and the types of our financing sources are not expected to change significantly for 2016.\nWe have reviewed all of our debt agreements as well as our liquidity position and projected future cash needs. Despite volatility in commodity markets, we remain confident in our current financial position, the strength of our balance sheet and the short- and long-term viability of our business model. To date, our liquidity has been impacted by such volatility through lower than normal cash flow from operations. However, including cash on-hand, we expect to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to cover all of our growth capital expenditures for the remaining four HOSMAX vessels under construction, commercial-related capital expenditures, and all of our annually recurring cash debt service, maintenance capital expenditures and cash income taxes through the completion of the newbuild program, as well as discretionary share repurchases from time to time, without ever having to use our currently undrawn revolving credit facility. We also believe that we will be able to fund all of the deferred maintenance capital expenditures that will be required upon reactivation of our stacked vessels when market conditions improve without having to draw on such facility. We have three tranches of funded unsecured debt outstanding that mature in fiscal years 2019, 2020 and 2021, respectively.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had total cash and cash equivalents of $259.8 million. We also have a $300 million revolving credit facility, expandable up to $500 million, which is undrawn as of February 26, 2016. On February 6, 2015, we amended and extended the maturity of our existing revolving credit facility to February 2020, provided that, if the 2019 convertible senior notes remain outstanding on March 1, 2019, the Company is required to maintain a specified minimum liquidity level until after the redemption or refinancing of the convertible senior notes, which mature on September 1, 2019. As of December 31, 2015, we had posted letters of credit for $0.5 million and had $299.5 million of credit available under our revolving credit facility. The full undrawn credit amount of such facility is available for all uses of proceeds, including working capital, if necessary. However, the primary intended use of the facility is the potential future construction or acquisition of assets that generate additional EBITDA.\nOn October 28, 2014, our Board of Directors authorized us to repurchase up to $150 million in shares of our common stock from time to time, $25 million of which was used to buy-back 891,396 shares during the fourth quarter of 2014. There were no such repurchases during the twelve months ended December 31, 2015. Any future repurchases under this program will be funded from our cash on-hand, cash flow from operations and/or cash proceeds from the divestiture of non-core assets. While we have an authorized share repurchase program, we will continue to prioritize our usage of cash appropriate to the current market cycle.\nAlthough we expect to continue generating positive working capital through our operations, events beyond our control, such as sustained low prices for oil and natural gas, a further significant decline in such commodity prices, renewed regulatory-driven delays in the issuance of drilling plans and permits in the GoM, declines in expenditures for exploration, development and production activity, any extended reduction in domestic consumption of refined\npetroleum products and other reasons discussed under the Forward Looking Statements on page ii and \"Item 1A - Risk Factors\" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, may affect our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Should such need for additional financing arise, we may not be able to access the capital markets on attractive terms at that time or otherwise obtain sufficient capital to meet our maturing debt obligations or finance growth opportunities that may arise. We will continue to closely monitor our liquidity position, as well as the state of the global capital and credit markets. See further discussion in the Contractual Obligations section below.\nCash Flows\nOperating Activities. We rely primarily on cash flows from operations to provide working capital for current and future operations. Cash flows from operating activities were $215.8 million in 2015, $163.1 million in 2014, and $207.1 million in 2013. Operating cash flows in 2015 were favorably impacted by a reduction in outstanding accounts receivable balances combined with lower cash outflows for regulatory drydocking expenses compared to the prior year, partially offset by lower cash inflows from soft market conditions. Cash flows from operations for 2015 reflect full or partial-period contributions from 14 vessels that were placed in service under our fifth OSV newbuild program on various dates during 2014 and 2015. Operating cash flows in 2014 included the impact of $43.6 million of costs related to regulatory recertifications for our vessels. Operating cash flows in 2014 were unfavorably affected by the soft market conditions for our OSVs operating in the GoM, partially offset by the full or partial-period contributions from 14 vessels that were placed in service under our fifth OSV newbuild program on various dates during 2013 and 2014. Operating cash flows in 2013 were favorably affected by the increased dayrates for our high-spec OSVs and MPSVs operating in the GoM and, to a lesser extent, the partial-period contributions from four new generation OSVs that were delivered under our fifth OSV newbuild program.\nInvesting Activities. Net cash used in investing activities was $141.3 million in 2015, $401.5 million in 2014, and $526.6 million in 2013. Cash utilized in 2015 consisted of construction costs incurred for our fifth OSV newbuild program partially offset by $152.0 million in aggregate proceeds from the sale of four 250EDF class OSVs to the U.S. Navy. The proceeds from the asset sale have been reinvested in the construction of vessels under our fifth OSV newbuild program. Cash utilized during 2014 primarily consisted of construction costs incurred for our fifth OSV newbuild program and capital improvements made to our existing operating fleet, partially offset by $7.2 million in aggregate net cash proceeds from the sale of non-core assets. Cash utilized during 2013 primarily consisted of construction costs incurred for our fifth OSV newbuild program and capital improvements made to our existing operating fleet, partially offset by $16.0 million in aggregate net cash proceeds from the sale of non-core assets.\nFinancing Activities. Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities was $1.0 million in 2015, $(19.7) million in 2014, and $(61.3) million in 2013. Net cash provided by financing activities in 2015 resulted from net proceeds from common shares issued pursuant to our employee stock-based incentive plan, partially offset by deferred financing costs related to the amendment and extension of our existing $300 million revolving credit facility. Net cash used in financing activities for 2014 primarily resulted from the repurchase of our common stock. See Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the common stock repurchase. Net cash used in financing activities for 2013 primarily resulted from the repurchase and retirement of our 2017 senior notes and the redemption of our 2026 convertible senior notes. These outflows were partially offset by the issuance of our 2021 senior notes.\nOn March 14, 2013, we commenced a tender offer and solicitation of consents relating to the repurchase of our existing 2017 senior notes. The tender offer expired on April 10, 2013. On March 28, 2013, we also completed the private placement of $450 million of 2021 senior notes, resulting in offering proceeds of approximately $442.4 million, net of transaction costs. In connection with the tender offer, related consent solicitation, and related redemption, we used $269.3 million of such proceeds to repurchase all of our outstanding $250 million aggregate principal amount of 2017 senior notes. As a result of the repurchase of the 2017 senior notes, we recorded a pre-tax loss on early extinguishment of debt of $25.8 million ($16.1 million after-tax or $0.44 per diluted share).\nOn November 15, 2013, we completed the conversion and redemption of all of our outstanding $250 million aggregate principal amount of 2026 convertible senior notes. We elected to redeem the 2026 convertible senior notes on November 15, 2013, or the Redemption Date, at a redemption price of 100% of the principal amount thereof and accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the Redemption Date. Holders of approximately $249.6 million in aggregate principal amount of the 2026 convertible senior notes elected to convert prior to the previously announced redemption date of November 15, 2013. The conversions of the 2026 convertible senior notes were settled based on the applicable conversion rate of 20.6260 shares of our common stock per $1,000 principal amount of notes, which equates to a conversion price of $48.48 per share, and on the volume-weighted average price of our common stock during the Observation Period (as defined in the Indenture governing the 2026 convertible senior notes) of October 8,\n2013 through November 11, 2013. We satisfied our conversion obligations to holders by paying cash equal to the aggregate principal amount of the 2026 convertible senior notes converted and delivering shares of our common stock in settlement of all conversion obligations in excess of the principal amount (except that we paid cash in lieu of issuing fractional shares). In total, we delivered 728,411 shares of our common stock to the converting holders, which were provided to us by the counterparties to the previously disclosed convertible note hedge transactions entered into in 2006 concurrently with the pricing of the 2026 convertible senior notes. This prevented the equity dilution that would otherwise have resulted from the share delivery requirements of the conversion. The number of shares of our common stock outstanding after the conversion was the same as immediately prior to the conversion. The remaining $0.4 million in aggregate principal amount of the 2026 convertible senior notes was redeemed on November 15, 2013 at a redemption price of 100% of the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the Redemption Date. The cash payment obligations related to the conversion and redemption were funded with cash on-hand.\nDiscontinued Operations. Net cash provided by discontinued operations was $4.0 million in 2014 and $244.1 million in 2013. Net cash provided by discontinued operations in 2014 primarily resulted from the sale of our final three older, lower-horsepower tugs. Net cash provided by discontinued operations in 2013 primarily resulted from the sale of substantially all of the assets related to the Downstream segment to Genesis Marine, LLC for approximately $230 million in gross cash proceeds. See Note 13 for further discussion regarding Discontinued Operations. The proceeds from the asset sale have been reinvested in the construction of vessels under our fifth OSV newbuild program.\nCommitments and Contractual Obligations\nThe following table sets forth our aggregate contractual obligations as of December 31, 2015 (in thousands).\n\n \n (1) Vessel construction commitments reflect contractual milestone payments for our fifth OSV newbuild program. The total project costs for the currently contracted 24-vessel program are expected to be $1,335.0 million, excluding capitalized construction period interest. From the inception of this program through December 31, 2015, we have incurred $1,201.7 million, or 90.0%, of total expected project costs. \n (2) Our 2021 senior notes, with a fixed interest rate of 5.000% per year, mature on March 1, 2021 and currently include $5,080 of deferred financing costs. \n (3) Our 2020 senior notes, with a fixed interest rate of 5.875% per year, mature on April 1, 2020 and currently include $3,944 of deferred financing costs. \n (4) Our 2019 convertible senior notes, with a fixed interest rate of 1.500% per year, mature on September 1, 2019 and currently include $41,600 of non-cash original issue discount and $4,095 of deferred financing costs. Holders of the convertible senior notes may require that such notes be repurchased at their option pursuant to certain types of corporate transactions described in Note 6 of our consolidated financial statements included herein. The debt maturities reflected in the table above assume that the holders of our convertible senior notes do not require that such notes be repurchased prior to their maturity in September 2019. \n (5) Interest payments relate to our 2021 senior notes due March 1, 2021, our 2020 senior notes due", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7 - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our historical consolidated financial statements and their notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our current views with respect to future events and financial performance. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements or as a result of certain factors such as those set forth in our Forward Looking Statements disclaimer on page ii of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nGeneral\nDuring 2015, oil prices have remained in a trading range of $35 to $65 per barrel and an average of $49 with a more recent price in the $28 to $40 range. The drop in oil price is due to surplus oil, driven in part by a significant rise in U.S. shale oil production as well as other previously unavailable sources of supply and OPEC suppliers in the Middle East and Russia not reducing their output. In addition, economic weakness in many regions of the world, notably Europe and China, has reduced the previously expected oil consumption growth rate. As a result of lower oil prices, major and independent oil companies with deepwater operations have significantly reduced their capital spending budgets, which are the principal demand drivers for our services. Less spending by our customers combined with a global oversupply of OSVs, including high-spec OSVs in our core markets, for the current market conditions, have resulted in reductions in both our dayrates and utilization.\nWe believe that the long-term nature of deepwater projects insulates them, somewhat, from a short-term fall in oil prices and that many sanctioned or on-going projects will proceed. However, deepwater activities will be affected by lower prices, even if they are affected less than other activities. We have experienced and continue to experience requests by our deepwater customers for price reductions in order to help mitigate the impact that lower prices are having and will continue to have on oil company operating results and cashflows. In addition, sustained low prices have caused un-sanctioned projects to be delayed or cancelled altogether, which could be manifested in less activity later, even if oil prices recover. Many of our operations are in support of deepwater projects that are in their final stages or of projects that do not involve deepwater and are more susceptible to immediate wind-down. We cannot predict whether, to what extent, or when oil prices will improve.\nIn the GoM, 18 high-spec OSVs have been delivered into the domestic market during 2015, including five of our own. We expect an additional 18 high-spec OSVs to be delivered into domestic service during 2016 and 2017. We do not anticipate significant growth in the supply of high-spec OSVs beyond the currently anticipated level of 210 of such vessels by the first quarter of 2017. During the fourth quarter of 2015, there was an average of roughly 48 floating rigs available in the GoM, while an average of 39 were working. As of February 17, 2016, there were 50 rigs available and 35 were working. However, ten floating rigs have contracts that will expire during 2016 and one rig is scheduled to leave the region. We do not know whether the remaining rigs will receive contract renewals for operations in the GoM. We expect three new rigs to arrive in the GoM during 2016. Once a rig arrives in the GoM, it can take several months to commence work and, therefore, we do not know the timing of when operations of newly arrived rigs will begin. Given these market conditions, we anticipate our average dayrates and utilization levels to be adversely affected compared to our 2015 and 2014 results. However, the GoM is one of the premier deepwater markets in the world and we are committed to supporting our customers in this market. We feel that once the current supply and demand fundamentals return to normal conditions our results from operations will improve.\nIn recognition of these weak market conditions, we stacked 28 OSVs on various dates from October 1, 2014 through December 31, 2015. Post year-end, we have stacked an additional five new generation OSVs to date. These 33 stacked vessels represent 49% of our fleetwide vessel headcount, but only 33% of our total OSV and MPSV deadweight tonnage. By stacking vessels, we expect to significantly reduce our cash outlays and lower our risk profile; however, we will have fewer revenue-producing units in service that can contribute to our results and contribute cash flows to cover our fixed costs and commitments. We may choose to stack additional vessels should market conditions warrant.\nIn Mexico, while the energy reform continues to progress, questions remain on the timing of the incremental activity expected in the deepwater GoM given the current oil price environment. PEMEX budget reductions have resulted in contract cancellations and slower than expected growth in the market for our vessels in Mexico. We have\nnoticed that PEMEX is reviewing its vessel needs and, in certain circumstances, is not exercising options for vessels that are currently operating in its chartered fleet. We expect that certain of our Mexican-flagged vessels will be affected and will likely be stacked, if not renewed. Nevertheless, we consider Mexico to be a long-term market for our services, especially in light of energy reforms being carried out there. Despite current oil prices, we recently observed improved bidding results from several international companies related to shallow water auctions in Mexico. We will continue to explore opportunities to place additional vessels into Mexico to support PEMEX in its ongoing shallow water activity and non-PEMEX customers in support of future shelf and deepwater activity there. In 2014, PEMEX announced its intention to use only vessels that are less that 15 years old. We and other market participants in Mexico, however, have successfully challenged this restriction, but PEMEX may renew its attempt in the future.\nIn Brazil, Petrobras generally appears to be moving towards an \"all Brazilian flag\" vessel fleet, which will limit opportunities in Brazil for foreign flag vessels, except where highly specialized services are required. In January 2016, we placed one of our newbuild HOSMAX 310 class OSVs into Brazilian registry. We will continue to monitor this market to charter our vessels to Petrobras or other companies operating in that region.\nMarket conditions\nAs of February 17, 2016, we had 17% of our new generation OSV vessel-days contracted for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2016. Our forward OSV contract coverage for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2017 currently stands at 3%. MPSV contract coverage for the fiscal years ending December 31, 2016 and 2017 is currently 5% and 0%, respectively.\nThe principal threat facing all of our markets is the fall in oil prices and resultant reduction in capital spending by our customers.\nOur Vessels\nAll of our current vessels are qualified under the Jones Act to engage in U.S. coastwise trade, except for seven foreign-flagged new generation OSVs, two foreign-flagged well-stimulation vessels and two foreign-flagged MPSVs. As of December 31, 2015, our 32 active new generation OSVs, six MPSVs and four managed OSVs were operating in domestic and international areas as noted in the following table:\nTable 102: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating Areas\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Domestic\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>GoM\n</td> <td>27\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other U.S. coastlines(1)\n</td> <td>5\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>32\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Foreign\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Mexico\n</td> <td>8\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Middle East\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Europe\n</td> <td>1\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>10\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Active Vessels(2)\n</td> <td>42\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n \n (1) Includes one owned vessel and four managed vessels that are currently supporting the military. \n (2) Excluded from this table are 28 new generation OSVs and one non-core conventional OSV that were stacked as of December 31, 2015.  OSV Newbuild Program #5. Recently, we announced the expansion of our fifth OSV newbuild program to enhance the four remaining MPSVs to be delivered. These enhancements include additional accommodations, additional ROV workspaces, additional crane lifting capacities and, for the final two MPSVs, a 60 foot mid-body section. Our fifth OSV newbuild program now consists of four 300 class OSVs, five 310 class OSVs, ten 320 class OSVs, three 310 class MPSVs and two 400 class MPSVs. As of February 17, 2016, we had delivered and placed in service 20 vessels under such newbuild program. Delivery of the four remaining vessels under this 24-vessel domestic newbuild program is expected to occur on various dates during 2016 and 2017. We expect to own and operate 62 new generation OSVs as of December 31, 2016, as well as manage four vessels for the U.S. Navy. These aggregate OSV vessel additions result in a projected average new generation OSV fleet complement of 61.9 and 62.0 for fiscal years 2016 and 2017, respectively. With the addition of the four MPSVs, we expect to own and operate eight and ten MPSVs as of December 31, 2016 and 2017, respectively. These MPSV additions result in a projected average MPSV fleet complement of 6.9, 8.7 and 10.0 vessels for the fiscal years 2016, 2017 and 2018, respectively. The aggregate cost of our fifth OSV newbuild program, excluding construction period interest, is expected to be approximately\n$1,335.0 million, approximately 90% of which has already been incurred. For further information regarding our fifth OSV newbuild program, please refer to the Capital Expenditures and Related Commitments section.\nOperating Costs\nOur operating costs are primarily a function of fleet size, areas of operations and utilization levels. The most significant direct operating costs are wages paid to vessel crews, maintenance and repairs, and marine insurance. Because most of these expenses are incurred regardless of vessel utilization, our direct operating costs as a percentage of revenues may fluctuate considerably with changes in dayrates and utilization. Since October 1, 2014, we have stacked 33 vessels. By removing these vessels from our active operating fleet, we have been able to significantly reduce our operating costs, including crew costs. If market conditions worsen, we may elect to stack additional vessels. Our fixed operating costs are now spread over 29 owned and operated vessels and four vessels managed for the U.S. Navy.\nIn certain foreign markets in which we operate, we are susceptible to higher operating costs, such as materials and supplies, crew wages, maintenance and repairs, taxes, importation duties, and insurance costs. Difficulties and costs of staffing international operations, including vessel crews, and language and cultural differences generally contribute to a higher cost structure in foreign locations compared to our domestic operations. We may not be able to recover higher international operating costs through higher dayrates charged to our customers. Therefore, when we increase our international complement of vessels, our gross margins may fluctuate depending on the foreign areas of operation and the complement of vessels operating domestically.\nIn addition to the operating costs described above, we incur fixed charges related to the depreciation of our fleet and amortization of costs for routine drydock inspections and maintenance and repairs necessary to ensure compliance with applicable regulations and to maintain certifications for our vessels with the USCG and various classification societies. The aggregate number of drydockings and other repairs undertaken in a given period determines the level of maintenance and repair expenses and marine inspection amortization charges. We capitalize costs incurred for drydock inspection and regulatory compliance and amortize such costs over the period between such drydockings, typically 30 months. Applicable maritime regulations require us to drydock our vessels twice in a five-year period for inspection and routine maintenance and repair. If we undertake a disproportionately large number of drydockings in a particular fiscal period, comparative results may be affected. While we can defer required drydockings of stacked vessels, we will be required to conduct such deferred drydockings prior to such vessels returning to service, which could delay their return to active service.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nOur consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. In many cases, the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by generally accepted accounting principles. In other circumstances, we are required to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that we believe are reasonable based upon available information. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and various other factors that we believe are reasonable based upon the information available. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions. We believe that of our significant accounting policies discussed in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements, the following may involve estimates that are inherently more subjective.\nCarrying Value of Vessels. We depreciate our OSVs and MPSVs over estimated useful lives of 25 years each. Salvage value for our new generation marine equipment is typically 25% of the originally recorded cost for these asset types. In assigning depreciable lives to these assets, we have considered the effects of both physical deterioration largely caused by wear and tear due to operating use and other economic and regulatory factors that could impact commercial viability. To date, our experience confirms that these policies are reasonable, although there may be events or changes in circumstances in the future that indicate that recovery of the carrying amount of our vessels might not be possible.\nWe presently review our vessels for impairment using the following asset groups: New Generation OSVs, MPSVs and Conventional OSV. As of December 31, 2015, we only had one remaining conventional OSV, which remains cold-stacked and has a net book value of only $0.4 million. Management has concluded that these groupings are currently appropriate because our vessels are highly relevant and mobile and are consistent based on the operating and marketing characteristics desired by our customers. When analyzing asset groups for impairment, we consider both historical and projected operating cash flows, operating income, and EBITDA based on current operating environment and future conditions that we can reasonably anticipate, such as inflation or prospective wage costs. These projections are based on, but not limited to, job location, current market dayrates included in recent sales proposals,\nutilization and contract coverage; along with anticipated market drivers, such as drilling rig movements, results of offshore lease sales and discussions with our customers regarding their ongoing drilling plans. We also consider recent vessel sales and recent vessel appraisals.\nIf events or changes in circumstances as set forth above indicate that the asset group's carrying amount may not be recoverable, we would then be required to estimate the undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset group and its eventual disposition. If the sum of the expected future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the vessel, we would be required to reduce the carrying amount to fair value. Examples of events or changes in circumstances that could indicate that the recoverability of the carrying amount of our asset groups should be assessed might include a significant change in regulations such as OPA 90, a significant decrease in the market value of the asset group and current period operating or cash flow losses combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses or a projection or forecast that demonstrates continuing losses associated with the asset group.\nWe reviewed ASC 360 regarding triggering events that would require an impairment analysis and concluded that there were no such events in 2015 or 2014. Our review gave consideration to the current market conditions, which include the recent commodity price decline, a reduction in certain projected capital budgets for our customers and our competitors' filings. While we expect this environment to have a negative impact on vessel utilization and dayrates, we view the deepwater and ultra deepwater projects of our customers, which are the principal markets for our vessel fleet, to be somewhat insulated from short-term commodity price cycles compared to onshore shale and shallow shelf offshore exploration and production activities. However, continued commodity price declines or protracted extensions of the current price cycle could result in additional delays or cancellations of deepwater projects, which may adversely affect long-term fleet utilization. We recently updated our analysis of whether a triggering event has occurred and we concluded that one has not. While the Company has historically operated its vessels predominately in the GoM, we will continue to deploy vessels to international markets as conditions warrant. Our technologically advanced vessels are capable of working in and are effectively mobilized to different markets, so neither the geographic location of vessels, nor reduced drilling activity in a particular exploration area is considered on its own as an impairment trigger. In addition, since we consider cyclicality and volatility to be normal for our industry, we do not consider strategically stacking vessels that we intend to reactivate to be a triggering event. We believe that the fair values of all of our asset groups exceed their carrying values. In order for the fair values of any of our assets to be below their respective carrying values, current and projected effective dayrates would have to be significantly below the lowest levels experienced in the Company's history. In addition, those market conditions would have to be sustained for the remaining economic useful lives of each vessel class, which is also unlikely.\nRecertification Costs. Our vessels are required by regulation to be recertified after certain periods of time. These recertification costs are incurred while the vessel is in drydock where other routine repairs and maintenance are performed and, at times, major replacements and improvements are performed. We expense routine repairs and maintenance as they are incurred. Recertification costs can be accounted for in one of two ways: (1) defer and amortize or (2) expense as incurred. We defer and amortize recertification costs over the length of time that the recertification is expected to last, which is generally 30 months. Major replacements and improvements, which extend the vessel's economic useful life or functional operating capability, are capitalized and depreciated over the vessel's remaining economic useful life. Inherent in this process are judgments we make regarding whether the specific cost incurred is capitalizable and the period that the incurred cost will benefit.\nMobilization Costs. Vessels will routinely move to and from international and domestic operating areas. Mobilization costs associated with relocating vessels typically include fuel, crew costs, vessel modifications, materials and supplies, importation taxes or other pre-positioning expenses required by the customer. The extent of mobilization costs incurred to relocate a vessel is directly related to the customer contract terms and area of operation. Some of our charter agreements provide for us to recover mobilization costs through billings to our customers. Unless mobilization costs are rebillable to customers, we expense these costs as incurred.\nRevenue Recognition. We charter our vessels to customers under time charters based on a daily rate of hire and recognize revenue as earned on a daily basis during the contract period of the specific vessel.\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts. Our customers are primarily national oil companies, major and independent, domestic and international, oil and gas and oil service companies. Our customers are granted credit on a short-term basis and related credit risks are considered minimal. We usually do not require collateral. We provide an estimate for uncollectible accounts based primarily on management's judgment. Management uses the relative age of receivable balances, historical losses, current economic conditions and individual evaluations of each customer to make adjustments to the allowance for doubtful accounts. Our historical losses have not been significant. However,\nbecause amounts due from individual customers can be significant, future adjustments to the allowance can be material if one or more individual customer's balances are deemed uncollectible.\nIncome Taxes. We follow accounting standards for income taxes that require the use of the liability method of computing deferred income taxes. Under this method, deferred income taxes are provided for the temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of our assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The assessment of the realization of deferred tax assets, particularly those related to tax net operating loss carryforwards and foreign tax credit carryforwards, involves the use of management's judgment to determine whether it is more likely than not that we will realize such tax benefits in the future prior to their expiration. We continue to review our projected operating results related to the realization of these foreign tax credit carryforwards and if current market conditions persist or worsen through 2018, we may not realize the full benefit of these carryforwards. In addition, each reporting period, we assess and adjust for any significant changes to our liability for unrecognized income tax benefits. We account for any interest and penalties relating to uncertain tax positions in general and administrative expenses.\nStock-Based Compensation Expense. All equity-settled share-based payments to employees and directors, including grants of stock options and restricted stock units, are recognized in the income statement based on their fair values at the date of grant. All cash-settled share-based payments to employees and directors are recognized in the income statement based on their fair values at the end of the reporting period.\nLegal Contingencies. We are involved in a variety of claims, lawsuits, investigations and proceedings, as described in Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements. We determine whether an estimated loss from a contingency should be accrued by assessing whether a loss is deemed probable and can be reasonably estimated. We assess our potential liability by analyzing our litigation and regulatory matters using available information. We develop our views on estimated losses in consultation with outside counsel handling our defense in these matters, which involves an analysis of potential results, assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies. Should developments in any of these matters cause a change in our determination such that we expect an unfavorable outcome and result in the need to recognize a material accrual, or should any of these matters result in a final adverse judgment or be settled for a significant amount, they could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the period or periods in which such change in determination, judgment or settlement occurs.\nResults of Operations\nThe tables below set forth the average dayrates, utilization rates and effective dayrates for our new generation OSVs and the average number and size of such vessels owned during the periods indicated. These vessels generate a substantial portion of our revenues and operating profit. Excluded from the OSV information below is the results of operations for our MPSVs, our shore-base facility, and vessel management services, including the four vessels managed for the U.S. Navy. The Company does not provide average or effective dayrates for its MPSVs. MPSV dayrates are impacted by highly variable customer-required cost-of-sales associated with ancillary equipment and services, such as ROVs, accomodation units and cranes, which are typically recovered through higher dayrates charged to the customer. Due to the fact that each of our MPSVs have a workload capacity and significantly higher income generating potential than each of the Company's new generation OSVs, the utilization and dayrate levels of our MPSVs could have a very large impact on our results of operations. For this reason, our consolidated operating results, on a period-to-period basis, are disproportionately impacted by the level of dayrates and utilization achieved by our six MPSVs.\nTable 106: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Years Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Offshore Supply Vessels:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average number of new generation OSVs(1)\n</td> <td>60.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>57.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>50.7\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average number of active new generation OSVs(2)\n</td> <td>42.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>56.6\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>50.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average new generation OSV fleet capacity (DWT)\n</td> <td>206,030\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>177,033\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>132,564\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average new generation OSV capacity (DWT)\n</td> <td>3,436\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,076\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,609\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average new generation OSV utilization rate(3)\n</td> <td>54.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>79.6\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>83.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effective new generation OSV utilization rate(4)\n</td> <td>77.8\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>80.7\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>84.4\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average new generation OSV dayrate(5)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>26,278\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>27,416\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>26,605\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effective dayrate(6)\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>14,295\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>21,823\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>22,268\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n \n (1) We owned 60 new generation OSVs as of December 31, 2015. Our average number of new generation OSVs for the year ended December 31, 2015 reflects the deliveries of certain vessels under our fifth OSV newbuild program. Please refer to Our Vessels on page 6 of this Form 10-K for more information about vessel names and placed in-service dates. Excluded from this data is one conventional OSV that we consider to be a non-core asset. \n (2) In response to weak market conditions, we elected to stack 28 new generation OSVs on various dates since October 2014. Subsequent to year-end, we have stacked an additional five new generation OSVs. Active new generation OSVs represent vessels that are immediately available for service during each respective period. \n (3) Utilization rates are average rates based on a 365-day year. Vessels are considered utilized when they are generating revenues. \n (4) Effective utilization rate is based on a denominator comprised only of vessel-days available for service by the active fleet, which excludes the impact of stacked vessel days. \n (5) Average new generation OSV dayrates represent average revenue per day, which includes charter hire, crewing services and net brokerage revenues, based on the number of days during the period that the OSVs generated revenues. \n (6) Effective dayrate represents the average dayrate multiplied by the average utilization rate. \nYEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2015 COMPARED TO YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2014\nSummarized financial information for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, is shown below in the following table (in thousands, except percentage changes):\nTable 114: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase (Decrease)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$ Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenues:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Domestic\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>328,262\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>490,314\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(162,052\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(33.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Foreign\n</td> <td>147,808\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>144,479\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,329\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>476,070\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>634,793\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(158,723\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(25.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating expenses\n</td> <td>219,260\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>296,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(77,240\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(26.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>109,029\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>115,450\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(6,421\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5.6\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General and administrative expenses\n</td> <td>48,297\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>54,245\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(5,948\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(11.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>376,586\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>466,195\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(89,609\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(19.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain on sale of assets\n</td> <td>44,060\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>822\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>43,238\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>>100.0\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income\n</td> <td>143,544\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>169,420\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(25,876\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(15.3\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense\n</td> <td>39,496\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>30,733\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,763\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>28.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest income\n</td> <td>1,525\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,086\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>439\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>40.4\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax expense\n</td> <td>39,757\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>52,367\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(12,610\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(24.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income from continuing operations\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>66,821\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>87,907\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(21,086\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(24.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income from discontinued operations, net of tax\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>618\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(618\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(100.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>66,821\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>88,525\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(21,704\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(24.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n \nRevenues. Revenues for 2015 decreased by $158.7 million, or 25.0%, to $476.1 million compared to $634.8 million for 2014. Our weighted-average active operating fleet for 2015 was approximately 48 vessels compared to 61 vessels for 2014. The decrease in revenues was primarily due to soft market conditions in the GoM, which led to our decision to stack 28 new generation OSVs on various dates between October 1, 2014 and December 31, 2015. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2015, we had an average of 18.0 vessels stacked compared to 0.8 vessels stacked in the prior-year period. This decrease in revenue was partially offset by $54.0 million in revenue earned from the full or partial-period contribution of 14 vessels that were placed in service under our fifth OSV newbuild program since December 2013. Revenue from our MPSV fleet decreased $40.7 million, or 23.2%, for 2015 compared to 2014. Our new generation OSV average dayrates were $26,278 for 2015 compared to $27,416 for 2014, a decrease of $1,138, or 4.2%. Our new generation OSV utilization was 54.4% for 2015 compared to 79.6% for 2014. This decrease in utilization is primarily due to soft market conditions for high-spec OSVs operating in the GoM and the incremental vessels that were stacked during 2015 compared to 2014. Our new generation OSVs incurred 238 days of aggregate downtime for regulatory drydockings and were stacked for an aggregate of 6,587 days during the twelve months ended December 31, 2015. Excluding stacked vessel days, our new generation OSV effective utilization was 77.8% and 80.7% during the twelve months ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Domestic revenues decreased by $162.1 million during 2015 compared to 2014 due to lower dayrates earned by vessels operating in our fleet during the twelve months ended December 31, 2015 and the stacking of vessels in late 2014 through 2015. Foreign revenues increased by $3.3 million primarily due to the full or partial-period contribution of 11 OSVs and two MPSVs that relocated to foreign regions on various dates since 2013. Foreign revenues comprised 31.0% of our total revenues for 2015 compared to 22.8% for 2014.\nOperating expenses. Operating expenses were $219.3 million, a decrease of $77.2 million, or 26.1%, for 2015 compared to $296.5 million for 2014. Operating expenses were driven lower by vessels that were removed from our active fleet count since late 2014, which resulted in a substantial reduction in mariner headcount. This decrease was partially offset by $25.7 million of operating costs related to the full or partial-period contribution from vessels added to our fleet since December 2013. Aggregate cash operating expenses are projected to be in the range of $170.0 million to $185.0 million for 2016. Such cash operating expense estimate is exclusive of any additional repositioning expenses we may incur in connection with the potential relocation of more of our vessels into international markets or back to the GoM, and any customer-required cost-of-sales related to future contract fixtures that are typically recovered through higher dayrates.\nDepreciation and Amortization. Depreciation and amortization expense was $6.4 million, or 5.6%, lower for 2015 compared to 2014. Depreciation increased by $11.3 million primarily due to the contribution of 14 vessels that were placed in service on various dates since December 2013. The depreciation increase was more than offset by a decrease in amortization expense of $17.7 million, primarily due to $6.8 million of incremental amortization recorded for the accelerated regulatory drydocking of vessels during 2014 along with lower amortization from the sale of four vessels to the U.S. Navy in 2015 and the deferral of planned drydockings for stacked vessels. Depreciation and amortization expense is expected to continue to increase from current levels as the vessels under our current newbuild program are placed in service and when any newly constructed vessels undergo their initial 30-month and 60-month recertifications.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses. General and administrative expenses of $48.3 million decreased by $5.9 million, or 11.0%, during 2015 compared to 2014. The decrease in G&A expenses was primarily due to lower shoreside compensation and short-term incentive compensation expense and a reduction in bad debt reserves. General and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues were 10.1% for 2015 compared to 8.5% for 2014. Our general and administrative expenses are expected to be in the approximate range of $47.0 to $52.0 million for 2016.\nGain on Sale of Assets. During 2015, we completed the sale of four 250EDF class OSVs, the HOS Arrowhead, the HOS Black Powder, the HOS Eagleview and the HOS Westwind, to the U.S. Navy for cash consideration of $152.0 million. The sale resulted in a pre-tax gain of approximately $44.1 million ($27.6 million after-tax or $0.76 per diluted share). During 2014, we sold a non-core 220 class OSV that resulted in an aggregate gain of approximately $0.8 million ($0.5 million after-tax or $0.01 per diluted share).\nOperating Income. Operating income decreased by $25.9 million to $143.5 million during 2015 compared to 2014 for the reasons discussed above. Operating income as a percentage of revenues was 30.2% for 2015 compared to 26.7% for 2014. Excluding the gain on sale of assets, our operating income for 2015 would have been $99.5 million, or 20.9% of revenues and for 2014 would have been $168.6 million, or 26.6% of revenues.\nInterest Expense. Interest expense increased $8.8 million during 2015 compared to 2014 primarily due to capitalizing a lower percentage of interest compared to the prior-year period. During 2015, we capitalized interest of $24.7 million, or roughly 38% of our total interest costs, compared to capitalized interest of $33.2 million, or roughly 52% of our total interest costs, for 2014.\nInterest Income. Interest income increased by $0.4 million to $1.5 million for 2015 compared to $1.1 million for 2014. Our average cash balance decreased to $269.9 million for 2015 compared to $307.9 million for 2014. The average interest rate earned on our invested cash balances was approximately 0.5% and 0.4% during the fiscal years ended December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively. The decrease in average cash balance was primarily due to cash outflows associated with our fifth OSV newbuild program in 2014 and 2015 and lower revenue earned by active vessels operating in our fleet. These decreases were partially offset by cash inflows from the sale of four vessels to the U.S. Navy in 2015.\nIncome Tax Expense. Our effective tax rate was 37.3% for 2015 and 2014. During 2015 and 2014, our income tax expense primarily consisted of deferred taxes. Our income tax rate is different from the federal statutory rate primarily due to expected state tax liabilities and items not deductible for federal income tax purposes.\nIncome from Continuing Operations. Operating performance decreased year-over-year by $21.1 million for reported income from continuing operations of $66.8 million for 2015 compared to $87.9 million for 2014. Excluding the gain on sale of assets from both periods presented, income from continuing operations would have been $39.2 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015 compared to $87.4 million for the same period in 2014. This decrease in income from continuing operations for the twelve months ended December 31, 2015 was primarily driven by lower revenues due to soft market conditions discussed above that were partially offset by the gain on the sale of four vessels to the U.S. Navy in 2015.\nYEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2014 COMPARED TO YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2013\nSummarized financial information for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, is shown below in the following table (in thousands, except percentage changes):\nTable 116: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Increase (Decrease)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$ Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>% Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenues:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Domestic\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>490,314\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>415,898\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>74,416\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Foreign\n</td> <td>144,479\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>132,247\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>12,232\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>634,793\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>548,145\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>86,648\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15.8\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating expenses\n</td> <td>296,500\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>239,239\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>57,261\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23.9\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>115,450\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>85,962\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>29,488\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>34.3\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General and administrative expenses\n</td> <td>54,245\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>53,428\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>817\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1.5\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>466,195\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>378,629\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>87,566\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23.1\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain on sale of assets\n</td> <td>822\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,587\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(765\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(48.2\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income\n</td> <td>169,420\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>171,103\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,683\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss on early extinguishment of debt\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>25,776\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(25,776\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(100.0\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense\n</td> <td>30,733\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>47,352\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(16,619\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(35.1\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest income\n</td> <td>1,086\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2,515\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(1,429\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(56.8\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income tax expense\n</td> <td>52,367\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>36,320\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16,047\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>44.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income from continuing operations\n</td> <td>87,907\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>64,078\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23,829\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>37.2\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income from discontinued operations, net of tax\n</td> <td>618\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>47,315\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(46,697\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(98.7\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>88,525\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>111,393\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>(22,868\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(20.5\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n \nRevenues. Revenues for 2014 increased by $86.6 million, or 15.8%, to $634.8 million compared to $548.1 million for 2013. Our weighted-average active operating fleet for 2014 was approximately 61 vessels compared to 54 vessels for 2013. These higher revenues primarily resulted from the full or partial-period contribution of 20 vessels that were placed in service under our fifth OSV newbuild program since 2013 or returned to service under our 200 class OSV retrofit program since 2012 and, to a lesser extent, an increase in revenues from the MPSV fleet. Vessels placed in-service under our fifth OSV newbuild program and our OSV retrofit program accounted for increases of $102.5 million and $17.7 million, respectively, in revenues during 2014 compared to 2013. Revenue from our MPSVs that were in service during each of the twelve months ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 increased by $35.3 million, or 27.5%, primarily due to higher spot dayrates earned by one of our MPSVs performing flotel services in the GoM. These higher revenues were partially offset by a $73.4 million decrease in revenue for our remaining vessels that were in service during each of the twelve months ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 due to soft market conditions and 128 incremental days out-of-service for regulatory drydockings compared to 2013. Our new generation OSV average dayrates were $27,416 for 2014 compared to $26,605 for 2013, an increase of $811, or 3.0%. Our new generation OSV utilization was 79.6% for 2014 compared to 83.7% for 2013. This decrease in utilization was primarily due to soft spot market conditions for our high-spec OSVs operating in the GoM and the incremental vessel-days out-of-service for regulatory drydockings during 2014 compared to 2013. Domestic revenues increased by $74.4 million during 2014 due to the full or partial-period contribution of 14 vessels added to our fleet under our fifth OSV newbuild program on various dates during 2013 and 2014. Foreign revenues increased by $12.2 million primarily due to the relocation of an MPSV from the GoM to foreign markets during 2014. Foreign revenues comprised 22.8% of our total revenues for 2014 compared to 24.1% for 2013.\nOperating expenses. Operating expenses were $296.5 million, an increase of $57.3 million, or 23.9%, for 2014 compared to $239.2 million for 2013. Newly constructed vessels under our fifth OSV newbuild program and upgraded vessels placed in service under our 200 class OSV retrofit program during 2013 and 2014 accounted for approximately $55.0 million of the higher operating costs.\nDepreciation and Amortization. Depreciation and amortization expense was $29.5 million, or 34.3%, higher for 2014 compared to 2013. This increase is primarily due to the full or partial-period contribution of 14 newbuild vessels that were placed in service on various dates during 2013 and 2014, as well as the higher cost basis of six vessels\nredelivered under our 200 class OSV retrofit program in 2013. The increase in amortization is primarily due to a higher per-vessel average in shipyard costs for vessel regulatory drydockings given the shift in our fleet mix to a higher percentage of much larger high-spec vessels and, to a lesser extent, incremental amortization recorded for the accelerated regulatory drydocking of vessels during 2014.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses. General and administrative expenses of $54.2 million increased by $0.8 million, or 1.5%, during 2014 compared to 2013. This increase in G&A expenses was primarily the result of the growth of our shoreside support team related to our on-going newbuild program and expanding international operations. This increase was partially offset due to the valuation of our stock-based compensation expense, which was driven lower by the recent decline in our stock price, and lower shoreside incentive compensation expense. General and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues were 8.5% for 2014 compared to 9.7% for 2013.\nGain on Sale of Assets. During 2014, we sold a non-core 220 class OSV that resulted in an aggregate gain of approximately $0.8 million ($0.5 million after-tax or $0.01 per diluted share). During 2013, we sold certain non-core marine assets, including two 220 class OSVs, that resulted in an aggregate gain of approximately $1.6 million ($1.0 million after-tax or $0.03 per diluted share).\nOperating Income. Operating income decreased by $1.7 million to $169.4 million during 2014 compared to 2013 for the reasons discussed above. Operating income as a percentage of revenues was 26.7% for 2014 compared to 31.2% for 2013.\nLoss on Early Extinguishment of Debt. On March 14, 2013, we commenced a cash tender offer for all of the $250.0 million in aggregate principal amount of our 2017 senior notes. Approximately 94% of such senior notes were validly tendered during the designated tender period, which ended on March 27, 2013. The remaining 2017 senior notes were redeemed on May 13, 2013. During 2013, we recorded a loss on early extinguishment of debt of approximately $25.8 million ($16.1 million after-tax or $0.44 per diluted share), which was comprised of the tender offer costs, the write-off of unamortized financing costs and original issue discount, and a bond redemption premium. There was no such transaction in 2014.\nInterest Expense. Interest expense decreased $16.6 million during 2014 compared to 2013 primarily due to lower interest expense resulting from the November 2013 retirement of our convertible senior notes due 2026. During 2014, we capitalized interest of $33.2 million, or roughly 52% of our total interest costs, compared to capitalized interest of $31.2 million, or roughly 40% of our total interest costs, for 2013.\nInterest Income. Interest income decreased by $1.4 million to $1.1 million for 2014 compared to $2.5 million for 2013. Our average cash balance decreased to $307.9 million for 2014 compared to $663.4 million for 2013. The average interest rate earned on our invested cash balances was approximately 0.4% during the fiscal years ended December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013. The decrease in average cash balance was due to cash outflows associated with our fifth OSV newbuild program in 2014 and the retirement of all of our outstanding $250 million aggregate principal amount of 2026 convertible senior notes in November 2013.\nIncome Tax Expense. Our effective tax rate was 37.3% and 36.2% for 2014 and 2013, respectively. During 2014, our income tax expense primarily consisted of deferred taxes. Our income tax rate is different from the federal statutory rate primarily due to expected state tax liabilities and items not deductible for federal income tax purposes. The lower tax rate for 2013 was primarily attributable to the tax benefit taken in 2013 in connection with the re-pricing of the net deferred tax liabilities on the balance sheet as a result of the sale of the Downstream segment.\nIncome from Continuing Operations. Operating performance increased year-over-year by $23.8 million for reported income from continuing operations of $87.9 million for 2014 compared to $64.1 million for 2013. Excluding the after-tax loss on early extinguishment of debt, income from continuing operations would have been $80.2 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2013 compared to $87.9 million for the same period in 2014. This increase in income from continuing operations for 2014 was primarily due to higher operating income based on the full or partial- period contribution of 14 vessels placed in service under our fifth OSV newbuild program discussed above and a $15.2 million decrease in net interest expense. Income from continuing operations for 2013 was adversely impacted by a $25.8 million pre-tax loss on early extinguishment of debt in connection with the tender offer purchase and redemption of our 2017 senior notes.\nDiscontinued Operations. On August 29, 2013, we closed the sale of substantially all of our Downstream assets to Genesis Marine, LLC. As a result of this transaction, the current and historical operating results of these vessels for 2014 and 2013 have been restated and reflected as discontinued operations. Excluded from the sale were three older,\nlower-horsepower tugs considered to be non-core assets. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2014, these three tugs were sold for net cash proceeds of $1.6 million. These sales resulted in a pre-tax gain of approximately $0.9 million ($0.6 million after-tax or $0.02 per diluted share. Operating income during 2013 for this segment included a gain on sale of assets of approximately $60.0 million ($38.1 million after-tax or $1.04 per diluted share).\nThe following table details financial highlights for fiscal years ended December 31, 2014, and 2013, respectively, related to our Downstream segment that was sold in August 2013 (in thousands):\nTable 118: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenue\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>12\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>43,318\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain on sale of assets\n</td> <td>867\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>60,076\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income\n</td> <td>555\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>74,278\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income from discontinued operations, net of tax\n</td> <td>618\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>47,315\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur capital requirements have historically been financed with cash flows from operations, proceeds from issuances of our debt and common equity securities, borrowings under our credit facilities and cash received from the sale of assets. We require capital to fund on-going operations, remaining obligations under our expanded fifth OSV newbuild program, vessel recertifications, discretionary capital expenditures and debt service and may require capital to fund potential future vessel construction, retrofit or conversion projects, acquisitions or stock repurchases. The nature of our capital requirements and the types of our financing sources are not expected to change significantly for 2016.\nWe have reviewed all of our debt agreements as well as our liquidity position and projected future cash needs. Despite volatility in commodity markets, we remain confident in our current financial position, the strength of our balance sheet and the short- and long-term viability of our business model. To date, our liquidity has been impacted by such volatility through lower than normal cash flow from operations. However, including cash on-hand, we expect to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to cover all of our growth capital expenditures for the remaining four HOSMAX vessels under construction, commercial-related capital expenditures, and all of our annually recurring cash debt service, maintenance capital expenditures and cash income taxes through the completion of the newbuild program, as well as discretionary share repurchases from time to time, without ever having to use our currently undrawn revolving credit facility. We also believe that we will be able to fund all of the deferred maintenance capital expenditures that will be required upon reactivation of our stacked vessels when market conditions improve without having to draw on such facility. We have three tranches of funded unsecured debt outstanding that mature in fiscal years 2019, 2020 and 2021, respectively.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had total cash and cash equivalents of $259.8 million. We also have a $300 million revolving credit facility, expandable up to $500 million, which is undrawn as of February 26, 2016. On February 6, 2015, we amended and extended the maturity of our existing revolving credit facility to February 2020, provided that, if the 2019 convertible senior notes remain outstanding on March 1, 2019, the Company is required to maintain a specified minimum liquidity level until after the redemption or refinancing of the convertible senior notes, which mature on September 1, 2019. As of December 31, 2015, we had posted letters of credit for $0.5 million and had $299.5 million of credit available under our revolving credit facility. The full undrawn credit amount of such facility is available for all uses of proceeds, including working capital, if necessary. However, the primary intended use of the facility is the potential future construction or acquisition of assets that generate additional EBITDA.\nOn October 28, 2014, our Board of Directors authorized us to repurchase up to $150 million in shares of our common stock from time to time, $25 million of which was used to buy-back 891,396 shares during the fourth quarter of 2014. There were no such repurchases during the twelve months ended December 31, 2015. Any future repurchases under this program will be funded from our cash on-hand, cash flow from operations and/or cash proceeds from the divestiture of non-core assets. While we have an authorized share repurchase program, we will continue to prioritize our usage of cash appropriate to the current market cycle.\nAlthough we expect to continue generating positive working capital through our operations, events beyond our control, such as sustained low prices for oil and natural gas, a further significant decline in such commodity prices, renewed regulatory-driven delays in the issuance of drilling plans and permits in the GoM, declines in expenditures for exploration, development and production activity, any extended reduction in domestic consumption of refined\npetroleum products and other reasons discussed under the Forward Looking Statements on page ii and \"Item 1A - Risk Factors\" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, may affect our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Should such need for additional financing arise, we may not be able to access the capital markets on attractive terms at that time or otherwise obtain sufficient capital to meet our maturing debt obligations or finance growth opportunities that may arise. We will continue to closely monitor our liquidity position, as well as the state of the global capital and credit markets. See further discussion in the Contractual Obligations section below.\nCash Flows\nOperating Activities. We rely primarily on cash flows from operations to provide working capital for current and future operations. Cash flows from operating activities were $215.8 million in 2015, $163.1 million in 2014, and $207.1 million in 2013. Operating cash flows in 2015 were favorably impacted by a reduction in outstanding accounts receivable balances combined with lower cash outflows for regulatory drydocking expenses compared to the prior year, partially offset by lower cash inflows from soft market conditions. Cash flows from operations for 2015 reflect full or partial-period contributions from 14 vessels that were placed in service under our fifth OSV newbuild program on various dates during 2014 and 2015. Operating cash flows in 2014 included the impact of $43.6 million of costs related to regulatory recertifications for our vessels. Operating cash flows in 2014 were unfavorably affected by the soft market conditions for our OSVs operating in the GoM, partially offset by the full or partial-period contributions from 14 vessels that were placed in service under our fifth OSV newbuild program on various dates during 2013 and 2014. Operating cash flows in 2013 were favorably affected by the increased dayrates for our high-spec OSVs and MPSVs operating in the GoM and, to a lesser extent, the partial-period contributions from four new generation OSVs that were delivered under our fifth OSV newbuild program.\nInvesting Activities. Net cash used in investing activities was $141.3 million in 2015, $401.5 million in 2014, and $526.6 million in 2013. Cash utilized in 2015 consisted of construction costs incurred for our fifth OSV newbuild program partially offset by $152.0 million in aggregate proceeds from the sale of four 250EDF class OSVs to the U.S. Navy. The proceeds from the asset sale have been reinvested in the construction of vessels under our fifth OSV newbuild program. Cash utilized during 2014 primarily consisted of construction costs incurred for our fifth OSV newbuild program and capital improvements made to our existing operating fleet, partially offset by $7.2 million in aggregate net cash proceeds from the sale of non-core assets. Cash utilized during 2013 primarily consisted of construction costs incurred for our fifth OSV newbuild program and capital improvements made to our existing operating fleet, partially offset by $16.0 million in aggregate net cash proceeds from the sale of non-core assets.\nFinancing Activities. Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities was $1.0 million in 2015, $(19.7) million in 2014, and $(61.3) million in 2013. Net cash provided by financing activities in 2015 resulted from net proceeds from common shares issued pursuant to our employee stock-based incentive plan, partially offset by deferred financing costs related to the amendment and extension of our existing $300 million revolving credit facility. Net cash used in financing activities for 2014 primarily resulted from the repurchase of our common stock. See Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the common stock repurchase. Net cash used in financing activities for 2013 primarily resulted from the repurchase and retirement of our 2017 senior notes and the redemption of our 2026 convertible senior notes. These outflows were partially offset by the issuance of our 2021 senior notes.\nOn March 14, 2013, we commenced a tender offer and solicitation of consents relating to the repurchase of our existing 2017 senior notes. The tender offer expired on April 10, 2013. On March 28, 2013, we also completed the private placement of $450 million of 2021 senior notes, resulting in offering proceeds of approximately $442.4 million, net of transaction costs. In connection with the tender offer, related consent solicitation, and related redemption, we used $269.3 million of such proceeds to repurchase all of our outstanding $250 million aggregate principal amount of 2017 senior notes. As a result of the repurchase of the 2017 senior notes, we recorded a pre-tax loss on early extinguishment of debt of $25.8 million ($16.1 million after-tax or $0.44 per diluted share).\nOn November 15, 2013, we completed the conversion and redemption of all of our outstanding $250 million aggregate principal amount of 2026 convertible senior notes. We elected to redeem the 2026 convertible senior notes on November 15, 2013, or the Redemption Date, at a redemption price of 100% of the principal amount thereof and accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the Redemption Date. Holders of approximately $249.6 million in aggregate principal amount of the 2026 convertible senior notes elected to convert prior to the previously announced redemption date of November 15, 2013. The conversions of the 2026 convertible senior notes were settled based on the applicable conversion rate of 20.6260 shares of our common stock per $1,000 principal amount of notes, which equates to a conversion price of $48.48 per share, and on the volume-weighted average price of our common stock during the Observation Period (as defined in the Indenture governing the 2026 convertible senior notes) of October 8,\n2013 through November 11, 2013. We satisfied our conversion obligations to holders by paying cash equal to the aggregate principal amount of the 2026 convertible senior notes converted and delivering shares of our common stock in settlement of all conversion obligations in excess of the principal amount (except that we paid cash in lieu of issuing fractional shares). In total, we delivered 728,411 shares of our common stock to the converting holders, which were provided to us by the counterparties to the previously disclosed convertible note hedge transactions entered into in 2006 concurrently with the pricing of the 2026 convertible senior notes. This prevented the equity dilution that would otherwise have resulted from the share delivery requirements of the conversion. The number of shares of our common stock outstanding after the conversion was the same as immediately prior to the conversion. The remaining $0.4 million in aggregate principal amount of the 2026 convertible senior notes was redeemed on November 15, 2013 at a redemption price of 100% of the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the Redemption Date. The cash payment obligations related to the conversion and redemption were funded with cash on-hand.\nDiscontinued Operations. Net cash provided by discontinued operations was $4.0 million in 2014 and $244.1 million in 2013. Net cash provided by discontinued operations in 2014 primarily resulted from the sale of our final three older, lower-horsepower tugs.
