AND SUBSIDIARIES\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis\nOverview\nWe are a leading diversified capital manager that invests in and finances residential and commercial assets. Our principal business objective is to generate net income for distribution to our stockholders and optimize our returns through prudent management of our diversified investment strategies. We are an internally-managed Maryland corporation founded in 1997 that has elected to be taxed as a REIT. Prior to the closing of the Internalization (as defined in Item 1 under Closing of the Internalization and Termination of the Management Agreement\u201d) on June 30, 2020, we were externally managed by Annaly Management Company LLC (our Former Manager\u201d). Our common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol NLY.\u201d\nWe use our capital coupled with borrowed funds to invest primarily in real estate related investments, earning the spread between the yield on our assets and the cost of our borrowings and hedging activities.\nFor a full discussion of our business, refer to the section titled Business Overview\u201d of Part I, Item 1. Business.\u201d\nBusiness Environment and COVID-19\nThe themes that have dominated financial markets since the elevated volatility seen in March and April 2020 remain unchanged. Fiscal stimulus has supported businesses and consumers most negatively impacted by COVID-19 while the Federal Reserve's ( Fed\u201d) unprecedented monetary policy actions eased financial conditions and contained interest rate volatility. These factors drove our strong performance to close out the year, delivering an economic return of 5.1% for the fourth quarter and 1.8% for 2020. Throughout the year, we returned $1.4 billion aggregate in common and preferred dividends to our shareholders, signaling meaningful resilience following the historic disruption seen in March and April.\nInterest rates ended 2020 near their highest levels since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic reflecting optimism about the post-COVID recovery in spite of negative developments of record U.S. virus cases, tighter restrictions and resulting lackluster economic growth particularly in the U.S. service sector. The rapid COVID-19 vaccine development and plans for deployment, combined with the relatively healthy consumer balance sheets, suggest that the U.S. economy may rebound at a faster pace than during traditional economic downturns once a majority of the population reaches immunity, though meaningful uncertainties remain about both the timing of immunity and the subsequent recovery pace.\nAt the end of 2020, our capital allocation remained tilted towards Agency mortgage-backed securities ( MBS\u201d), representing 78% of the aggregate portfolio, compared to 74% one year ago. However, this year-over-year snapshot masks more recent increases in activity in our residential credit and middle market lending businesses, which saw strong investor sponsorship and improving fundamentals as markets signal a cyclical recovery. As Agency MBS spreads have continued to tighten given Fed and bank sector demand for the product, select credit sectors have allowed for targeted, attractive opportunities. While opportunistic, Annaly continues with its disciplined and defensive-minded credit focus, which is necessary given overall tight asset spreads.\nSomewhat offsetting the effect from tight asset spreads, current financing conditions are among the most favorable seen in Annaly's history. The liquidity created through the Fed's monetary policy actions have led to absolute low level of rates and a flat term structure of the repo curve. Favorable financing conditions have allowed us to increase our net interest margin (excluding PAA) from 1.41% at the end of 2019 to 1.98% at the end of 2020, as cheaper financing more than offset the decline in asset yields driven by the aforementioned spread compression. Additionally, securitization markets have rebounded substantially, resulting in better execution levels than one year ago, and provide attractive non-recourse term financing to bolster our residential credit asset investment strategy and diversify financing for our whole loan business.\nBusiness Continuity\nOur well-established Business Continuity Planning ( BCP\u201d) was designed to ensure continued, effective operations through a variety of scenarios including natural disasters and disease pandemics. It identifies critical systems, processes, roles and third parties, and can be adjusted on a real-time basis to address situations as they arise.\nThe BCP is regularly updated and tested. Annual testing includes extensive, remote Disaster Recovery testing and tabletop exercise scenarios with management. Key tenets of the planning include active communication between our Crisis Response Team, which is comprised of senior leaders across a number of functions, and our internal and external stakeholders to afford efficient, thoughtful, effective responses to evolving emergency situations.\nHistorical tabletop exercises have included use of CDC Influenza Pandemic exercise materials. That exercise documented our response and possible impacts to a variety of scenarios, including those in which shelter in place orders\u201d were required and response/ impact assessments to those scenarios. Regular meetings were commenced to implement and review active internal and external communications planning. These exercises, along with regulatory and industry guidance, informed our staged response to the conditions created by COVID-19. We took proactive actions, which included canceling non-essential travel and instituting 100% remote working, ahead of New York State-mandated requirements. To protect the health and well-being of our employees, their families and communities remote work requirements began in phases in early March, culminating with a\nANNALY CAPITAL MANAGEMENT, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis\ncompany-wide exercise on March 13, 2020 to test connectivity and functionality. All employees were able to successfully perform their duties in this testing and we have operated largely remotely since that time.\nA majority of our business activities continues to be performed remotely, though we have seen a limited number of employees return to the office on a voluntary and periodic basis. We continue to monitor guidance from federal, state and local authorities to gauge how to further proceed in any efforts to return to the office.\nEconomic Environment\nThe pace of economic growth in 2020 slowed sharply, not only in the United States but worldwide, as the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic affected nearly all ways of life and disrupted many aspects of the economy. The far-reaching consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic led U.S. gross domestic product ( GDP\u201d) to decline by 3.5% year-over-year in 2020, in turn marking the largest decline in economic activity during a calendar year in more than 70 years. The disruptions caused by the pandemic were unique in that they primarily impacted the service sector of the economy, a sector that has been a source of relative stability during prior economic downturns. Other parts of the economy, including goods consumption and housing, have recovered from the initial pandemic-driven downturn and these sectors are now above 2019 output levels. All of this suggests that the economy is currently relatively bifurcated, requiring U.S. health officials to work to defeat the virus before economic activity can return to pre-pandemic levels in aggregate.\nThe sharp economic contraction led the unemployment rate to rise to 6.7% in December 2020, nearly twice as high as the unemployment rate seen in December 2019 according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The rise in the unemployment rate likely understates the number of jobs lost in 2020 as the employment-to-population ratio fell to 57.4%, suggesting that 3.5% of the population, or roughly 9 million people, no longer held a job at the end of 2020 compared to one year ago. Wage growth, as measured by the year-over-year change in private sector average hourly earnings rose sharply, reading 5.1% in the month of December 2020 compared to 3.0% in December 2019. The sharp increase in wages, however, appears to be driven by changes in the underlying composition of employees by industry, as sectors with generally lower wages, such as leisure and hospitality services, have seen outsized job losses relative to sectors with higher wages. Alternative measures of wage growth, such as the Employment Cost Index or the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta's Wage Tracker show meaningfully less wage growth.\nInflation remained muted into the economic downturn as measured by the year-over-year changes in the Personal Consumption Expenditure Chain Price Index ( PCE\u201d). The headline PCE measure increased by 1.3% year-over-year in December 2020. The more stable core PCE measure, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, registered a similar 1.5% year-over-year increase. Although both inflation measures remain somewhat below the Fed's 2.0% inflation target, the Fed expects inflation to recover towards its target in coming years as the economy begins to recover from the economic downturn.\nThe Fed conducts monetary policy with a dual mandate: full employment and price stability. Given the contraction in economic activity witnessed following the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Fed increased its monetary policy support at unprecedented speed and size. The target range for the Federal Funds rate was cut from 1.50% - 1.75% in December 2019 to 0.0% - 0.25% in March 2020. Following the interest rate cuts, the Fed provided guidance that short-term interest rates will remain near current levels until labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with the Fed assessments of maximum employment and inflation has risen to 2 percent and is on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time\u201d as stated in the December 2020 Federal Open Market Committee meeting statement. In addition to the zero-interest rate policy, the Fed restarted its asset purchase programs, increasing its holdings of Treasury securities and Agency MBS by a total of $2.0 trillion and $631 billion, respectively. Asset purchases continued at the end of 2020 at a pace of $80 billion per month in Treasury securities and $40 billion per month in MBS. Beyond rate policy and asset purchases, the Fed also announced several lending programs to various other market sectors, such as corporate bonds, municipals, and small businesses, among others. These lending programs largely concluded their activities at the end of December 2020 but could be revived should the economic situation deteriorate.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, yields on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note declined by 101 bps primarily in the first half of the year as a sharp slowdown in global economic growth and heightened uncertainties around the economic recovery led to strong demand for interest rate products and the aforementioned unprecedented fiscal and monetary stimulus. The mortgage basis, or the spread between the 30-year Agency MBS coupon and 10-year U.S. Treasury rate, had a volatile year, rising meaningfully in the first quarter before retracing given strong demand for MBS in the second half of the year.\nThe following table below presents interest rates and spreads at each date presented:\nANNALY CAPITAL MANAGEMENT, INC.

Our plan includes steps to evaluate exposure, review contracts, assess impact to our business, process and technology and define a communication strategy with shareholders, regulators and other stakeholders. The committee also continues to engage with industry working groups and other market participants regarding the transition. In October 2020, as part of the transition from LIBOR, we participated in the Chicago Mercantile Exchange ( CME\u201d) Group's transitioning for price alignment and discounting for USD OTC cleared swaps from the daily effective federal funds rate to the secured overnight financing rate ( SOFR\u201d). As a result of this activity, our existing swap and swaption positions have been updated with the new SOFR discounting curve and basis swaps entered into during this transition were sold in the CME Group's auction on October 19, 2020. We continue to remain on track with our LIBOR transition plan, which requires different solutions depending on the underlying asset or liability. Most U.S. LIBOR tenors have been extended from December 31, 2021 to June 2023. Similar to the rest of the market, the bulk of our exposure is in derivatives contracts. Certain contracts, such as interest rate swaps, have an orderly market transition already in process, whereas other contracts, such as loan agreements require bilateral amendments with transition currently in process and adequate time left to resolve. See Risks Related to Our Investing, Portfolio Management and Financing Activities-Changes in the method pursuant to which LIBOR is determined and potential discontinuation of LIBOR may affect our results.\u201d\nResults of Operations\nThe results of our operations are affected by various factors, many of which are beyond our control. Certain of such risks and uncertainties are described herein (see Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d above) and in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d.\nThis Management Discussion and Analysis section contains analysis and discussion of financial results computed in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP\u201d) and non-GAAP measurements. To supplement our consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP, we provide non-GAAP financial measures to enhance investor understanding of our

The changes in core earnings (excluding PAA) for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the same period in 2019 were primarily due to lower interest expense from lower borrowing rates and average interest bearing liabilities, and higher TBA dollar roll income, partially offset by lower coupon income resulting from a decrease in the average yield on interest earnings assets and lower average interest earning assets, and unfavorable changes in the net interest component of interest rate swaps.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nTo supplement our consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP, we provide the following non-GAAP financial measures:\n\u2022core earnings (excluding PAA);\n\u2022core earnings (excluding PAA) attributable to common stockholders;\n\u2022core earnings (excluding PAA) per average common share;\n\u2022annualized core return on average equity (excluding PAA);\n\u2022interest income (excluding PAA);\n\u2022economic interest expense;\n\u2022economic net interest income (excluding PAA);\n\u2022average yield on interest earning assets (excluding PAA);\n\u2022average economic cost of interest bearing liabilities;\n\u2022net interest margin (excluding PAA); and\n\u2022net interest spread (excluding PAA).\nThese measures should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures computed in accordance with GAAP. While intended to offer a fuller understanding of our results and operations, non-GAAP financial measures also have limitations. For example, we may calculate our non-GAAP metrics, such as core earnings (excluding PAA), or the PAA, differently than our peers making comparative analysis difficult. Additionally, in the case of non-GAAP measures that exclude the PAA, the amount of amortization expense excluding the PAA is not necessarily representative of the amount of future periodic amortization nor is it indicative of the term over which we will amortize the remaining unamortized premium. Changes to actual and estimated prepayments will impact the timing and amount of premium amortization and, as such, both GAAP and non-GAAP results.\nThese non-GAAP measures provide additional detail to enhance investor understanding of our period-over-period operating performance and business trends, as well as for assessing our performance versus that of industry peers.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis\nOur principal business objective is to generate net income for distribution to our stockholders and optimize our returns through prudent management of our diversified investment strategies. We generate net income by earning a net interest spread on our investment portfolio, which is a function of interest income from our investment portfolio less financing, hedging and operating costs. Core earnings (excluding PAA), which is defined as the sum of (a) economic net interest income, (b) TBA dollar roll income and CMBX coupon income, (c) realized amortization of MSRs, (d) other income (loss) (excluding depreciation and amortization expense on real estate and related intangibles, non-core income allocated to equity method investments and other non-core components of other income (loss)), (e) general and administrative expenses (excluding transaction expenses and non-recurring items), and (f) income taxes (excluding the income tax effect of non-core income (loss) items), and excludes (g) the premium amortization adjustment ( PAA\u201d) representing the cumulative impact on prior periods, but not the current period, of quarter-over-quarter changes in estimated long-term prepayment speeds related to our Agency mortgage-backed securities, is used by management and, we believe, used by analysts and investors to measure our progress in achieving our principal business objective.\nWe seek to fulfill our principal business objective through a variety of factors including portfolio construction, the degree of market risk exposure and related hedge profile, and the use and forms of leverage, all while operating within the parameters of our capital allocation policy and risk governance framework.\nWe believe these non-GAAP measures provide management and investors with additional details regarding our underlying operating results and investment portfolio trends by (i) making adjustments to account for the disparate reporting of changes in fair value where certain instruments are reflected in GAAP net income (loss) while others are reflected in other comprehensive income (loss), and (ii) by excluding certain unrealized, non-cash or episodic components of GAAP net income (loss) in order to provide additional transparency into the operating performance of our portfolio. Annualized core return on average equity (excluding PAA), which is calculated by dividing core earnings (excluding PAA) over average stockholders' equity, provides investors with additional detail on the core earnings generated by our invested equity capital.\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of GAAP financial results to non-GAAP core earnings for the periods presented:\nTable 29:

Refer to disclosures within this section above for additional information on non-GAAP financial measures.\nFrom time to time, we enter into TBA forward contracts as an alternate means of investing in and financing Agency mortgage-backed securities. A TBA contract is an agreement to purchase or sell, for future delivery, an Agency mortgage-backed security with a specified issuer, term and coupon. A TBA dollar roll represents a transaction where TBA contracts with the same terms but different settlement dates are simultaneously bought and sold. The TBA contract settling in the later month typically prices at a discount to the earlier month contract with the difference in price commonly referred to as the drop\u201d. The drop is a reflection of the expected net interest income from an investment in similar Agency mortgage-backed securities, net of an implied financing cost, that would be foregone as a result of settling the contract in the later month rather than in the earlier month. The drop between the current settlement month price and the forward settlement month price occurs because in the TBA dollar roll market, the party providing the financing is the party that would retain all principal and interest payments accrued during the financing period. Accordingly, TBA dollar roll income generally represents the economic equivalent of the net interest income earned on the underlying Agency mortgage-backed security less an implied financing cost.\nTBA dollar roll transactions are accounted for under GAAP as a series of derivatives transactions. The fair value of TBA derivatives is based on methods similar to those used to value Agency mortgage-backed securities. We record TBA derivatives at fair value on our Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition and recognize periodic changes in fair value in Net gains (losses) on other derivatives in our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss), which includes both unrealized and realized gains and losses on derivatives (excluding interest rate swaps).\nTBA dollar roll income is calculated as the difference in price between two TBA contracts with the same terms but different settlement dates multiplied by the notional amount of the TBA contract. Although accounted for as derivatives, TBA dollar rolls capture the economic equivalent of net interest income, or carry, on the underlying Agency mortgage-backed security (interest income less an implied cost of financing). TBA dollar roll income is reported as a component of Net gains (losses) on other derivatives in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss).\nThe CMBX index is a synthetic tradable index referencing a basket of 25 commercial mortgage-backed securities of a particular rating and vintage. The CMBX index allows investors to take a long position (referred to as selling protection) or short position (referred to as purchasing protection) on the respective basket of commercial mortgage-backed securities and is structured as a pay-as-you-go\u201d contract whereby the protection seller receives and the protection buyer pays a standardized running coupon on the contracted notional amount. Additionally, the protection seller is obligated to pay to the protection buyer the amount of principal losses and/or coupon shortfalls on the underlying commercial mortgage-backed securities as they occur. We report income (expense) on CMBX positions in Net gains (losses) on other derivatives in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss). The coupon payments received or paid on CMBX positions is equivalent to interest income (expense) and therefore included in core earnings (excluding PAA).\nPremium Amortization Expense\nIn accordance with GAAP, we amortize or accrete premiums or discounts into interest income for our Agency mortgage-backed securities, excluding interest-only securities, multifamily and reverse mortgages, taking into account estimates of future principal prepayments in the calculation of the effective yield. We recalculate the effective yield as differences between anticipated and actual prepayments occur. Using third-party model and market information to project future cash flows and expected remaining lives of securities, the effective interest rate determined for each security is applied as if it had been in place from the date of the security's acquisition. The amortized cost of the security is then adjusted to the amount that would have existed had the new effective yield been applied since the acquisition date. The adjustment to amortized cost is offset with a charge or credit to interest income. Changes in interest rates and other market factors will impact prepayment speed projections and the amount of premium amortization recognized in any given period.\nANNALY CAPITAL MANAGEMENT, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis\nOur GAAP metrics include the unadjusted impact of amortization and accretion associated with this method. Certain of our non-GAAP metrics exclude the effect of the PAA, which quantifies the component of premium amortization representing the cumulative impact on prior periods, but not the current period, of quarter-over-quarter changes in estimated long-term Constant Prepayment Rate ( CPR\u201d).\nThe following table illustrates the impact of the PAA on premium amortization expense for our Residential Securities portfolio and residential securities transferred or pledged to securitization vehicles, for the periods presented:\nTable 30: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>For the Years Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(dollars in thousands) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Premium amortization expense </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,375,461 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,113,786 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>705,926 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less: PAA cost (benefit) </td> <td>415,444 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>254,894 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(62,021) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Premium amortization expense (excluding PAA) </td> <td>$ </td> <td>960,017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>858,892 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>767,947 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 31: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nInterest income (excluding PAA), economic interest expense and economic net interest income (excluding PAA)\nInterest income (excluding PAA) represents interest income excluding the effect of the premium amortization adjustment, and serves as the basis for deriving average yield on interest earning assets (excluding PAA), net interest spread (excluding PAA) and net interest margin (excluding PAA), which are discussed below. We believe this measure provides management and investors with additional detail to enhance their understanding of our operating results and trends by excluding the component of premium amortization expense representing the cumulative effect of quarter-over-quarter changes in estimated long-term prepayment speeds related to our Agency mortgage-backed securities (other than interest-only securities, multifamily and reverse mortgages), which can obscure underlying trends in the performance of the portfolio.\nEconomic interest expense is comprised of GAAP interest expense and the net interest component of interest rate swaps. We use interest rate swaps to manage our exposure to changing interest rates on repurchase agreements by economically hedging cash flows associated with these borrowings. Accordingly, adding the net interest component of interest rate swaps to interest expense, as computed in accordance with GAAP, reflects the total contractual interest expense and thus, provides investors with additional information about the cost of our financing strategy. We may use market agreed coupon ( MAC\u201d) interest rate swaps in which we may receive or make a payment at the time of entering into such interest rate swap to compensate for the off-market nature of such interest rate swap. In accordance with GAAP, upfront payments associated with MAC interest rate swaps are not reflected in the net interest component of interest rate swaps in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss). We did not enter into any MAC interest rate swaps during the years ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019.\nSimilarly, economic net interest income (excluding PAA), as computed below, provides investors with additional information to enhance their understanding of the net economics of our primary business operations.\nThe following tables provide GAAP measures of interest expense and net interest income and details with respect to reconciling the aforementioned line items on a non-GAAP basis for each respective period:\nInterest Income (excluding PAA)\nTable 32: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>GAAP Interest Income </td> <td> </td> <td>PAA Cost\n(Benefit) </td> <td> </td> <td>Interest Income (excluding PAA) (1)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>For the years ended </td> <td>(dollars in thousands) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>December 31, 2020 </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,229,625 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>415,444 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,645,069 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>December 31, 2019 </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,787,297 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>254,894 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,042,191 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>December 31, 2018 </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,332,563 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(62,021) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,270,542 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1) Represents a non-GAAP financial measure.

The change was due to lower borrowing rates and decreases in average interest bearing liabilities, partially offset by the change in the net interest component of interest rate swaps, which was ($207.9) million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $351.4 million for the same period in 2019.\nANNALY CAPITAL MANAGEMENT, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis\nWe do not manage our portfolio to have a pre-designated amount of borrowings at quarter or year end. Our borrowings at period end are a snapshot of our borrowings as of a date, and this number may differ from average borrowings over the period for a number of reasons. The mortgage-backed securities we own pay principal and interest towards the end of each month and the mortgage-backed securities we purchase are typically settled during the beginning of the month. As a result, depending on the amount of mortgage-backed securities we have committed to purchase, we may retain the principal and interest we receive in the prior month, or we may use it to pay down our borrowings. Moreover, we generally use interest rate swaps, swaptions and other derivative instruments to hedge our portfolio, and as we pledge or receive collateral under these agreements, our borrowings on any given day may be increased or decreased. Our average borrowings during a quarter may differ from period end borrowings as we implement our portfolio management strategies and risk management strategies over changing market conditions by increasing or decreasing leverage. Additionally, these numbers may differ during periods when we conduct equity capital raises, as in certain instances we may purchase additional assets and increase leverage in anticipation of an equity capital raise. Since our average borrowings and period end borrowings can be expected to differ, we believe our average borrowings during a period provide a more accurate representation of our exposure to the risks associated with leverage than our period end borrowings.\nAt December 31, 2020 and 2019, the majority of our debt represented repurchase agreements and other secured financing arrangements collateralized by a pledge of our Residential Securities, residential mortgage loans, commercial real estate investments and corporate loans. All of our Residential Securities are currently accepted as collateral for these borrowings.

The net interest component of interest rate swaps was ($207.9) million for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $351.4 million for the same period in 2019, reflecting a decrease in rates combined with the timing of rate resets during the period and changes in notional balance. Realized gains (losses) on termination or maturity of interest rate swaps was ($1.9) billion resulting from interest rate swaps with a notional amount of $104.1 billion for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to ($1.4) billion resulting from the termination or maturity of interest rate swaps with a notional amount of $88.6 billion for the same period in 2019. Unrealized gains (losses) on interest rate swaps was ($0.9) billion for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to ($1.2) billion for the same period in 2019, which reflected a steeper decline in forward interest rates during the earlier period.\nNet gains (losses) on disposal of investments and other was $661.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared with ($47.9) million for the same period in 2019. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we disposed of Residential Securities with a carrying value of $51.8 billion for an aggregate net gain of $637.0 million.

Management's Discussion and Analysis\nNet gains (losses) on other derivatives was $756.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to ($680.8) million for the same period in 2019. The change in net gains (losses) on other derivatives was primarily comprised of changes in net gains (losses) on futures contracts, which was ($280.1) million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to ($962.7) million for the same period in 2019 and higher net gains on TBA derivatives, which was $985.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $326.8 million for the same period in 2019.\nNet unrealized gains (losses) on instruments measured at fair value through earnings was ($303.0) million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $36.0 million for the same period in 2019, primarily due to unfavorable changes in unrealized gains (losses) on Agency interest-only securities, non-Agency mortgage-backed securities, commercial securitized loans of consolidated VIEs and residential credit risk transfer securities, partially offset by favorable changes in unrealized gains (losses) on commercial debt issued by securitization vehicles for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the same period in 2019.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, a loan loss provision of ($147.6) million was recorded on commercial mortgage and corporate loans compared to ($16.6) million for the same period in 2019. Refer to the Loans\u201d Note located within Item 15 for additional information related to these loan loss provisions.\nOther Income (Loss)\nOther income (loss) includes certain revenues and costs associated with our investments in commercial real estate, including rental income and recoveries, net servicing income on MSRs, operating costs as well as depreciation and amortization expense. We report in Other income (loss) items whose amounts, either individually or in the aggregate, would not, in the opinion of management, be meaningful to readers of the financial statements. Given the nature of certain components of this line item, balances may fluctuate from period to period.\nGeneral and Administrative Expenses\nGeneral and administrative ( G&A\u201d) expenses consist of compensation and management fee (until closing of the Internalization on June 30, 2020) and other expenses.

Includes $19.3 million of transaction costs incurred in connection with securitizations of residential whole loans, commercial loans and Agency mortgage-backed securities for the year ended December 31, 2019. Excluding these transaction costs, G&A expenses as a percentage of average total assets and as a percentage of average equity were 0.23% and 1.62%, respectively, and 0.23% and 1.84%, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\n2020 Compared with 2019\nG&A expenses decreased $62.4 million to $239.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the same period in 2019. The change was primarily due to lower compensation costs, reflecting cost savings related to the Internalization and lower management fees and expense reimbursements to our Former Manager in the first half of 2020 reflecting lower adjusted stockholders' equity balances compared to the same period in 2019, and lower transaction costs during the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the same period in 2019.\nReturn on Average Equity\nThe following table shows the components of our annualized return on average equity for the periods presented.\nComponents of Annualized Return on Average Equity\nANNALY CAPITAL MANAGEMENT, INC.

As a result of this fair value accounting treatment, our book value and book value per share are likely to fluctuate far more than if we used amortized cost accounting. As a result, comparisons with companies that use amortized cost accounting for some or all of their balance sheet may not be meaningful.\nThe table below shows cumulative unrealized gains and losses on our available-for-sale investments reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition.\nTable 41: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>December 31, 2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, 2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(dollars in thousands) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unrealized gain </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,378,523 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,267,577 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unrealized loss </td> <td>(4,188) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(129,386) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,374,335 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,138,191 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nUnrealized changes in the estimated fair value of available-for-sale investments may have a direct effect on our potential earnings and dividends: positive changes will increase our equity base and allow us to increase our borrowing capacity while negative changes tend to reduce borrowing capacity. A very large negative change in the net fair value of our available-for-sale Residential Securities might impair our liquidity position, requiring us to sell assets with the potential result of realized losses upon sale.\nThe fair value of these securities being less than amortized cost at December 31, 2020 is solely due to market conditions and not the quality of the assets. Substantially all of the Agency mortgage-backed securities are AAA\u201d rated or carry an implied AAA\u201d rating. The investments are not considered to be other-than-temporarily impaired because we currently have the ability and intent to hold the investments to maturity or for a period of time sufficient for a forecasted market price recovery up to or beyond the cost of the investments, and it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell the investments before recovery of the amortized cost bases, which may be maturity. Also, we are guaranteed payment of the principal and interest amounts of the securities by the respective issuing Agency.\nANNALY CAPITAL MANAGEMENT, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis\nFinancial Condition\nTotal assets were $88.5 billion and $130.3 billion at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.

Our mortgage-backed securities were largely Freddie Mac, Fannie Mae or Ginnie Mae pass through certificates or CMOs, which carry an actual or implied AAA\u201d rating. We carry all of our Agency mortgage-backed securities at fair value on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition.\nWe accrete discount balances as an increase to interest income over the expected life of the related interest earning assets and we amortize premium balances as a decrease to interest income over the expected life of the related interest earning assets. At December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 we had on our Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition a total of $88.3 million and $156.9 million, respectively, of unamortized discount (which is the difference between the remaining principal value and current amortized cost of our Residential Securities, excluding securities transferred or pledged to securitization vehicles, acquired at a price below principal value) and a total of $4.0 billion and $5.3 billion, respectively, of unamortized premium (which is the difference between the remaining principal value and the current amortized cost of our Residential Securities, excluding securities transferred or pledged to securitization vehicles, acquired at a price above principal value).\nThe weighted average experienced prepayment speed on our Agency mortgage-backed securities portfolio for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 was 20.2% and 12.7%, respectively. The weighted average projected long-term prepayment speed on our Agency mortgage-backed securities portfolio as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 was 16.4% and 13.9%, respectively.\nGiven our current portfolio composition, if mortgage principal prepayment rates were to increase over the life of our mortgage-backed securities, all other factors being equal, our net interest income would decrease during the life of these mortgage-backed securities as we would be required to amortize our net premium balance into income over a shorter time period. Similarly, if mortgage principal prepayment rates were to decrease over the life of our mortgage-backed securities, all other factors being equal, our net interest income would increase during the life of these mortgage-backed securities as we would amortize our net premium balance over a longer time period.\nANNALY CAPITAL MANAGEMENT, INC.

We may use securitization structures, credit facilities, mortgages payable or other term financing structures to finance certain of our assets. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we received $19.6 billion from principal repayments and $52.6 billion in cash from disposal of Residential Securities. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we received $17.2 billion from principal repayments and $25.5 billion in cash from disposal of Residential Securities.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe do not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships which would have been established for the sole purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes.\nWe have limited future funding commitments related to certain of our unconsolidated joint ventures. In addition, we have provided customary non-recourse carve-out and environmental guarantees (or underlying indemnities with respect thereto) with respect to mortgage loans held by subsidiaries of these unconsolidated joint ventures. We believe that the likelihood of making any payments under these guarantees is remote, and have not accrued a related liability at December 31, 2020.\nANNALY CAPITAL MANAGEMENT, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis\nCapital Management\nMaintaining a strong balance sheet that can support the business even in times of economic stress and market volatility is of critical importance to our business strategy. A strong and robust capital position is essential to executing our investment strategy. Our capital strategy is predicated on a strong capital position, which enables us to execute our investment strategy regardless of the market environment. Our capital policy defines the parameters and principles supporting a comprehensive capital management practice.\nThe major risks impacting capital are capital, liquidity and funding risk, investment/market risk, credit risk, counterparty risk, operational risk and compliance, regulatory and legal risk. For further discussion of the risks we are subject to, please see Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d of this annual report on Form 10-K.\nCapital requirements are based on maintaining levels above approved thresholds, ensuring the quality of our capital appropriately reflects our asset mix, market and funding structure. In the event we fall short of our internal thresholds, we will consider appropriate actions which may include asset sales, changes in asset mix, reductions in asset purchases or originations, issuance of capital or other capital enhancing or risk reduction strategies.\nStockholders' Equity\nThe following table provides a summary of total stockholders' equity at December 31, 2020 and 2019:\nTable 48: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>December 31, 2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, 2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Stockholders' equity </td> <td>(dollars in thousands) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>7.50% Series D cumulative redeemable preferred stock </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>445,457 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>6.95% Series F fixed-to-floating rate cumulative redeemable preferred stock </td> <td>696,910 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>696,910 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>6.50% Series G fixed-to-floating rate cumulative redeemable preferred stock </td> <td>411,335 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>411,335 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>6.75% Series I fixed-to-floating rate cumulative redeemable preferred stock </td> <td>428,324 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>428,324 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Common stock </td> <td>13,982 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14,301 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Additional paid-in capital </td> <td>19,750,818 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>19,966,923 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) </td> <td>3,374,335 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,138,191 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Accumulated deficit </td> <td>(10,667,388) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(8,309,424) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total stockholders' equity </td> <td>$ </td> <td>14,008,316 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>15,792,017 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nANNALY CAPITAL MANAGEMENT, INC.

In connection with the offering, we granted the underwriters a thirty-day option to purchase up to an additional 11.3 million shares of common stock, which the underwriters exercised in full resulting in an additional $109.6 million in proceeds before deducting offering expenses.\nIn June 2019, we announced that our Board authorized the repurchase of up to $1.5 billion of our outstanding shares of common stock, which expired on December 31, 2020 ( the Prior Share Repurchase Program\u201d). In December 2020, we announced that our Board authorized the repurchase of up to $1.5 billion of our outstanding common shares through December 31, 2021 (the New Share Repurchase Program\u201d). The New Share Repurchase Program replaced the Prior Share Repurchase Program. During the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we repurchased 32.4 million and 26.2 million shares of our common stock for an aggregate amount of $208.9 million and $223.2 million, excluding commission costs, respectively. All common shares purchased were part of a publicly announced plans in open-market transactions.\nNo shares were issued under the at-the-market sales program during the year ended December 31, 2020. During the years ended December 31, 2019, we issued 56.0 million shares of common stock for proceeds of $569.1 million, net of commissions and fees, under the at-the-market sales program.\nNo options were exercised during the years ended December 31, 2020, and 2019.\nPreferred Stock\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company redeemed all 18.4 million of its issued and outstanding shares of 7.50% Series D Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock ( Series D Preferred Stock\u201d) for $460.0 million. The cash redemption amount for each share of Series D Preferred Stock was $25.00.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, we redeemed all 7.0 million of our issued and outstanding shares of 7.625% Series C Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock ( Series C Preferred Stock\u201d) for $175.0 million. The cash redemption amount for each share of Series C Preferred Stock was $25.00 plus accrued and unpaid dividends to, but not including, the redemption date of July 21, 2019.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, we redeemed all 2.2 million of our issued and outstanding shares of 8.125% Series H Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock ( Series H Preferred Stock\u201d) for $55.0 million. The cash redemption amount for each share of Series H Preferred Stock was $25.00 plus accrued and unpaid dividends to, but not including, the redemption date of May 31, 2019.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, we issued 17.7 million shares of our 6.750% Series I Fixed-to-Floating Rate Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock for gross proceeds of $442.5 million before deducting the underwriting discount and other estimated offering costs.\nLeverage and Capital\nWe believe that it is prudent to maintain conservative debt-to-equity and economic leverage ratios as there may be continued volatility in the mortgage and credit markets. Our capital policy governs our capital and leverage position including setting limits. Based on the guidelines, we generally expect to maintain an economic leverage ratio of less than 10:1. Our actual economic leverage ratio varies from time to time based upon various factors, including our management's opinion of the level of risk of our assets and liabilities, our liquidity position, our level of unused borrowing capacity, the availability of credit, over-collateralization levels required by lenders when we pledge assets to secure borrowings and our assessment of domestic and\nANNALY CAPITAL MANAGEMENT, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis\ninternational market conditions.\nOur debt-to-equity ratio at December 31, 2020 and 2019 was 5.1:1 and 7.1:1, respectively. Our economic leverage ratio, which is computed as the sum of Recourse Debt, cost basis of TBA derivative and CMBX notional outstanding, and net forward purchases (sales) of investments divided by total equity, at December 31, 2020 and 2019 was 6.2:1 and 7.2:1, respectively. Our capital ratio, which represents our ratio of stockholders' equity to total assets (inclusive of total market value of TBA derivatives and shown net of debt issued by securitization vehicles), was 13.6% and 12.0% at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nRisk Management\nFor more information on COVID-19, including actions we have taken in response, please refer to the section titled Business Environment and COVID-19\u201d within this Item 7.\nWe are subject to a variety of risks in the ordinary conduct of our business. The effective management of these risks is of critical importance to the overall success of Annaly. The objective of our risk management framework is to identify, measure and monitor these risks.\nOur risk management framework is intended to facilitate a holistic, enterprise wide view of risk. We have built a strong and collaborative risk management culture throughout Annaly focused on awareness which supports appropriate understanding and management of our key risks. Each employee is accountable for identifying, monitoring and managing risk within their area of responsibility.\nRisk Appetite\nWe maintain a firm-wide risk appetite statement which defines the types and levels of risk we are willing to take in order to achieve our business objectives, and reflects our risk management philosophy. We engage in risk activities based on our core expertise that aim to enhance value for our stockholders. Our activities focus on income generation and capital preservation through proactive portfolio management, supported by a conservative liquidity and leverage posture.\nThe risk appetite statement asserts the following key risk parameters to guide our investment management activities:\nTable 50: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Risk Parameter </td> <td> </td> <td>Description </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Portfolio Composition </td> <td> </td> <td>We will maintain a portfolio comprised of target assets approved by our Board and in accordance with our capital allocation policy. </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Leverage </td> <td> </td> <td>We generally expect to maintain an economic leverage ratio no greater than 10:1. </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Liquidity Risk </td> <td> </td> <td>We will seek to maintain an unencumbered asset portfolio sufficient to meet our liquidity needs under adverse market conditions. </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest Rate Risk </td> <td> </td> <td>We will seek to manage interest rate risk to protect the portfolio from adverse rate movements utilizing derivative instruments targeting both income and capital preservation. </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Credit Risk </td> <td> </td> <td>We will seek to manage credit risk by making investments which conform within our specific investment policy parameters and optimize risk-adjusted returns. </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capital Preservation </td> <td> </td> <td>We will seek to protect our capital base through disciplined risk management practices. </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Compliance </td> <td> </td> <td>We will seek to comply with regulatory requirements needed to maintain our REIT status and our exemption from registration under the Investment Company Act. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nGovernance\nRisk management begins with our Board, through the review and oversight of the risk management framework, and executive management, through the ongoing formulation of risk management practices and related execution in managing risk. The Board exercises its oversight of risk management primarily through the Board Risk Committee ( BRC\u201d) and Board Audit Committee ( BAC\u201d) with support from the other Board Committees. The BRC is responsible for oversight of our risk governance structure, risk management and risk assessment guidelines and policies and our risk appetite. The BAC is responsible for oversight of the quality and integrity of our accounting, internal controls and financial reporting practices, including independent auditor selection, evaluation and review, and oversight of the internal audit function. The Management Development and Compensation Committee is responsible for oversight of risk related to our compensation policies and practices. The Corporate Responsibility Committee assists the Board in its oversight of any matters that may present reputational or ESG risk to us, and\nANNALY CAPITAL MANAGEMENT, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis\nthe Nominating/Corporate Governance Committee assists the Board in its oversight of our corporate governance framework and the annual self-evaluation of the Board.\nRisk assessment and risk management are the responsibility of our management. A series of management committees has oversight or decision-making responsibilities for risk management activities. Membership of these committees is reviewed regularly to ensure the appropriate personnel are engaged in the risk management process. Four primary management committees have been established to provide a comprehensive framework for risk management. The management committees responsible for our risk management include the Enterprise Risk Committee ( ERC\u201d), Asset and Liability Committee ( ALCO\u201d), Investment Committee and the Financial Reporting and Disclosure Committee ( FRDC\u201d). Each of these committees reports to our management Operating Committee which is responsible for oversight and management of our operations, including oversight and approval authority over all aspects of our enterprise risk management.\nAudit Services is an independent function with reporting lines to the BAC. Audit Services is responsible for performing our internal audit activities, which includes independently assessing and validating key controls within the risk management framework.\nOur compliance group is responsible for oversight of our regulatory compliance. Our Chief Compliance Officer has reporting lines to the BAC.\nDescription of Risks\nWe are subject to a variety of risks due to the business we operate. Risk categories are an important component of a robust enterprise wide risk management framework.\nWe have identified the following primary categories that we utilize to identify, assess, measure and monitor risk.\nANNALY CAPITAL MANAGEMENT, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis\nTable 51: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Risk </td> <td> </td> <td>Description </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Capital, Liquidity and Funding Risk </td> <td> </td> <td>Risk to earnings, capital or business resulting from our inability to meet our obligations when they come due without incurring unacceptable losses because of inability to liquidate assets or obtain adequate funding. </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investment/Market Risk </td> <td> </td> <td>Risk to earnings, capital or business resulting in the decline in value of our assets or an increase in the costs of financing caused by changes in market variables, such as interest rates, which affect the values of investment securities and other investment instruments. </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Credit Risk </td> <td> </td> <td>Risk to earnings, capital or business resulting from an obligor's failure to meet the terms of any contract or otherwise failure to perform as agreed.

Our capital, liquidity and funding risk management practices consist of the following primary elements:\nTable 52: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Element </td> <td> </td> <td>Description </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Funding </td> <td> </td> <td>Availability of diverse and stable sources of funds. </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Excess Liquidity </td> <td> </td> <td>Excess liquidity primarily in the form of unencumbered assets and cash. </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Maturity Profile </td> <td> </td> <td>Diversity and tenor of liabilities and modest use of leverage. </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Stress Testing </td> <td> </td> <td>Scenario modeling to measure the resiliency of our liquidity position. </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Liquidity Management Policies </td> <td> </td> <td>Comprehensive policies including monitoring, risk limits and an escalation protocol. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nFunding\nOur primary financing sources are repurchase agreements provided through counterparty arrangements and through Arcola, other secured financing, debt issued by securitization vehicles, mortgages, credit facilities, note sales and various forms of equity. We maintain excess liquidity by holding unencumbered liquid assets that could be either used to collateralize additional borrowings or sold.\nWe seek to conservatively manage our repurchase agreement funding position through a variety of methods including diversity, breadth and depth of counterparties and maintaining a staggered maturity profile.\nOur wholly-owned subsidiary, Arcola, provides direct access to third party funding as a FINRA member broker-dealer. Arcola borrows funds through the General Collateral Finance Repo service offered by the FICC, with FICC acting as the central counterparty. In addition, Arcola has borrowed funds through direct repurchase agreements.\nTo reduce our liquidity risk we maintain a laddered approach to our repurchase agreements. At December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, the weighted average days to maturity was 64 days and 65 days, respectively.\nOur repurchase agreements generally provide that in the event of a margin call we must provide additional securities or cash on the same business day that a margin call is made. Should prepayment speeds on the mortgages underlying our Agency and Residential mortgage-backed securities and/or market interest rates or other factors move suddenly and cause declines in the market value of assets posted as collateral, resulting margin calls may cause an adverse change in our liquidity position.\nAt December 31, 2020, we had total financial assets and cash pledged against existing liabilities of $71.7 billion. The weighted average haircut was approximately 4% on repurchase agreements. The quality and character of the Residential Securities and commercial real estate investments that we pledge as collateral under the repurchase agreements and interest rate swaps did not materially change at December 31, 2020 compared to the same period in 2019.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis\nMaturity Profile\nWe consider the profile of our assets, liabilities and derivatives when managing both liquidity risk as well as investment/market risk employing a measurement of both the maturity gap and interest rate sensitivity gap. We determine the amount of liquid assets that are required to be held by monitoring several liquidity metrics. We utilize several modeling techniques to analyze our current and potential obligations including the expected cash flows from our assets, liabilities and derivatives. The following table illustrates the expected final maturities and cash flows of our assets, liabilities and derivatives. The table is based on a static portfolio and assumes no reinvestment of asset cash flows and no future liabilities are entered into. In assessing the maturity of our assets, liabilities and off balance sheet obligations, we use the stated maturities, or our prepayment expectations for assets and liabilities that exhibit prepayment characteristics. Cash and cash equivalents are included in the \u2018Less than 3 Months' maturity bucket, as they are typically held for a short period of time.\nWith respect to each maturity bucket, our maturity gap is considered negative when the amount of maturing liabilities exceeds the amount of maturing assets. A negative gap increases our liquidity risk as we must enter into future liabilities. Our interest rate sensitivity gap is the difference between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities maturing or re-pricing within a given time period. Unlike the calculation of maturity gap, interest rate sensitivity gap includes the effect of our interest rate swaps. A gap is considered positive when the amount of interest-rate sensitive assets exceeds the amount of interest-rate sensitive liabilities. A gap is considered negative when the amount of interest-rate sensitive liabilities exceeds interest-rate sensitive assets. During a period of rising interest rates, a negative gap would tend to adversely affect net interest income, while a positive gap would tend to result in an increase in net interest income. During a period of falling interest rates, a negative gap would tend to result in an increase in net interest income, while a positive gap would tend to affect net interest income adversely. Because different types of assets and liabilities with the same or similar maturities may react differently to changes in overall market rates or conditions, changes in interest rates may affect net interest income positively or negatively even if assets and liabilities were perfectly matched in each maturity category. The amount of assets and liabilities utilized to compute our interest rate sensitivity gap was determined in accordance with the contractual terms of the assets and liabilities, except that adjustable-rate loans and securities are included in the period in which their interest rates are first scheduled to adjust and not in the period in which they mature. The effects of interest rate swaps, whereby we generally pay a fixed rate and receive a floating rate and effectively lock in our financing costs for a longer term, are also reflected in our interest rate sensitivity gap.\nThe interest rate sensitivity of our assets and liabilities in the following table at December 31, 2020 could vary substantially based on actual prepayment experience.\nANNALY CAPITAL MANAGEMENT, INC.

These stress tests assist with the management of our pool of liquid assets and influence our current and future funding plans. Our stress tests are modeled over both short term and longer time horizons. The stresses applied include market-wide and firm-specific stresses.\nLiquidity Management Policies\nWe utilize a comprehensive liquidity policy structure to inform our liquidity risk management practices including monitoring and measurement, along with well-defined key risk indicators. Both quantitative and qualitative targets are utilized to measure the ongoing stability and condition of the liquidity position, and include the level and composition of unencumbered assets, as well as both short-term and long-term sustainability of the funding composition under stress conditions.\nWe also monitor early warning metrics designed to measure the quality and depth of liquidity sources based upon both company-specific and market conditions. The metrics assist in assessing our liquidity conditions and are integrated into our escalation protocol.\nANNALY CAPITAL MANAGEMENT, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis\nInvestment/Market Risk Management\nOne of the primary risks we are subject to is investment/market risk. Changes in the level of interest rates can affect our net interest income, which is the difference between the income we earn on our interest earning assets and the interest expense incurred from interest bearing liabilities and derivatives. Changes in the level of interest rates and spreads can also affect the value of our securities and potential realization of gains or losses from the sale of these assets. We may utilize a variety of financial instruments, including interest rate swaps, swaptions, options, futures and other hedges, in order to limit the adverse effects of interest rates on our results. In the case of interest rate swaps, we utilize contracts linked to LIBOR but may also enter into interest rate swaps where the floating leg is linked to the overnight index swap rate or another index, particularly in light of a potential transition away from LIBOR. In addition, we may use MAC interest rate swaps in which we may receive or make a payment at the time of entering such interest rate swap to compensate for the off-market nature of such interest rate swap. MAC interest rate swaps offer price transparency, flexibility and more efficient portfolio administration through compression which is the process of reducing the number of unique interest rate swap contracts and replacing them with fewer contracts containing market defined terms. Our portfolio and the value of our portfolio, including derivatives, may be adversely affected as a result of changing interest rates and spreads.\nWe simulate a wide variety of interest rate scenarios in evaluating our risk. Scenarios are run to capture our sensitivity to changes in interest rates, spreads and the shape of the yield curve. We also consider the assumptions affecting our analysis such as those related to prepayments. In addition to predefined interest rate scenarios, we utilize Value-at-Risk measures to estimate potential losses in the portfolio over various time horizons utilizing various confidence levels. The following tables estimate the potential changes in economic net interest income over a twelve month period and the immediate effect on our portfolio market value (inclusive of derivative instruments), should interest rates instantaneously increase or decrease by 25, 50 or 75 basis points, and the effect of portfolio market value if mortgage option-adjusted spreads instantaneously increase or decrease by 5, 15 or 25 basis points (assuming shocks are parallel and instantaneous). All changes to income and portfolio market value are measured as percentage changes from the projected net interest income and portfolio value at the base interest rate scenario. The net interest income simulations incorporate the interest expense effect of rate resets on liabilities and derivatives as well as the amortization expense and reinvestment of principal based on the prepayments on our securities, which varies based on the level of rates. The results assume no management actions in response to the rate or spread changes. The following table presents estimates at December 31, 2020. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates.\nTable 60: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Change in Interest Rate (1)\n</td> <td>Projected Percentage Change in Economic Net Interest Income (2)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>Estimated Percentage Change in Portfolio Value (3)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>Estimated Change as a\n% on NAV (3)(4)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>-75 Basis points </td> <td>(34.3%) </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.2)% </td> <td> </td> <td>(1.3%) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>-50 Basis points </td> <td>(22.7%) </td> <td> </td> <td>-% </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.2)% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>-25 Basis points </td> <td>(11.2%) </td> <td> </td> <td>0.1% </td> <td> </td> <td>0.7% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>+25 Basis points </td> <td>7.1% </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.1%) </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.5%) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>+50 Basis points </td> <td>13.5% </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.2%) </td> <td> </td> <td>(1.3%) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>+75 Basis points </td> <td>20.2% </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.4%) </td> <td> </td> <td>(2.7%) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>MBS Spread Shock (1)\n</td> <td>Estimated Change in\nPortfolio Market Value </td> <td> </td> <td>Estimated Change as a %\non NAV (3)(4)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>-25 Basis points </td> <td>1.5% </td> <td> </td> <td>9.0% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>-15 Basis points </td> <td>0.9% </td> <td> </td> <td>5.4% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>-5 Basis points </td> <td>0.3% </td> <td> </td> <td>1.8% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>+5 Basis points </td> <td>(0.3%) </td> <td> </td> <td>(1.8%) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>+15 Basis points </td> <td>(0.9%) </td> <td> </td> <td>(5.3%) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>+25 Basis points </td> <td>(1.5%) </td> <td> </td> <td>(8.9%) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1) Interest rate and MBS spread sensitivity are based on results from third party models in conjunction with inputs from our internal investment professionals.

We seek to manage credit risk by making investments which conform within the firm's specific investment policy parameters and optimize risk-return attributes.\nWhile we do not expect to encounter credit risk in our Agency mortgage-backed securities, we face credit risk on the non-Agency mortgage-backed securities and CRT securities in our portfolio. In addition, we are also exposed to credit risk on\nANNALY CAPITAL MANAGEMENT, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis\nresidential mortgage loans, commercial real estate investments and corporate debt. MSR values may also be impacted if overall costs to service the underlying mortgage loans increase due to borrower performance. We are subject to risk of loss if an issuer or borrower fails to perform its contractual obligations. We have established policies and procedures for mitigating credit risk, including establishing and reviewing limits for credit exposure. We will originate or purchase commercial investments that meet our comprehensive underwriting process and credit standards and are approved by the appropriate committee. Once a commercial investment is made, our ongoing surveillance process includes regular reviews, analysis and oversight of investments by our investment personnel and appropriate committee. We review credit and other risks of loss associated with each investment. Our management monitors the overall portfolio risk and determines estimates of provision for loss. Additionally, ALCO has oversight of our credit risk exposure.\nOur portfolio composition, based on balance sheet values, at December 31, 2020 and 2019 was as follows:\nTable 61: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>December 31, 2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, 2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Category </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Agency mortgage-backed securities </td> <td>86.4 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>89.5 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Credit risk transfer securities </td> <td>0.6 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>0.4 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-agency mortgage-backed securities </td> <td>1.1 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>0.9 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Residential mortgage loans(1)\n</td> <td>4.2 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>3.3 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Mortgage servicing rights </td> <td>0.1 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>0.3 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial real estate (1) (2)\n</td> <td>5.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>3.9 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Corporate debt </td> <td>2.6 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>1.7 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1) Includes assets transferred or pledged to securitization vehicles.\n(2) Net of unamortized origination fees.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nANNALY CAPITAL MANAGEMENT, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis\nCounterparty Risk Management\nOur use of repurchase and derivative agreements and trading activities create exposure to counterparty risk relating to potential losses that could be recognized if the counterparties to these agreements fail to perform their obligations under the contracts. In the event of default by a counterparty, we could have difficulty obtaining our assets pledged as collateral. A significant portion of our investments are financed with repurchase agreements by pledging our Residential Securities and certain commercial real estate investments as collateral to the applicable lender. The collateral we pledge generally exceeds the amount of the borrowings under each agreement. If the counterparty to the repurchase agreement defaults on its obligations and we are not able to recover our pledged asset, we are at risk of losing the over-collateralization or haircut. The amount of this exposure is the difference between the amount loaned to us plus interest due to the counterparty and the fair value of the collateral pledged by us to the lender including accrued interest receivable on such collateral.\nWe also use interest rate swaps and other derivatives to manage interest rate risk. Under these agreements, we pledge securities and cash as collateral or settle variation margin payments as part of a margin arrangement.\nIf a counterparty were to default on its obligations, we would be exposed to a loss to a derivative counterparty to the extent that the amount of our securities or cash pledged exceeded the unrealized loss on the associated derivative and we were not able to recover the excess collateral. Additionally, we would be exposed to a loss to a derivative counterparty to the extent that our unrealized gains on derivative instruments exceeded the amount of the counterparty's securities or cash pledged to us.\nWe monitor our exposure to counterparties across several dimensions including by type of arrangement, collateral type, counterparty type, ratings and geography. Additionally, ALCO has oversight of our counterparty exposure.\nThe following table summarizes our exposure to counterparties by geography at December 31, 2020:\nTable 62: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Number of Counterparties </td> <td> </td> <td>Secured Financing (1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>Interest Rate Swaps at Fair Value </td> <td> </td> <td>Exposure - Secured Financing (2)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>Exposure - Interest Rate Swaps (2)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Geography </td> <td>(dollars in thousands) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>North America </td> <td>24 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>52,983,020 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(361,964) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,920,875 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(1,620,846) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Europe </td> <td>10 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9,044,400 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(644,528) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,894,424 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(905,245) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Japan </td> <td>4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,715,695 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>205,019 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total </td> <td>38 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>65,743,115 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(1,006,492) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>6,020,318 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(2,526,091) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(1) Includes repurchase agreements and other secured financing.\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(2) Represents the amount of cash and/or securities pledged as collateral to each counterparty less the aggregate of repurchase agreement and other secured financing and unrealized loss on swaps for each counterparty.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperational Risk Management\nWe are subject to operational risk in each of our business and support functions. Operational risk may arise from internal or external sources including human error, fraud, systems issues, process change, vendors, business interruptions and other external events. Model risk considers potential errors with a model's results due to uncertainty in model parameters and inappropriate methodologies used. The result of these risks may include financial loss and reputational damage. We manage operational risk through a variety of tools including policies and procedures that cover topics such as business continuity, personal conduct, cybersecurity and vendor management. Other tools include testing, including disaster recovery testing; systems controls, including access controls; training, including cybersecurity awareness training; and monitoring, which includes the use of key risk indicators. Employee-level lines of defense against operational risk include proper segregation of incompatible duties, activity-level internal controls over financial reporting, the empowerment of business units to identify and mitigate operational risk sources, testing by our internal audit staff, and our overall governance framework.\nWe have established a Cybersecurity Committee to help mitigate cybersecurity risks. The role of the committee is to oversee cyber risk assessments, monitor applicable key risk indicators, review cybersecurity training procedures, oversee our Cybersecurity Incident Response Plan and engage third parties to conduct periodic penetration testing. Our cybersecurity risk assessment includes an evaluation of cyber risk related to sensitive data held by third parties on their systems. The Cybersecurity Committee periodically reports to the ERC, and the Board via the BRC and the BAC. There is no assurance that these efforts will effectively mitigate cybersecurity risk and mitigation efforts are not an assurance that no cybersecurity incidents will occur. We currently maintain cybersecurity insurance, however, there is no assurance that the insurance policy will cover all cybersecurity breaches or that the policy will cover all losses.\nANNALY CAPITAL MANAGEMENT, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis\nCompliance, Regulatory and Legal Risk Management\nOur business is organized as a REIT, and we seek to continue to meet the requirements for taxation as a REIT. The determination that we are a REIT requires an analysis of various factual matters and circumstances. Accordingly, we closely monitor our REIT status within our risk management program. We also regularly assess our risk management in respect of our regulated and licensed subsidiaries, which include our registered broker-dealer subsidiary Arcola and our subsidiary that is registered with the SEC as an investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act.\nThe financial services industry is highly regulated and receives significant attention from regulators, which may impact both our company as well as our business strategy. We proactively monitor the potential impact regulation may have both directly and indirectly on us. We maintain a process to actively monitor both actual and potential legal action that may affect us. Our risk management framework is designed to identify, measure and monitor these risks under the oversight of the ERC.\nWe currently rely on the exemption from registration provided by Section 3(c)(5)(C) of the Investment Company Act, and we seek to continue to meet the requirements for this exemption from registration. The determination that we qualify for this exemption from registration depends on various factual matters and circumstances. Accordingly, in conjunction with our legal department, we closely monitor our compliance with Section 3(c)(5)(C) within our risk management program. The monitoring of this risk is also under the oversight of the ERC.\nAs a result of the Dodd-Frank Act, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission ( CFTC\u201d) gained jurisdiction over the regulation of interest rate swaps. The CFTC has asserted that this causes the operators of mortgage real estate investment trusts that use swaps as part of their business model to fall within the statutory definition of Commodity Pool Operator ( CPO\u201d), and, absent relief from the Division of Swap Dealer and Intermediary Oversight or the CFTC, to register as CPOs. On December 7, 2012, as a result of numerous requests for no-action relief from the CPO registration requirement for operators of mortgage real estate investment trusts, the Division of Swap Dealer and Intermediary Oversight of the CFTC issued no-action relief entitled No-Action Relief from the Commodity Pool Operator Registration Requirement for Commodity Pool Operators of Certain Pooled Investment Vehicles Organized as Mortgage Real Estate Investment Trusts\u201d that permits a CPO to receive relief by filing a claim to perfect the use of the relief. A claim submitted by a CPO will be effective upon filing, so long as the claim is materially complete. The conditions that must be met relate to initial margin and premiums requirements, net income derived annually from commodity interest positions that are not qualifying hedging transactions, marketing of interests in the mortgage real estate investment trust to the public, and identification of the entity as a mortgage real estate investment trust in its federal tax filings with the Internal Revenue Service. While we disagree with the CFTC's position that mortgage REITs that use swaps as part of their business model fall within the statutory definition of a CPO, we have submitted a claim for the relief set forth in the no-action relief entitled No-Action Relief from the Commodity Pool Operator Registration Requirement for Commodity Pool Operators of Certain Pooled Investment Vehicles Organized as Mortgage Real Estate Investment Trusts\u201d and believe we meet the criteria for such relief set forth therein.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur critical accounting policies that require us to make significant judgments or estimates are described below. For more information on these critical accounting policies and other significant accounting policies, see Significant Accounting Policies\u201d in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nValuation of Financial Instruments\nResidential Securities\nThere is an active market for our Agency mortgage-backed securities, CRT securities and non-Agency mortgage-backed securities. Since we primarily invest in securities that can be valued using actively quoted prices for actively traded assets, there is a high degree of observable inputs and less subjectivity in measuring fair value. Internal fair values are determined using quoted prices from the TBA securities market, the Treasury curve and the underlying characteristics of the individual securities, which may include coupon, periodic and life caps, reset dates and the expected life of the security. While prepayment rates may be difficult to predict and require estimation and judgment in the valuation of Agency mortgage-backed securities, we use several third party models to validate prepayment speeds used in fair value measurements of residential securities. All internal fair values are compared to external pricing sources and/or dealer quotes to determine reasonableness. Additionally, securities used as collateral for repurchase agreements are priced daily by counterparties to ensure sufficient collateralization, providing additional verification of our internal pricing.\nANNALY CAPITAL MANAGEMENT, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis\nResidential Mortgage Loans\nThere is an active market for the residential whole loans in which we invest. Since we primarily invest in residential loans that can be valued using actively quoted prices for similar assets, there are observable inputs in measuring fair value. Internal fair values are determined using quoted prices for similar market transactions, the swap curve and the underlying characteristics of the individual loans, which may include loan term, coupon, and reset dates. While prepayment rates may be difficult to predict and are a significant estimate requiring judgment in the valuation of residential whole loans, we validate prepayment speeds against those provided by independent pricing analytic providers specializing in residential mortgage loans. Internal fair values are generally compared to external pricing sources to determine reasonableness.\nMSRs\nFair value estimates for our investment in MSRs are obtained from models, which use significant unobservable inputs in their valuations. These valuations primarily utilize discounted cash flow models that incorporate unobservable market data inputs including prepayment rates, delinquency levels, costs to service and discount rates. Model valuations are then compared to valuations obtained from third-party pricing providers. Management reviews the valuations received from third-party pricing providers and uses them as a point of comparison to modeled values. The valuation of MSRs requires significant judgment by management and the third-party pricing providers.\nCommercial Real Estate Investments\nThe fair value of commercial mortgage-backed securities classified as available-for-sale is determined based upon quoted prices of similar assets in recent market transactions and requires the application of judgment due to differences in the underlying collateral. These securities must also be evaluated for impairment if the fair value of the security is lower than its amortized cost. Determining whether there is an other-than-temporary impairment may require us to exercise significant judgment and make estimates to determine expected cash flows incorporating assumptions such as changes in interest rates and loss expectations. For commercial real estate loans and preferred equity investments classified as held for investment, we apply significant judgment in evaluating the need for a loss reserve. Estimated net recoverable value of the commercial real estate loans and preferred equity investments and other factors such as the fair value of any collateral, the amount and status of senior debt, the prospects of the borrower and the competitive landscape where the borrower conducts business must be considered in determining the allowance for loan losses. For commercial real estate loans held for sale, significant judgment may need to be applied in determining the fair value of the loans and whether a valuation allowance is necessary. Factors that may need to be considered to determine the fair value of a loan held for sale include the borrower's credit quality, liquidity and other market factors and the fair value of the underlying collateral.\nInterest Rate Swaps\nWe use the overnight indexed swap ( OIS\u201d) curve as an input to value substantially all of our uncleared interest rate swaps. We believe using the OIS curve, which reflects the interest rate typically paid on cash collateral, enables us to most accurately determine the fair value of uncleared interest rate swaps. Consistent with market practice, we exchange collateral (also called margin) based on the fair values of our interest rate swaps. Through this margining process, we may be able to compare our recorded fair value with the fair value calculated by the counterparty or derivatives clearing organization, providing additional verification of our recorded fair value of the uncleared interest rate swaps. We value our cleared interest rate swaps using the prices provided by the derivatives clearing organization.\nRevenue Recognition\nInterest income from coupon payments is accrued based on the outstanding principal amounts of the Residential Securities and their contractual terms. Premiums and discounts associated with the purchase of the Residential Securities are amortized or accreted into interest income over the projected lives of the securities using the interest method. To aid in determining projected lives of the securities, we use third-party model and market information to project prepayment speeds. Our prepayment speed projections incorporate underlying loan characteristics (i.e., coupon, term, original loan size, original loan-to-value ratio, etc.) and market data, including interest rate and home price index forecasts and expert judgment. Prepayment speeds vary according to the type of investment, conditions in the financial markets and other factors and cannot be predicted with any certainty. Changes to model assumptions, including interest rates and other market data, as well as periodic revisions to the model will cause changes in the results. Adjustments are made for actual prepayment activity as it relates to calculating the effective yield. Gains or losses on sales of Residential Securities are recorded on trade date based on the specific identification method.\nANNALY CAPITAL MANAGEMENT, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis\nConsolidation of Variable Interest Entities\nDetermining whether an entity has a controlling financial interest in a VIE requires significant judgment related to assessing the purpose and design of the VIE and determination of the activities that most significantly impact its economic performance. We must also identify explicit and implicit variable interests in the entity and consider our involvement in both the design of the VIE and its ongoing activities. To determine whether consolidation of the VIE is required, we must apply judgment to assess whether we have the power to direct the most significant activities of the VIE and whether we have either the rights to receive benefits or the obligation to absorb losses that could be potentially significant to the VIE.\nUse of Estimates\nThe use of GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates.\nANNALY CAPITAL MANAGEMENT, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nItem 7.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis\n\nANNALY CAPITAL MANAGEMENT, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis\nOverview\nWe are a leading diversified capital manager that invests in and finances residential and commercial assets. Our principal business objective is to generate net income for distribution to our stockholders and optimize our returns through prudent management of our diversified investment strategies. We are an internally-managed Maryland corporation founded in 1997 that has elected to be taxed as a REIT. Prior to the closing of the Internalization (as defined in Item 1 under Closing of the Internalization and Termination of the Management Agreement\u201d) on June 30, 2020, we were externally managed by Annaly Management Company LLC (our Former Manager\u201d). Our common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol NLY.\u201d\nWe use our capital coupled with borrowed funds to invest primarily in real estate related investments, earning the spread between the yield on our assets and the cost of our borrowings and hedging activities.\nFor a full discussion of our business, refer to the section titled Business Overview\u201d of Part I, Item 1. Business.\u201d\nBusiness Environment and COVID-19\nThe themes that have dominated financial markets since the elevated volatility seen in March and April 2020 remain unchanged. Fiscal stimulus has supported businesses and consumers most negatively impacted by COVID-19 while the Federal Reserve's ( Fed\u201d) unprecedented monetary policy actions eased financial conditions and contained interest rate volatility. These factors drove our strong performance to close out the year, delivering an economic return of 5.1% for the fourth quarter and 1.8% for 2020. Throughout the year, we returned $1.4 billion aggregate in common and preferred dividends to our shareholders, signaling meaningful resilience following the historic disruption seen in March and April.\nInterest rates ended 2020 near their highest levels since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic reflecting optimism about the post-COVID recovery in spite of negative developments of record U.S. virus cases, tighter restrictions and resulting lackluster economic growth particularly in the U.S. service sector. The rapid COVID-19 vaccine development and plans for deployment, combined with the relatively healthy consumer balance sheets, suggest that the U.S. economy may rebound at a faster pace than during traditional economic downturns once a majority of the population reaches immunity, though meaningful uncertainties remain about both the timing of immunity and the subsequent recovery pace.\nAt the end of 2020, our capital allocation remained tilted towards Agency mortgage-backed securities ( MBS\u201d), representing 78% of the aggregate portfolio, compared to 74% one year ago. However, this year-over-year snapshot masks more recent increases in activity in our residential credit and middle market lending businesses, which saw strong investor sponsorship and improving fundamentals as markets signal a cyclical recovery. As Agency MBS spreads have continued to tighten given Fed and bank sector demand for the product, select credit sectors have allowed for targeted, attractive opportunities. While opportunistic, Annaly continues with its disciplined and defensive-minded credit focus, which is necessary given overall tight asset spreads.\nSomewhat offsetting the effect from tight asset spreads, current financing conditions are among the most favorable seen in Annaly's history. The liquidity created through the Fed's monetary policy actions have led to absolute low level of rates and a flat term structure of the repo curve. Favorable financing conditions have allowed us to increase our net interest margin (excluding PAA) from 1.41% at the end of 2019 to 1.98% at the end of 2020, as cheaper financing more than offset the decline in asset yields driven by the aforementioned spread compression. Additionally, securitization markets have rebounded substantially, resulting in better execution levels than one year ago, and provide attractive non-recourse term financing to bolster our residential credit asset investment strategy and diversify financing for our whole loan business.\nBusiness Continuity\nOur well-established Business Continuity Planning ( BCP\u201d) was designed to ensure continued, effective operations through a variety of scenarios including natural disasters and disease pandemics. It identifies critical systems, processes, roles and third parties, and can be adjusted on a real-time basis to address situations as they arise.\nThe BCP is regularly updated and tested. Annual testing includes extensive, remote Disaster Recovery testing and tabletop exercise scenarios with management. Key tenets of the planning include active communication between our Crisis Response Team, which is comprised of senior leaders across a number of functions, and our internal and external stakeholders to afford efficient, thoughtful, effective responses to evolving emergency situations.\nHistorical tabletop exercises have included use of CDC Influenza Pandemic exercise materials. That exercise documented our response and possible impacts to a variety of scenarios, including those in which shelter in place orders\u201d were required and response/ impact assessments to those scenarios. Regular meetings were commenced to implement and review active internal and external communications planning. These exercises, along with regulatory and industry guidance, informed our staged response to the conditions created by COVID-19. We took proactive actions, which included canceling non-essential travel and instituting 100% remote working, ahead of New York State-mandated requirements. To protect the health and well-being of our employees, their families and communities remote work requirements began in phases in early March, culminating with a\nANNALY CAPITAL MANAGEMENT, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis\ncompany-wide exercise on March 13, 2020 to test connectivity and functionality. All employees were able to successfully perform their duties in this testing and we have operated largely remotely since that time.\nA majority of our business activities continues to be performed remotely, though we have seen a limited number of employees return to the office on a voluntary and periodic basis. We continue to monitor guidance from federal, state and local authorities to gauge how to further proceed in any efforts to return to the office.\nEconomic Environment\nThe pace of economic growth in 2020 slowed sharply, not only in the United States but worldwide, as the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic affected nearly all ways of life and disrupted many aspects of the economy. The far-reaching consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic led U.S. gross domestic product ( GDP\u201d) to decline by 3.5% year-over-year in 2020, in turn marking the largest decline in economic activity during a calendar year in more than 70 years. The disruptions caused by the pandemic were unique in that they primarily impacted the service sector of the economy, a sector that has been a source of relative stability during prior economic downturns. Other parts of the economy, including goods consumption and housing, have recovered from the initial pandemic-driven downturn and these sectors are now above 2019 output levels. All of this suggests that the economy is currently relatively bifurcated, requiring U.S. health officials to work to defeat the virus before economic activity can return to pre-pandemic levels in aggregate.\nThe sharp economic contraction led the unemployment rate to rise to 6.7% in December 2020, nearly twice as high as the unemployment rate seen in December 2019 according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The rise in the unemployment rate likely understates the number of jobs lost in 2020 as the employment-to-population ratio fell to 57.4%, suggesting that 3.5% of the population, or roughly 9 million people, no longer held a job at the end of 2020 compared to one year ago. Wage growth, as measured by the year-over-year change in private sector average hourly earnings rose sharply, reading 5.1% in the month of December 2020 compared to 3.0% in December 2019. The sharp increase in wages, however, appears to be driven by changes in the underlying composition of employees by industry, as sectors with generally lower wages, such as leisure and hospitality services, have seen outsized job losses relative to sectors with higher wages. Alternative measures of wage growth, such as the Employment Cost Index or the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta's Wage Tracker show meaningfully less wage growth.\nInflation remained muted into the economic downturn as measured by the year-over-year changes in the Personal Consumption Expenditure Chain Price Index ( PCE\u201d). The headline PCE measure increased by 1.3% year-over-year in December 2020. The more stable core PCE measure, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, registered a similar 1.5% year-over-year increase. Although both inflation measures remain somewhat below the Fed's 2.0% inflation target, the Fed expects inflation to recover towards its target in coming years as the economy begins to recover from the economic downturn.\nThe Fed conducts monetary policy with a dual mandate: full employment and price stability. Given the contraction in economic activity witnessed following the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Fed increased its monetary policy support at unprecedented speed and size. The target range for the Federal Funds rate was cut from 1.50% - 1.75% in December 2019 to 0.0% - 0.25% in March 2020. Following the interest rate cuts, the Fed provided guidance that short-term interest rates will remain near current levels until labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with the Fed assessments of maximum employment and inflation has risen to 2 percent and is on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time\u201d as stated in the December 2020 Federal Open Market Committee meeting statement. In addition to the zero-interest rate policy, the Fed restarted its asset purchase programs, increasing its holdings of Treasury securities and Agency MBS by a total of $2.0 trillion and $631 billion, respectively. Asset purchases continued at the end of 2020 at a pace of $80 billion per month in Treasury securities and $40 billion per month in MBS. Beyond rate policy and asset purchases, the Fed also announced several lending programs to various other market sectors, such as corporate bonds, municipals, and small businesses, among others. These lending programs largely concluded their activities at the end of December 2020 but could be revived should the economic situation deteriorate.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, yields on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note declined by 101 bps primarily in the first half of the year as a sharp slowdown in global economic growth and heightened uncertainties around the economic recovery led to strong demand for interest rate products and the aforementioned unprecedented fiscal and monetary stimulus. The mortgage basis, or the spread between the 30-year Agency MBS coupon and 10-year U.S. Treasury rate, had a volatile year, rising meaningfully in the first quarter before retracing given strong demand for MBS in the second half of the year.\nThe following table below presents interest rates and spreads at each date presented:\nANNALY CAPITAL MANAGEMENT, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis\n\nLondon Interbank Offered Rate ( LIBOR\u201d) Transition Working Group\nWe have established a cross-functional LIBOR transition committee to determine our transition plan and facilitate an orderly transition to alternative reference rates. Our plan includes steps to evaluate exposure, review contracts, assess impact to our business, process and technology and define a communication strategy with shareholders, regulators and other stakeholders. The committee also continues to engage with industry working groups and other market participants regarding the transition. In October 2020, as part of the transition from LIBOR, we participated in the Chicago Mercantile Exchange ( CME\u201d) Group's transitioning for price alignment and discounting for USD OTC cleared swaps from the daily effective federal funds rate to the secured overnight financing rate ( SOFR\u201d). As a result of this activity, our existing swap and swaption positions have been updated with the new SOFR discounting curve and basis swaps entered into during this transition were sold in the CME Group's auction on October 19, 2020. We continue to remain on track with our LIBOR transition plan, which requires different solutions depending on the underlying asset or liability. Most U.S. LIBOR tenors have been extended from December 31, 2021 to June 2023. Similar to the rest of the market, the bulk of our exposure is in derivatives contracts. Certain contracts, such as interest rate swaps, have an orderly market transition already in process, whereas other contracts, such as loan agreements require bilateral amendments with transition currently in process and adequate time left to resolve. See Risks Related to Our Investing, Portfolio Management and Financing Activities-Changes in the method pursuant to which LIBOR is determined and potential discontinuation of LIBOR may affect our results.\u201d\nResults of Operations\nThe results of our operations are affected by various factors, many of which are beyond our control. Certain of such risks and uncertainties are described herein (see Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d above) and in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors\u201d.\nThis Management Discussion and Analysis section contains analysis and discussion of financial results computed in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP\u201d) and non-GAAP measurements. To supplement our consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP, we provide non-GAAP financial measures to enhance investor understanding of our period-over-period operating performance and business trends, as well as for assessing our performance versus that of industry peers.\nRefer to the Non-GAAP Financial Measures\u201d section for additional information.\nNet Income (Loss) Summary\nThe following table presents financial information related to our results of operations as of and for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018.\n\nGAAP\nNet income (loss) was ($889.8) million, which includes $1.4 million attributable to noncontrolling interests, or ($0.73) per average basic common share, for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to ($2.2) billion, which includes ($0.2) million attributable to noncontrolling interests, or ($1.60) per average basic common share, for the same period in 2019. We attribute the majority of the change in net income (loss) to favorable changes in net gains (losses) on other derivatives, net gains (losses) on disposal of investments and other and net interest income, partially offset by unfavorable changes in the net interest component of interest rate swaps and net unrealized gains (losses) on instruments measured at fair value through earnings and realized gains (losses) on termination or maturity of interest rate swaps. Net gains (losses) on other derivatives was $756.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to ($680.8) million for the same period in 2019. Net gains (losses) on disposal of investments and other was $661.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to ($47.9) million for the same period in 2019. Net interest income for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $1.3 billion compared to $1.0 billion for the same period in 2019. The net interest component of interest rate swaps was ($207.9) million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $351.4 million for the same period in 2019. Realized gains (losses) on termination or maturity of interest rate swaps was ($1.9) billion for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to ($1.4) billion for the same period in 2019. Refer to the section titled Realized and Unrealized Gains (Losses)\u201d located within this Item 7 for additional information related to these changes.\nNon-GAAP\nCore earnings (excluding premium amortization adjustment ( PAA\u201d)) were $1.7 billion, or $1.10 per average common share, for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $1.6 billion, or $1.00 per average common share, for the same period in 2019. The changes in core earnings (excluding PAA) for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the same period in 2019 were primarily due to lower interest expense from lower borrowing rates and average interest bearing liabilities, and higher TBA dollar roll income, partially offset by lower coupon income resulting from a decrease in the average yield on interest earnings assets and lower average interest earning assets, and unfavorable changes in the net interest component of interest rate swaps.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nTo supplement our consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP, we provide the following non-GAAP financial measures:\n\u2022core earnings (excluding PAA);\n\u2022core earnings (excluding PAA) attributable to common stockholders;\n\u2022core earnings (excluding PAA) per average common share;\n\u2022annualized core return on average equity (excluding PAA);\n\u2022interest income (excluding PAA);\n\u2022economic interest expense;\n\u2022economic net interest income (excluding PAA);\n\u2022average yield on interest earning assets (excluding PAA);\n\u2022average economic cost of interest bearing liabilities;\n\u2022net interest margin (excluding PAA); and\n\u2022net interest spread (excluding PAA).\nThese measures should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures computed in accordance with GAAP. While intended to offer a fuller understanding of our results and operations, non-GAAP financial measures also have limitations. For example, we may calculate our non-GAAP metrics, such as core earnings (excluding PAA), or the PAA, differently than our peers making comparative analysis difficult. Additionally, in the case of non-GAAP measures that exclude the PAA, the amount of amortization expense excluding the PAA is not necessarily representative of the amount of future periodic amortization nor is it indicative of the term over which we will amortize the remaining unamortized premium. Changes to actual and estimated prepayments will impact the timing and amount of premium amortization and, as such, both GAAP and non-GAAP results.\nThese non-GAAP measures provide additional detail to enhance investor understanding of our period-over-period operating performance and business trends, as well as for assessing our performance versus that of industry peers. Additional information pertaining to our use of these non-GAAP financial measures, including discussion of how each such measure may be useful to investors, and reconciliations to their most directly comparable GAAP results are provided below.\nCore earnings (excluding PAA), core earnings (excluding PAA) attributable to common stockholders, core earnings (excluding PAA) per average common share and annualized core return on average equity (excluding PAA)\nANNALY CAPITAL MANAGEMENT, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis\nOur principal business objective is to generate net income for distribution to our stockholders and optimize our returns through prudent management of our diversified investment strategies. We generate net income by earning a net interest spread on our investment portfolio, which is a function of interest income from our investment portfolio less financing, hedging and operating costs. Core earnings (excluding PAA), which is defined as the sum of (a) economic net interest income, (b) TBA dollar roll income and CMBX coupon income, (c) realized amortization of MSRs, (d) other income (loss) (excluding depreciation and amortization expense on real estate and related intangibles, non-core income allocated to equity method investments and other non-core components of other income (loss)), (e) general and administrative expenses (excluding transaction expenses and non-recurring items), and (f) income taxes (excluding the income tax effect of non-core income (loss) items), and excludes (g) the premium amortization adjustment ( PAA\u201d) representing the cumulative impact on prior periods, but not the current period, of quarter-over-quarter changes in estimated long-term prepayment speeds related to our Agency mortgage-backed securities, is used by management and, we believe, used by analysts and investors to measure our progress in achieving our principal business objective.\nWe seek to fulfill our principal business objective through a variety of factors including portfolio construction, the degree of market risk exposure and related hedge profile, and the use and forms of leverage, all while operating within the parameters of our capital allocation policy and risk governance framework.\nWe believe these non-GAAP measures provide management and investors with additional details regarding our underlying operating results and investment portfolio trends by (i) making adjustments to account for the disparate reporting of changes in fair value where certain instruments are reflected in GAAP net income (loss) while others are reflected in other comprehensive income (loss), and (ii) by excluding certain unrealized, non-cash or episodic components of GAAP net income (loss) in order to provide additional transparency into the operating performance of our portfolio. Annualized core return on average equity (excluding PAA), which is calculated by dividing core earnings (excluding PAA) over average stockholders' equity, provides investors with additional detail on the core earnings generated by our invested equity capital.\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of GAAP financial results to non-GAAP core earnings for the periods presented:\n\n(1) Includes $3.6 million of loss provision on the Company's unfunded loan commitments for the year ended December 31, 2020, which is reported in Other income (loss) in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss).\nANNALY CAPITAL MANAGEMENT, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis\n(2) Includes depreciation and amortization expense related to equity method investments.\n(3) Represents unrealized (gains) losses allocated to equity interests in a portfolio of MSR which is a component of Other income (loss).\n(4) Represents the amount of consideration paid for the acquisition of MTGE in excess of the fair value of net assets acquired. This amount is primarily attributable to a decline in portfolio valuation between the pricing and closing dates of the transaction and is consistent with changes in market values observed for similar instruments over the same period.\n(5) Includes costs incurred in connection with securitizations of residential whole loans. The year ended December 31, 2020 also includes costs incurred in connection with the Internalization, the CEO search process and a securitization of Agency mortgage-backed securities. The year ended December 31, 2019 also includes costs incurred in connection with the securitization of commercial loans and Agency mortgage-backed securities. The year ended December 31, 2018 also includes costs incurred in connection with the acquisition of MTGE Investment Corp.\n(6) TBA dollar roll income and CMBX coupon income each represent a component of Net gains (losses) on other derivatives. CMBX coupon income totaled $5.8 million, $4.6 million and $2.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\n(7) MSR amortization represents the portion of changes in fair value that is attributable to the realization of estimated cash flows on the Company's MSR portfolio and is reported as a component of Net unrealized gains (losses) on instruments measured at fair value.\n(8) Represents a non-GAAP financial measure. Refer to disclosures within this section above for additional information on non-GAAP financial measures.\nFrom time to time, we enter into TBA forward contracts as an alternate means of investing in and financing Agency mortgage-backed securities. A TBA contract is an agreement to purchase or sell, for future delivery, an Agency mortgage-backed security with a specified issuer, term and coupon. A TBA dollar roll represents a transaction where TBA contracts with the same terms but different settlement dates are simultaneously bought and sold. The TBA contract settling in the later month typically prices at a discount to the earlier month contract with the difference in price commonly referred to as the drop\u201d. The drop is a reflection of the expected net interest income from an investment in similar Agency mortgage-backed securities, net of an implied financing cost, that would be foregone as a result of settling the contract in the later month rather than in the earlier month. The drop between the current settlement month price and the forward settlement month price occurs because in the TBA dollar roll market, the party providing the financing is the party that would retain all principal and interest payments accrued during the financing period. Accordingly, TBA dollar roll income generally represents the economic equivalent of the net interest income earned on the underlying Agency mortgage-backed security less an implied financing cost.\nTBA dollar roll transactions are accounted for under GAAP as a series of derivatives transactions. The fair value of TBA derivatives is based on methods similar to those used to value Agency mortgage-backed securities. We record TBA derivatives at fair value on our Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition and recognize periodic changes in fair value in Net gains (losses) on other derivatives in our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss), which includes both unrealized and realized gains and losses on derivatives (excluding interest rate swaps).\nTBA dollar roll income is calculated as the difference in price between two TBA contracts with the same terms but different settlement dates multiplied by the notional amount of the TBA contract. Although accounted for as derivatives, TBA dollar rolls capture the economic equivalent of net interest income, or carry, on the underlying Agency mortgage-backed security (interest income less an implied cost of financing). TBA dollar roll income is reported as a component of Net gains (losses) on other derivatives in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss).\nThe CMBX index is a synthetic tradable index referencing a basket of 25 commercial mortgage-backed securities of a particular rating and vintage. The CMBX index allows investors to take a long position (referred to as selling protection) or short position (referred to as purchasing protection) on the respective basket of commercial mortgage-backed securities and is structured as a pay-as-you-go\u201d contract whereby the protection seller receives and the protection buyer pays a standardized running coupon on the contracted notional amount. Additionally, the protection seller is obligated to pay to the protection buyer the amount of principal losses and/or coupon shortfalls on the underlying commercial mortgage-backed securities as they occur. We report income (expense) on CMBX positions in Net gains (losses) on other derivatives in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss). The coupon payments received or paid on CMBX positions is equivalent to interest income (expense) and therefore included in core earnings (excluding PAA).\nPremium Amortization Expense\nIn accordance with GAAP, we amortize or accrete premiums or discounts into interest income for our Agency mortgage-backed securities, excluding interest-only securities, multifamily and reverse mortgages, taking into account estimates of future principal prepayments in the calculation of the effective yield. We recalculate the effective yield as differences between anticipated and actual prepayments occur. Using third-party model and market information to project future cash flows and expected remaining lives of securities, the effective interest rate determined for each security is applied as if it had been in place from the date of the security's acquisition. The amortized cost of the security is then adjusted to the amount that would have existed had the new effective yield been applied since the acquisition date. The adjustment to amortized cost is offset with a charge or credit to interest income. Changes in interest rates and other market factors will impact prepayment speed projections and the amount of premium amortization recognized in any given period.\nANNALY CAPITAL MANAGEMENT, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis\nOur GAAP metrics include the unadjusted impact of amortization and accretion associated with this method. Certain of our non-GAAP metrics exclude the effect of the PAA, which quantifies the component of premium amortization representing the cumulative impact on prior periods, but not the current period, of quarter-over-quarter changes in estimated long-term Constant Prepayment Rate ( CPR\u201d).\nThe following table illustrates the impact of the PAA on premium amortization expense for our Residential Securities portfolio and residential securities transferred or pledged to securitization vehicles, for the periods presented:\n\n \nInterest income (excluding PAA), economic interest expense and economic net interest income (excluding PAA)\nInterest income (excluding PAA) represents interest income excluding the effect of the premium amortization adjustment, and serves as the basis for deriving average yield on interest earning assets (excluding PAA), net interest spread (excluding PAA) and net interest margin (excluding PAA), which are discussed below. We believe this measure provides management and investors with additional detail to enhance their understanding of our operating results and trends by excluding the component of premium amortization expense representing the cumulative effect of quarter-over-quarter changes in estimated long-term prepayment speeds related to our Agency mortgage-backed securities (other than interest-only securities, multifamily and reverse mortgages), which can obscure underlying trends in the performance of the portfolio.\nEconomic interest expense is comprised of GAAP interest expense and the net interest component of interest rate swaps. We use interest rate swaps to manage our exposure to changing interest rates on repurchase agreements by economically hedging cash flows associated with these borrowings. Accordingly, adding the net interest component of interest rate swaps to interest expense, as computed in accordance with GAAP, reflects the total contractual interest expense and thus, provides investors with additional information about the cost of our financing strategy. We may use market agreed coupon ( MAC\u201d) interest rate swaps in which we may receive or make a payment at the time of entering into such interest rate swap to compensate for the off-market nature of such interest rate swap. In accordance with GAAP, upfront payments associated with MAC interest rate swaps are not reflected in the net interest component of interest rate swaps in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss). We did not enter into any MAC interest rate swaps during the years ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019.\nSimilarly, economic net interest income (excluding PAA), as computed below, provides investors with additional information to enhance their understanding of the net economics of our primary business operations.\nThe following tables provide GAAP measures of interest expense and net interest income and details with respect to reconciling the aforementioned line items on a non-GAAP basis for each respective period:\nInterest Income (excluding PAA)\n GAAP Interest Income PAA Cost (Benefit) Interest Income (excluding PAA) (1) For the years ended (dollars in thousands) December 31, 2020 $ 2,229,625 $ 415,444 $ 2,645,069 December 31, 2019 $ 3,787,297 $ 254,894 $ 4,042,191 December 31, 2018 $ 3,332,563 $ (62,021) $ 3,270,542 (1) Represents a non-GAAP financial measure.

In general, as prepayment speeds and expectations of prepayment speeds on our Agency mortgage-backed securities portfolio increase, related purchase premium amortization increases, thereby reducing the yield on such assets. The following table presents the weighted average experienced CPR and weighted average projected long-term CPR on our Agency mortgage-backed securities portfolio as of and for the periods presented.\n\n(1) For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\n(2) At December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nAverage Yield on Interest Earning Assets (excluding PAA), Net Interest Spread (excluding PAA), Net Interest Margin (excluding PAA) and Average Economic Cost of Interest Bearing Liabilities\nNet interest spread (excluding PAA), which is the difference between the average yield on interest earning assets (excluding PAA) and the average economic cost of interest bearing liabilities, which represents annualized economic interest expense divided by average interest bearing liabilities, and net interest margin (excluding PAA), which is calculated as the sum of interest income (excluding PAA) plus TBA dollar roll income and CMBX coupon income less interest expense and the net interest component of interest rate swaps divided by the sum of average interest earning assets plus average TBA contract and CMBX balances, provide management with additional measures of our profitability that management relies upon in monitoring the performance of the business.\nDisclosure of these measures, which are presented below, provides investors with additional detail regarding how management evaluates our performance.\nNet Interest Spread (excluding PAA)\nANNALY CAPITAL MANAGEMENT, INC.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis\nOverview\nWe are a leading diversified capital manager that invests in and finances residential and commercial assets. Our principal business objective is to generate net income for distribution to our stockholders and optimize our returns through prudent management of our diversified investment strategies. We are an internally-managed Maryland corporation founded in 1997 that has elected to be taxed as a REIT. Prior to the closing of the Internalization (as defined in Item 1 under Closing of the Internalization and Termination of the Management Agreement\u201d) on June 30, 2020, we were externally managed by Annaly Management Company LLC (our Former Manager\u201d). Our common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol NLY.\u201d\nWe use our capital coupled with borrowed funds to invest primarily in real estate related investments, earning the spread between the yield on our assets and the cost of our borrowings and hedging activities.\nFor a full discussion of our business, refer to the section titled Business Overview\u201d of Part I, Item 1. Business.\u201d\nBusiness Environment and COVID-19\nThe themes that have dominated financial markets since the elevated volatility seen in March and April 2020 remain unchanged. Fiscal stimulus has supported businesses and consumers most negatively impacted by COVID-19 while the Federal Reserve's ( Fed\u201d) unprecedented monetary policy actions eased financial conditions and contained interest rate volatility. These factors drove our strong performance to close out the year, delivering an economic return of 5.1% for the fourth quarter and 1.8% for 2020. Throughout the year, we returned $1.4 billion aggregate in common and preferred dividends to our shareholders, signaling meaningful resilience following the historic disruption seen in March and April.\nInterest rates ended 2020 near their highest levels since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic reflecting optimism about the post-COVID recovery in spite of negative developments of record U.S. virus cases, tighter restrictions and resulting lackluster economic growth particularly in the U.S. service sector. The rapid COVID-19 vaccine development and plans for deployment, combined with the relatively healthy consumer balance sheets, suggest that the U.S. economy may rebound at a faster pace than during traditional economic downturns once a majority of the population reaches immunity, though meaningful uncertainties remain about both the timing of immunity and the subsequent recovery pace.\nAt the end of 2020, our capital allocation remained tilted towards Agency mortgage-backed securities ( MBS\u201d), representing 78% of the aggregate portfolio, compared to 74% one year ago. However, this year-over-year snapshot masks more recent increases in activity in our residential credit and middle market lending businesses, which saw strong investor sponsorship and improving fundamentals as markets signal a cyclical recovery. As Agency MBS spreads have continued to tighten given Fed and bank sector demand for the product, select credit sectors have allowed for targeted, attractive opportunities. While opportunistic, Annaly continues with its disciplined and defensive-minded credit focus, which is necessary given overall tight asset spreads.\nSomewhat offsetting the effect from tight asset spreads, current financing conditions are among the most favorable seen in Annaly's history. The liquidity created through the Fed's monetary policy actions have led to absolute low level of rates and a flat term structure of the repo curve. Favorable financing conditions have allowed us to increase our net interest margin (excluding PAA) from 1.41% at the end of 2019 to 1.98% at the end of 2020, as cheaper financing more than offset the decline in asset yields driven by the aforementioned spread compression. Additionally, securitization markets have rebounded substantially, resulting in better execution levels than one year ago, and provide attractive non-recourse term financing to bolster our residential credit asset investment strategy and diversify financing for our whole loan business.\nBusiness Continuity\nOur well-established Business Continuity Planning ( BCP\u201d) was designed to ensure continued, effective operations through a variety of scenarios including natural disasters and disease pandemics. It identifies critical systems, processes, roles and third parties, and can be adjusted on a real-time basis to address situations as they arise.\nThe BCP is regularly updated and tested. Annual testing includes extensive, remote Disaster Recovery testing and tabletop exercise scenarios with management. Key tenets of the planning include active communication between our Crisis Response Team, which is comprised of senior leaders across a number of functions, and our internal and external stakeholders to afford efficient, thoughtful, effective responses to evolving emergency situations.\nHistorical tabletop exercises have included use of CDC Influenza Pandemic exercise materials. That exercise documented our response and possible impacts to a variety of scenarios, including those in which shelter in place orders\u201d were required and response/ impact assessments to those scenarios. Regular meetings were commenced to implement and review active internal and external communications planning. These exercises, along with regulatory and industry guidance, informed our staged response to the conditions created by COVID-19. We took proactive actions, which included canceling non-essential travel and instituting 100% remote working, ahead of New York State-mandated requirements. To protect the health and well-being of our employees, their families and communities remote work requirements began in phases in early March, culminating with a\nANNALY CAPITAL MANAGEMENT, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis\ncompany-wide exercise on March 13, 2020 to test connectivity and functionality. All employees were able to successfully perform their duties in this testing and we have operated largely remotely since that time.\nA majority of our business activities continues to be performed remotely, though we have seen a limited number of employees return to the office on a voluntary and periodic basis. We continue to monitor guidance from federal, state and local authorities to gauge how to further proceed in any efforts to return to the office.\nEconomic Environment\nThe pace of economic growth in 2020 slowed sharply, not only in the United States but worldwide, as the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic affected nearly all ways of life and disrupted many aspects of the economy. The far-reaching consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic led U.S. gross domestic product ( GDP\u201d) to decline by 3.5% year-over-year in 2020, in turn marking the largest decline in economic activity during a calendar year in more than 70 years. The disruptions caused by the pandemic were unique in that they primarily impacted the service sector of the economy, a sector that has been a source of relative stability during prior economic downturns. Other parts of the economy, including goods consumption and housing, have recovered from the initial pandemic-driven downturn and these sectors are now above 2019 output levels. All of this suggests that the economy is currently relatively bifurcated, requiring U.S. health officials to work to defeat the virus before economic activity can return to pre-pandemic levels in aggregate.\nThe sharp economic contraction led the unemployment rate to rise to 6.7% in December 2020, nearly twice as high as the unemployment rate seen in December 2019 according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The rise in the unemployment rate likely understates the number of jobs lost in 2020 as the employment-to-population ratio fell to 57.4%, suggesting that 3.5% of the population, or roughly 9 million people, no longer held a job at the end of 2020 compared to one year ago. Wage growth, as measured by the year-over-year change in private sector average hourly earnings rose sharply, reading 5.1% in the month of December 2020 compared to 3.0% in December 2019. The sharp increase in wages, however, appears to be driven by changes in the underlying composition of employees by industry, as sectors with generally lower wages, such as leisure and hospitality services, have seen outsized job losses relative to sectors with higher wages. Alternative measures of wage growth, such as the Employment Cost Index or the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta's Wage Tracker show meaningfully less wage growth.\nInflation remained muted into the economic downturn as measured by the year-over-year changes in the Personal Consumption Expenditure Chain Price Index ( PCE\u201d). The headline PCE measure increased by 1.3% year-over-year in December 2020. The more stable core PCE measure, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, registered a similar 1.5% year-over-year increase. Although both inflation measures remain somewhat below the Fed's 2.0% inflation target, the Fed expects inflation to recover towards its target in coming years as the economy begins to recover from the economic downturn.\nThe Fed conducts monetary policy with a dual mandate: full employment and price stability. Given the contraction in economic activity witnessed following the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Fed increased its monetary policy support at unprecedented speed and size. The target range for the Federal Funds rate was cut from 1.50% - 1.75% in December 2019 to 0.0% - 0.25% in March 2020. Following the interest rate cuts, the Fed provided guidance that short-term interest rates will remain near current levels until labor market conditions have reached levels consistent with the Fed assessments of maximum employment and inflation has risen to 2 percent and is on track to moderately exceed 2 percent for some time\u201d as stated in the December 2020 Federal Open Market Committee meeting statement. In addition to the zero-interest rate policy, the Fed restarted its asset purchase programs, increasing its holdings of Treasury securities and Agency MBS by a total of $2.0 trillion and $631 billion, respectively. Asset purchases continued at the end of 2020 at a pace of $80 billion per month in Treasury securities and $40 billion per month in MBS. Beyond rate policy and asset purchases, the Fed also announced several lending programs to various other market sectors, such as corporate bonds, municipals, and small businesses, among others. These lending programs largely concluded their activities at the end of December 2020 but could be revived should the economic situation deteriorate.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, yields on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note declined by 101 bps primarily in the first half of the year as a sharp slowdown in global economic growth and heightened uncertainties around the economic recovery led to strong demand for interest rate products and the aforementioned unprecedented fiscal and monetary stimulus. The mortgage basis, or the spread between the 30-year Agency MBS coupon and 10-year U.S. Treasury rate, had a volatile year, rising meaningfully in the first quarter before retracing given strong demand for MBS in the second half of the year.\nThe following table below presents interest rates and spreads at each date presented:\nANNALY CAPITAL MANAGEMENT, INC.

Our plan includes steps to evaluate exposure, review contracts, assess impact to our business, process and technology and define a communication strategy with shareholders, regulators and other stakeholders. The committee also continues to engage with industry working groups and other market participants regarding the transition. In October 2020, as part of the transition from LIBOR, we participated in the Chicago Mercantile Exchange ( CME\u201d) Group's transitioning for price alignment and discounting for USD OTC cleared swaps from the daily effective federal funds rate to the secured overnight financing rate ( SOFR\u201d). As a result of this activity, our existing swap and swaption positions have been updated with the new SOFR discounting curve and basis swaps entered into during this transition were sold in the CME Group's auction on October 19, 2020. We continue to remain on track with our LIBOR transition plan, which requires different solutions depending on the underlying asset or liability. Most U.S. LIBOR tenors have been extended from December 31, 2021 to June 2023. Similar to the rest of the market, the bulk of our exposure is in derivatives contracts. Certain contracts, such as interest rate swaps, have an orderly market transition already in process, whereas other contracts, such as loan agreements require bilateral amendments with transition currently in process and adequate time left to resolve. See Risks Related to Our Investing, Portfolio Management and Financing Activities-Changes in the method pursuant to which LIBOR is determined and potential discontinuation of LIBOR may affect our results.\u201d\nResults of Operations\nThe results of our operations are affected by various factors, many of which are beyond our control. Certain of such risks and uncertainties are described herein (see Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d above) and in Part I, Item 1A.

Refer to the section titled Realized and Unrealized Gains (Losses)\u201d located within this Item 7 for additional information related to these changes.\nNon-GAAP\nCore earnings (excluding premium amortization adjustment ( PAA\u201d)) were $1.7 billion, or $1.10 per average common share, for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $1.6 billion, or $1.00 per average common share, for the same period in 2019. The changes in core earnings (excluding PAA) for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the same period in 2019 were primarily due to lower interest expense from lower borrowing rates and average interest bearing liabilities, and higher TBA dollar roll income, partially offset by lower coupon income resulting from a decrease in the average yield on interest earnings assets and lower average interest earning assets, and unfavorable changes in the net interest component of interest rate swaps.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nTo supplement our consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP, we provide the following non-GAAP financial measures:\n\u2022core earnings (excluding PAA);\n\u2022core earnings (excluding PAA) attributable to common stockholders;\n\u2022core earnings (excluding PAA) per average common share;\n\u2022annualized core return on average equity (excluding PAA);\n\u2022interest income (excluding PAA);\n\u2022economic interest expense;\n\u2022economic net interest income (excluding PAA);\n\u2022average yield on interest earning assets (excluding PAA);\n\u2022average economic cost of interest bearing liabilities;\n\u2022net interest margin (excluding PAA); and\n\u2022net interest spread (excluding PAA).\nThese measures should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures computed in accordance with GAAP. While intended to offer a fuller understanding of our results and operations, non-GAAP financial measures also have limitations. For example, we may calculate our non-GAAP metrics, such as core earnings (excluding PAA), or the PAA, differently than our peers making comparative analysis difficult. Additionally, in the case of non-GAAP measures that exclude the PAA, the amount of amortization expense excluding the PAA is not necessarily representative of the amount of future periodic amortization nor is it indicative of the term over which we will amortize the remaining unamortized premium. Changes to actual and estimated prepayments will impact the timing and amount of premium amortization and, as such, both GAAP and non-GAAP results.\nThese non-GAAP measures provide additional detail to enhance investor understanding of our period-over-period operating performance and business trends, as well as for assessing our performance versus that of industry peers. Additional information pertaining to our use of these non-GAAP financial measures, including discussion of how each such measure may be useful to investors, and reconciliations to their most directly comparable GAAP results are provided below.\nCore earnings (excluding PAA), core earnings (excluding PAA) attributable to common stockholders, core earnings (excluding PAA) per average common share and annualized core return on average equity (excluding PAA)\nANNALY CAPITAL MANAGEMENT, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis\nOur principal business objective is to generate net income for distribution to our stockholders and optimize our returns through prudent management of our diversified investment strategies. We generate net income by earning a net interest spread on our investment portfolio, which is a function of interest income from our investment portfolio less financing, hedging and operating costs. Core earnings (excluding PAA), which is defined as the sum of (a) economic net interest income, (b) TBA dollar roll income and CMBX coupon income, (c) realized amortization of MSRs, (d) other income (loss) (excluding depreciation and amortization expense on real estate and related intangibles, non-core income allocated to equity method investments and other non-core components of other income (loss)), (e) general and administrative expenses (excluding transaction expenses and non-recurring items), and (f) income taxes (excluding the income tax effect of non-core income (loss) items), and excludes (g) the premium amortization adjustment ( PAA\u201d) representing the cumulative impact on prior periods, but not the current period, of quarter-over-quarter changes in estimated long-term prepayment speeds related to our Agency mortgage-backed securities, is used by management and, we believe, used by analysts and investors to measure our progress in achieving our principal business objective.\nWe seek to fulfill our principal business objective through a variety of factors including portfolio construction, the degree of market risk exposure and related hedge profile, and the use and forms of leverage, all while operating within the parameters of our capital allocation policy and risk governance framework.\nWe believe these non-GAAP measures provide management and investors with additional details regarding our underlying operating results and investment portfolio trends by (i) making adjustments to account for the disparate reporting of changes in fair value where certain instruments are reflected in GAAP net income (loss) while others are reflected in other comprehensive income (loss), and (ii) by excluding certain unrealized, non-cash or episodic components of GAAP net income (loss) in order to provide additional transparency into the operating performance of our portfolio. Annualized core return on average equity (excluding PAA), which is calculated by dividing core earnings (excluding PAA) over average stockholders' equity, provides investors with additional detail on the core earnings generated by our invested equity capital.\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of GAAP financial results to non-GAAP core earnings for the periods presented:\nTable 29:

The year ended December 31, 2019 also includes costs incurred in connection with the securitization of commercial loans and Agency mortgage-backed securities. The year ended December 31, 2018 also includes costs incurred in connection with the acquisition of MTGE Investment Corp.\n(6) TBA dollar roll income and CMBX coupon income each represent a component of Net gains (losses) on other derivatives. CMBX coupon income totaled $5.8 million, $4.6 million and $2.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\n(7) MSR amortization represents the portion of changes in fair value that is attributable to the realization of estimated cash flows on the Company's MSR portfolio and is reported as a component of Net unrealized gains (losses) on instruments measured at fair value.\n(8) Represents a non-GAAP financial measure. Refer to disclosures within this section above for additional information on non-GAAP financial measures.\nFrom time to time, we enter into TBA forward contracts as an alternate means of investing in and financing Agency mortgage-backed securities. A TBA contract is an agreement to purchase or sell, for future delivery, an Agency mortgage-backed security with a specified issuer, term and coupon. A TBA dollar roll represents a transaction where TBA contracts with the same terms but different settlement dates are simultaneously bought and sold. The TBA contract settling in the later month typically prices at a discount to the earlier month contract with the difference in price commonly referred to as the drop\u201d. The drop is a reflection of the expected net interest income from an investment in similar Agency mortgage-backed securities, net of an implied financing cost, that would be foregone as a result of settling the contract in the later month rather than in the earlier month. The drop between the current settlement month price and the forward settlement month price occurs because in the TBA dollar roll market, the party providing the financing is the party that would retain all principal and interest payments accrued during the financing period. Accordingly, TBA dollar roll income generally represents the economic equivalent of the net interest income earned on the underlying Agency mortgage-backed security less an implied financing cost.\nTBA dollar roll transactions are accounted for under GAAP as a series of derivatives transactions. The fair value of TBA derivatives is based on methods similar to those used to value Agency mortgage-backed securities. We record TBA derivatives at fair value on our Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition and recognize periodic changes in fair value in Net gains (losses) on other derivatives in our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss), which includes both unrealized and realized gains and losses on derivatives (excluding interest rate swaps).\nTBA dollar roll income is calculated as the difference in price between two TBA contracts with the same terms but different settlement dates multiplied by the notional amount of the TBA contract. Although accounted for as derivatives, TBA dollar rolls capture the economic equivalent of net interest income, or carry, on the underlying Agency mortgage-backed security (interest income less an implied cost of financing). TBA dollar roll income is reported as a component of Net gains (losses) on other derivatives in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss).\nThe CMBX index is a synthetic tradable index referencing a basket of 25 commercial mortgage-backed securities of a particular rating and vintage. The CMBX index allows investors to take a long position (referred to as selling protection) or short position (referred to as purchasing protection) on the respective basket of commercial mortgage-backed securities and is structured as a pay-as-you-go\u201d contract whereby the protection seller receives and the protection buyer pays a standardized running coupon on the contracted notional amount. Additionally, the protection seller is obligated to pay to the protection buyer the amount of principal losses and/or coupon shortfalls on the underlying commercial mortgage-backed securities as they occur. We report income (expense) on CMBX positions in Net gains (losses) on other derivatives in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss). The coupon payments received or paid on CMBX positions is equivalent to interest income (expense) and therefore included in core earnings (excluding PAA).\nPremium Amortization Expense\nIn accordance with GAAP, we amortize or accrete premiums or discounts into interest income for our Agency mortgage-backed securities, excluding interest-only securities, multifamily and reverse mortgages, taking into account estimates of future principal prepayments in the calculation of the effective yield. We recalculate the effective yield as differences between anticipated and actual prepayments occur. Using third-party model and market information to project future cash flows and expected remaining lives of securities, the effective interest rate determined for each security is applied as if it had been in place from the date of the security's acquisition. The amortized cost of the security is then adjusted to the amount that would have existed had the new effective yield been applied since the acquisition date. The adjustment to amortized cost is offset with a charge or credit to interest income. Changes in interest rates and other market factors will impact prepayment speed projections and the amount of premium amortization recognized in any given period.\nANNALY CAPITAL MANAGEMENT, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis\nOur GAAP metrics include the unadjusted impact of amortization and accretion associated with this method. Certain of our non-GAAP metrics exclude the effect of the PAA, which quantifies the component of premium amortization representing the cumulative impact on prior periods, but not the current period, of quarter-over-quarter changes in estimated long-term Constant Prepayment Rate ( CPR\u201d).\nThe following table illustrates the impact of the PAA on premium amortization expense for our Residential Securities portfolio and residential securities transferred or pledged to securitization vehicles, for the periods presented:\nTable 30: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>For the Years Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>(dollars in thousands) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Premium amortization expense </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,375,461 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,113,786 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>705,926 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less: PAA cost (benefit) </td> <td>415,444 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>254,894 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(62,021) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Premium amortization expense (excluding PAA) </td> <td>$ </td> <td>960,017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>858,892 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>767,947 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n \nInterest income (excluding PAA), economic interest expense and economic net interest income (excluding PAA)\nInterest income (excluding PAA) represents interest income excluding the effect of the premium amortization adjustment, and serves as the basis for deriving average yield on interest earning assets (excluding PAA), net interest spread (excluding PAA) and net interest margin (excluding PAA), which are discussed below. We believe this measure provides management and investors with additional detail to enhance their understanding of our operating results and trends by excluding the component of premium amortization expense representing the cumulative effect of quarter-over-quarter changes in estimated long-term prepayment speeds related to our Agency mortgage-backed securities (other than interest-only securities, multifamily and reverse mortgages), which can obscure underlying trends in the performance of the portfolio.\nEconomic interest expense is comprised of GAAP interest expense and the net interest component of interest rate swaps. We use interest rate swaps to manage our exposure to changing interest rates on repurchase agreements by economically hedging cash flows associated with these borrowings. Accordingly, adding the net interest component of interest rate swaps to interest expense, as computed in accordance with GAAP, reflects the total contractual interest expense and thus, provides investors with additional information about the cost of our financing strategy. We may use market agreed coupon ( MAC\u201d) interest rate swaps in which we may receive or make a payment at the time of entering into such interest rate swap to compensate for the off-market nature of such interest rate swap. In accordance with GAAP, upfront payments associated with MAC interest rate swaps are not reflected in the net interest component of interest rate swaps in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss). We did not enter into any MAC interest rate swaps during the years ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019.\nSimilarly, economic net interest income (excluding PAA), as computed below, provides investors with additional information to enhance their understanding of the net economics of our primary business operations.\nThe following tables provide GAAP measures of interest expense and net interest income and details with respect to reconciling the aforementioned line items on a non-GAAP basis for each respective period:\nInterest Income (excluding PAA)\n GAAP Interest Income PAA Cost (Benefit) Interest Income (excluding PAA) (1) For the years ended (dollars in thousands) December 31, 2020 $ 2,229,625 $ 415,444 $ 2,645,069 December 31, 2019 $ 3,787,297 $ 254,894 $ 4,042,191 December 31, 2018 $ 3,332,563 $ (62,021) $ 3,270,542 (1) Represents a non-GAAP financial measure.
