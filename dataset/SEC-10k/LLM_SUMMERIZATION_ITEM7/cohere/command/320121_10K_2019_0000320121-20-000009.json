Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nGeneral\nThe solutions we offer secure cyberspace, the cloud environment, and the people and operations of the enterprise. These three facets of the modern organization share much in common, but also require a diverse range of skills, capabilities, and experience to meet the important requirements of security-conscious customers. Telos' decades-long resume of providing a broad spectrum of technology and security solutions uniquely qualifies us to meet our customers' needs in these three areas. Our experience in addressing challenges in one operation of the enterprise informs our work in meeting requirements in others. We understand that a range of complementary capabilities may be needed to solve a single challenge, and we also recognize when a single solution might address multiple challenges.\nOur substantive expertise in developing, orchestrating, and delivering solutions across these areas gives us the vision and the confidence to provide solutions that empower and protect the enterprise at an integrated, holistic level.\nOur capabilities include:\nTable 53: <table> <tr> <td>\u25cf </td> <td> Cybersecurity - Today's enterprises need to understand and manage their cyber risk and reduce their cyber attack surfaces. Telos helps our customers assure the ongoing security, integrity, and compliance of their on-premises and cloud-based systems and to reduce threats and vulnerabilities to foil cyber adversaries before they can attack.

As ICT and OT systems have become part of the organizational DNA, Telos has led with offerings that ensure personnel can work securely and productively across and beyond the enterprise.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements include revenue recognition, allowance for doubtful accounts receivable, allowance for inventory obsolescence, the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets, income taxes, contingencies and litigation, potential impairments of goodwill and intangible assets, estimated pension-related costs for our foreign subsidiaries and accretion of Public Preferred Stock. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nThe following is a summary of the most critical accounting policies used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe account for revenue in accordance with Accounting Standard Codification ( ASC\u201d) Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers.\u201d The unit of account in ASC 606 is a performance obligation which is a promise in a contract with a customer, to transfer a good or service to the customer. ASC 606 prescribes a five-step model for recognizing revenue that includes identifying the contract with the customer, determining the performance obligation(s), determining the transaction price, allocating the transaction price to the performance obligation(s), and recognizing revenue as the performance obligations are satisfied. Timing of the satisfaction of performance obligations varies across our businesses due to our diverse product and service mix, customer base, and contractual terms. Significant judgment can be required in determining certain performance obligations, and these determinations could change the amount of revenue and profit recorded in a given period. Our contracts may have a single performance obligation or multiple performance obligations. When there are multiple performance obligations within a contract, we allocate the transaction price to each performance obligation based on our best estimate of standalone selling price.\nWe account for a contract after it has been approved by the parties to the contract, the rights and the payment terms of the parties are identified, the contract has commercial substance and collectability is probable, which is presumed for our U.S. Government customers and prime contractors for which we perform as subcontractors to U.S. Government end-customers.\nThe majority of our revenue is recognized over time, as control is transferred continuously to our customers who receive and consume benefits as we perform, and is classified as services revenue. All of our business groups earn services revenue under a variety of contract types, including time and materials, firm-fixed price, firm fixed price level of effort, and cost plus fixed fee contract types, which may include variable consideration as discussed further below. Revenue is recognized over time using costs incurred to date relative to total estimated costs at completion to measure progress toward satisfying our performance obligations. Incurred cost represents work performed, which corresponds with, and thereby best depicts, the transfer of control to the customer. Contract costs include labor, material, subcontractor costs and indirect expenses. This continuous transfer of control to the customer is supported by clauses in our contracts with U.S. Government customers whereby the customer may terminate a contract for convenience and then pay for costs incurred plus a profit, at which time the customer would take control of any work in process. For non-U.S. Government contracts where we perform as a subcontractor and our order includes similar Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) provisions as the prime contractor's order from the U.S. Government, continuous transfer of control is likewise supported by such provisions. For other non-U.S. Government customers, continuous transfer of control to such customers is also supported due to general terms in our contracts and rights to recover damages which would include, among other potential damages, the right to payment for our work performed to date plus a reasonable profit.\nDue to the transfer of control over time, revenue is recognized based on progress towards completion of the performance obligation. The selection of the method to measure progress towards completion requires judgment and is based on the nature of the performance obligations. We generally use the cost-to-cost measure of progress on a proportional performance basis for our contracts because it best depicts the transfer of control to the customer which occurs as we incur costs on our contracts. Under the cost-to-cost measure of progress, the extent of progress towards completion is measured based on the ratio of costs incurred to date to the total estimated costs at completion of the performance obligation. Revenues are recorded proportionally as costs are incurred. Due to the nature of the work required to be performed on certain of our performance obligations, the estimation of total revenue and cost at completion is complex, subject to many variables and requires significant judgment. Contract estimates are based on various assumptions including labor and subcontractor costs, materials and other direct costs and the complexity of the work to be performed. A significant change in one or more of these estimates could affect the profitability of our contracts. We review and update our contract-related estimates regularly and recognize adjustments in estimated profit on contracts on a cumulative catch-up basis, which may result in an adjustment increasing or decreasing revenue to date on a contract in a particular period that the adjustment is identified. Revenue and profit in future periods of contract performance are recognized using the adjusted estimate.\nRevenue that is recognized at a point in time is for the sale of software licenses in our Secure Mobility and Network Management/Defense Enterprise Solutions (formerly CO&D's Secure Mobility Solutions) and Secure Communications Cyber and Enterprise Solutions (formerly IT & Enterprise Solutions) business groups and for the sale of resold products in Telos ID Enterprise Solutions (formerly Identity Management Solutions) and Cyber & Cloud Solutions (formerly CO&D's Cyber Security Solutions), and is classified as product revenue. Revenue on these contracts is recognized when the customer obtains control of the transferred product or service, which is generally upon delivery of the product to the customer for their use, due to us maintaining control of the product until that point. Orders for the sale of software licenses may contain multiple performance obligations, such as maintenance, training, or consulting services, which are typically delivered over time, consistent with the transfer of control disclosed above for the provision of services. When an order contains multiple performance obligations, we allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations using our best estimate of standalone selling price.\nContracts are routinely and often modified to account for changes in contract requirements, specifications, quantities, or price. Depending on the nature of the modification, we determine whether to account for the modification as an adjustment to the existing contract or as a new contract. Generally, modifications are not distinct from the existing contract due to the significant interrelatedness of the performance obligations and are therefore accounted for as an adjustment to the existing contract, and recognized as a cumulative adjustment to revenue (as either an increase or reduction of revenue) based on the modification's effect on progress toward completion of a performance obligation.\nOur contracts may include various types of variable consideration, such as claims (for instance, indirect rate or other equitable adjustments) or incentive fees. We include estimated amounts in the transaction price based on all of the information available to us, including historical information and future estimations, and to the extent it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when any uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is resolved. We have revised and re-submitted several years of incurred cost submissions reflecting certain indirect rate structure changes as a result of regular Defense Contract Audit Agency ( DCAA\u201d) audits of incurred cost submissions. This resulted in signed final rate agreement letters for fiscal years 2011 to 2013 and conformed incurred cost submissions for 2014 to 2015. We evaluated the resulting changes to revenue under the applicable cost plus fixed fee contracts for the years 2011 to 2015 as variable consideration, and determined the most likely amount to which we expect to be entitled, to the extent that no constraint exists that would preclude recognizing this revenue or result in a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized. We included these estimated amounts of variable consideration in the transaction price and as performance on these contracts is complete, we have recognized revenue of $6.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2018.\nHistorically, most of our contracts do not include award or incentive fees. For incentive fees, we would include such fees in the transaction price to the extent we could reasonably estimate the amount of the fee. With limited historical experience, we have not included any revenue related to incentive fees in our estimated transaction prices. We may include in our contract estimates additional revenue for submitted contract modifications or claims against the customer when we believe we have an enforceable right to the modification or claim, the amount can be estimated reliably and its realization is probable. We consider the contractual/legal basis for the claim (in particular FAR provisions), the facts and circumstances around any additional costs incurred, the reasonableness of those costs and the objective evidence available to support such claims.\nFor our contracts that have an original duration of one year or less, we use the practical expedient applicable to such contracts and do not consider the time value of money. We capitalize sales commissions related to proprietary software and related services that are directly tied to sales. We do not elect the practical expedient to expense as incurred the incremental costs of obtaining a contract if the amortization period would have been one year or less. For the sales commissions that are capitalized, we amortize the asset over the expected customer life, which is based on recent and historical data.\nContract assets are amounts that are invoiced as work progresses in accordance with agreed-upon contractual terms, either at periodic intervals or upon achievement of contractual milestones. Generally, revenue recognition occurs before billing, resulting in contract assets. These contract assets are referred to as unbilled receivables and are reported within accounts receivable, net of reserve on our consolidated balance sheets.\nBilled receivables are amounts billed and due from our customers and are reported within accounts receivable, net of reserve on the consolidated balance sheets. The portion of the payments retained by the customer until final contract settlement is not considered a significant financing component due to the intent of the retainage being the customer's protection with respect to full and final performance under the contract.\nContract liabilities are payments received in advance and milestone payments from our customers on selected contracts that exceed revenue earned to date, resulting in contract liabilities. Contract liabilities typically are not considered a significant financing component because they are generally satisfied within one year and are used to meet working capital demands that can be higher in the early stages of a contract. Contract liabilities are reported on our consolidated balance sheet on a net contract basis at the end of each reporting period.\nWe have one reportable segment. We treat sales to U.S. customers as sales within the U.S. regardless of where the services are performed. Substantially all of our revenues are from U.S. customers as revenue derived from international customers is de minimus. The following tables disclose revenue (in thousands) by customer type and contract type for the periods presented. Prior period amounts have not been adjusted under the modified retrospective method.\nTable 56: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nFederal\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 149,257\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 129,279\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 101,519\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> State & Local, and Commercial\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 9,961\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 8,737\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 6,208\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 159,218\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 138,016\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 107,727\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 57: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nFirm fixed-price\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 131,629\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 103,454\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 89,516\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Time-and-materials\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 14,569\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 16,795\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 10,222\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cost plus fixed fee\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 13,020\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 17,767\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 7,989\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 159,218\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 138,016\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 107,727\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following table discloses accounts receivable and contract assets (in thousands):\nTable 58: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Billed accounts receivable\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 11,917\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 18,848\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Unbilled receivables\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 16,745\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 16,000\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Allowance for doubtful accounts\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (720\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (306\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Receivables - net\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 27,942\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 34,542\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following table discloses contract liabilities (in thousands):\nTable 59: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Contract liabilities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 6,338\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 5,232\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs of December 31, 2019 and 2018, we had $112.4 million and $79.3 million of remaining performance obligations, respectively, which we also refer to as funded backlog. We expect to recognize approximately 98.4% of our remaining performance obligations as revenue in 2020, an additional 1.1% by 2021 and the balance thereafter. For the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, the amount of revenue recognized during the year that was included in the opening contract liabilities balance was $4.2 million and $5.5 million, respectively.\nInventories\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value, where cost is determined primarily on the weighted average cost method. Inventories consist primarily of purchased off-the-shelf hardware and software, and component computer parts used in connection with system integration services that we perform. Inventories also include spare parts utilized to support certain maintenance contracts. Spare parts inventory is amortized on a straight-line basis over two to five years, which represents the shorter of the warranty period or estimated useful life of the asset. An allowance for obsolete, slow-moving or non-salable inventory is provided for all other inventory. This allowance is based on our overall obsolescence experience and our assessment of future inventory requirements.\nGoodwill\nWe evaluate the impairment of goodwill in accordance with ASC 350, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other,\u201d which requires goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets to be assessed on at least an annual basis for impairment using a fair value basis. Between annual evaluations, if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying amount, then impairment must be evaluated. Such circumstances could include, but are not limited to: (1) a significant adverse change in legal factors or business climate, or (2) a loss of key contracts or customers.\nAs the result of an acquisition, we record any excess purchase price over the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired as goodwill. An allocation of the purchase price to tangible and intangible net assets acquired is based upon our valuation of the acquired assets. Goodwill is not amortized, but is subject to annual impairment tests. We complete our goodwill impairment tests as of December 31st each year. Additionally, we make evaluations between annual tests if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. The evaluation is based on the estimation of the fair values of our three reporting units, Cyber Operations and Defense ( CO&D\u201d), Telos ID Enterprise Solutions, and Secure Communications Cyber and Enterprise Solutions, of which goodwill is housed in the CO&D reporting unit, in comparison to the reporting unit's net asset carrying values. Our discounted cash flows required management's judgment with respect to forecasted revenue streams and operating margins, capital expenditures and the selection and use of an appropriate discount rate. We utilized the weighted average cost of capital as derived by certain assumptions specific to our facts and circumstances as the discount rate. The net assets attributable to the reporting units are determined based upon the estimated assets and liabilities attributable to the reporting units in deriving its free cash flows. In addition, the estimate of the total fair value of our reporting units is compared to the market capitalization of the Company. The Company's assessment resulted in a fair value that was greater than the Company's carrying value, therefore the second step of the impairment test, as prescribed by the authoritative literature, was not required to be performed and no impairment of goodwill was recorded as of December 31, 2019. Subsequent reviews may result in future periodic impairments that could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations in the period recognized. Recent operating results have reduced the projection of future cash flow growth potential, which indicates that certain negative potential events, such as a material loss or losses on contracts, or failure to achieve projected growth could result in impairment in the future. We estimate the fair value of our reporting unit and compare the valuation with the respective carrying value for the reporting unit to determine whether any goodwill impairment exists. If we determine through the impairment review process that goodwill is impaired, we will record an impairment charge in our consolidated statements of operations. Goodwill is amortized and deducted over a 15-year period for tax purposes.\nIncome Taxes\nWe account for income taxes in accordance with ASC 740, Income Taxes.\u201d Under ASC 740, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences of temporary differences and income tax credits. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured by applying enacted statutory tax rates that are applicable to the future years in which deferred tax assets or liabilities are expected to be settled or realized for differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of existing assets and liabilities. Any change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in net income in the period in which the tax rate change is enacted. We record a valuation allowance that reduces deferred tax assets when it is \"more likely than not\" that deferred tax assets will not be realized. We are required to establish a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets if, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Based on available evidence, realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income. We considered projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies, and reversal of taxable temporary differences in making this assessment. As such, we have determined that a full valuation allowance is required as of December 31, 2019 and 2018. As a result of a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets, a deferred tax liability related to goodwill remained on our consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2019 and 2018. Due to the tax reform enacted on December 22, 2017, net operating losses generated in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017 will have an indefinite carryforward period, which will be available to offset future taxable income created by the reversal of temporary taxable differences related to goodwill. As a result, we have adjusted the valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets and liabilities at December 31, 2019 and 2018. See additional information on tax reform and its impact on our income taxes in Note 9 - Income Taxes.\nResults of Operations\nWe derive a substantial portion of our revenues from contracts and subcontracts with the U.S. Government. Our revenues are generated from a number of contract vehicles and task orders. Over the past several years we have sought to diversify and improve our operating margins through an evolution of our business from an emphasis on product reselling to that of an advanced solutions technologies provider. To that end, although we continue to offer resold products through our contract vehicles, we have focused on selling solutions and outsourcing product sales, as well as designing and delivering Telos manufactured and branded technologies. We believe our contract portfolio is characterized as having low to moderate financial risk due to the limited number of long-term fixed price development contracts. Our firm fixed-price activities consist principally of contracts for the products and services at established contract prices. Our time-and-material contracts generally allow the pass-through of allowable costs plus a profit margin. For 2019, 2018, and 2017, the Company's revenue derived from firm fixed-price contracts was 82.7%, 74.9%, and 83.1%, respectively, cost-plus contracts was 8.2%, 12.9%, and 7.4%, respectively, and time-and-material contracts was 9.1%, 12.2%, and 9.5%, respectively.\nWe provide different solutions and are party to contracts of varying revenue types under the NETCENTS (Network-Centric Solutions) and NETCENTS-2 contracts to the U.S. Air Force. NETCENTS and NETCENTS-2 are IDIQ and GWAC, therefore any government customer may utilize the NETCENTS and NETCENTS-2 vehicles to meet its purchasing needs. Consequently, revenue earned on the underlying NETCENTS and NETCENTS-2 delivery orders varies from period to period according to the customer and solution mix for the products and services delivered during a particular period, unlike a standalone contract with one separately identified customer. The contracts themselves do not fund any orders and they state that the contracts are for an indefinite delivery and indefinite quantity. The majority of our task/delivery orders have periods of performance of less than 12 months, which contributes to the variances between interim and annual reporting periods. The period of performance for the original NETCENTS contract ended on September 30, 2013. Previously awarded task orders that contain periods of performance that extended past September 30, 2013, including exercisable option years under existing task orders, were not affected by the contract expiration. We were selected for an award on the NETCENTS replacement contract, NETCENTS-2 Network Operations and Infrastructure Solutions Small Business Companion, on March 27, 2014, and upon re-evaluation by the customer, we were again selected for an award on April 3, 2015 and the contract was opened for issuance of new orders in May 2015. We have also been awarded other IDIQ/GWACs, including the Department of Homeland Security's EAGLE II, GSA Alliant 2, and blanket purchase agreements under our GSA schedule. However, we have not been awarded significant delivery orders under EAGLE II, or GSA Alliant 2 as it was not ready for agencies to use until July 1, 2018.\nU.S. Government appropriations have been and continue to be affected by larger U.S. Government budgetary issues and related legislation. In 2011, Congress enacted the Budget Control Act of 2011 (the BCA\u201d), which established specific limits on annual appropriations for fiscal years 2012-2021. The BCA has been amended a number of times, most recently by the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2019 (the BBA\u201d), which was enacted on August 2, 2019. As a result, DoD funding levels have fluctuated over this period and have been difficult to predict. Most recently, while the two-year BBA allowed for modestly increased defense spending in FY 2020, unless and until it is again modified, the BBA also essentially will maintain defense spending in FY 2021 with only a minor increase (less than one percent) permitted above the current FY 2020 appropriated funding level.\nAccording to the Office of Management and Budget, federal outlays devoted to defense programs have fallen from 4.5 percent to 3.2 percent as a share of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) since enactment of the BCA. Moreover, as a result of the spending caps imposed by the BCA, annual DoD budget authority in FY 2020 is only 3.7 percent higher (in unadjusted dollars) than it was a decade ago in FY 2010.\nSince final enactment in December 2019 of appropriations legislation for FY 2020, and the February 10, 2020 submission of the President's proposed FY 2021 budget, the Coronavirus pandemic and associated economic dislocation in the United States has resulted in the need for an overwhelming federal response. This has led to the enactment of several comprehensive appropriations and economic stimulus measures, as well as negotiations between Congress and the White House for additional massive initiatives for the current year and into the next fiscal year, the details of which are not yet finalized. These substantial alterations to FY 2020 spending baselines are also likely to further impact FY 2021 spending in ways that cannot now be predicted. The impact of the health and economic crisis, and the resulting large increase in federal spending, on the government contracts that we hold and the federal procurements that we would otherwise compete for cannot now be known.\nIn addition to the ongoing need to respond to the crisis in the current fiscal year, Congress and the President must agree on FY 2021 appropriations legislation prior to October 1, 2020; failing to do so by then would likely mean DoD and other departments will again be funded for an unknown period of time under another Continuing Resolution, which would again restrict new spending initiatives. This is consistent with the practice for a number of years where the U.S. Government has been unable to complete its appropriations process prior to the beginning of the next fiscal year, resulting in actual or threatened governmental shut-downs and repeated use for extended time periods each year of Continuing Resolutions to fund part of all of the government. The impact of the substantial additional spending on the Coronavirus pandemic on the appropriations for FY 2021, and the appropriations process itself, is not now known.\nThe current health and economic crisis is highly fluid, and it is likely to continue to affect multiple federal departments and agencies for an unknown period of time and in ways that are difficult to predict. Nonetheless, we believe that the federal government will very likely endeavor to maintain continuity of services and, with much of the business of government now being conducted through use of information technology systems and in many cases during the crisis remotely, we believe there will still be a need on the part of the government for the types of solutions and services provided by Telos.\nWe anticipate there will continue to be a significant amount of debate and negotiations within the U.S. Government over federal and defense spending, and these deliberations may be impacted by the health and economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic in ways that are at this time difficult to foresee. In the context of these negotiations, it is possible that the U.S. Government, or portions of the U.S. Government, could be shut down or disrupted for periods of time, and that government programs could be modified, cut or replaced as part of broader reforms to reduce the federal deficit or efforts to redirect federal spending, whether related or unrelated to the COVID-19 crisis. For more information on the risks and uncertainties related to U.S. Government contracts, see Part I - Item 1A Risk Factors in this Annual Report on the Form 10-K.\nStatement of Operations Data\nThe

Revenue increased by 15.4% to $159.2 million for 2019 from $138.0 million for 2018. Such increase primarily consists of an increase in sales from the U.S. Air Force NETCENTS-2 contract. As discussed above, NETCENTS-2 is an IDIQ contract utilized by multiple government customers and sales under NETCENTS-2 vary from period to period according to the solution mix and timing of deliverables for a particular period. Services revenue increased by 18.7% to $143.6 million for 2019 from $121.0 million for 2018, primarily attributable to increases in sales of $10.8 million of Telos ID Enterprise Solutions, $9.2 million of Cyber & Cloud Solutions, $5.9 million of Secure Communications Cyber and Enterprise Solutions, offset by a decrease in sales of $3.4 million of Secure Mobility and Network Management/Defense Enterprise Solutions. The change in product and services revenue varies from period to period depending on the mix of solutions sold and the nature of such solutions, as well as the timing of deliverables. Product revenue decreased by 8.2% to $15.6 million for 2019 from $17.0 million for 2018, primarily attributable to decreases in sales of $0.9 million of Cyber & Cloud Solutions in proprietary software, and $0.8 million of Telos ID Enterprise Solutions, offset by an increase in sales of $0.4 million of proprietary software in Secure Communications Cyber and Enterprise Solutions.\nRevenue increased by 28.1% to $138.0 million for 2018 from $107.7 million for 2017. Such increase primarily consists of an increase in sales from the U.S. Air Force NETCENTS-2 contract. Services revenue increased by 48.3% to $121.0 million for 2018 from $81.6 million for 2017, primarily attributable to increases in sales of $22.7 million of Secure Mobility and Network Management/Defense Enterprise Solutions under several NETCENTS delivery orders for Telos-installed solutions which included $6.0 million of revenue accruals for multiple contracts as a result of several years of cumulative indirect rate adjustments, $10.6 million of Telos ID Enterprise solutions, $5.7 million of Cyber & Cloud Solutions, and $0.4 million of Secure Communications Cyber and Enterprise Solutions. Product revenue decreased by 34.8% to $17.0 million for 2018 from $26.1 million for 2017, primarily attributable to decreases in sales of $9.2 million of Telos ID Enterprise solutions, $2.0 million of resold products in Secure Mobility and Network Management/Defense Enterprise Solutions, and $1.0 million of proprietary software in Secure Communications Cyber and Enterprise Solutions, offset by an increase in sales of $3.1 million of Cyber & Cloud Solutions in proprietary software.\nCost of sales. Cost of sales increased by 25.8% to $106.9 million for 2019 from $85.0 million for 2018 as a result of increases in revenue. Cost of sales for services increased by $21.9 million, and as a percentage of services revenue increased by 5.3%, due to a change in the mix and nature of the programs including increases in sales of certain Telos-installed solutions in Secure Mobility and Network Management/Defense Enterprise Solutions under NETCENTS-2. Cost of sales for product increased by 0.1%, and as a percentage of product revenue increased by 4.3%, primarily due to declines in proprietary software sales.\nCost of sales increased by 26.5% to $85.0 million for 2018 from $67.2 million for 2017 as a result of increases in revenue. Cost of sales for services increased by $26.9 million, and as a percentage of services revenue increased by 2.3%, due to a change in the mix and nature of the programs including an increase in sales of certain Telos-installed solutions in Secure Mobility and Network Management/Defense Enterprise Solutions under NETCENTS-2 and due to other contracts in Cyber & Cloud Solutions, offset by the revenue accruals related to indirect rate adjustments discussed above which did not include direct costs in Secure Mobility and Network Management/Defense Enterprise Solutions deliverables. Cost of sales for product decreased by $9.1 million, primarily due to decreases in product revenue for resold products, and as a percentage of product revenue decreased by 18.3%, primarily due to declines in resold products, as well as increases in proprietary software sales.\nGross profit. Gross profit decreased by 1.4% to $52.3 million for 2019 from $53.1 million for 2018. Gross margin decreased to 32.9% for 2019 from 38.4% for 2018, due to various changes in the mix of contracts in all business lines, primarily decreases in proprietary software sales.\nGross profit increased by 30.8% to $53.1 million for 2018 from $40.6 million for 2017. Gross margin increased to 38.4% for 2018 from 37.7% for 2017, due to various changes in the mix of contracts in all business lines, primarily increases in sales of Cyber & Cloud Security solutions in proprietary software, as well as the revenue accruals related to indirect rate adjustments discussed above.\nSelling, general, and administrative expenses. Selling, general, and administrative expenses increased by 7.4% to $47.3 million for 2019 from $44.0 million for 2018. Such increase is primarily attributable to increases in labor costs of $1.9 million, bonuses of $0.5 million, bad debt expenses of $0.5 million, and outside services of $0.4 million.\nSelling, general, and administrative expenses increased by 9.7% to $44.0 million for 2018 from $40.2 million for 2017. Such increase is primarily attributable to increases in labor costs of $1.7 million, bonuses of $1.5 million, and capitalization and related amortization of software development costs of $0.6 million.\nInterest expense. Interest expense increased by 2.9% to $7.5 million for 2019 from $7.3 million for 2018, primarily due to an increase in interest on the EnCap senior term loan, offset by a decrease in interest on an equipment purchase arrangement.\nInterest expense increased by 8.5% to $7.3 million for 2018 from $6.7 million for 2017, primarily due to an increase in interest on the EnCap senior term loan and an equipment purchase arrangement.\nComponents of interest expense are as follows:\nTable 61: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (amounts in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Commercial and subordinated note interest incurred\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,644\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,436\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,848\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Preferred stock interest accrued\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 3,823\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 3,822\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 3,842\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 7,467\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 7,258\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 6,690\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nProvision for income taxes.\nIncome tax benefit was $104,000 for 2019, compared to an income tax provision of $31,000 for 2018, primarily attributable to the decrease in deferred tax liability due to the timing of the state conformity to the indefinite-lived net operating loss provision of the Tax Act (as described below). Income tax provision was $31,000 for 2018, compared to an income tax benefit of $2.8 million for 2017, primarily due to the decrease in the hanging credit deferred tax liability offset by the adjustment to the provisional estimate recorded for the hanging credit deferred tax liability under SAB 118.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAs described in more detail below, we maintain a Credit Agreement with EnCap and a Purchase Agreement with RCA. The willingness of RCA to purchase our accounts receivable under the Purchase Agreement and our ability to obtain additional financing may be limited due to various factors, including the eligibility of our receivables, the status of our business, global credit market conditions, and perceptions of our business or industry by EnCap, RCA, or other potential sources of financing. If we are unable to maintain the Purchase Agreement, we would need to obtain additional credit to fund our future operations. If credit is available in that event, lenders may impose more restrictive terms and higher interest rates that may reduce our borrowing capacity, increase our costs, or reduce our operating flexibility. The failure to maintain, extend, renew or replace the Purchase Agreement with a comparable arrangement or arrangements that provide similar amounts of liquidity for the Company would have a material negative impact on our overall liquidity, financial and operating results.\nWhile a variety of factors related to sources and uses of cash, such as timeliness of accounts receivable collections, vendor credit terms, or significant collateral requirements, ultimately impact our liquidity, such factors may or may not have a direct impact on our liquidity based on how the transactions associated with such circumstances impact our availability under our credit arrangements. For example, a contractual requirement to post collateral for a duration of several months, depending on the materiality of the amount, could have an immediate negative effect on our liquidity, as such a circumstance would utilize cash resources without a near-term cash inflow back to us. Likewise, the release of such collateral could have a corresponding positive effect on our liquidity, as it would represent an addition to our cash resources without any corresponding near-term cash outflow. Similarly, a slow-down of payments from a customer, group of customers or government payment office would not have an immediate and direct effect on our availability unless the slowdown was material in amount and over an extended period of time. Any of these examples would have an impact on our cash resources, our financing arrangements, and therefore our liquidity.\nManagement may determine that, in order to reduce capital and liquidity requirements, planned spending on capital projects and indirect expense growth may be curtailed, subject to growth in operating results. Additionally, management may seek to put in place a credit facility with a commercial bank or other potential lenders, although no assurance can be given that such a facility could be put in place under terms acceptable to the Company.\nOur working capital was $2.9 million and $2.1 million as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Although no assurances can be given, we expect that our financing arrangements with EnCap and RCA, collectively, and funds generated from operations are sufficient to maintain the liquidity we require to meet our operating, investing and financing needs for the next 12 months.\nCash provided by operating activities of $11.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to cash provided by operating activities of $6.3 million for 2018, and cash used in operating activities of $0.6 million for 2017. Cash provided by operating activities is primarily driven by our operating income, the timing of receipt of customer payments, the timing of payments to vendors and employees, and the timing of inventory turnover, adjusted for certain non-cash items that do not impact cash flows from operating activities. Additionally, cash provided by operating activities also includes approximately $3.8 million annually of dividends from preferred stock recorded as interest expense. In 2019, net loss was $2.1 million, which included $5.0 million of depreciation and amortization, $1.8 million of which amortization of capitalized software development costs. In 2018, net income was $1.7 million, which included $3.0 million of depreciation and amortization, $1.1 million of which amortization of capitalized software development costs. In 2017, net loss was $3.5 million, which included $2.0 million of depreciation and amortization and $2.8 million of income tax benefit.\nCash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017 was $6.5 million, $4.1 million, and $2.2 million, respectively, which, for the year ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, consisted of the capitalization of software development costs of $2.4 million, $1.6 million and $1.5 million, respectively, and the purchases of property and equipment of $4.1 million, $2.5 million and $0.7 million, respectively.\nCash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $1.4 million, compared to cash used in financing activities of $2.7 million for 2018, and cash provided by financing activities $2.8 million for 2017. The financing activities in 2019 consisted of net proceeds of $4.9 million from the EnCap senior term loan, distributions of $2.4 million to the Class B Member of Telos ID, and repayments of $1.1 million under finance leases. The financing activities in 2018 consisted of distributions of $1.7 million to the Class B Member of Telos ID and repayments of $1.0 million under finance leases. The financing activities in 2017 consisted of net proceeds of $9.4 million from the EnCap senior term loan, distributions of $3.7 million to the Class B Member of Telos ID, redemption of $2.1 million of senior preferred stock, and repayments of $0.9 million under finance leases.\nAdditionally, our capital structure consists of redeemable preferred stock and common stock. The capital structure is complex and requires an understanding of the terms of the instruments, certain restrictions on scheduled payments and redemptions of the various instruments, and the interrelationship of the instruments especially as it relates to the subordination hierarchy. Therefore, a thorough understanding of how our capital structure impacts our liquidity is necessary and, accordingly, we have disclosed the relevant information about each instrument as follows:\nEnlightenment Capital Credit Agreement\nOn January 25, 2017, we entered into a Credit Agreement (the \"Credit Agreement\") with Enlightenment Capital Solutions Fund II, L.P., as agent (the \"Agent\") and the lenders party thereto (the \"Lenders\") (together referenced as EnCap\u201d). The Credit Agreement provided for an $11 million senior term loan (the \"Loan\") with a maturity date of January 25, 2022, subject to acceleration in the event of customary events of default.\nAll borrowings under the Credit Agreement accrue interest at the rate of 13.0% per annum (the Accrual Rate\u201d). If, at the request of the Company, the Agent executes an intercreditor agreement with another senior lender under which the Agent and the Lenders subordinate their liens (an \"Alternative Interest Rate Event\"), the interest rate will increase to 14.5% per annum. After the occurrence and during the continuance of any event of default, the interest rate will increase 2.0%. The Company is obligated to pay accrued interest in cash on a monthly basis at a rate of not less than 10.0% per annum or, during the continuance of an Alternate Interest Rate Event, 11.5% per annum. The Company may elect to pay the remaining interest in cash, by payment-in-kind (by addition to the principal amount of the Loan) or by combination of cash and payment-in-kind. Upon thirty days prior written notice, the Company may prepay any portion or the entire amount of the Loan.\nAn amount of approximately $1.1 million was netted from the proceeds of the Loan as a prepayment of all interest due and payable at the Accrual Rate during the period from January 25, 2017 to October 31, 2017. A separate fee letter executed by the Company and the Agent, dated January 25, 2017, sets forth the fees payable to the Agent in connection with the Credit Agreement.\nThe Credit Agreement contains representations, warranties, covenants, terms and conditions customary for transactions of this type. In connection with the Credit Agreement, the Agent has been granted, for the benefit of the Lenders, a security interest in and general lien upon various property of the Company, subject to certain permitted liens and any intercreditor agreement. The occurrence of an event of default under the Credit Agreement could result in the Loan and other obligations becoming immediately due and payable and allow the Lenders to exercise all rights and remedies available to them under the Credit Agreement or as a secured party under the UCC, in addition to all other rights and remedies available to them.\nIn connection with the Credit Agreement, on January 25, 2017, the Company issued warrants (each, a \"Warrant\") to the Agent and certain of the Lenders representing in the aggregate the right to purchase in accordance with their terms 1,135,284.333 shares of the Class A Common Stock of the Company, no par value per share, which is equivalent to approximately 2.5% of the common equity interests of the Company on a fully diluted basis. The exercise price is $1.321 per share and each Warrant expires on January 25, 2027. The value of the warrants were determined to be de minimis and no value was allocated to them on a relative fair value basis in accounting for the debt instrument.\nThe Credit Agreement also included an $825,000 exit fee, which was payable upon any repayment or prepayment of the loan. This amount had been included in the total principal due and treated as an unamortized discount on the debt, which would be amortized over the term of the loan, using the effective interest method at a rate of 15.0%. We incurred fees and transaction costs of approximately $374,000 related to the issuance of the Credit Agreement, which are being amortized over the life of the Credit Agreement.\nEffective February 23, 2017, the Credit Agreement was amended to change the required timing of certain post-closing items to allow for more time to complete the legal and administrative requirements around such items. On April 18, 2017, the Credit Agreement was further amended (the Second Amendment\u201d) to incorporate the parties' agreement to subordinate certain debt owed by the Company to the affiliated entities of Mr. John R. C. Porter (the Subordinated Debt\u201d) and to redeem all outstanding shares of the Series A-1 Redeemable Preferred Stock and the Series A-2 Redeemable Preferred Stock, including those owned by Mr. John R.C. Porter and his affiliates, for an aggregate redemption price of $2.1 million.\nIn connection with the Second Amendment and that subordination of debt, on April 18, 2017, we also entered into Subordination and Intercreditor Agreements (the Intercreditor Agreements\u201d) with affiliated entities of Mr. John R. C. Porter (together referenced as Porter\u201d), in which Porter agreed that the Subordinated Debt is fully subordinated to the amended Credit Agreement and related documents, and that required payments, if any, under the Subordinated Debt are permitted only if certain conditions are met.\nOn March 30, 2018, the Credit Agreement was further amended (the Third Amendment\u201d) to waive certain covenant defaults and to reset the covenants for 2018 measurement periods to more accurately reflect the Company's projected performance for the year. The measurement against the covenants for consolidated leverage ratio and consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio were agreed to not be measured as of December 31, 2017 and were reset for 2018 measurement periods. Additionally, a minimum revenue covenant and a net working capital covenant were added. In consideration of these amendments, the interest rate on the loan was increased by 1%, which will revert back to the original rate upon achievement of two consecutive quarters of a specified fixed charge coverage ratio as defined in the agreement. The Company may elect to pay the increase in interest expense in cash or by payment-in-kind (by addition to the principal amount of the Loan). The increase in interest expense has been paid in cash. Contemporaneously with the Third Amendment, Mr. John B. Wood agreed to transfer 50,000 shares of the Company's Class A Common Stock owned by him to EnCap.\nOn July 19, 2019, we entered into the Fourth Amendment to Credit Agreement and Waiver; First Amendment to Fee Letter ( Fourth Amendment\u201d) to amend the Credit Agreement. As a result of the Fourth Amendment, several terms of the Credit Agreement were amended, including the following:\nTable 62: <table> <tr> <td>\u25cf </td> <td> The Company borrowed an additional $5 million from the Lenders, increasing the total amount of the principal to $16 million.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 63: <table> <tr> <td>\u25cf </td> <td> The maturity date of the Credit Agreement was amended from January 25, 2022 to January 15, 2021.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 64: <table> <tr> <td>\u25cf </td> <td> The prepayment price was amended as follows: (a) from January 26, 2019 through January 25, 2020, the prepayment price is 102% of the principal amount, (b) from January 26, 2020 through October 14, 2020, the prepayment price is 101% of the principal amount, and (c) from October 15, 2020 to the maturity date, the prepayment price will be at par. However, the prepayment price for the additional $5 million loan attributable to the Fourth Amendment will be at par.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 65: <table> <tr> <td>\u25cf </td> <td> The following financial covenants, as defined in the Credit Agreement, were amended and updated: Consolidated Leverage Ratio, Consolidated Senior Leverage Ratio, Consolidated Capital Expenditures, Minimum Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, and Minimum Consolidated Net Working Capital.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 66: <table> <tr> <td>\u25cf </td> <td> Any actual or potential non-compliance with the applicable provisions of the Credit Agreement were waived.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 67: <table> <tr> <td>\u25cf </td> <td> The borrowing under the Credit Agreement continues to be collateralized by substantially all of the Company's assets including inventory, equipment and accounts receivable.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 68: <table> <tr> <td>\u25cf </td> <td> The Company paid the Agent a fee of $110,000 in connection with the Fourth Amendment.

For the measurement period ended December 31, 2019 we were in compliance with the Credit Agreement's financial covenants, based on an agreement between the Company and EnCap on the definition of certain input factors that determine the measurement against the covenants.\nOn March 26, 2020, the Credit Agreement was amended (the Fifth Amendment\u201d) to modify the financial covenants for 2020 through the maturity of the Credit Agreement to establish that the covenants will remain at the December 31, 2019 levels and to update the previously agreed-upon definition of certain financial covenants, specifically the amount of Capital Expenditures to be included in the measurement of the covenants. The Fifth Amendment also provides for the right for the Company to elect to extend the maturity date of the Credit Agreement which is currently scheduled to mature on January 15, 2021. The Fifth Amendment provides for four quarterly maturity date extensions, which would increase the Exit Fee payable under the Credit Agreement by $250,000 for each quarterly maturity date extension elected, for a total of $1 million increase to the Exit Fee were all four of the maturity date extensions to be elected. The Company paid EnCap an amendment fee of $100,000 and out-of-pocket costs and expenses in consideration for the Fifth Amendment.\nWe incurred interest expense in the amount of $2.2 million, $1.7 million and $1.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively, under the Credit Agreement.\nAccounts Receivable Purchase Agreement\nOn July 15, 2016, we entered into an Accounts Receivable Purchase Agreement (the Purchase Agreement\u201d) with Republic Capital Access, LLC ( RCA\u201d or Buyer\u201d), pursuant to which we may offer for sale, and RCA, in its sole discretion, may purchase, eligible accounts receivable relating to U.S. Government prime contracts or subcontracts of the Company (collectively, the Purchased Receivables\u201d). Upon purchase, RCA becomes the absolute owner of any such Purchased Receivables, which are payable directly to RCA, subject to certain repurchase obligations of the Company. The total amount of Purchased Receivables is subject to a maximum limit of $10 million of outstanding Purchased Receivables (the Maximum Amount\u201d) at any given time. The Purchase Agreement had an initial term expiring on June 30, 2018 and automatically renews for successive 12-month renewal periods unless terminated in writing by either the Company or RCA. On March 2, 2018, the term of the Purchase Agreement was extended to June 30, 2020. On November 15, 2019, the term of the Purchase Agreement was extended to June 30, 2022. No fee or consideration of any kind was paid in connection with these extensions.\nThe initial purchase price of a Purchased Receivable is equal to 90% of the face value of the receivable if the account debtor is an agency of the U.S. Government, and 85% if the account debtor is not an agency of the U.S. Government; provided, however, that RCA has the right to adjust these initial purchase price rates in its sole discretion. After collection by RCA of the portion of a Purchased Receivable in excess of the initial purchase price, RCA shall pay the Company the residual 10% or 15% of such Purchased Receivable, as appropriate, less (i) a discount factor equal to 0.30%, for federal government prime contracts (or 0.56% for non-federal government investment grade account obligors or 0.62% for non-federal government non-investment grade account obligors) of the face amounts of Purchased Receivables; (ii) a program access fee equal to 0.008% of the daily ending account balance for each day that the Purchased Receivables are outstanding; (iii) a commitment fee equal to 1% per annum of the Maximum Amount minus the amount of Purchased Receivables outstanding; and (iv) fees, costs and expenses relating to the preparation, administration and enforcement of the Purchase Agreement and any other related agreements.\nThe Purchase Agreement provides that in the event, but only to the extent, that the conveyance of Purchased Receivables by the Company is characterized by a court or other governmental authority as a loan rather than a sale, the Company shall be deemed to have granted RCA, effective as of the date of the first purchase under the Purchase Agreement, a security interest in all of the Company's right, title and interest in, to and under all of the Purchased Receivables, whether now or hereafter owned, existing or arising.\nThe Company provides a power of attorney to RCA to take certain actions in the Company's stead, including (a) to sell, assign or transfer in whole or in part any of the Purchased Receivables; (b) to demand, receive and give releases to any account debtor with respect to amounts due under any Purchased Receivables; (c) to notify all account debtors with respect to the Purchased Receivables; and (d) to take any actions necessary to perfect RCA's interests in the Purchased Receivables.\nThe Company is liable to the Buyer for any fraudulent statements and all representations, warranties, covenants, and indemnities made by the Company pursuant to the terms of the Purchase Agreement. It is considered an event of default if (a) the Company fails to pay any amounts it owes to RCA when due (subject to a cure period); (b) the Company has voluntary or involuntary bankruptcy proceedings commenced by or against it; (c) the Company is no longer solvent or is generally not paying its debts as they become due; (d) any voluntary liens, garnishments, attachments, or the like are issued against or attach to the Purchased Receivables; (e) the Company breaches any warranty, representation, or covenant (subject to a cure period); (f) the Company is not in compliance or has otherwise defaulted under any document or obligation in favor of RCA or an RCA affiliate; or (g) the Purchase Agreement or any material provision terminates (other than in accordance with the terms of the Purchase Agreement) or ceases to be effective or to be a binding obligation of the Company. If any such event of default occurs, then RCA may take certain actions, including ceasing to buy any eligible receivables, declaring any indebtedness or other obligations immediately due and payable, or terminating the Purchase Agreement.\nFinancing and Security Agreement\nOn July 15, 2016, we entered into a Financing and Security Agreement (the Financing Agreement\u201d) with Action Capital Corporation ( Action Capital\u201d), pursuant to which Action Capital agreed to provide the Company with advances of up to 90% of the net amount of certain acceptable customer accounts of the Company that have been assigned as collateral to Action Capital (the Acceptable Accounts\u201d). The maximum outstanding principal amount of advances under the Financing Agreement was $5 million. The Financing Agreement had a term of two years, provided that the Company may terminate it at any time without penalty upon written notice. On August 13, 2018, the Financing Agreement was extended through January 2, 2019. No fee or consideration of any kind was paid in connection with this extension. The Financing Agreement was not extended beyond this date.\nSubordinated Debt\nOn March 31, 2015, the Company entered into Subordinated Loan Agreements and Subordinated Promissory Notes ( Porter Notes\u201d) with affiliated entities of Mr. John R. C. Porter (together referenced as Porter\u201d). Mr. Porter and Toxford Corporation, of which Mr. Porter is the sole shareholder, own 35.0% of our Class A Common Stock. Under the terms of the Porter Notes, Porter lent the Company $2.5 million on or about March 31, 2015. Telos also entered into Subordination and Intercreditor Agreements (the Subordination Agreements\u201d) with Porter and a prior senior lender, in which the Porter Notes were fully subordinated to the financing provided by that senior lender, and payments under the Porter Notes were permitted only if certain conditions are met. According to the original terms of the Porter Notes, the outstanding principal sum bears interest at the fixed rate of twelve percent (12%) per annum which would be payable in arrears in cash on the 20th day of each May, August, November and February, with the first interest payment date due on August 20, 2015. The Porter Notes do not call for amortization payments and are unsecured. The Porter Notes, in whole or in part, may be repaid at any time without premium or penalty. The unpaid principal, together with interest, was originally due and payable in full on July 1, 2017.\nOn April 18, 2017, we amended and restated the Porter Notes to reduce the interest rate from twelve percent (12%) to six percent (6%) per annum, to be accrued, and extended the maturity date from July 1, 2017 to July 25, 2022. Telos also entered into Intercreditor Agreements with Porter and EnCap, in which the Porter Notes are fully subordinated to the Credit Agreement and any subsequent senior lenders, and payments under the Porter Notes are permitted only if certain conditions are met. All other terms remain in full force and effect. As a result of the amendment and restatement of the Porter Notes, we recorded a gain on extinguishment of debt of approximately $1 million, which consisted of the remeasurement of the debt at fair value. As the extinguishment was with a related party, the transaction was deemed to be a capital transaction and the gain was recorded in the Company's stockholders' deficit as of December 31, 2017. We incurred interest expense in the amount of $330,000, $308,000, and $292,000 for 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively, on the Porter Notes. As of December 31, 2019, approximately $1.1 million of accrued interest was payable according to the stated interest rate of the Porter Notes.\nPublic Preferred Stock\nA maximum of 6,000,000 shares of the Public Preferred Stock, par value $.01 per share, has been authorized for issuance. We initially issued 2,858,723 shares of the Public Preferred Stock pursuant to the acquisition of the Company during fiscal year 1990. The Public Preferred Stock was recorded at fair value on the date of original issue, November 21, 1989, and we made periodic accretions under the interest method of the excess of the redemption value over the recorded value. We adjusted our estimate of accrued accretion in the amount of $1.5 million in the second quarter of 2006. The Public Preferred Stock was fully accreted as of December 2008. We declared stock dividends totaling 736,863 shares in 1990 and 1991. Since 1991, no other dividends, in stock or cash, have been declared. In November 1998, we retired 410,000 shares of the Public Preferred Stock. The total number of shares issued and outstanding at December 31, 2019 and 2018, was 3,185,586. The Public Preferred Stock is quoted as TLSRP\u201d on the OTCQB marketplace and the OTC Bulletin Board.\nSince 1991, no dividends were declared or paid on our Public Preferred Stock, based upon our interpretation of restrictions in our Articles of Amendment and Restatement, limitations in the terms of the Public Preferred Stock instrument, specific dividend payment restrictions in various financing agreements to which the Public Preferred Stock is subject, other senior obligations currently or previously in existence, and Maryland law limitations in existence prior to October 1, 2009. Subsequent to the 2009 Maryland law change, dividend payments continue to be prohibited except under certain specific circumstances as set forth in Maryland Code Section 2-311, which the Company did not satisfy as of the measurement dates. Pursuant to the terms of the Articles of Amendment and Restatement, we were scheduled, but not required, to redeem the Public Preferred Stock in five annual tranches during the years 2005 through 2009. However, due to our substantial senior obligations currently or previously in existence, limitations set forth in the covenants in the Credit Agreement and the Porter Notes, foreseeable capital and operational requirements, and restrictions and prohibitions of our Articles of Amendment and Restatement, we were and remain unable to meet the redemption schedule set forth in the terms of the Public Preferred Stock as of the measurement dates. Moreover, the Public Preferred Stock is not payable on demand, nor callable, for failure to redeem the Public Preferred Stock in accordance with the redemption schedule set forth in the instrument. Therefore, we classify these securities as noncurrent liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2019 and 2018.\nOn January 25, 2017, we became parties with certain of our subsidiaries to the Credit Agreement with EnCap. Under the Credit Agreement, we agreed that, until full and final payment of the obligations under the Credit Agreement, we would not make any distribution or declare or pay any dividends (other than common stock) on our stock, or purchase, acquire, or redeem any stock, or exchange any stock for indebtedness, or retire any stock. Additionally, the Porter Notes contain similar prohibitions on dividend payments or stock redemptions.\nAccordingly, as stated above, we will continue to classify the entirety of our obligation to redeem the Public Preferred Stock as a long-term obligation. The Credit Agreement and the Porter Notes prohibit, among other things, the redemption of any stock, common or preferred, other than as described above. The Public Preferred Stock by its terms also cannot be redeemed if doing so would violate the terms of an agreement regarding the borrowing of funds or the extension of credit which is binding upon us or any of our subsidiaries, and it does not include any other provisions that would otherwise require any acceleration of the redemption of or amortization of payments with respect to the Public Preferred Stock. Thus, the Public Preferred Stock is not and will not be due on demand, nor callable, within 12 months from December 31, 2019. This classification is consistent with ASC 210, Balance Sheet\u201d and 470, Debt\u201d and the FASB ASC Master Glossary definition of Current Liabilities.\u201d\nASC 210 and the FASB ASC Master Glossary define current liabilities as follows: The term current liabilities is used principally to designate obligations whose liquidation is reasonably expected to require the use of existing resources properly classifiable as current assets, or the creation of other current liabilities. As a balance sheet category, the classification is intended to include obligations for items which have entered into the operating cycle, such as payables incurred in the acquisition of materials and supplies to be used in the production of goods or in providing services to be offered for sale; collections received in advance of the delivery of goods or performance of services; and debts that arise from operations directly related to the operating cycle, such as accruals for wages, salaries, commissions, rentals, royalties, and income and other taxes. Other liabilities whose regular and ordinary liquidation is expected to occur within a relatively short period of time, usually twelve months, are also intended for inclusion, such as short-term debts arising from the acquisition of capital assets, serial maturities of long-term obligations, amounts required to be expended within one year under sinking fund provisions, and agency obligations arising from the collection or acceptance of cash or other assets for the account of third persons.\nASC 470 provides the following: The current liability classification is also intended to include obligations that, by their terms, are due on demand or will be due on demand within one year (or operating cycle, if longer) from the balance sheet date, even though liquidation may not be expected within that period. It is also intended to include long-term obligations that are or will be callable by the creditor either because the debtor's violation of a provision of the debt agreement at the balance sheet date makes the obligation callable or because the violation, if not cured within a specified grace period, will make the obligation callable.\nIf, pursuant to the terms of the Public Preferred Stock, we do not redeem the Public Preferred Stock in accordance with the scheduled redemptions described above, the terms of the Public Preferred Stock require us to discharge our obligation to redeem the Public Preferred Stock as soon as we are financially capable and legally permitted to do so. Therefore, by its very terms, the Public Preferred Stock is not due on demand or callable for failure to make a scheduled payment pursuant to its redemption provisions and is properly classified as a noncurrent liability.\nWe pay dividends on the Public Preferred Stock when and if declared by the Board of Directors. The Public Preferred Stock accrues a semi-annual dividend at the annual rate of 12% ($1.20) per share, based on the liquidation preference of $10 per share, and is fully cumulative. Dividends in additional shares of the Public Preferred Stock for 1990 and 1991 were paid at the rate of 6% per share for each $.60 of such dividends not paid in cash. For the cash dividends payable since December 1, 1995, we have accrued $107.4 million and $103.5 million as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. We accrued dividends on the Public Preferred Stock of $3.8 million for each of the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, which was recorded as interest expense. Prior to the effective date of ASC 480 on July 1, 2003, such dividends were charged to stockholders' accumulated deficit.\nSenior Redeemable Preferred Stock\nThe Senior Redeemable Preferred Stock was senior to all other outstanding equity of the Company, including the Public Preferred Stock. The Series A-1 ranked on a parity with the Series A-2. The components of the authorized Senior Redeemable Preferred Stock were 1,250 shares of Series A-1 and 1,750 shares of Series A-2 Senior Redeemable Preferred Stock, each with $.01 par value. The Senior Redeemable Preferred Stock carried a cumulative per annum dividend rate of 14.125% of its liquidation value of $1,000 per share. The dividends were payable semiannually on June 30 and December 31 of each year. We had not declared dividends on our Senior Redeemable Preferred Stock since its issuance, other than in connection with the redemptions from 2010 to 2013. The liquidation preference of the Senior Redeemable Preferred Stock was the face amount of the Series A-1 and A-2 ($1,000 per share), plus all accrued and unpaid dividends.\nDue to the terms of the Credit Agreement, the Porter Notes, other senior obligations currently or previously in existence, the Senior Redeemable Preferred Stock and applicable provisions of Maryland law governing the payment of distributions, we had been precluded from redeeming the Senior Redeemable Preferred Stock and paying any accrued and unpaid dividends on the Senior Redeemable Preferred Stock, other than the redemptions that occurred from 2010 to 2013. In addition, certain holders of the Senior Redeemable Preferred Stock had entered into standby agreements whereby, among other things, those holders would not demand any payments in respect of dividends or redemptions of their instruments and the maturity dates of the instruments have been extended.\nIn accordance with the requirements of the Second Amendment to the EnCap Credit Agreement, we redeemed all outstanding shares of the Senior Redeemable Preferred Stock on April 18, 2017 for $2.1 million.\nWe accrued dividends on the Senior Redeemable Preferred Stock of $0, $0, and $20,000 for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively, which were reported as interest expense. Prior to the effective date of ASC 480-10, Distinguishing Liabilities from Equity,\u201d on July 1, 2003, such dividends were charged to stockholders' deficit.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following summarizes our contractual obligations and our redeemable preferred stock at December 31, 2019 (in thousands):\nTable 70: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Payments due by Period\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\nTotal\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2021 - 2023\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2024 - 2026\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2027 and later\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Finance lease obligations (1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 21,411\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,047\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 6,449\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 6,944\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 5,971\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Senior term loan (2)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 19,476\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2,190\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 17,286\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> ----\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> ----\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Subordinated debt (3)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 3,905\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> ----\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 3,905\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> ----\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> ----\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating lease obligations (4)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 2,443\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 1,647\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> ----\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 47,235\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 5,005\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 29,287\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 6,972\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 5,971\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Public preferred stock (5)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 139,210\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 186,445\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> (1) Includes interest expense:\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 4,546\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,056\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,304\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(2) Amount represents the carrying value as of December 31, 2019, plus interest and fee accrual of $3.1 million, is due and payable in full on January 15, 2021.\n(3) Amount represents the carrying value as of December 31, 2019 plus interest accrual of $1.0million, is due and payable in full on July 25, 2022.\n(4) Includes\noperating lease right-of-use obligations and short-term leases with terms of 12 months or less.\n(5) In accordance with ASC 480, the public preferred stock was reclassified from equity to liability in July 2003. Amount represents the carrying value as of December 31, 2019, and includes accrual of accumulated dividends and accretion of $132.8 million. Payment of such amount presumes conditions precedent being satisfied (See Note 7 - Redeemable Preferred Stock) and as such, redemption date is unknown and accordingly payment is not reflected in a particular period. Amount does not reflect additional dividends and accretion through the redemption date as such date is unknown. Such additional dividends accrue annually in the amount of $3.8 million. Such accretion has been fully accreted as of December 31, 2008.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe have no off-balance sheet arrangements (as defined in Item 303, paragraph (a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S-K) that have or are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, sales or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.\nCapital Expenditures\nCapital expenditures for property and equipment were $4.1 million, $2.5 million, and $0.7 million for 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively. We presently anticipate capital expenditures of approximately $3.5 million in 2020; however, there can be no assurance that this level of capital expenditures will occur. We believe that available cash and borrowings under the Purchase Agreement will be sufficient to generate adequate amounts of cash to fund our projected capital expenditures for 2020.\nLeases and Related Obligations\nWe have various lease agreements for property and equipment that, pursuant to ASC 840, Leases,\u201d require us to record the present value of the minimum lease payments for such equipment and property as an asset in our consolidated financial statements. Such assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over the term of the related lease or their useful life, whichever is shorter.\nWe adopted ASU 2016-02 effective January 1, 2019 and recorded right-of-use assets and liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet and expanded disclosures about leasing arrangements, among other items, for most lease arrangements.\nInflation\nThe rate of inflation has been moderate over the past five years and, accordingly, has not had a significant impact on the Company. We have generally been able to pass through any increased costs to customers through higher prices to the extent permitted by competitive pressures.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 1 -

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nGeneral\nThe solutions we offer secure cyberspace, the cloud environment, and the people and operations of the enterprise. These three facets of the modern organization share much in common, but also require a diverse range of skills, capabilities, and experience to meet the important requirements of security-conscious customers. Telos' decades-long resume of providing a broad spectrum of technology and security solutions uniquely qualifies us to meet our customers' needs in these three areas. Our experience in addressing challenges in one operation of the enterprise informs our work in meeting requirements in others. We understand that a range of complementary capabilities may be needed to solve a single challenge, and we also recognize when a single solution might address multiple challenges.\nOur substantive expertise in developing, orchestrating, and delivering solutions across these areas gives us the vision and the confidence to provide solutions that empower and protect the enterprise at an integrated, holistic level.\nOur capabilities include:\n \u25cf Cybersecurity - Today's enterprises need to understand and manage their cyber risk and reduce their cyber attack surfaces. Telos helps our customers assure the ongoing security, integrity, and compliance of their on-premises and cloud-based systems and to reduce threats and vulnerabilities to foil cyber adversaries before they can attack. Our consultants assess our customers' security environments and design, engineer, and operate the systems they need to strengthen their cybersecurity posture. \n \u25cf Cloud Security - The cloud as an organizational resource is more than two decades old, yet the needs of cloud users are constantly changing. Telos offers the specialized skills and experience needed to help our customers plan, engineer, and execute secure cloud migration strategies and then assure ongoing management and security in keeping with the leading standards for cloud-based systems and workloads. \n \u25cf Enterprise Security - Securing the enterprise means protecting the essential and timeless elements common to every organization: Its people and processes, its supply chain and inventories, its finances and facilities, its information and communications. As ICT and OT systems have become part of the organizational DNA, Telos has led with offerings that ensure personnel can work securely and productively across and beyond the enterprise. \nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements include revenue recognition, allowance for doubtful accounts receivable, allowance for inventory obsolescence, the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets, income taxes, contingencies and litigation, potential impairments of goodwill and intangible assets, estimated pension-related costs for our foreign subsidiaries and accretion of Public Preferred Stock. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nThe following is a summary of the most critical accounting policies used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe account for revenue in accordance with Accounting Standard Codification ( ASC\u201d) Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers.\u201d The unit of account in ASC 606 is a performance obligation which is a promise in a contract with a customer, to transfer a good or service to the customer. ASC 606 prescribes a five-step model for recognizing revenue that includes identifying the contract with the customer, determining the performance obligation(s), determining the transaction price, allocating the transaction price to the performance obligation(s), and recognizing revenue as the performance obligations are satisfied. Timing of the satisfaction of performance obligations varies across our businesses due to our diverse product and service mix, customer base, and contractual terms. Significant judgment can be required in determining certain performance obligations, and these determinations could change the amount of revenue and profit recorded in a given period. Our contracts may have a single performance obligation or multiple performance obligations. When there are multiple performance obligations within a contract, we allocate the transaction price to each performance obligation based on our best estimate of standalone selling price.\nWe account for a contract after it has been approved by the parties to the contract, the rights and the payment terms of the parties are identified, the contract has commercial substance and collectability is probable, which is presumed for our U.S. Government customers and prime contractors for which we perform as subcontractors to U.S. Government end-customers.\nThe majority of our revenue is recognized over time, as control is transferred continuously to our customers who receive and consume benefits as we perform, and is classified as services revenue. All of our business groups earn services revenue under a variety of contract types, including time and materials, firm-fixed price, firm fixed price level of effort, and cost plus fixed fee contract types, which may include variable consideration as discussed further below. Revenue is recognized over time using costs incurred to date relative to total estimated costs at completion to measure progress toward satisfying our performance obligations. Incurred cost represents work performed, which corresponds with, and thereby best depicts, the transfer of control to the customer. Contract costs include labor, material, subcontractor costs and indirect expenses. This continuous transfer of control to the customer is supported by clauses in our contracts with U.S. Government customers whereby the customer may terminate a contract for convenience and then pay for costs incurred plus a profit, at which time the customer would take control of any work in process. For non-U.S. Government contracts where we perform as a subcontractor and our order includes similar Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) provisions as the prime contractor's order from the U.S. Government, continuous transfer of control is likewise supported by such provisions. For other non-U.S. Government customers, continuous transfer of control to such customers is also supported due to general terms in our contracts and rights to recover damages which would include, among other potential damages, the right to payment for our work performed to date plus a reasonable profit.\nDue to the transfer of control over time, revenue is recognized based on progress towards completion of the performance obligation. The selection of the method to measure progress towards completion requires judgment and is based on the nature of the performance obligations. We generally use the cost-to-cost measure of progress on a proportional performance basis for our contracts because it best depicts the transfer of control to the customer which occurs as we incur costs on our contracts. Under the cost-to-cost measure of progress, the extent of progress towards completion is measured based on the ratio of costs incurred to date to the total estimated costs at completion of the performance obligation. Revenues are recorded proportionally as costs are incurred. Due to the nature of the work required to be performed on certain of our performance obligations, the estimation of total revenue and cost at completion is complex, subject to many variables and requires significant judgment. Contract estimates are based on various assumptions including labor and subcontractor costs, materials and other direct costs and the complexity of the work to be performed. A significant change in one or more of these estimates could affect the profitability of our contracts. We review and update our contract-related estimates regularly and recognize adjustments in estimated profit on contracts on a cumulative catch-up basis, which may result in an adjustment increasing or decreasing revenue to date on a contract in a particular period that the adjustment is identified. Revenue and profit in future periods of contract performance are recognized using the adjusted estimate.\nRevenue that is recognized at a point in time is for the sale of software licenses in our Secure Mobility and Network Management/Defense Enterprise Solutions (formerly CO&D's Secure Mobility Solutions) and Secure Communications Cyber and Enterprise Solutions (formerly IT & Enterprise Solutions) business groups and for the sale of resold products in Telos ID Enterprise Solutions (formerly Identity Management Solutions) and Cyber & Cloud Solutions (formerly CO&D's Cyber Security Solutions), and is classified as product revenue. Revenue on these contracts is recognized when the customer obtains control of the transferred product or service, which is generally upon delivery of the product to the customer for their use, due to us maintaining control of the product until that point. Orders for the sale of software licenses may contain multiple performance obligations, such as maintenance, training, or consulting services, which are typically delivered over time, consistent with the transfer of control disclosed above for the provision of services. When an order contains multiple performance obligations, we allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations using our best estimate of standalone selling price.\nContracts are routinely and often modified to account for changes in contract requirements, specifications, quantities, or price. Depending on the nature of the modification, we determine whether to account for the modification as an adjustment to the existing contract or as a new contract. Generally, modifications are not distinct from the existing contract due to the significant interrelatedness of the performance obligations and are therefore accounted for as an adjustment to the existing contract, and recognized as a cumulative adjustment to revenue (as either an increase or reduction of revenue) based on the modification's effect on progress toward completion of a performance obligation.\nOur contracts may include various types of variable consideration, such as claims (for instance, indirect rate or other equitable adjustments) or incentive fees. We include estimated amounts in the transaction price based on all of the information available to us, including historical information and future estimations, and to the extent it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when any uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is resolved. We have revised and re-submitted several years of incurred cost submissions reflecting certain indirect rate structure changes as a result of regular Defense Contract Audit Agency ( DCAA\u201d) audits of incurred cost submissions. This resulted in signed final rate agreement letters for fiscal years 2011 to 2013 and conformed incurred cost submissions for 2014 to 2015. We evaluated the resulting changes to revenue under the applicable cost plus fixed fee contracts for the years 2011 to 2015 as variable consideration, and determined the most likely amount to which we expect to be entitled, to the extent that no constraint exists that would preclude recognizing this revenue or result in a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized. We included these estimated amounts of variable consideration in the transaction price and as performance on these contracts is complete, we have recognized revenue of $6.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2018.\nHistorically, most of our contracts do not include award or incentive fees. For incentive fees, we would include such fees in the transaction price to the extent we could reasonably estimate the amount of the fee. With limited historical experience, we have not included any revenue related to incentive fees in our estimated transaction prices. We may include in our contract estimates additional revenue for submitted contract modifications or claims against the customer when we believe we have an enforceable right to the modification or claim, the amount can be estimated reliably and its realization is probable. We consider the contractual/legal basis for the claim (in particular FAR provisions), the facts and circumstances around any additional costs incurred, the reasonableness of those costs and the objective evidence available to support such claims.\nFor our contracts that have an original duration of one year or less, we use the practical expedient applicable to such contracts and do not consider the time value of money. We capitalize sales commissions related to proprietary software and related services that are directly tied to sales. We do not elect the practical expedient to expense as incurred the incremental costs of obtaining a contract if the amortization period would have been one year or less. For the sales commissions that are capitalized, we amortize the asset over the expected customer life, which is based on recent and historical data.\nContract assets are amounts that are invoiced as work progresses in accordance with agreed-upon contractual terms, either at periodic intervals or upon achievement of contractual milestones. Generally, revenue recognition occurs before billing, resulting in contract assets. These contract assets are referred to as unbilled receivables and are reported within accounts receivable, net of reserve on our consolidated balance sheets.\nBilled receivables are amounts billed and due from our customers and are reported within accounts receivable, net of reserve on the consolidated balance sheets. The portion of the payments retained by the customer until final contract settlement is not considered a significant financing component due to the intent of the retainage being the customer's protection with respect to full and final performance under the contract.\nContract liabilities are payments received in advance and milestone payments from our customers on selected contracts that exceed revenue earned to date, resulting in contract liabilities. Contract liabilities typically are not considered a significant financing component because they are generally satisfied within one year and are used to meet working capital demands that can be higher in the early stages of a contract. Contract liabilities are reported on our consolidated balance sheet on a net contract basis at the end of each reporting period.\nWe have one reportable segment. We treat sales to U.S. customers as sales within the U.S. regardless of where the services are performed. Substantially all of our revenues are from U.S. customers as revenue derived from international customers is de minimus. The following tables disclose revenue (in thousands) by customer type and contract type for the periods presented. Prior period amounts have not been adjusted under the modified retrospective method.\n\n\nThe following table discloses accounts receivable and contract assets (in thousands):\n\nThe following table discloses contract liabilities (in thousands):\n\nAs of December 31, 2019 and 2018, we had $112.4 million and $79.3 million of remaining performance obligations, respectively, which we also refer to as funded backlog. We expect to recognize approximately 98.4% of our remaining performance obligations as revenue in 2020, an additional 1.1% by 2021 and the balance thereafter. For the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, the amount of revenue recognized during the year that was included in the opening contract liabilities balance was $4.2 million and $5.5 million, respectively.\nInventories\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value, where cost is determined primarily on the weighted average cost method. Inventories consist primarily of purchased off-the-shelf hardware and software, and component computer parts used in connection with system integration services that we perform. Inventories also include spare parts utilized to support certain maintenance contracts. Spare parts inventory is amortized on a straight-line basis over two to five years, which represents the shorter of the warranty period or estimated useful life of the asset. An allowance for obsolete, slow-moving or non-salable inventory is provided for all other inventory. This allowance is based on our overall obsolescence experience and our assessment of future inventory requirements.\nGoodwill\nWe evaluate the impairment of goodwill in accordance with ASC 350, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other,\u201d which requires goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets to be assessed on at least an annual basis for impairment using a fair value basis. Between annual evaluations, if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying amount, then impairment must be evaluated. Such circumstances could include, but are not limited to: (1) a significant adverse change in legal factors or business climate, or (2) a loss of key contracts or customers.\nAs the result of an acquisition, we record any excess purchase price over the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired as goodwill. An allocation of the purchase price to tangible and intangible net assets acquired is based upon our valuation of the acquired assets. Goodwill is not amortized, but is subject to annual impairment tests. We complete our goodwill impairment tests as of December 31st each year. Additionally, we make evaluations between annual tests if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. The evaluation is based on the estimation of the fair values of our three reporting units, Cyber Operations and Defense ( CO&D\u201d), Telos ID Enterprise Solutions, and Secure Communications Cyber and Enterprise Solutions, of which goodwill is housed in the CO&D reporting unit, in comparison to the reporting unit's net asset carrying values. Our discounted cash flows required management's judgment with respect to forecasted revenue streams and operating margins, capital expenditures and the selection and use of an appropriate discount rate. We utilized the weighted average cost of capital as derived by certain assumptions specific to our facts and circumstances as the discount rate. The net assets attributable to the reporting units are determined based upon the estimated assets and liabilities attributable to the reporting units in deriving its free cash flows. In addition, the estimate of the total fair value of our reporting units is compared to the market capitalization of the Company. The Company's assessment resulted in a fair value that was greater than the Company's carrying value, therefore the second step of the impairment test, as prescribed by the authoritative literature, was not required to be performed and no impairment of goodwill was recorded as of December 31, 2019. Subsequent reviews may result in future periodic impairments that could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations in the period recognized. Recent operating results have reduced the projection of future cash flow growth potential, which indicates that certain negative potential events, such as a material loss or losses on contracts, or failure to achieve projected growth could result in impairment in the future. We estimate the fair value of our reporting unit and compare the valuation with the respective carrying value for the reporting unit to determine whether any goodwill impairment exists. If we determine through the impairment review process that goodwill is impaired, we will record an impairment charge in our consolidated statements of operations. Goodwill is amortized and deducted over a 15-year period for tax purposes.\nIncome Taxes\nWe account for income taxes in accordance with ASC 740, Income Taxes.\u201d Under ASC 740, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences of temporary differences and income tax credits. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured by applying enacted statutory tax rates that are applicable to the future years in which deferred tax assets or liabilities are expected to be settled or realized for differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of existing assets and liabilities. Any change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in net income in the period in which the tax rate change is enacted. We record a valuation allowance that reduces deferred tax assets when it is \"more likely than not\" that deferred tax assets will not be realized. We are required to establish a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets if, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Based on available evidence, realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income. We considered projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies, and reversal of taxable temporary differences in making this assessment. As such, we have determined that a full valuation allowance is required as of December 31, 2019 and 2018. As a result of a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets, a deferred tax liability related to goodwill remained on our consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2019 and 2018. Due to the tax reform enacted on December 22, 2017, net operating losses generated in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017 will have an indefinite carryforward period, which will be available to offset future taxable income created by the reversal of temporary taxable differences related to goodwill. As a result, we have adjusted the valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets and liabilities at December 31, 2019 and 2018. See additional information on tax reform and its impact on our income taxes in Note 9 - Income Taxes.\nResults of Operations\nWe derive a substantial portion of our revenues from contracts and subcontracts with the U.S. Government. Our revenues are generated from a number of contract vehicles and task orders. Over the past several years we have sought to diversify and improve our operating margins through an evolution of our business from an emphasis on product reselling to that of an advanced solutions technologies provider. To that end, although we continue to offer resold products through our contract vehicles, we have focused on selling solutions and outsourcing product sales, as well as designing and delivering Telos manufactured and branded technologies. We believe our contract portfolio is characterized as having low to moderate financial risk due to the limited number of long-term fixed price development contracts. Our firm fixed-price activities consist principally of contracts for the products and services at established contract prices. Our time-and-material contracts generally allow the pass-through of allowable costs plus a profit margin. For 2019, 2018, and 2017, the Company's revenue derived from firm fixed-price contracts was 82.7%, 74.9%, and 83.1%, respectively, cost-plus contracts was 8.2%, 12.9%, and 7.4%, respectively, and time-and-material contracts was 9.1%, 12.2%, and 9.5%, respectively.\nWe provide different solutions and are party to contracts of varying revenue types under the NETCENTS (Network-Centric Solutions) and NETCENTS-2 contracts to the U.S. Air Force. NETCENTS and NETCENTS-2 are IDIQ and GWAC, therefore any government customer may utilize the NETCENTS and NETCENTS-2 vehicles to meet its purchasing needs. Consequently, revenue earned on the underlying NETCENTS and NETCENTS-2 delivery orders varies from period to period according to the customer and solution mix for the products and services delivered during a particular period, unlike a standalone contract with one separately identified customer. The contracts themselves do not fund any orders and they state that the contracts are for an indefinite delivery and indefinite quantity. The majority of our task/delivery orders have periods of performance of less than 12 months, which contributes to the variances between interim and annual reporting periods. The period of performance for the original NETCENTS contract ended on September 30, 2013. Previously awarded task orders that contain periods of performance that extended past September 30, 2013, including exercisable option years under existing task orders, were not affected by the contract expiration. We were selected for an award on the NETCENTS replacement contract, NETCENTS-2 Network Operations and Infrastructure Solutions Small Business Companion, on March 27, 2014, and upon re-evaluation by the customer, we were again selected for an award on April 3, 2015 and the contract was opened for issuance of new orders in May 2015. We have also been awarded other IDIQ/GWACs, including the Department of Homeland Security's EAGLE II, GSA Alliant 2, and blanket purchase agreements under our GSA schedule. However, we have not been awarded significant delivery orders under EAGLE II, or GSA Alliant 2 as it was not ready for agencies to use until July 1, 2018.\nU.S. Government appropriations have been and continue to be affected by larger U.S. Government budgetary issues and related legislation. In 2011, Congress enacted the Budget Control Act of 2011 (the BCA\u201d), which established specific limits on annual appropriations for fiscal years 2012-2021. The BCA has been amended a number of times, most recently by the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2019 (the BBA\u201d), which was enacted on August 2, 2019. As a result, DoD funding levels have fluctuated over this period and have been difficult to predict. Most recently, while the two-year BBA allowed for modestly increased defense spending in FY 2020, unless and until it is again modified, the BBA also essentially will maintain defense spending in FY 2021 with only a minor increase (less than one percent) permitted above the current FY 2020 appropriated funding level.\nAccording to the Office of Management and Budget, federal outlays devoted to defense programs have fallen from 4.5 percent to 3.2 percent as a share of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) since enactment of the BCA. Moreover, as a result of the spending caps imposed by the BCA, annual DoD budget authority in FY 2020 is only 3.7 percent higher (in unadjusted dollars) than it was a decade ago in FY 2010.\nSince final enactment in December 2019 of appropriations legislation for FY 2020, and the February 10, 2020 submission of the President's proposed FY 2021 budget, the Coronavirus pandemic and associated economic dislocation in the United States has resulted in the need for an overwhelming federal response. This has led to the enactment of several comprehensive appropriations and economic stimulus measures, as well as negotiations between Congress and the White House for additional massive initiatives for the current year and into the next fiscal year, the details of which are not yet finalized. These substantial alterations to FY 2020 spending baselines are also likely to further impact FY 2021 spending in ways that cannot now be predicted. The impact of the health and economic crisis, and the resulting large increase in federal spending, on the government contracts that we hold and the federal procurements that we would otherwise compete for cannot now be known.\nIn addition to the ongoing need to respond to the crisis in the current fiscal year, Congress and the President must agree on FY 2021 appropriations legislation prior to October 1, 2020; failing to do so by then would likely mean DoD and other departments will again be funded for an unknown period of time under another Continuing Resolution, which would again restrict new spending initiatives. This is consistent with the practice for a number of years where the U.S. Government has been unable to complete its appropriations process prior to the beginning of the next fiscal year, resulting in actual or threatened governmental shut-downs and repeated use for extended time periods each year of Continuing Resolutions to fund part of all of the government. The impact of the substantial additional spending on the Coronavirus pandemic on the appropriations for FY 2021, and the appropriations process itself, is not now known.\nThe current health and economic crisis is highly fluid, and it is likely to continue to affect multiple federal departments and agencies for an unknown period of time and in ways that are difficult to predict. Nonetheless, we believe that the federal government will very likely endeavor to maintain continuity of services and, with much of the business of government now being conducted through use of information technology systems and in many cases during the crisis remotely, we believe there will still be a need on the part of the government for the types of solutions and services provided by Telos.\nWe anticipate there will continue to be a significant amount of debate and negotiations within the U.S. Government over federal and defense spending, and these deliberations may be impacted by the health and economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic in ways that are at this time difficult to foresee. In the context of these negotiations, it is possible that the U.S. Government, or portions of the U.S. Government, could be shut down or disrupted for periods of time, and that government programs could be modified, cut or replaced as part of broader reforms to reduce the federal deficit or efforts to redirect federal spending, whether related or unrelated to the COVID-19 crisis. For more information on the risks and uncertainties related to U.S. Government contracts, see Part I - Item 1A Risk Factors in this Annual Report on the Form 10-K.\nStatement of Operations Data\nThe following table sets forth certain consolidated financial data and related percentages for the periods indicated:\n\nYears ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017\nRevenue. Revenue increased by 15.4% to $159.2 million for 2019 from $138.0 million for 2018. Such increase primarily consists of an increase in sales from the U.S. Air Force NETCENTS-2 contract. As discussed above, NETCENTS-2 is an IDIQ contract utilized by multiple government customers and sales under NETCENTS-2 vary from period to period according to the solution mix and timing of deliverables for a particular period. Services revenue increased by 18.7% to $143.6 million for 2019 from $121.0 million for 2018, primarily attributable to increases in sales of $10.8 million of Telos ID Enterprise Solutions, $9.2 million of Cyber & Cloud Solutions, $5.9 million of Secure Communications Cyber and Enterprise Solutions, offset by a decrease in sales of $3.4 million of Secure Mobility and Network Management/Defense Enterprise Solutions. The change in product and services revenue varies from period to period depending on the mix of solutions sold and the nature of such solutions, as well as the timing of deliverables. Product revenue decreased by 8.2% to $15.6 million for 2019 from $17.0 million for 2018, primarily attributable to decreases in sales of $0.9 million of Cyber & Cloud Solutions in proprietary software, and $0.8 million of Telos ID Enterprise Solutions, offset by an increase in sales of $0.4 million of proprietary software in Secure Communications Cyber and Enterprise Solutions.\nRevenue increased by 28.1% to $138.0 million for 2018 from $107.7 million for 2017. Such increase primarily consists of an increase in sales from the U.S. Air Force NETCENTS-2 contract. Services revenue increased by 48.3% to $121.0 million for 2018 from $81.6 million for 2017, primarily attributable to increases in sales of $22.7 million of Secure Mobility and Network Management/Defense Enterprise Solutions under several NETCENTS delivery orders for Telos-installed solutions which included $6.0 million of revenue accruals for multiple contracts as a result of several years of cumulative indirect rate adjustments, $10.6 million of Telos ID Enterprise solutions, $5.7 million of Cyber & Cloud Solutions, and $0.4 million of Secure Communications Cyber and Enterprise Solutions. Product revenue decreased by 34.8% to $17.0 million for 2018 from $26.1 million for 2017, primarily attributable to decreases in sales of $9.2 million of Telos ID Enterprise solutions, $2.0 million of resold products in Secure Mobility and Network Management/Defense Enterprise Solutions, and $1.0 million of proprietary software in Secure Communications Cyber and Enterprise Solutions, offset by an increase in sales of $3.1 million of Cyber & Cloud Solutions in proprietary software.\nCost of sales. Cost of sales increased by 25.8% to $106.9 million for 2019 from $85.0 million for 2018 as a result of increases in revenue. Cost of sales for services increased by $21.9 million, and as a percentage of services revenue increased by 5.3%, due to a change in the mix and nature of the programs including increases in sales of certain Telos-installed solutions in Secure Mobility and Network Management/Defense Enterprise Solutions under NETCENTS-2. Cost of sales for product increased by 0.1%, and as a percentage of product revenue increased by 4.3%, primarily due to declines in proprietary software sales.\nCost of sales increased by 26.5% to $85.0 million for 2018 from $67.2 million for 2017 as a result of increases in revenue. Cost of sales for services increased by $26.9 million, and as a percentage of services revenue increased by 2.3%, due to a change in the mix and nature of the programs including an increase in sales of certain Telos-installed solutions in Secure Mobility and Network Management/Defense Enterprise Solutions under NETCENTS-2 and due to other contracts in Cyber & Cloud Solutions, offset by the revenue accruals related to indirect rate adjustments discussed above which did not include direct costs in Secure Mobility and Network Management/Defense Enterprise Solutions deliverables. Cost of sales for product decreased by $9.1 million, primarily due to decreases in product revenue for resold products, and as a percentage of product revenue decreased by 18.3%, primarily due to declines in resold products, as well as increases in proprietary software sales.\nGross profit. Gross profit decreased by 1.4% to $52.3 million for 2019 from $53.1 million for 2018. Gross margin decreased to 32.9% for 2019 from 38.4% for 2018, due to various changes in the mix of contracts in all business lines, primarily decreases in proprietary software sales.\nGross profit increased by 30.8% to $53.1 million for 2018 from $40.6 million for 2017. Gross margin increased to 38.4% for 2018 from 37.7% for 2017, due to various changes in the mix of contracts in all business lines, primarily increases in sales of Cyber & Cloud Security solutions in proprietary software, as well as the revenue accruals related to indirect rate adjustments discussed above.\nSelling, general, and administrative expenses. Selling, general, and administrative expenses increased by 7.4% to $47.3 million for 2019 from $44.0 million for 2018. Such increase is primarily attributable to increases in labor costs of $1.9 million, bonuses of $0.5 million, bad debt expenses of $0.5 million, and outside services of $0.4 million.\nSelling, general, and administrative expenses increased by 9.7% to $44.0 million for 2018 from $40.2 million for 2017. Such increase is primarily attributable to increases in labor costs of $1.7 million, bonuses of $1.5 million, and capitalization and related amortization of software development costs of $0.6 million.\nInterest expense. Interest expense increased by 2.9% to $7.5 million for 2019 from $7.3 million for 2018, primarily due to an increase in interest on the EnCap senior term loan, offset by a decrease in interest on an equipment purchase arrangement.\nInterest expense increased by 8.5% to $7.3 million for 2018 from $6.7 million for 2017, primarily due to an increase in interest on the EnCap senior term loan and an equipment purchase arrangement.\nComponents of interest expense are as follows:\n\nProvision for income taxes.\nIncome tax benefit was $104,000 for 2019, compared to an income tax provision of $31,000 for 2018, primarily attributable to the decrease in deferred tax liability due to the timing of the state conformity to the indefinite-lived net operating loss provision of the Tax Act (as described below). Income tax provision was $31,000 for 2018, compared to an income tax benefit of $2.8 million for 2017, primarily due to the decrease in the hanging credit deferred tax liability offset by the adjustment to the provisional estimate recorded for the hanging credit deferred tax liability under SAB 118.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAs described in more detail below, we maintain a Credit Agreement with EnCap and a Purchase Agreement with RCA. The willingness of RCA to purchase our accounts receivable under the Purchase Agreement and our ability to obtain additional financing may be limited due to various factors, including the eligibility of our receivables, the status of our business, global credit market conditions, and perceptions of our business or industry by EnCap, RCA, or other potential sources of financing. If we are unable to maintain the Purchase Agreement, we would need to obtain additional credit to fund our future operations. If credit is available in that event, lenders may impose more restrictive terms and higher interest rates that may reduce our borrowing capacity, increase our costs, or reduce our operating flexibility. The failure to maintain, extend, renew or replace the Purchase Agreement with a comparable arrangement or arrangements that provide similar amounts of liquidity for the Company would have a material negative impact on our overall liquidity, financial and operating results.\nWhile a variety of factors related to sources and uses of cash, such as timeliness of accounts receivable collections, vendor credit terms, or significant collateral requirements, ultimately impact our liquidity, such factors may or may not have a direct impact on our liquidity based on how the transactions associated with such circumstances impact our availability under our credit arrangements. For example, a contractual requirement to post collateral for a duration of several months, depending on the materiality of the amount, could have an immediate negative effect on our liquidity, as such a circumstance would utilize cash resources without a near-term cash inflow back to us. Likewise, the release of such collateral could have a corresponding positive effect on our liquidity, as it would represent an addition to our cash resources without any corresponding near-term cash outflow. Similarly, a slow-down of payments from a customer, group of customers or government payment office would not have an immediate and direct effect on our availability unless the slowdown was material in amount and over an extended period of time. Any of these examples would have an impact on our cash resources, our financing arrangements, and therefore our liquidity.\nManagement may determine that, in order to reduce capital and liquidity requirements, planned spending on capital projects and indirect expense growth may be curtailed, subject to growth in operating results. Additionally, management may seek to put in place a credit facility with a commercial bank or other potential lenders, although no assurance can be given that such a facility could be put in place under terms acceptable to the Company.\nOur working capital was $2.9 million and $2.1 million as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Although no assurances can be given, we expect that our financing arrangements with EnCap and RCA, collectively, and funds generated from operations are sufficient to maintain the liquidity we require to meet our operating, investing and financing needs for the next 12 months.\nCash provided by operating activities of $11.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to cash provided by operating activities of $6.3 million for 2018, and cash used in operating activities of $0.6 million for 2017. Cash provided by operating activities is primarily driven by our operating income, the timing of receipt of customer payments, the timing of payments to vendors and employees, and the timing of inventory turnover, adjusted for certain non-cash items that do not impact cash flows from operating activities. Additionally, cash provided by operating activities also includes approximately $3.8 million annually of dividends from preferred stock recorded as interest expense. In 2019, net loss was $2.1 million, which included $5.0 million of depreciation and amortization, $1.8 million of which amortization of capitalized software development costs. In 2018, net income was $1.7 million, which included $3.0 million of depreciation and amortization, $1.1 million of which amortization of capitalized software development costs. In 2017, net loss was $3.5 million, which included $2.0 million of depreciation and amortization and $2.8 million of income tax benefit.\nCash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017 was $6.5 million, $4.1 million, and $2.2 million, respectively, which, for the year ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, consisted of the capitalization of software development costs of $2.4 million, $1.6 million and $1.5 million, respectively, and the purchases of property and equipment of $4.1 million, $2.5 million and $0.7 million, respectively.\nCash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $1.4 million, compared to cash used in financing activities of $2.7 million for 2018, and cash provided by financing activities $2.8 million for 2017. The financing activities in 2019 consisted of net proceeds of $4.9 million from the EnCap senior term loan, distributions of $2.4 million to the Class B Member of Telos ID, and repayments of $1.1 million under finance leases. The financing activities in 2018 consisted of distributions of $1.7 million to the Class B Member of Telos ID and repayments of $1.0 million under finance leases. The financing activities in 2017 consisted of net proceeds of $9.4 million from the EnCap senior term loan, distributions of $3.7 million to the Class B Member of Telos ID, redemption of $2.1 million of senior preferred stock, and repayments of $0.9 million under finance leases.\nAdditionally, our capital structure consists of redeemable preferred stock and common stock. The capital structure is complex and requires an understanding of the terms of the instruments, certain restrictions on scheduled payments and redemptions of the various instruments, and the interrelationship of the instruments especially as it relates to the subordination hierarchy. Therefore, a thorough understanding of how our capital structure impacts our liquidity is necessary and, accordingly, we have disclosed the relevant information about each instrument as follows:\nEnlightenment Capital Credit Agreement\nOn January 25, 2017, we entered into a Credit Agreement (the \"Credit Agreement\") with Enlightenment Capital Solutions Fund II, L.P., as agent (the \"Agent\") and the lenders party thereto (the \"Lenders\") (together referenced as EnCap\u201d). The Credit Agreement provided for an $11 million senior term loan (the \"Loan\") with a maturity date of January 25, 2022, subject to acceleration in the event of customary events of default.\nAll borrowings under the Credit Agreement accrue interest at the rate of 13.0% per annum (the Accrual Rate\u201d). If, at the request of the Company, the Agent executes an intercreditor agreement with another senior lender under which the Agent and the Lenders subordinate their liens (an \"Alternative Interest Rate Event\"), the interest rate will increase to 14.5% per annum. After the occurrence and during the continuance of any event of default, the interest rate will increase 2.0%. The Company is obligated to pay accrued interest in cash on a monthly basis at a rate of not less than 10.0% per annum or, during the continuance of an Alternate Interest Rate Event, 11.5% per annum. The Company may elect to pay the remaining interest in cash, by payment-in-kind (by addition to the principal amount of the Loan) or by combination of cash and payment-in-kind. Upon thirty days prior written notice, the Company may prepay any portion or the entire amount of the Loan.\nAn amount of approximately $1.1 million was netted from the proceeds of the Loan as a prepayment of all interest due and payable at the Accrual Rate during the period from January 25, 2017 to October 31, 2017. A separate fee letter executed by the Company and the Agent, dated January 25, 2017, sets forth the fees payable to the Agent in connection with the Credit Agreement.\nThe Credit Agreement contains representations, warranties, covenants, terms and conditions customary for transactions of this type. In connection with the Credit Agreement, the Agent has been granted, for the benefit of the Lenders, a security interest in and general lien upon various property of the Company, subject to certain permitted liens and any intercreditor agreement. The occurrence of an event of default under the Credit Agreement could result in the Loan and other obligations becoming immediately due and payable and allow the Lenders to exercise all rights and remedies available to them under the Credit Agreement or as a secured party under the UCC, in addition to all other rights and remedies available to them.\nIn connection with the Credit Agreement, on January 25, 2017, the Company issued warrants (each, a \"Warrant\") to the Agent and certain of the Lenders representing in the aggregate the right to purchase in accordance with their terms 1,135,284.333 shares of the Class A Common Stock of the Company, no par value per share, which is equivalent to approximately 2.5% of the common equity interests of the Company on a fully diluted basis. The exercise price is $1.321 per share and each Warrant expires on January 25, 2027. The value of the warrants were determined to be de minimis and no value was allocated to them on a relative fair value basis in accounting for the debt instrument.\nThe Credit Agreement also included an $825,000 exit fee, which was payable upon any repayment or prepayment of the loan. This amount had been included in the total principal due and treated as an unamortized discount on the debt, which would be amortized over the term of the loan, using the effective interest method at a rate of 15.0%. We incurred fees and transaction costs of approximately $374,000 related to the issuance of the Credit Agreement, which are being amortized over the life of the Credit Agreement.\nEffective February 23, 2017, the Credit Agreement was amended to change the required timing of certain post-closing items to allow for more time to complete the legal and administrative requirements around such items. On April 18, 2017, the Credit Agreement was further amended (the Second Amendment\u201d) to incorporate the parties' agreement to subordinate certain debt owed by the Company to the affiliated entities of Mr. John R. C. Porter (the Subordinated Debt\u201d) and to redeem all outstanding shares of the Series A-1 Redeemable Preferred Stock and the Series A-2 Redeemable Preferred Stock, including those owned by Mr. John R.C. Porter and his affiliates, for an aggregate redemption price of $2.1 million.\nIn connection with the Second Amendment and that subordination of debt, on April 18, 2017, we also entered into Subordination and Intercreditor Agreements (the Intercreditor Agreements\u201d) with affiliated entities of Mr. John R. C. Porter (together referenced as Porter\u201d), in which Porter agreed that the Subordinated Debt is fully subordinated to the amended Credit Agreement and related documents, and that required payments, if any, under the Subordinated Debt are permitted only if certain conditions are met.\nOn March 30, 2018, the Credit Agreement was further amended (the Third Amendment\u201d) to waive certain covenant defaults and to reset the covenants for 2018 measurement periods to more accurately reflect the Company's projected performance for the year. The measurement against the covenants for consolidated leverage ratio and consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio were agreed to not be measured as of December 31, 2017 and were reset for 2018 measurement periods. Additionally, a minimum revenue covenant and a net working capital covenant were added. In consideration of these amendments, the interest rate on the loan was increased by 1%, which will revert back to the original rate upon achievement of two consecutive quarters of a specified fixed charge coverage ratio as defined in the agreement. The Company may elect to pay the increase in interest expense in cash or by payment-in-kind (by addition to the principal amount of the Loan). The increase in interest expense has been paid in cash. Contemporaneously with the Third Amendment, Mr. John B. Wood agreed to transfer 50,000 shares of the Company's Class A Common Stock owned by him to EnCap.\nOn July 19, 2019, we entered into the Fourth Amendment to Credit Agreement and Waiver; First Amendment to Fee Letter ( Fourth Amendment\u201d) to amend the Credit Agreement. As a result of the Fourth Amendment, several terms of the Credit Agreement were amended, including the following:\n \u25cf The Company borrowed an additional $5 million from the Lenders, increasing the total amount of the principal to $16 million. \n \u25cf The maturity date of the Credit Agreement was amended from January 25, 2022 to January 15, 2021. \n \u25cf The prepayment price was amended as follows: (a) from January 26, 2019 through January 25, 2020, the prepayment price is 102% of the principal amount, (b) from January 26, 2020 through October 14, 2020, the prepayment price is 101% of the principal amount, and (c) from October 15, 2020 to the maturity date, the prepayment price will be at par. However, the prepayment price for the additional $5 million loan attributable to the Fourth Amendment will be at par. \n \u25cf The following financial covenants, as defined in the Credit Agreement, were amended and updated: Consolidated Leverage Ratio, Consolidated Senior Leverage Ratio, Consolidated Capital Expenditures, Minimum Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, and Minimum Consolidated Net Working Capital. \n \u25cf Any actual or potential non-compliance with the applicable provisions of the Credit Agreement were waived. \n \u25cf The borrowing under the Credit Agreement continues to be collateralized by substantially all of the Company's assets including inventory, equipment and accounts receivable. \n \u25cf The Company paid the Agent a fee of $110,000 in connection with the Fourth Amendment. We incurred immaterial third party transaction costs which were expensed in the current period. \n \u25cf The exit fee was increased from $825,000 to $1,200,000. \nThe exit fee has been included in the total principal due and treated as an unamortized discount on the debt, which will be amortized over the term of the loan using the effective interest method at a rate of 17.3% over the remaining term of the loan. For the measurement period ended December 31, 2019 we were in compliance with the Credit Agreement's financial covenants, based on an agreement between the Company and EnCap on the definition of certain input factors that determine the measurement against the covenants.\nOn March 26, 2020, the Credit Agreement was amended (the Fifth Amendment\u201d) to modify the financial covenants for 2020 through the maturity of the Credit Agreement to establish that the covenants will remain at the December 31, 2019 levels and to update the previously agreed-upon definition of certain financial covenants, specifically the amount of Capital Expenditures to be included in the measurement of the covenants. The Fifth Amendment also provides for the right for the Company to elect to extend the maturity date of the Credit Agreement which is currently scheduled to mature on January 15, 2021. The Fifth Amendment provides for four quarterly maturity date extensions, which would increase the Exit Fee payable under the Credit Agreement by $250,000 for each quarterly maturity date extension elected, for a total of $1 million increase to the Exit Fee were all four of the maturity date extensions to be elected. The Company paid EnCap an amendment fee of $100,000 and out-of-pocket costs and expenses in consideration for the Fifth Amendment.\nWe incurred interest expense in the amount of $2.2 million, $1.7 million and $1.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively, under the Credit Agreement.\nAccounts Receivable Purchase Agreement\nOn July 15, 2016, we entered into an Accounts Receivable Purchase Agreement (the Purchase Agreement\u201d) with Republic Capital Access, LLC ( RCA\u201d or Buyer\u201d), pursuant to which we may offer for sale, and RCA, in its sole discretion, may purchase, eligible accounts receivable relating to U.S. Government prime contracts or subcontracts of the Company (collectively, the Purchased Receivables\u201d). Upon purchase, RCA becomes the absolute owner of any such Purchased Receivables, which are payable directly to RCA, subject to certain repurchase obligations of the Company. The total amount of Purchased Receivables is subject to a maximum limit of $10 million of outstanding Purchased Receivables (the Maximum Amount\u201d) at any given time. The Purchase Agreement had an initial term expiring on June 30, 2018 and automatically renews for successive 12-month renewal periods unless terminated in writing by either the Company or RCA. On March 2, 2018, the term of the Purchase Agreement was extended to June 30, 2020. On November 15, 2019, the term of the Purchase Agreement was extended to June 30, 2022. No fee or consideration of any kind was paid in connection with these extensions.\nThe initial purchase price of a Purchased Receivable is equal to 90% of the face value of the receivable if the account debtor is an agency of the U.S. Government, and 85% if the account debtor is not an agency of the U.S. Government; provided, however, that RCA has the right to adjust these initial purchase price rates in its sole discretion. After collection by RCA of the portion of a Purchased Receivable in excess of the initial purchase price, RCA shall pay the Company the residual 10% or 15% of such Purchased Receivable, as appropriate, less (i) a discount factor equal to 0.30%, for federal government prime contracts (or 0.56% for non-federal government investment grade account obligors or 0.62% for non-federal government non-investment grade account obligors) of the face amounts of Purchased Receivables; (ii) a program access fee equal to 0.008% of the daily ending account balance for each day that the Purchased Receivables are outstanding; (iii) a commitment fee equal to 1% per annum of the Maximum Amount minus the amount of Purchased Receivables outstanding; and (iv) fees, costs and expenses relating to the preparation, administration and enforcement of the Purchase Agreement and any other related agreements.\nThe Purchase Agreement provides that in the event, but only to the extent, that the conveyance of Purchased Receivables by the Company is characterized by a court or other governmental authority as a loan rather than a sale, the Company shall be deemed to have granted RCA, effective as of the date of the first purchase under the Purchase Agreement, a security interest in all of the Company's right, title and interest in, to and under all of the Purchased Receivables, whether now or hereafter owned, existing or arising.\nThe Company provides a power of attorney to RCA to take certain actions in the Company's stead, including (a) to sell, assign or transfer in whole or in part any of the Purchased Receivables;", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nGeneral\nThe solutions we offer secure cyberspace, the cloud environment, and the people and operations of the enterprise. These three facets of the modern organization share much in common, but also require a diverse range of skills, capabilities, and experience to meet the important requirements of security-conscious customers. Telos' decades-long resume of providing a broad spectrum of technology and security solutions uniquely qualifies us to meet our customers' needs in these three areas. Our experience in addressing challenges in one operation of the enterprise informs our work in meeting requirements in others. We understand that a range of complementary capabilities may be needed to solve a single challenge, and we also recognize when a single solution might address multiple challenges.\nOur substantive expertise in developing, orchestrating, and delivering solutions across these areas gives us the vision and the confidence to provide solutions that empower and protect the enterprise at an integrated, holistic level.\nOur capabilities include:\n \u25cf Cybersecurity - Today's enterprises need to understand and manage their cyber risk and reduce their cyber attack surfaces. Telos helps our customers assure the ongoing security, integrity, and compliance of their on-premises and cloud-based systems and to reduce threats and vulnerabilities to foil cyber adversaries before they can attack. Our consultants assess our customers' security environments and design, engineer, and operate the systems they need to strengthen their cybersecurity posture. \n \u25cf Cloud Security - The cloud as an organizational resource is more than two decades old, yet the needs of cloud users are constantly changing. Telos offers the specialized skills and experience needed to help our customers plan, engineer, and execute secure cloud migration strategies and then assure ongoing management and security in keeping with the leading standards for cloud-based systems and workloads. \n \u25cf Enterprise Security - Securing the enterprise means protecting the essential and timeless elements common to every organization: Its people and processes, its supply chain and inventories, its finances and facilities, its information and communications. As ICT and OT systems have become part of the organizational DNA, Telos has led with offerings that ensure personnel can work securely and productively across and beyond the enterprise. \nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements include revenue recognition, allowance for doubtful accounts receivable, allowance for inventory obsolescence, the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets, income taxes, contingencies and litigation, potential impairments of goodwill and intangible assets, estimated pension-related costs for our foreign subsidiaries and accretion of Public Preferred Stock. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nThe following is a summary of the most critical accounting policies used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe account for revenue in accordance with Accounting Standard Codification ( ASC\u201d) Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers.\u201d The unit of account in ASC 606 is a performance obligation which is a promise in a contract with a customer, to transfer a good or service to the customer. ASC 606 prescribes a five-step model for recognizing revenue that includes identifying the contract with the customer, determining the performance obligation(s), determining the transaction price, allocating the transaction price to the performance obligation(s), and recognizing revenue as the performance obligations are satisfied. Timing of the satisfaction of performance obligations varies across our businesses due to our diverse product and service mix, customer base, and contractual terms. Significant judgment can be required in determining certain performance obligations, and these determinations could change the amount of revenue and profit recorded in a given period. Our contracts may have a single performance obligation or multiple performance obligations. When there are multiple performance obligations within a contract, we allocate the transaction price to each performance obligation based on our best estimate of standalone selling price.\nWe account for a contract after it has been approved by the parties to the contract, the rights and the payment terms of the parties are identified, the contract has commercial substance and collectability is probable, which is presumed for our U.S. Government customers and prime contractors for which we perform as subcontractors to U.S. Government end-customers.\nThe majority of our revenue is recognized over time, as control is transferred continuously to our customers who receive and consume benefits as we perform, and is classified as services revenue. All of our business groups earn services revenue under a variety of contract types, including time and materials, firm-fixed price, firm fixed price level of effort, and cost plus fixed fee contract types, which may include variable consideration as discussed further below. Revenue is recognized over time using costs incurred to date relative to total estimated costs at completion to measure progress toward satisfying our performance obligations. Incurred cost represents work performed, which corresponds with, and thereby best depicts, the transfer of control to the customer. Contract costs include labor, material, subcontractor costs and indirect expenses. This continuous transfer of control to the customer is supported by clauses in our contracts with U.S. Government customers whereby the customer may terminate a contract for convenience and then pay for costs incurred plus a profit, at which time the customer would take control of any work in process. For non-U.S. Government contracts where we perform as a subcontractor and our order includes similar Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) provisions as the prime contractor's order from the U.S. Government, continuous transfer of control is likewise supported by such provisions. For other non-U.S. Government customers, continuous transfer of control to such customers is also supported due to general terms in our contracts and rights to recover damages which would include, among other potential damages, the right to payment for our work performed to date plus a reasonable profit.\nDue to the transfer of control over time, revenue is recognized based on progress towards completion of the performance obligation. The selection of the method to measure progress towards completion requires judgment and is based on the nature of the performance obligations. We generally use the cost-to-cost measure of progress on a proportional performance basis for our contracts because it best depicts the transfer of control to the customer which occurs as we incur costs on our contracts. Under the cost-to-cost measure of progress, the extent of progress towards completion is measured based on the ratio of costs incurred to date to the total estimated costs at completion of the performance obligation. Revenues are recorded proportionally as costs are incurred. Due to the nature of the work required to be performed on certain of our performance obligations, the estimation of total revenue and cost at completion is complex, subject to many variables and requires significant judgment. Contract estimates are based on various assumptions including labor and subcontractor costs, materials and other direct costs and the complexity of the work to be performed. A significant change in one or more of these estimates could affect the profitability of our contracts. We review and update our contract-related estimates regularly and recognize adjustments in estimated profit on contracts on a cumulative catch-up basis, which may result in an adjustment increasing or decreasing revenue to date on a contract in a particular period that the adjustment is identified. Revenue and profit in future periods of contract performance are recognized using the adjusted estimate.\nRevenue that is recognized at a point in time is for the sale of software licenses in our Secure Mobility and Network Management/Defense Enterprise Solutions (formerly CO&D's Secure Mobility Solutions) and Secure Communications Cyber and Enterprise Solutions (formerly IT & Enterprise Solutions) business groups and for the sale of resold products in Telos ID Enterprise Solutions (formerly Identity Management Solutions) and Cyber & Cloud Solutions (formerly CO&D's Cyber Security Solutions), and is classified as product revenue. Revenue on these contracts is recognized when the customer obtains control of the transferred product or service, which is generally upon delivery of the product to the customer for their use, due to us maintaining control of the product until that point. Orders for the sale of software licenses may contain multiple performance obligations, such as maintenance, training, or consulting services, which are typically delivered over time, consistent with the transfer of control disclosed above for the provision of services. When an order contains multiple performance obligations, we allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations using our best estimate of standalone selling price.\nContracts are routinely and often modified to account for changes in contract requirements, specifications, quantities, or price. Depending on the nature of the modification, we determine whether to account for the modification as an adjustment to the existing contract or as a new contract. Generally, modifications are not distinct from the existing contract due to the significant interrelatedness of the performance obligations and are therefore accounted for as an adjustment to the existing contract, and recognized as a cumulative adjustment to revenue (as either an increase or reduction of revenue) based on the modification's effect on progress toward completion of a performance obligation.\nOur contracts may include various types of variable consideration, such as claims (for instance, indirect rate or other equitable adjustments) or incentive fees. We include estimated amounts in the transaction price based on all of the information available to us, including historical information and future estimations, and to the extent it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when any uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is resolved. We have revised and re-submitted several years of incurred cost submissions reflecting certain indirect rate structure changes as a result of regular Defense Contract Audit Agency ( DCAA\u201d) audits of incurred cost submissions. This resulted in signed final rate agreement letters for fiscal years 2011 to 2013 and conformed incurred cost submissions for 2014 to 2015. We evaluated the resulting changes to revenue under the applicable cost plus fixed fee contracts for the years 2011 to 2015 as variable consideration, and determined the most likely amount to which we expect to be entitled, to the extent that no constraint exists that would preclude recognizing this revenue or result in a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized. We included these estimated amounts of variable consideration in the transaction price and as performance on these contracts is complete, we have recognized revenue of $6.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2018.\nHistorically, most of our contracts do not include award or incentive fees. For incentive fees, we would include such fees in the transaction price to the extent we could reasonably estimate the amount of the fee. With limited historical experience, we have not included any revenue related to incentive fees in our estimated transaction prices. We may include in our contract estimates additional revenue for submitted contract modifications or claims against the customer when we believe we have an enforceable right to the modification or claim, the amount can be estimated reliably and its realization is probable. We consider the contractual/legal basis for the claim (in particular FAR provisions), the facts and circumstances around any additional costs incurred, the reasonableness of those costs and the objective evidence available to support such claims.\nFor our contracts that have an original duration of one year or less, we use the practical expedient applicable to such contracts and do not consider the time value of money. We capitalize sales commissions related to proprietary software and related services that are directly tied to sales. We do not elect the practical expedient to expense as incurred the incremental costs of obtaining a contract if the amortization period would have been one year or less. For the sales commissions that are capitalized, we amortize the asset over the expected customer life, which is based on recent and historical data.\nContract assets are amounts that are invoiced as work progresses in accordance with agreed-upon contractual terms, either at periodic intervals or upon achievement of contractual milestones. Generally, revenue recognition occurs before billing, resulting in contract assets. These contract assets are referred to as unbilled receivables and are reported within accounts receivable, net of reserve on our consolidated balance sheets.\nBilled receivables are amounts billed and due from our customers and are reported within accounts receivable, net of reserve on the consolidated balance sheets. The portion of the payments retained by the customer until final contract settlement is not considered a significant financing component due to the intent of the retainage being the customer's protection with respect to full and final performance under the contract.\nContract liabilities are payments received in advance and milestone payments from our customers on selected contracts that exceed revenue earned to date, resulting in contract liabilities. Contract liabilities typically are not considered a significant financing component because they are generally satisfied within one year and are used to meet working capital demands that can be higher in the early stages of a contract. Contract liabilities are reported on our consolidated balance sheet on a net contract basis at the end of each reporting period.\nWe have one reportable segment. We treat sales to U.S. customers as sales within the U.S. regardless of where the services are performed. Substantially all of our revenues are from U.S. customers as revenue derived from international customers is de minimus. The following tables disclose revenue (in thousands) by customer type and contract type for the periods presented. Prior period amounts have not been adjusted under the modified retrospective method.\nTable 56: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nFederal\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 149,257\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 129,279\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 101,519\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> State & Local, and Commercial\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 9,961\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 8,737\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 6,208\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 159,218\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 138,016\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 107,727\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 57: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\nFirm fixed-price\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 131,629\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 103,454\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 89,516\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Time-and-materials\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 14,569\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 16,795\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 10,222\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cost plus fixed fee\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 13,020\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 17,767\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 7,989\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 159,218\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 138,016\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 107,727\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following table discloses accounts receivable and contract assets (in thousands):\nTable 58: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Billed accounts receivable\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 11,917\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 18,848\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Unbilled receivables\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 16,745\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 16,000\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Allowance for doubtful accounts\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (720\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (306\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Receivables - net\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 27,942\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 34,542\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe following table discloses contract liabilities (in thousands):\nTable 59: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Contract liabilities\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 6,338\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 5,232\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nAs of December 31, 2019 and 2018, we had $112.4 million and $79.3 million of remaining performance obligations, respectively, which we also refer to as funded backlog. We expect to recognize approximately 98.4% of our remaining performance obligations as revenue in 2020, an additional 1.1% by 2021 and the balance thereafter. For the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, the amount of revenue recognized during the year that was included in the opening contract liabilities balance was $4.2 million and $5.5 million, respectively.\nInventories\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value, where cost is determined primarily on the weighted average cost method. Inventories consist primarily of purchased off-the-shelf hardware and software, and component computer parts used in connection with system integration services that we perform. Inventories also include spare parts utilized to support certain maintenance contracts. Spare parts inventory is amortized on a straight-line basis over two to five years, which represents the shorter of the warranty period or estimated useful life of the asset. An allowance for obsolete, slow-moving or non-salable inventory is provided for all other inventory. This allowance is based on our overall obsolescence experience and our assessment of future inventory requirements.\nGoodwill\nWe evaluate the impairment of goodwill in accordance with ASC 350, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other,\u201d which requires goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets to be assessed on at least an annual basis for impairment using a fair value basis. Between annual evaluations, if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying amount, then impairment must be evaluated. Such circumstances could include, but are not limited to: (1) a significant adverse change in legal factors or business climate, or (2) a loss of key contracts or customers.\nAs the result of an acquisition, we record any excess purchase price over the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired as goodwill. An allocation of the purchase price to tangible and intangible net assets acquired is based upon our valuation of the acquired assets. Goodwill is not amortized, but is subject to annual impairment tests. We complete our goodwill impairment tests as of December 31st each year. Additionally, we make evaluations between annual tests if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. The evaluation is based on the estimation of the fair values of our three reporting units, Cyber Operations and Defense ( CO&D\u201d), Telos ID Enterprise Solutions, and Secure Communications Cyber and Enterprise Solutions, of which goodwill is housed in the CO&D reporting unit, in comparison to the reporting unit's net asset carrying values. Our discounted cash flows required management's judgment with respect to forecasted revenue streams and operating margins, capital expenditures and the selection and use of an appropriate discount rate. We utilized the weighted average cost of capital as derived by certain assumptions specific to our facts and circumstances as the discount rate. The net assets attributable to the reporting units are determined based upon the estimated assets and liabilities attributable to the reporting units in deriving its free cash flows. In addition, the estimate of the total fair value of our reporting units is compared to the market capitalization of the Company. The Company's assessment resulted in a fair value that was greater than the Company's carrying value, therefore the second step of the impairment test, as prescribed by the authoritative literature, was not required to be performed and no impairment of goodwill was recorded as of December 31, 2019. Subsequent reviews may result in future periodic impairments that could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations in the period recognized. Recent operating results have reduced the projection of future cash flow growth potential, which indicates that certain negative potential events, such as a material loss or losses on contracts, or failure to achieve projected growth could result in impairment in the future. We estimate the fair value of our reporting unit and compare the valuation with the respective carrying value for the reporting unit to determine whether any goodwill impairment exists. If we determine through the impairment review process that goodwill is impaired, we will record an impairment charge in our consolidated statements of operations. Goodwill is amortized and deducted over a 15-year period for tax purposes.\nIncome Taxes\nWe account for income taxes in accordance with ASC 740, Income Taxes.\u201d Under ASC 740, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences of temporary differences and income tax credits. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured by applying enacted statutory tax rates that are applicable to the future years in which deferred tax assets or liabilities are expected to be settled or realized for differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of existing assets and liabilities. Any change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in net income in the period in which the tax rate change is enacted. We record a valuation allowance that reduces deferred tax assets when it is \"more likely than not\" that deferred tax assets will not be realized. We are required to establish a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets if, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Based on available evidence, realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income. We considered projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies, and reversal of taxable temporary differences in making this assessment. As such, we have determined that a full valuation allowance is required as of December 31, 2019 and 2018. As a result of a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets, a deferred tax liability related to goodwill remained on our consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2019 and 2018. Due to the tax reform enacted on December 22, 2017, net operating losses generated in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017 will have an indefinite carryforward period, which will be available to offset future taxable income created by the reversal of temporary taxable differences related to goodwill. As a result, we have adjusted the valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets and liabilities at December 31, 2019 and 2018. See additional information on tax reform and its impact on our income taxes in Note 9 - Income Taxes.\nResults of Operations\nWe derive a substantial portion of our revenues from contracts and subcontracts with the U.S. Government. Our revenues are generated from a number of contract vehicles and task orders. Over the past several years we have sought to diversify and improve our operating margins through an evolution of our business from an emphasis on product reselling to that of an advanced solutions technologies provider. To that end, although we continue to offer resold products through our contract vehicles, we have focused on selling solutions and outsourcing product sales, as well as designing and delivering Telos manufactured and branded technologies. We believe our contract portfolio is characterized as having low to moderate financial risk due to the limited number of long-term fixed price development contracts. Our firm fixed-price activities consist principally of contracts for the products and services at established contract prices. Our time-and-material contracts generally allow the pass-through of allowable costs plus a profit margin. For 2019, 2018, and 2017, the Company's revenue derived from firm fixed-price contracts was 82.7%, 74.9%, and 83.1%, respectively, cost-plus contracts was 8.2%, 12.9%, and 7.4%, respectively, and time-and-material contracts was 9.1%, 12.2%, and 9.5%, respectively.\nWe provide different solutions and are party to contracts of varying revenue types under the NETCENTS (Network-Centric Solutions) and NETCENTS-2 contracts to the U.S. Air Force. NETCENTS and NETCENTS-2 are IDIQ and GWAC, therefore any government customer may utilize the NETCENTS and NETCENTS-2 vehicles to meet its purchasing needs. Consequently, revenue earned on the underlying NETCENTS and NETCENTS-2 delivery orders varies from period to period according to the customer and solution mix for the products and services delivered during a particular period, unlike a standalone contract with one separately identified customer. The contracts themselves do not fund any orders and they state that the contracts are for an indefinite delivery and indefinite quantity. The majority of our task/delivery orders have periods of performance of less than 12 months, which contributes to the variances between interim and annual reporting periods. The period of performance for the original NETCENTS contract ended on September 30, 2013. Previously awarded task orders that contain periods of performance that extended past September 30, 2013, including exercisable option years under existing task orders, were not affected by the contract expiration. We were selected for an award on the NETCENTS replacement contract, NETCENTS-2 Network Operations and Infrastructure Solutions Small Business Companion, on March 27, 2014, and upon re-evaluation by the customer, we were again selected for an award on April 3, 2015 and the contract was opened for issuance of new orders in May 2015. We have also been awarded other IDIQ/GWACs, including the Department of Homeland Security's EAGLE II, GSA Alliant 2, and blanket purchase agreements under our GSA schedule. However, we have not been awarded significant delivery orders under EAGLE II, or GSA Alliant 2 as it was not ready for agencies to use until July 1, 2018.\nU.S. Government appropriations have been and continue to be affected by larger U.S. Government budgetary issues and related legislation. In 2011, Congress enacted the Budget Control Act of 2011 (the BCA\u201d), which established specific limits on annual appropriations for fiscal years 2012-2021. The BCA has been amended a number of times, most recently by the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2019 (the BBA\u201d), which was enacted on August 2, 2019. As a result, DoD funding levels have fluctuated over this period and have been difficult to predict. Most recently, while the two-year BBA allowed for modestly increased defense spending in FY 2020, unless and until it is again modified, the BBA also essentially will maintain defense spending in FY 2021 with only a minor increase (less than one percent) permitted above the current FY 2020 appropriated funding level.\nAccording to the Office of Management and Budget, federal outlays devoted to defense programs have fallen from 4.5 percent to 3.2 percent as a share of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) since enactment of the BCA. Moreover, as a result of the spending caps imposed by the BCA, annual DoD budget authority in FY 2020 is only 3.7 percent higher (in unadjusted dollars) than it was a decade ago in FY 2010.\nSince final enactment in December 2019 of appropriations legislation for FY 2020, and the February 10, 2020 submission of the President's proposed FY 2021 budget, the Coronavirus pandemic and associated economic dislocation in the United States has resulted in the need for an overwhelming federal response. This has led to the enactment of several comprehensive appropriations and economic stimulus measures, as well as negotiations between Congress and the White House for additional massive initiatives for the current year and into the next fiscal year, the details of which are not yet finalized. These substantial alterations to FY 2020 spending baselines are also likely to further impact FY 2021 spending in ways that cannot now be predicted. The impact of the health and economic crisis, and the resulting large increase in federal spending, on the government contracts that we hold and the federal procurements that we would otherwise compete for cannot now be known.\nIn addition to the ongoing need to respond to the crisis in the current fiscal year, Congress and the President must agree on FY 2021 appropriations legislation prior to October 1, 2020; failing to do so by then would likely mean DoD and other departments will again be funded for an unknown period of time under another Continuing Resolution, which would again restrict new spending initiatives. This is consistent with the practice for a number of years where the U.S. Government has been unable to complete its appropriations process prior to the beginning of the next fiscal year, resulting in actual or threatened governmental shut-downs and repeated use for extended time periods each year of Continuing Resolutions to fund part of all of the government. The impact of the substantial additional spending on the Coronavirus pandemic on the appropriations for FY 2021, and the appropriations process itself, is not now known.\nThe current health and economic crisis is highly fluid, and it is likely to continue to affect multiple federal departments and agencies for an unknown period of time and in ways that are difficult to predict. Nonetheless, we believe that the federal government will very likely endeavor to maintain continuity of services and, with much of the business of government now being conducted through use of information technology systems and in many cases during the crisis remotely, we believe there will still be a need on the part of the government for the types of solutions and services provided by Telos.\nWe anticipate there will continue to be a significant amount of debate and negotiations within the U.S. Government over federal and defense spending, and these deliberations may be impacted by the health and economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic in ways that are at this time difficult to foresee. In the context of these negotiations, it is possible that the U.S. Government, or portions of the U.S. Government, could be shut down or disrupted for periods of time, and that government programs could be modified, cut or replaced as part of broader reforms to reduce the federal deficit or efforts to redirect federal spending, whether related or unrelated to the COVID-19 crisis. For more information on the risks and uncertainties related to U.S. Government contracts, see Part I - Item 1A Risk Factors in this Annual Report on the Form 10-K.\nStatement of Operations Data\nThe

Revenue increased by 15.4% to $159.2 million for 2019 from $138.0 million for 2018. Such increase primarily consists of an increase in sales from the U.S. Air Force NETCENTS-2 contract. As discussed above, NETCENTS-2 is an IDIQ contract utilized by multiple government customers and sales under NETCENTS-2 vary from period to period according to the solution mix and timing of deliverables for a particular period. Services revenue increased by 18.7% to $143.6 million for 2019 from $121.0 million for 2018, primarily attributable to increases in sales of $10.8 million of Telos ID Enterprise Solutions, $9.2 million of Cyber & Cloud Solutions, $5.9 million of Secure Communications Cyber and Enterprise Solutions, offset by a decrease in sales of $3.4 million of Secure Mobility and Network Management/Defense Enterprise Solutions. The change in product and services revenue varies from period to period depending on the mix of solutions sold and the nature of such solutions, as well as the timing of deliverables. Product revenue decreased by 8.2% to $15.6 million for 2019 from $17.0 million for 2018, primarily attributable to decreases in sales of $0.9 million of Cyber & Cloud Solutions in proprietary software, and $0.8 million of Telos ID Enterprise Solutions, offset by an increase in sales of $0.4 million of proprietary software in Secure Communications Cyber and Enterprise Solutions.\nRevenue increased by 28.1% to $138.0 million for 2018 from $107.7 million for 2017. Such increase primarily consists of an increase in sales from the U.S. Air Force NETCENTS-2 contract. Services revenue increased by 48.3% to $121.0 million for 2018 from $81.6 million for 2017, primarily attributable to increases in sales of $22.7 million of Secure Mobility and Network Management/Defense Enterprise Solutions under several NETCENTS delivery orders for Telos-installed solutions which included $6.0 million of revenue accruals for multiple contracts as a result of several years of cumulative indirect rate adjustments, $10.6 million of Telos ID Enterprise solutions, $5.7 million of Cyber & Cloud Solutions, and $0.4 million of Secure Communications Cyber and Enterprise Solutions. Product revenue decreased by 34.8% to $17.0 million for 2018 from $26.1 million for 2017, primarily attributable to decreases in sales of $9.2 million of Telos ID Enterprise solutions, $2.0 million of resold products in Secure Mobility and Network Management/Defense Enterprise Solutions, and $1.0 million of proprietary software in Secure Communications Cyber and Enterprise Solutions, offset by an increase in sales of $3.1 million of Cyber & Cloud Solutions in proprietary software.\nCost of sales. Cost of sales increased by 25.8% to $106.9 million for 2019 from $85.0 million for 2018 as a result of increases in revenue. Cost of sales for services increased by $21.9 million, and as a percentage of services revenue increased by 5.3%, due to a change in the mix and nature of the programs including increases in sales of certain Telos-installed solutions in Secure Mobility and Network Management/Defense Enterprise Solutions under NETCENTS-2. Cost of sales for product increased by 0.1%, and as a percentage of product revenue increased by 4.3%, primarily due to declines in proprietary software sales.\nCost of sales increased by 26.5% to $85.0 million for 2018 from $67.2 million for 2017 as a result of increases in revenue. Cost of sales for services increased by $26.9 million, and as a percentage of services revenue increased by 2.3%, due to a change in the mix and nature of the programs including an increase in sales of certain Telos-installed solutions in Secure Mobility and Network Management/Defense Enterprise Solutions under NETCENTS-2 and due to other contracts in Cyber & Cloud Solutions, offset by the revenue accruals related to indirect rate adjustments discussed above which did not include direct costs in Secure Mobility and Network Management/Defense Enterprise Solutions deliverables. Cost of sales for product decreased by $9.1 million, primarily due to decreases in product revenue for resold products, and as a percentage of product revenue decreased by 18.3%, primarily due to declines in resold products, as well as increases in proprietary software sales.\nGross profit. Gross profit decreased by 1.4% to $52.3 million for 2019 from $53.1 million for 2018. Gross margin decreased to 32.9% for 2019 from 38.4% for 2018, due to various changes in the mix of contracts in all business lines, primarily decreases in proprietary software sales.\nGross profit increased by 30.8% to $53.1 million for 2018 from $40.6 million for 2017. Gross margin increased to 38.4% for 2018 from 37.7% for 2017, due to various changes in the mix of contracts in all business lines, primarily increases in sales of Cyber & Cloud Security solutions in proprietary software, as well as the revenue accruals related to indirect rate adjustments discussed above.\nSelling, general, and administrative expenses. Selling, general, and administrative expenses increased by 7.4% to $47.3 million for 2019 from $44.0 million for 2018. Such increase is primarily attributable to increases in labor costs of $1.9 million, bonuses of $0.5 million, bad debt expenses of $0.5 million, and outside services of $0.4 million.\nSelling, general, and administrative expenses increased by 9.7% to $44.0 million for 2018 from $40.2 million for 2017. Such increase is primarily attributable to increases in labor costs of $1.7 million, bonuses of $1.5 million, and capitalization and related amortization of software development costs of $0.6 million.\nInterest expense. Interest expense increased by 2.9% to $7.5 million for 2019 from $7.3 million for 2018, primarily due to an increase in interest on the EnCap senior term loan, offset by a decrease in interest on an equipment purchase arrangement.\nInterest expense increased by 8.5% to $7.3 million for 2018 from $6.7 million for 2017, primarily due to an increase in interest on the EnCap senior term loan and an equipment purchase arrangement.\nComponents of interest expense are as follows:\nTable 61: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (amounts in thousands)\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Commercial and subordinated note interest incurred\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,644\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 3,436\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,848\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Preferred stock interest accrued\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 3,823\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 3,822\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 3,842\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 7,467\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 7,258\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 6,690\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nProvision for income taxes.\nIncome tax benefit was $104,000 for 2019, compared to an income tax provision of $31,000 for 2018, primarily attributable to the decrease in deferred tax liability due to the timing of the state conformity to the indefinite-lived net operating loss provision of the Tax Act (as described below). Income tax provision was $31,000 for 2018, compared to an income tax benefit of $2.8 million for 2017, primarily due to the decrease in the hanging credit deferred tax liability offset by the adjustment to the provisional estimate recorded for the hanging credit deferred tax liability under SAB 118.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAs described in more detail below, we maintain a Credit Agreement with EnCap and a Purchase Agreement with RCA. The willingness of RCA to purchase our accounts receivable under the Purchase Agreement and our ability to obtain additional financing may be limited due to various factors, including the eligibility of our receivables, the status of our business, global credit market conditions, and perceptions of our business or industry by EnCap, RCA, or other potential sources of financing. If we are unable to maintain the Purchase Agreement, we would need to obtain additional credit to fund our future operations. If credit is available in that event, lenders may impose more restrictive terms and higher interest rates that may reduce our borrowing capacity, increase our costs, or reduce our operating flexibility. The failure to maintain, extend, renew or replace the Purchase Agreement with a comparable arrangement or arrangements that provide similar amounts of liquidity for the Company would have a material negative impact on our overall liquidity, financial and operating results.\nWhile a variety of factors related to sources and uses of cash, such as timeliness of accounts receivable collections, vendor credit terms, or significant collateral requirements, ultimately impact our liquidity, such factors may or may not have a direct impact on our liquidity based on how the transactions associated with such circumstances impact our availability under our credit arrangements. For example, a contractual requirement to post collateral for a duration of several months, depending on the materiality of the amount, could have an immediate negative effect on our liquidity, as such a circumstance would utilize cash resources without a near-term cash inflow back to us. Likewise, the release of such collateral could have a corresponding positive effect on our liquidity, as it would represent an addition to our cash resources without any corresponding near-term cash outflow. Similarly, a slow-down of payments from a customer, group of customers or government payment office would not have an immediate and direct effect on our availability unless the slowdown was material in amount and over an extended period of time. Any of these examples would have an impact on our cash resources, our financing arrangements, and therefore our liquidity.\nManagement may determine that, in order to reduce capital and liquidity requirements, planned spending on capital projects and indirect expense growth may be curtailed, subject to growth in operating results. Additionally, management may seek to put in place a credit facility with a commercial bank or other potential lenders, although no assurance can be given that such a facility could be put in place under terms acceptable to the Company.\nOur working capital was $2.9 million and $2.1 million as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Although no assurances can be given, we expect that our financing arrangements with EnCap and RCA, collectively, and funds generated from operations are sufficient to maintain the liquidity we require to meet our operating, investing and financing needs for the next 12 months.\nCash provided by operating activities of $11.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to cash provided by operating activities of $6.3 million for 2018, and cash used in operating activities of $0.6 million for 2017. Cash provided by operating activities is primarily driven by our operating income, the timing of receipt of customer payments, the timing of payments to vendors and employees, and the timing of inventory turnover, adjusted for certain non-cash items that do not impact cash flows from operating activities. Additionally, cash provided by operating activities also includes approximately $3.8 million annually of dividends from preferred stock recorded as interest expense. In 2019, net loss was $2.1 million, which included $5.0 million of depreciation and amortization, $1.8 million of which amortization of capitalized software development costs. In 2018, net income was $1.7 million, which included $3.0 million of depreciation and amortization, $1.1 million of which amortization of capitalized software development costs. In 2017, net loss was $3.5 million, which included $2.0 million of depreciation and amortization and $2.8 million of income tax benefit.\nCash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017 was $6.5 million, $4.1 million, and $2.2 million, respectively, which, for the year ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, consisted of the capitalization of software development costs of $2.4 million, $1.6 million and $1.5 million, respectively, and the purchases of property and equipment of $4.1 million, $2.5 million and $0.7 million, respectively.\nCash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $1.4 million, compared to cash used in financing activities of $2.7 million for 2018, and cash provided by financing activities $2.8 million for 2017. The financing activities in 2019 consisted of net proceeds of $4.9 million from the EnCap senior term loan, distributions of $2.4 million to the Class B Member of Telos ID, and repayments of $1.1 million under finance leases. The financing activities in 2018 consisted of distributions of $1.7 million to the Class B Member of Telos ID and repayments of $1.0 million under finance leases. The financing activities in 2017 consisted of net proceeds of $9.4 million from the EnCap senior term loan, distributions of $3.7 million to the Class B Member of Telos ID, redemption of $2.1 million of senior preferred stock, and repayments of $0.9 million under finance leases.\nAdditionally, our capital structure consists of redeemable preferred stock and common stock. The capital structure is complex and requires an understanding of the terms of the instruments, certain restrictions on scheduled payments and redemptions of the various instruments, and the interrelationship of the instruments especially as it relates to the subordination hierarchy. Therefore, a thorough understanding of how our capital structure impacts our liquidity is necessary and, accordingly, we have disclosed the relevant information about each instrument as follows:\nEnlightenment Capital Credit Agreement\nOn January 25, 2017, we entered into a Credit Agreement (the \"Credit Agreement\") with Enlightenment Capital Solutions Fund II, L.P., as agent (the \"Agent\") and the lenders party thereto (the \"Lenders\") (together referenced as EnCap\u201d). The Credit Agreement provided for an $11 million senior term loan (the \"Loan\") with a maturity date of January 25, 2022, subject to acceleration in the event of customary events of default.\nAll borrowings under the Credit Agreement accrue interest at the rate of 13.0% per annum (the Accrual Rate\u201d). If, at the request of the Company, the Agent executes an intercreditor agreement with another senior lender under which the Agent and the Lenders subordinate their liens (an \"Alternative Interest Rate Event\"), the interest rate will increase to 14.5% per annum. After the occurrence and during the continuance of any event of default, the interest rate will increase 2.0%. The Company is obligated to pay accrued interest in cash on a monthly basis at a rate of not less than 10.0% per annum or, during the continuance of an Alternate Interest Rate Event, 11.5% per annum. The Company may elect to pay the remaining interest in cash, by payment-in-kind (by addition to the principal amount of the Loan) or by combination of cash and payment-in-kind. Upon thirty days prior written notice, the Company may prepay any portion or the entire amount of the Loan.\nAn amount of approximately $1.1 million was netted from the proceeds of the Loan as a prepayment of all interest due and payable at the Accrual Rate during the period from January 25, 2017 to October 31, 2017. A separate fee letter executed by the Company and the Agent, dated January 25, 2017, sets forth the fees payable to the Agent in connection with the Credit Agreement.\nThe Credit Agreement contains representations, warranties, covenants, terms and conditions customary for transactions of this type. In connection with the Credit Agreement, the Agent has been granted, for the benefit of the Lenders, a security interest in and general lien upon various property of the Company, subject to certain permitted liens and any intercreditor agreement. The occurrence of an event of default under the Credit Agreement could result in the Loan and other obligations becoming immediately due and payable and allow the Lenders to exercise all rights and remedies available to them under the Credit Agreement or as a secured party under the UCC, in addition to all other rights and remedies available to them.\nIn connection with the Credit Agreement, on January 25, 2017, the Company issued warrants (each, a \"Warrant\") to the Agent and certain of the Lenders representing in the aggregate the right to purchase in accordance with their terms 1,135,284.333 shares of the Class A Common Stock of the Company, no par value per share, which is equivalent to approximately 2.5% of the common equity interests of the Company on a fully diluted basis. The exercise price is $1.321 per share and each Warrant expires on January 25, 2027. The value of the warrants were determined to be de minimis and no value was allocated to them on a relative fair value basis in accounting for the debt instrument.\nThe Credit Agreement also included an $825,000 exit fee, which was payable upon any repayment or prepayment of the loan. This amount had been included in the total principal due and treated as an unamortized discount on the debt, which would be amortized over the term of the loan, using the effective interest method at a rate of 15.0%. We incurred fees and transaction costs of approximately $374,000 related to the issuance of the Credit Agreement, which are being amortized over the life of the Credit Agreement.\nEffective February 23, 2017, the Credit Agreement was amended to change the required timing of certain post-closing items to allow for more time to complete the legal and administrative requirements around such items. On April 18, 2017, the Credit Agreement was further amended (the Second Amendment\u201d) to incorporate the parties' agreement to subordinate certain debt owed by the Company to the affiliated entities of Mr. John R. C. Porter (the Subordinated Debt\u201d) and to redeem all outstanding shares of the Series A-1 Redeemable Preferred Stock and the Series A-2 Redeemable Preferred Stock, including those owned by Mr. John R.C. Porter and his affiliates, for an aggregate redemption price of $2.1 million.\nIn connection with the Second Amendment and that subordination of debt, on April 18, 2017, we also entered into Subordination and Intercreditor Agreements (the Intercreditor Agreements\u201d) with affiliated entities of Mr. John R. C. Porter (together referenced as Porter\u201d), in which Porter agreed that the Subordinated Debt is fully subordinated to the amended Credit Agreement and related documents, and that required payments, if any, under the Subordinated Debt are permitted only if certain conditions are met.\nOn March 30, 2018, the Credit Agreement was further amended (the Third Amendment\u201d) to waive certain covenant defaults and to reset the covenants for 2018 measurement periods to more accurately reflect the Company's projected performance for the year. The measurement against the covenants for consolidated leverage ratio and consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio were agreed to not be measured as of December 31, 2017 and were reset for 2018 measurement periods. Additionally, a minimum revenue covenant and a net working capital covenant were added. In consideration of these amendments, the interest rate on the loan was increased by 1%, which will revert back to the original rate upon achievement of two consecutive quarters of a specified fixed charge coverage ratio as defined in the agreement. The Company may elect to pay the increase in interest expense in cash or by payment-in-kind (by addition to the principal amount of the Loan). The increase in interest expense has been paid in cash. Contemporaneously with the Third Amendment, Mr. John B. Wood agreed to transfer 50,000 shares of the Company's Class A Common Stock owned by him to EnCap.\nOn July 19, 2019, we entered into the Fourth Amendment to Credit Agreement and Waiver; First Amendment to Fee Letter ( Fourth Amendment\u201d) to amend the Credit Agreement. As a result of the Fourth Amendment, several terms of the Credit Agreement were amended, including the following:\n \u25cf The Company borrowed an additional $5 million from the Lenders, increasing the total amount of the principal to $16 million. \n \u25cf The maturity date of the Credit Agreement was amended from January 25, 2022 to January 15, 2021. \n \u25cf The prepayment price was amended as follows: (a) from January 26, 2019 through January 25, 2020, the prepayment price is 102% of the principal amount, (b) from January 26, 2020 through October 14, 2020, the prepayment price is 101% of the principal amount, and (c) from October 15, 2020 to the maturity date, the prepayment price will be at par. However, the prepayment price for the additional $5 million loan attributable to the Fourth Amendment will be at par. \n \u25cf The following financial covenants, as defined in the Credit Agreement, were amended and updated: Consolidated Leverage Ratio, Consolidated Senior Leverage Ratio, Consolidated Capital Expenditures, Minimum Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, and Minimum Consolidated Net Working Capital. \n \u25cf Any actual or potential non-compliance with the applicable provisions of the Credit Agreement were waived. \n \u25cf The borrowing under the Credit Agreement continues to be collateralized by substantially all of the Company's assets including inventory, equipment and accounts receivable. \n \u25cf The Company paid the Agent a fee of $110,000 in connection with the Fourth Amendment. We incurred immaterial third party transaction costs which were expensed in the current period. \n \u25cf The exit fee was increased from $825,000 to $1,200,000. \nThe exit fee has been included in the total principal due and treated as an unamortized discount on the debt, which will be amortized over the term of the loan using the effective interest method at a rate of 17.3% over the remaining term of the loan. For the measurement period ended December 31, 2019 we were in compliance with the Credit Agreement's financial covenants, based on an agreement between the Company and EnCap on the definition of certain input factors that determine the measurement against the covenants.\nOn March 26, 2020, the Credit Agreement was amended (the Fifth Amendment\u201d) to modify the financial covenants for 2020 through the maturity of the Credit Agreement to establish that the covenants will remain at the December 31, 2019 levels and to update the previously agreed-upon definition of certain financial covenants, specifically the amount of Capital Expenditures to be included in the measurement of the covenants. The Fifth Amendment also provides for the right for the Company to elect to extend the maturity date of the Credit Agreement which is currently scheduled to mature on January 15, 2021. The Fifth Amendment provides for four quarterly maturity date extensions, which would increase the Exit Fee payable under the Credit Agreement by $250,000 for each quarterly maturity date extension elected, for a total of $1 million increase to the Exit Fee were all four of the maturity date extensions to be elected. The Company paid EnCap an amendment fee of $100,000 and out-of-pocket costs and expenses in consideration for the Fifth Amendment.\nWe incurred interest expense in the amount of $2.2 million, $1.7 million and $1.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively, under the Credit Agreement.\nAccounts Receivable Purchase Agreement\nOn July 15, 2016, we entered into an Accounts Receivable Purchase Agreement (the Purchase Agreement\u201d) with Republic Capital Access, LLC ( RCA\u201d or Buyer\u201d), pursuant to which we may offer for sale, and RCA, in its sole discretion, may purchase, eligible accounts receivable relating to U.S. Government prime contracts or subcontracts of the Company (collectively, the Purchased Receivables\u201d). Upon purchase, RCA becomes the absolute owner of any such Purchased Receivables, which are payable directly to RCA, subject to certain repurchase obligations of the Company. The total amount of Purchased Receivables is subject to a maximum limit of $10 million of outstanding Purchased Receivables (the Maximum Amount\u201d) at any given time. The Purchase Agreement had an initial term expiring on June 30, 2018 and automatically renews for successive 12-month renewal periods unless terminated in writing by either the Company or RCA. On March 2, 2018, the term of the Purchase Agreement was extended to June 30, 2020. On November 15, 2019, the term of the Purchase Agreement was extended to June 30, 2022. No fee or consideration of any kind was paid in connection with these extensions.\nThe initial purchase price of a Purchased Receivable is equal to 90% of the face value of the receivable if the account debtor is an agency of the U.S. Government, and 85% if the account debtor is not an agency of the U.S. Government; provided, however, that RCA has the right to adjust these initial purchase price rates in its sole discretion. After collection by RCA of the portion of a Purchased Receivable in excess of the initial purchase price, RCA shall pay the Company the residual 10% or 15% of such Purchased Receivable, as appropriate, less (i) a discount factor equal to 0.30%, for federal government prime contracts (or 0.56% for non-federal government investment grade account obligors or 0.62% for non-federal government non-investment grade account obligors) of the face amounts of Purchased Receivables; (ii) a program access fee equal to 0.008% of the daily ending account balance for each day that the Purchased Receivables are outstanding; (iii) a commitment fee equal to 1% per annum of the Maximum Amount minus the amount of Purchased Receivables outstanding; and (iv) fees, costs and expenses relating to the preparation, administration and enforcement of the Purchase Agreement and any other related agreements.\nThe Purchase Agreement provides that in the event, but only to the extent, that the conveyance of Purchased Receivables by the Company is characterized by a court or other governmental authority as a loan rather than a sale, the Company shall be deemed to have granted RCA, effective as of the date of the first purchase under the Purchase Agreement, a security interest in all of the Company's right, title and interest in, to and under all of the Purchased Receivables, whether now or hereafter owned, existing or arising.\nThe Company provides a power of attorney to RCA to take certain actions in the Company's stead, including (a) to sell, assign or transfer in whole or in part any of the Purchased Receivables;"}
