Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto. This discussion summarizes the significant factors affecting our results of operations and the financial condition of our business during each of the fiscal years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2015.\nOn January 15, 2014 the Company completed the merger (the Merger\u201d) with VTB Holdings, Inc. which was treated as a reverse acquisition\u201d with VTBH considered the accounting acquirer and surviving entity, as a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company (f/k/a Parametric Sound Corporation), a publicly-traded company. Accordingly, VTBH's historical results of operations on a stand-alone basis replace Parametric's historical results of operations for all periods on or prior to January 15, 2014, and for all periods following the Merger, the results of operations of both companies have been included.\nTurtle Beach Corporation (herein referred to as the Company,\u201d we,\u201d us,\u201d or our\u201d), headquartered in San Diego, California and incorporated in the state of Nevada in 2010, is a premier audio technology company with expertise and experience in developing, commercializing and marketing innovative products across a range of large addressable markets operating under two reportable segments, Turtle Beach\u00ae ( Headset ) and HyperSound\u00ae.\nTable 47: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>Turtle Beach is a worldwide leading provider of feature-rich headset solutions for use across multiple platforms, including video game and entertainment consoles, handheld consoles, personal computers, tablets and mobile devices.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 48: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\u2022\n</td> <td>HyperSound technology is an innovative patent-protected sound technology that delivers immersive, directional audio offering unique potential benefits in a variety of commercial settings and consumer devices. The recent launch of the HyperSound Clear\u2122 500P product has transitioned the business to the hearing healthcare market, where we believe a large percentage of people with hearing loss could use the product to improve their listening experiences from sources such as TV, CD/DVD players and stereo systems.\n</td> </tr>\n</table> Business Trends\nHeadset\nSales in the gaming accessories market, which includes headsets and other peripherals such as gamepads, specialty controllers, adapters, batteries, memory and interactive gaming toys are heavily dependent on the global video game console industry. In 2013, the gaming industry experienced a cyclical event as Microsoft and Sony each announced new consoles for the first time in eight years, and the consumer response to the Xbox One and PlayStation\u00ae4 (the new generation\u201d or new-gen\u201d consoles) has been overwhelmingly positive, creating a growing installed base of gamers and a market for new-gen headsets. In 2016, we anticipate that Xbox 360 and Playstation\u00ae3 (the old generation\u201d or old-gen\u201d consoles) will take a final, large drop as the market completes the transition to new-gen compatible headsets.\nCumulative New Generation Console Sales (in millions)\nSource: DFC Intelligence Forecasts: Worldwide Console Forecast, May 2015.\nIn 2015, new-gen active installed base surpassed old-gen active installed base with, according to May 2015 Intelligence: Worldwide Console Forecast report by DFC Intelligence Forecasts, or DFC,\u201d over 60% of cumulative new generation console sales still to come including over 30 million consoles expected to be sold worldwide next year. Further, DFC estimates that cumulative new generation consoles will exceed $65 billion by 2018.\nHyperSound\nHearing Health Care. Gradual hearing loss can affect individuals of all ages, varying from mild to profound and is a growing, widespread issue. In the United States, there are nearly 50 million people with some degree of hearing loss significant enough to require a hearing aid.\nSource: World Health Organization, 2013.\nHyperSound technology offers a fundamentally new way to deliver sound, and our research indicates that it improves the home listening experience. We believe that a large percentage of people with hearing loss may be able to use HyperSound Clear 500P to improve their listening experiences from sources such as TV, CD/DVD players and stereo systems.\nCommercial. We are currently marketing our HyperSound technology to retailers and audio-visual integrators for use in settings where directed audio and sound zones are beneficial, such as digital signage and interactive retail displays. Convenience retailers and fast moving consumer good brands face ever-greater challenges as competition for customers intensifies, and as shoppers increasingly rely on in-store cues. As a result, digital signage is a growing form of direct advertising, capturing an increasing share of advertising spending as restaurants, banks, retail outlets, museums and other outlets and organizations employ commercial displays to communicate with patrons.\nResults of Operations\nManagement Overview\nOur net revenues, which decreased $23.4 million, or 12.6%, were impacted by several external factors, including the impact of the strong dollar on our international business and a more rapid than expected decline in old-gen revenues, which were down $40 million from 2014 to end at less than 12% of revenues. However, we completed our new-gen headset portfolio, launching seven new models, which resulted in a $23.8 million or 23.8% increase year-over-year, and continued to execute on initiatives to drive sustained growth and improved profitability, such as our global logistics partnership with Keuhne + Nagel and the transition of certain headset models to the world's largest contract manufacturer, Foxconn.\nDespite the product mix shift to higher margin new-gen headsets, gross profit as a percentage of net revenue decreased to 25.0% from 27.2% in the prior year. In addition to lower revenues, margins were negatively impacted by higher promotional credits to clear old-gen and licensed headset inventory, incremental costs associated with our new refurbishment model, contract manufacture transition costs and higher third party licensing and royalty costs associated with discontinued legacy license agreements. Looking ahead, we believe that margins and profitability will increase significantly as old-gen is now expected to be well under 10% of our headset business revenues in 2016.\nFor 2015, our reported net loss increased to $82.9 million driven largely by the Headset revenue decline, the negative non-cash impacts of the valuation allowance and goodwill impairment and, an increased investment in the HyperSound business ahead of the HyperSound Clear 500P launch. Diluted net loss per share of $1.96 was down compared to the prior year diluted net loss per share of $0.39.\nIn 2016, we believe that old-gen headset sales will take a final, large drop, which we expect to be roughly offset by continued strong growth in our new-gen headset business as our new core models capture further revenue share and, the initial full year of revenues from the HyperSound Clear 500P product, which will include the launch in Europe as well as continued channel expansion.\nKey Performance Indicators and Non-GAAP Measures\nManagement routinely reviews key performance indicators including revenue, operating income and margins, earnings per share, among others. In addition, we believe certain other measures provide useful information to management and investors about us and our financial condition and results of operations for the following reasons: (i) it is one of the measures used by our board of directors and management team to evaluate our operating performance; (ii) it is one of the measures used by our management team to make day-to-day operating decisions; (iii) the adjustments made are often viewed as either non-recurring or not reflective of ongoing financial performance or have no cash impact on operations; and (iv) it is used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties as a common operating performance measure to compare results across companies in our industry by backing out potential differences caused by variations in capital structures (affecting relative interest expense), and the age and book value of facilities and equipment (affecting relative depreciation and amortization expense). These metrics, however, are not measures of financial performance under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP\u201d) and, given the limitations of these metrics as analytical tools, should not be considered a substitute for gross profit, gross margins, net income (loss) or other consolidated income statement data as determined in accordance with GAAP. We consider the following non-GAAP measure, which may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies, to be key performance indicators:\nTable 49: <table><tr><td> </td>

2015 to the Year Ended December 31, 2014\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, Adjusted EBITDA on a consolidated basis was $(11.4) million, including investments of $13.8 million in the HyperSound business, compared to Adjusted EBITDA on a consolidated basis of $2.0 million, including investments of $10.0 million in the HyperSound business from the year ended December 31, 2014.\nHeadset Adjusted EBITDA totaled approximately $2.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $12.0 million in the prior year, which included the initial sell-in of the Company's and the industry's first ever Xbox One compatible headsets.\nIn addition to the lower sales volume driven primarily by the strong dollar on our international business, the current period was negatively impacted by promotional credits to continue to clear channel inventory and higher third party licensing and royalty costs which included $1.3 million of reserves for products associated with certain discontinued legacy license agreements.\nComparison of the Year Ended December 31, 2014 to the Year Ended December 31, 2013\nAdjusted EBITDA decreased for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2013 driven largely by our investment in the HyperSound business and an increased net loss reflecting the negative impact of costs to package the Microsoft Xbox One Headset Chat Adapter with our headsets and ship them to retailers, increased air freight usage to ensure certain new headsets were in the market for the holiday and in response to the labor uncertainty at the West Coast ports, and initial costs to support being a public company.\nFinancial Results\nThe following table sets forth the Company's statements of operations for the periods

negatively impacted by a more rapid than expected decline in old-gen revenues, which were down over $40 million compared to 2014 and, the strong dollar on our international business that declined 29.0% in the United Kingdom and 28.0% in Europe. These declines were\noffset, in part, by a 27.0% increase in new-gen revenues reflecting the continued positive consumer reaction to the XO ONE, XO FOUR Stealth and Stealth 500P headsets and the strong performance of our new products as we completed our headset portfolio transition with the launch of five new headsets for the holiday season.\nDespite the benefit of the product mix shift to higher margin new-gen headsets during the second half of the year, for the year ended December 31, 2015, gross profit as a percentage of net revenue decreased to 26.5% from 27.3% in the prior year. The year-over-year decrease in gross margin performance was primarily due to higher promotion credits to clear, and subsequent excess reserves of, old-gen and licensed headsets, incremental costs associated with our refurbishment model and contract manufacture transitions and, higher third party licensing and royalty costs. Excluding the impact of $1.8 million previous generation and licensed headset charges, gross profit as a percentage of net sales would have been 27.6% driven largely by sales of higher margin headsets.\nComparison of Fiscal Years 2014 and 2013\nIn spite of challenging overall market conditions that included a rapid decline in active user bases for Xbox 360 and PlayStation\u00ae3 and a more promotional environment, net revenues for year ended December 31, 2014 increased $7.7 million, or 4.3%, compared to the prior year on the strength of our new generation headset portfolio and the expansion of our international headset business with strong growth in several markets, including a 11.3% increase in the United Kingdom business and 29.7% in Europe, as well as the initial sales of our Xbox One headsets in China. Domestic sales increased 5.6% on strong consumer response to our new more advanced headsets. These gains were offset in part by a decline in sales to our Canadian distributor as fiscal 2013 included incremental initial stock orders.\nOur strategy to deliver innovative headsets across all price points drove a 6.6% increase in total Xbox compatible headsets sales as new generation console headsets bolstered by the launch of the XO FOUR, XO SEVEN, XO ONE and Stealth 500X outpaced the decline in previous generation headset sales. Sales of PlayStation\u00ae compatible headsets remained steady through the console transition on continued positive consumer reaction to the PX22 headset and the release of the ELITE 800, Stealth 500P, Ear Force Stealth 400 and P12 headsets.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2014, gross profit as a percentage of net revenue decreased to 27.2% from 28.2% in the prior year. In 2014, gross profit as a percentage of net revenue was negatively impacted by $2.5 million of incremental shipping and handling costs related to the Microsoft Xbox One Headset Chat Adapter necessary to have our headsets in retail stores for when Microsoft turned on gaming headset audio which had been delayed at the product launch and $3.4 million of incremental air freight costs to get certain new products (ELITE 800, Stealth 500X and XO ONE) to market for the holiday and in response to abnormal West Coast port delays due to labor disputes during contract negotiations. Excluding the impact of these additional shipping costs, gross profit as a percentage of net sales would have been 30.2% driven largely by sales of higher margin headsets.\nHyperSound Segment\nTable 54: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>HyperSound\n</td> <td>912\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>707\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross Profit\n</td> <td>(2,141\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>117\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross Margin\n</td> <td>(234.8\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash Margin\n</td> <td>(105.8\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>31.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) Excludes non-cash charges of $1.2 million, $0.1 million and $0.0 million, respectively.\nComparison of Fiscal Years 2015 and 2014\nNet revenues for the year ended December 31, 2015 were $0.9 million and reflect the initial sales of the HyperSound Clear 500P product that launched in November 2015, compared to $0.7 million in the prior year primarily from the first wide-scale deployment of the commercial product in Activision Call of Duty\u00ae retail displays.\nAs a result of certain start-up costs related to the HyperSound Clear 500P product, including the incremental amortization expense related to technological feasibility of the purchased in-process research and development intangible asset, gross profit\nas a percentage of net revenue was negative for the year ended December 31, 2015.

The 4.8% decrease was primarily due to lower direct media spend and licensing costs ($1.5 million) and a reduction in trade show spend ($0.9 million) in connection with a strategic shift to more targeted promotional activity, partially offset by incremental marketing costs and additional sales force related to the HyperSound Clear 500P product launch.\nSelling and marketing expense for the year ended December 31, 2014 totaled $33.4 million, or 18.0% as a percentage of net revenues, compared to $31.6 million, or 17.7% as a percentage of net revenues, for the prior year. The increase in expense was primarily due to $5.1 million of incremental costs related to the HyperSound business and higher depreciation driven by the addition of interactive retail display kiosks into two large retailers in the fourth quarter of 2013, partially offset by reduced trade show expenses ($0.7 million), direct media spend ($1.2 million) and, advertising and promotional expenses ($1.6 million) related to the media series headsets post their market launch in 2013.\nResearch and Development\nThe increase in research and development expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015 versus the prior year was primarily due to increased staffing levels to support the development of the HyperSound Clear 500P product ($1.9 million) as well as new advanced audio and wireless development initiatives to expand our Xbox One compatible headset portfolio and launch of our true multiplatform headset - the EarForce PX24 ($0.3 million).\nThe increase in research and development expenses for the year ended December 31, 2014 versus the comparable prior year was primarily due to HyperSound product development efforts ($3.6 million), increased staffing levels to support the development of technology leading headsets for the new generation consoles and, an investment in product development for the HyperSound Clear 500P product.\nGeneral and Administrative\nGeneral and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015 increased $4.3 million to $21.5 million compared to $17.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The year over year increase was primarily driven by higher employee costs as a result of the full year impact of additional headcount required of a public company ($1.5 million), legal fees associated with recent public filings in connection with our stock option exchange and financing activities ($0.7 million) and higher stock compensation expense ($0.7 million).\nGeneral and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2014 increased $8.8 million to $17.2 million compared to $8.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. The year over year increase was primarily driven by increased external\nexpenses to be a public company ($3.2 million), incremental costs related to HyperSound ($2.3 million), higher stock compensation expense ($1.1 million) and, additional headcount to build our internal capabilities and higher consultant fees for debt and equity capital activities ($1.4 million).\nGoodwill Impairment\nAs a result of our annual impairment test, we recorded a $49.8 million goodwill impairment charge in connection with the decline in implied fair value of the HyperSound reporting unit. There were no such charges in 2014 or 2013.\nBusiness Transaction\nBusiness transaction expenses for the year ended December 31, 2014 incurred in connection with the Merger included investment banker success fees of $2.2 million payable upon the close of the merger and legal and accounting fees required to complete the transaction compared to $3.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 related to due diligence and legal costs related to the acquisition of the HyperSound business that closed in January 2014.\nRestructuring Charges\nDuring 2014, we began to focus on company-wide overhead and operating expense cost reduction activities, such as closing excess facilities and reducing redundancies. In connection with our efforts to improve our operating efficiency and reduce costs, over the past two years, we completed the closure of certain warehouse operations and the production operations at one of our contract manufacturing operations in China.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense decreased $2.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily due to the write-off of $2.2 million of unamortized debt issuance costs related to the refinancing of our credit facility in the comparable period. Excluding this item, interest expense increased $0.1 million as additional interest related to the issuance of the Term Loan Due 2019 and subordinated notes offset by savings associated with rate reductions and lower average borrowings on our revolving line of credit.\nInterest expense increased $0.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 primarily due to higher deferred finance fees that included the write-off of $2.2 million of unamortized debt issuance costs related to the refinancing of our credit facility on March 31, 2014 and additional interest of $0.8 million related to the issuance of the subordinated notes. These factors were offset by rate reductions and lower average borrowings on our revolving line of credit.\nIncome Taxes\nDuring 2015, as a result of cumulative losses in recent years primarily due to incremental costs associated with the console transition, acquisition costs and initial investments in the HyperSound business, the Company concluded that a full valuation allowance is required on its net deferred tax assets.\nIncome tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $2.4 million at an effective tax rate of (3.0)% compared to income tax benefit $6.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 at an effective tax rate of 28.8%. The effective tax rate was primarily impacted by two discrete items, the release of certain reserves related to uncertain tax positions due to the closure of an IRS examination and the establishment of a valuation allowance on all of our deferred tax assets in the United States and the United Kingdom\nIncome tax benefit for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $6.3 million at an effective tax rate of 28.8% compared to income tax expense of $1.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 at an effective tax rate of 21.5%. The Company's effective tax rate for this year differed from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35% primarily due to differences in book and tax treatment of transaction costs, interest on the Series B Redeemable Preferred Stock and other non-deductible expenses.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur primary sources of working capital are cash flow from operations and availability of capital under our revolving credit facility. We have funded operations and acquisitions in recent periods with operating cash flows, and proceeds from debt and equity financings.\nThe following table summarizes our sources and uses of cash:\nTable 56: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash and cash equivalents at beginning of period\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,908\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,509\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,219\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by (used for) operating activities\n</td> <td>(15,133\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(14,834\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18,290\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by (used for) investing activities\n</td> <td>(6,693\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>557\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(6,167\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by (used for) financing activities\n</td> <td>21,134\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15,969\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(11,017\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effect of foreign exchange on cash\n</td> <td>(102\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(293\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>184\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash and cash equivalents at end of period\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,114\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,908\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,509\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating activities\nCash used for operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $15.1 million, a decline of $0.3 million as compared to $14.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The year-over-year decrease is primarily the result of lower net income adjusted for non-cash expenses and higher year-over-year payments of accounts payable due to incremental expenses incurred in connection with the launch of the HyperSound Clear 500P product. These impacts were offset, in part, by the valuation allowance recorded on the Company's deferred tax assets.\nCash used for operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $14.8 million, a decline of $33.1 million as compared to cash provided by operating activities of $18.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. The year-over-year decrease is primarily the result of lower net income adjusted for non-cash expenses and a reduction in net working capital (defined as accounts receivable and inventories less accounts payable). The reduction in net working capital was driven by payments of accounts payable that had increased during our debt refinancing process that started in late 2013 and was completed in March 2014.\nInvesting activities\nCash used for investing activities was $6.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to cash provided by investing activities of $0.6 million in 2014, which included $4.1 million of cash acquired in the Merger. Capital expenditures increased $3.2 million compared to the prior year to $6.7 million primarily due to expenditures on tooling related to the expansion of our headset portfolio and the initial production line for HyperSound Clear 500P as well as interactive display purchases in connection with our initial international headset display units.\nCash provided by investing activities was $0.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to cash used for investing activities of $6.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2013, as a result of $4.1 million of cash acquired in the Merger. During 2013, we refreshed demonstration units at key retailers and purchased new convention booth equipment in advance of the new generation console releases, and as such capital expenditures declined in the year ended December 31, 2014 to $3.5 million from $6.2 million in 2013.\nFinancing activities\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $21.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $16.0 million and $11.0 million of cash used in financing activities during the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Financing activities in 2015 included the issuance of a $15 million term loan and $16.3 million principal amount of subordinated notes, partially offset by repayments of term loans and net payments on our revolving credit facilities of $8.8 million.\nFinancing activities in 2014 included $37.2 million of proceeds from the sale of common stock, the issuance of $7.0 million principal amount of subordinated notes and a $7.7 million term loan borrowing partially offset by (i) net payments on our revolving credit facilities of $2.9 million, (ii) repayment of our $14.5 million legacy term loan and (iii) repayment of $18.5 million of outstanding subordinated notes.\nNet cash used in financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2013 was primarily related to net repayments of the legacy revolving line of credit and term loan, and was partially offset by the issuance of $10 million principal amount of subordinated notes.\nManagement assessment of liquidity\nManagement believes that our current cash and cash equivalents, the amounts available under our revolving credit facility, the impact of the proceeds from our recent term loans and subordinated notes, and equity raise and cash flows derived from operations will be sufficient to meet anticipated cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures for at least the next 12 months. Significant assumptions underlie this belief, including, among other things, that there will be no material adverse developments in our business, liquidity or capital requirements.\nOn February 5, 2016, we received approximately $6.2 million in net proceeds in connection with the successful closure of a public offering of 5.0 million shares of common stock and a separate, concurrent, side-by-side private placement of 1.7 million shares of common stock at a price of $1.00 per share. In accordance with certain amendments to our Credit Facility, these proceeds were applied against the outstanding principal balance of the working capital line of credit.\nWe believe the combination of our revolving credit facility, long-term debt and cash flow generated by our gaming headset business will cover incremental costs related to the continued launch of the HyperSound Clear 500P product and provide the necessary liquidity to fund our annual working capital needs, particularly during the gaming industry's seasonal slow period in the first half of the year.\nForeign cash balances at December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014 were $0.2 million and $2.5 million, respectively.\nRevolving Credit Facility\nOn March 31, 2014, Turtle Beach and certain of its subsidiaries entered into a new asset-based revolving credit agreement ( Credit Facility\u201d) with Bank of America, N.A., as Agent, Sole Lead Arranger and Sole Bookrunner, which replaced the then existing loan and security agreement. The Credit Facility, which expires on March 31, 2019, provides for a line of credit of up to $60 million inclusive of a sub-facility limit of $10 million for TB Europe, a wholly owned subsidiary of Turtle Beach. The Credit Facility may be used for working capital, the issuance of bank guarantees, letters of credit and other corporate purposes.\nThe maximum credit availability for loans and letters of credit under the Credit Facility is governed by a borrowing base determined by the application of specified percentages to certain eligible assets, primarily eligible trade accounts receivable and inventories, and is subject to discretionary reserves and revaluation adjustments.\nAmounts outstanding under the Credit Facility bear interest at a rate equal to either a rate published by Bank of America or the LIBOR rate, plus in each case, an applicable margin, which is between 1.00% to 1.50% for U.S. base rate loans and between 2.00% to 2.50% for U.S. LIBOR loans and U.K. loans. As of December 31, 2015, interest rates for outstanding borrowings were 5.00% for base rate loans and 2.92% for LIBOR rate loans. In addition, Turtle Beach is required to pay a commitment fee on the unused revolving loan commitment at a rate ranging from 0.25% to 0.50%, and letter of credit fees and agent fees.\nIf certain availability thresholds are not met, meaning that the Company does not have receivables and inventory which are eligible to borrow on under the Credit Facility in excess of amounts borrowed, the Credit Facility requires the Company and its restricted subsidiaries to maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio. The fixed charge ratio is defined as the ratio, determined on a consolidated basis for the most recent four fiscal quarters, of (a) EBITDA minus capital expenditures, excluding those financed through other instruments, and cash taxes paid, and (b) Fixed Charges defined as the sum of cash interest expense plus scheduled principal payments.\nThe Credit Facility also contains affirmative and negative covenants that, subject to certain exceptions, limit our ability to take certain actions, including our ability to incur debt, pay dividends and repurchase stock, make certain investments and other payments, enter into certain mergers and consolidations, engage in sale leaseback transactions and transactions with affiliates and encumber and dispose of assets. Obligations under the Credit Facility are secured by a security interest and lien upon substantially all of the Company's assets.\nIn March 2015, Bank of America notified the Company that certain events of default had occurred and were continuing under the Credit Agreement, including (i) the Company's failure to deliver in a timely matter certain monthly financial statements in accordance with the Credit Agreement, (ii) the Company's failure to deliver in a timely matter certain financial projections in accordance with the Credit Agreement, (iii) the Company's failure to repay an over-advance of approximately $100,000 that existed between March 6, 2015 and March 9, 2015, and (iv) the Company's failure to satisfy the fixed charge coverage ratio under the Credit Agreement for certain measurement dates during the fourth quarter of 2014 (in part as a result of certain\nretroactive changes to the calculation of such ratio pursuant to the second amendment, dated December 29, 2014) (the Existing Events of Default\u201d).\nOn March 16, 2015, the Company entered into a third amendment (the Third Amendment\u201d) to the Credit Facility pursuant to which Bank of America and the lenders under the Credit Facility agreed to waive the Existing Events of Default. In addition, the Third Amendment amends certain other provisions of the agreement and requires that we maintain an EBITDA ratio at the end of each month beginning April 30, 2015 on a cumulative basis through the remainder of 2015 and thereafter on a trailing twelve-month basis, our EBITDA (as defined under the Credit Facility) must be in an amount equal to at least 75% of our monthly projected EBITDA as set forth in projections delivered pursuant to the Credit Facility. The current fixed charge coverage ratio of at least 1.15 to 1.00 on the last day of each month while a Covenant Trigger Period (as defined in the agreement) is in effect will become effective again after the Company has complied with such ratio for six consecutive months.\nOn November 2, 2015, the Company entered into a sixth amendment to the Credit Facility that modified certain provisions to provide (i) that the Company will make certain periodic reports with respect to certain financial metrics, (ii) that the existing financial covenants are suspended and replaced by amended EBITDA levels during the months ended September 30, 2015 through the month ending November 30, 2015, and (iii) that the loan availability is decreased by an additional block.\nOn December 1, 2015, in connection with the sixth amendment, the Company further amended certain provisions of the Credit Facility to, among other things, amend the definition of EBITDA to exclude certain non-recurring expenses and replace certain financial covenants by amended EBITDA levels each month beginning with the month ended December 31, 2015 through (and including) the month ending March 31, 2017 (with revised financial covenants to be agreed based on new financial projections after such date) on both an overall and segment-by-segment basis.\nOn February 1, 2016, the Company further amended certain provisions of the Credit Facility to, among other things, provide that, on or prior to February 5, 2016, the Company receive net proceeds of not less than $6.0 million of additional equity capital or additional third lien debt financing and apply such proceeds against the outstanding principal balance of the working capital line of credit, amend the definition of EBITDA to exclude certain non-recurring expenses and replace certain financial covenants by amended EBITDA levels. The Company satisfied its paydown obligation with the proceeds from the recent offering and private placement.\nAs of December 31, 2015, the Company was in compliance with all the amended financial covenants, and excess borrowing availability was approximately $3.8 million, net of the outstanding Term Loan Due 2018 (as defined below) that is considered to be an additional outstanding amount under the Credit Facility.\nTerm Loans\nTerm Loan Due 2018\nOn December 29, 2014, the Company amended the Credit Facility to permit the repayment of $7.7 million of existing subordinated debt and accrued interest with the proceeds of an additional loan (the Term Loan\u201d). The Term Loan will result in modified financial covenants while it is outstanding, will bear interest at a rate of LIBOR for the applicable interest period plus 5% and will be repaid in equal monthly installments beginning on April 1, 2015 and ending on April 1, 2018. As of December 31, 2015, the outstanding principal balance was $5.8 million,\nTerm Loan Due 2019\nOn July 22, 2015, the Company and its subsidiaries, entered into a term loan, guaranty and security agreement (the Term Loan Due 2019\u201d) with Crystal Financial LLC, as agent, sole lead arranger and sole bookrunner, Crystal Financial SPV LLC and the other persons party thereto ( Crystal\u201d), which provides for an aggregate term loan commitment of $15 million that bears interest at a rate per annum equal to the 90-day LIBOR rate plus 10.25%. Under the terms of the Term Loan Due 2019, the Company is required to make payments of interest in arrears on the first day of each month beginning August 1, 2015 and will repay the principal in monthly payments beginning January 1, 2016, with a final payment on June 28, 2019, the maturity date.\nThe Term Loan Due 2019 is secured by a security interest in substantially all of the Company and each of its subsidiaries' working capital assets and is subject to the first-priority lien of Bank of America , N.A., as agent, under the Credit Facility, other than with respect to equipment, fixtures, real property interests, intellectual property, intercompany property, intercompany indebtedness, equity interest in their subsidiaries, and certain other assets specified in an inter-creditor agreement between Bank of America and Crystal.\nThe Company and its subsidiaries are required to comply with various customary covenants including, (i) maintaining minimum EBITDA and Headset EBITDA (each as defined in the Term Loan Due 2019) in each trailing twelve month period beginning August 31, 2015, (ii) maintaining a Consolidated Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Term Loan Due 2019) to be measured on the last day of each month while the term loans are outstanding of no more than 5.75:1 beginning December 31, 2015 with periodic step-downs to 3.00:1 on January 31, 2017, (iii) not making capital expenditures in excess of $11 million in the year ending December 31, 2015 and in excess of $7 million in each of the years ending December 31, 2016, 2017, 2018 and 2019, (iv) restrictions on the Company's and its subsidiaries ability to prepay its subordinated notes, pay dividends, incur debt, create or suffer liens and engage in certain fundamental transactions and (v) an obligation to provide certain financial and other information. The agreement permits certain equity holders of the Company to contribute funds to the Company to cure certain financial covenant defaults.\nThe Term Loan Due 2019 contains customary representations, mandatory prepayment events and events of default, including defaults triggered by the failure to make payments when due, breaches of covenants and representations, material impairment in the perfection of Crystal's security interest in the collateral and events related to bankruptcy and insolvency of the Company and its subsidiaries. Upon an event of default, Crystal may declare all outstanding obligations immediately due and payable (along with a prepayment fee), a default rate of an additional 2.0% may be applied to amounts outstanding and may take other actions including collecting or taking such other action with respect to the collateral pledged in connection with the term loan.\nOn February 1, 2016, the Company entered into a third amendment to amend certain provisions to, among other things, provide that net proceeds from additional equity capital or additional third lien debt financing are applied against the outstanding principal balance of the working capital line of credit, amend the definition of EBITDA to exclude certain non-recurring expenses and replace certain financial covenants by amended EBITDA levels each month beginning with the month ended December 31, 2015 and on a trailing twelve-month period basis beginning with the period ending October 31, 2016, through the termination date on both an overall and segment-by-segment basis.\nAs of December 31, 2015, the Company was in compliance with the amended financial covenants, and outstanding principal balance was $12.6 million.\nSubordination Agreement\nOn November 16, 2015, as a condition precedent to our lenders permitting certain subordinated notes, we entered into a subordinated agreement with and between certain parties that our obligations under any such notes would be subordinated in right of payment in full of all the Company's obligations under the Credit Facility and Term Loan Due 2019.\nSubordinated Notes - Related Party\nConcurrently with the completion of the Term Loan Due 2019, the Company amended and restated each of its outstanding subordinated notes (the Amended Notes\u201d). The $13.8 million obligation of the Company under the Amended Notes is subordinate and junior to the prior payment of amounts due under the Credit Facility and Term Loan Due 2019. In addition, the stated maturity date of the Amended Notes was extended to September 29, 2019, subject to acceleration in certain circumstances, such as a change of control in the Company. The Amended Notes bear interest at a rate per annum equal to LIBOR plus 10.5% and shall be paid-in-kind by adding the amount to the principal amount due. Further, as consideration for the concessions in the Amended Notes, the Company issued warrants to purchase 1.7 million of the Company's common stock at an exercise price of $2.54 per share.\nOn November 16, 2015, the Company issued a $2.5 million subordinated note (the November Note\u201d) to SG VTB, the proceeds of which, as set forth in the amendment to the Term Loan Due 2019, were applied against the outstanding balance of the Term Loan Due 2019. The November Note will bear interest at a rate of 15% per annum until its maturity date, which is September 29, 2019, and is subordinated to all senior debt of the Company. In connection with the November Note, the Company issued a warrant to purchase 1.4 million shares of the Company's common stock at an exercise price of $2.00 per share.\nSG VTB is an affiliate of Stripes Group LLC ( Stripes\u201d), a private equity firm focused on internet, software, healthcare IT and branded consumer products businesses. Kenneth A. Fox, one of our directors, is the managing general partner of Stripes and the sole manager of SG VTB and Ronald Doornink, our Chairman of the Board, is an operating partner of Stripes.\nSeries B redeemable preferred stock\nIn September 2010, VTBH issued 1,000,000 shares of its Series B Redeemable Preferred Stock with a fair value of $12.4 million. We are required to redeem the Series B Redeemable Preferred Stock on the earlier to occur of September 28, 2030 or the occurrence of a liquidation event (as defined in VTBH's Certificate of Incorporation) at its original issue price of $12.425371 per share plus any accrued but unpaid dividends. The redemption value was $16.1 million and $14.9 million as of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nOur discussion and analysis of our results of operations and capital resources are based on our condensed consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in conformity with GAAP. The preparation of these condensed consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Management bases its estimates, assumptions and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances.\nDifferent assumptions and judgments would change the estimates used in the preparation of the condensed consolidated financial statements, which, in turn, could change the results from those reported. Management evaluates its estimates, assumptions and judgments on an ongoing basis.\nBased on the above, we have determined that our most critical accounting policies are those related to revenue recognition and sales return reserve, inventory valuation, asset impairment, and income taxes.\nRevenue Recognition and Sales Return Reserve\nRevenue is recognized when products are shipped and title has been transferred to a customer, the sales price is fixed and determinable, and collection is reasonably assured. Product is considered delivered to the customer once it has been shipped and title and risk of loss have been transferred. Net revenue for on-line purchases is recognized when products are shipped from our distribution facilities.\nProvisions for cash discounts, quantity rebates, and sales returns in the period the sale is recorded, based upon our prior experience and current trends, as a reduction of revenue. These revenue reductions are established based upon management's best estimates at the time of sale following the historical trend, adjusted to reflect known changes in the factors that impact such reserves and allowances, and the terms of agreements with customers.\nInventory Valuation\nInventories are valued at the lower of weighted average cost or market, at the individual item level. Market is determined based on the estimated net realizable value, which is generally the selling price. Inventory levels are monitored to identify slow-moving items and markdowns are used to clear such product. Physical inventory counts are performed annually in January and estimates are made for any shortage between the date of the physical inventory count and the balance sheet date.\nAsset Impairment\nWe have significant long-lived tangible and intangible assets, including goodwill with indefinite lives, which are susceptible to valuation adjustments as a result of changes in various factors or conditions. We assess the potential impairment of intangible and fixed assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that full recoverability of net asset balances through future cash flows is in question. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are assessed at least annually, but also whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying values may not be recoverable. Factors we consider important, which could trigger an impairment of such assets include significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results; significant changes in the manner of or use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business; significant negative industry or economic trends; significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period; and a decline in our market capitalization below net book value.\nManagement estimates future pre-tax cash flows based on historical experience, knowledge and market data. Estimates of future cash flows require that we make assumptions and apply judgment, including forecasting future sales and expenses and estimating useful lives of the assets. These estimates can be affected by factors such as future product development and economic conditions that can be difficult to predict, as well as other factors such as those outlined in Risk Factors.\u201d If the expected future cash flows related to the long-lived assets are less than the assets' carrying value, an impairment loss would be recognized for the difference between estimated fair value and carrying value.\nIn connection with the Merger, the Company performed a valuation of the acquired goodwill and intangible assets and recorded $81.0 million of goodwill based on the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The Company conducted its annual impairment assessment as of November 1, 2015, and based on the two-step impairment test, recorded a $49.8 million goodwill impairment charge, which resulted in a $31.2 million remaining carrying value as of December 31, 2015. Refer to Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policy\u201d for further details.\nManagement's forecasts of planned revenue are largely dependent on the market acceptance and continued channel expansion of the Company's recently launched HyperSound Clear 500P product to generate the projected revenue in subsequent years. If the performance of the Company's HyperSound Clear 500P product in the hearing healthcare market does not meet expectations based on initial market data, a future impairment charge could result for a portion or all of the remaining goodwill. The amount of any impairment is dependent on the performance of the business which is dependent upon a number of variables which cannot be predicted with certainty.\nIncome Taxes\nWe account for income taxes using the asset and liability method. Under the asset and liability method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on the differences between the financial statement carrying value of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates and laws expected to be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. Inherent in the measurement of these deferred balances are certain judgments and interpretations of existing tax law and other published guidance as applied to our operations. Our effective tax rate considers our judgment of expected tax liabilities in the various jurisdictions within which we are subject to tax.\nThe determination of the need for a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets requires Management to make assumptions and to apply judgment, including forecasting future earnings, taxable income, and the mix of earnings in the jurisdictions in which we operate. During 2015, as a result of cumulative losses in recent years primarily due to incremental costs associated with the console transition, acquisition costs and initial investments in the HyperSound business, the Company concluded that a full valuation allowance is required on its net deferred tax assets.\nThe tax effects of uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in income tax returns are recognized only if they are more likely-than-not\u201d to be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits as of the reporting date. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. We recognize estimated accrued interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense.\nWe are currently under examination by certain state and local taxing jurisdictions. Further, at any given time, multiple tax years may be subject to examination by various taxing authorities. The recorded amounts of income tax are subject to adjustment upon examination, changes in interpretation and changes in judgment utilized in determining estimates.\nSee Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policy,\u201d in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for a complete discussion of recent accounting pronouncements. We are currently evaluating the impact of certain recently issued guidance on our financial condition and results of operations in future periods.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nOff balance sheet arrangements are transactions, agreements, or other contractual arrangements with an unconsolidated entity for which we have an obligation to the entity that is not recorded in the consolidated financial statements. As of December 31, 2015, there are no significant off-balance sheet arrangements.\nContractual Obligations\nOur principal commitments primarily consist of obligations for minimum payment commitments to leases for office space, redeemable preferred stock and the revolving credit facility.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto. This discussion summarizes the significant factors affecting our results of operations and the financial condition of our business during each of the fiscal years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2015.\nOn January 15, 2014 the Company completed the merger (the Merger\u201d) with VTB Holdings, Inc. which was treated as a reverse acquisition\u201d with VTBH considered the accounting acquirer and surviving entity, as a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company (f/k/a Parametric Sound Corporation), a publicly-traded company. Accordingly, VTBH's historical results of operations on a stand-alone basis replace Parametric's historical results of operations for all periods on or prior to January 15, 2014, and for all periods following the Merger, the results of operations of both companies have been included.\nTurtle Beach Corporation (herein referred to as the Company,\u201d we,\u201d us,\u201d or our\u201d), headquartered in San Diego, California and incorporated in the state of Nevada in 2010, is a premier audio technology company with expertise and experience in developing, commercializing and marketing innovative products across a range of large addressable markets operating under two reportable segments, Turtle Beach\u00ae ( Headset ) and HyperSound\u00ae.\n \u2022 Turtle Beach is a worldwide leading provider of feature-rich headset solutions for use across multiple platforms, including video game and entertainment consoles, handheld consoles, personal computers, tablets and mobile devices. \n \u2022 HyperSound technology is an innovative patent-protected sound technology that delivers immersive, directional audio offering unique potential benefits in a variety of commercial settings and consumer devices. The recent launch of the HyperSound Clear\u2122 500P product has transitioned the business to the hearing healthcare market, where we believe a large percentage of people with hearing loss could use the product to improve their listening experiences from sources such as TV, CD/DVD players and stereo systems.  Business Trends\nHeadset\nSales in the gaming accessories market, which includes headsets and other peripherals such as gamepads, specialty controllers, adapters, batteries, memory and interactive gaming toys are heavily dependent on the global video game console industry. In 2013, the gaming industry experienced a cyclical event as Microsoft and Sony each announced new consoles for the first time in eight years, and the consumer response to the Xbox One and PlayStation\u00ae4 (the new generation\u201d or new-gen\u201d consoles) has been overwhelmingly positive, creating a growing installed base of gamers and a market for new-gen headsets. In 2016, we anticipate that Xbox 360 and Playstation\u00ae3 (the old generation\u201d or old-gen\u201d consoles) will take a final, large drop as the market completes the transition to new-gen compatible headsets.\nCumulative New Generation Console Sales (in millions)\nSource: DFC Intelligence Forecasts: Worldwide Console Forecast, May 2015.\nIn 2015, new-gen active installed base surpassed old-gen active installed base with, according to May 2015 Intelligence: Worldwide Console Forecast report by DFC Intelligence Forecasts, or DFC,\u201d over 60% of cumulative new generation console sales still to come including over 30 million consoles expected to be sold worldwide next year. Further, DFC estimates that cumulative new generation consoles will exceed $65 billion by 2018.\nHyperSound\nHearing Health Care. Gradual hearing loss can affect individuals of all ages, varying from mild to profound and is a growing, widespread issue. In the United States, there are nearly 50 million people with some degree of hearing loss significant enough to require a hearing aid.\nSource: World Health Organization, 2013.\nHyperSound technology offers a fundamentally new way to deliver sound, and our research indicates that it improves the home listening experience. We believe that a large percentage of people with hearing loss may be able to use HyperSound Clear 500P to improve their listening experiences from sources such as TV, CD/DVD players and stereo systems.\nCommercial. We are currently marketing our HyperSound technology to retailers and audio-visual integrators for use in settings where directed audio and sound zones are beneficial, such as digital signage and interactive retail displays. Convenience retailers and fast moving consumer good brands face ever-greater challenges as competition for customers intensifies, and as shoppers increasingly rely on in-store cues. As a result, digital signage is a growing form of direct advertising, capturing an increasing share of advertising spending as restaurants, banks, retail outlets, museums and other outlets and organizations employ commercial displays to communicate with patrons.\nResults of Operations\nManagement Overview\nOur net revenues, which decreased $23.4 million, or 12.6%, were impacted by several external factors, including the impact of the strong dollar on our international business and a more rapid than expected decline in old-gen revenues, which were down $40 million from 2014 to end at less than 12% of revenues. However, we completed our new-gen headset portfolio, launching seven new models, which resulted in a $23.8 million or 23.8% increase year-over-year, and continued to execute on initiatives to drive sustained growth and improved profitability, such as our global logistics partnership with Keuhne + Nagel and the transition of certain headset models to the world's largest contract manufacturer, Foxconn.\nDespite the product mix shift to higher margin new-gen headsets, gross profit as a percentage of net revenue decreased to 25.0% from 27.2% in the prior year. In addition to lower revenues, margins were negatively impacted by higher promotional credits to clear old-gen and licensed headset inventory, incremental costs associated with our new refurbishment model, contract manufacture transition costs and higher third party licensing and royalty costs associated with discontinued legacy license agreements. Looking ahead, we believe that margins and profitability will increase significantly as old-gen is now expected to be well under 10% of our headset business revenues in 2016.\nFor 2015, our reported net loss increased to $82.9 million driven largely by the Headset revenue decline, the negative non-cash impacts of the valuation allowance and goodwill impairment and, an increased investment in the HyperSound business ahead of the HyperSound Clear 500P launch. Diluted net loss per share of $1.96 was down compared to the prior year diluted net loss per share of $0.39.\nIn 2016, we believe that old-gen headset sales will take a final, large drop, which we expect to be roughly offset by continued strong growth in our new-gen headset business as our new core models capture further revenue share and, the initial full year of revenues from the HyperSound Clear 500P product, which will include the launch in Europe as well as continued channel expansion.\nKey Performance Indicators and Non-GAAP Measures\nManagement routinely reviews key performance indicators including revenue, operating income and margins, earnings per share, among others. In addition, we believe certain other measures provide useful information to management and investors about us and our financial condition and results of operations for the following reasons: (i) it is one of the measures used by our board of directors and management team to evaluate our operating performance; (ii) it is one of the measures used by our management team to make day-to-day operating decisions; (iii) the adjustments made are often viewed as either non-recurring or not reflective of ongoing financial performance or have no cash impact on operations; and (iv) it is used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties as a common operating performance measure to compare results across companies in our industry by backing out potential differences caused by variations in capital structures (affecting relative interest expense), and the age and book value of facilities and equipment (affecting relative depreciation and amortization expense). These metrics, however, are not measures of financial performance under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP\u201d) and, given the limitations of these metrics as analytical tools, should not be considered a substitute for gross profit, gross margins, net income (loss) or other consolidated income statement data as determined in accordance with GAAP. We consider the following non-GAAP measure, which may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies, to be key performance indicators:\n \u2022 Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income (loss) before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation (non-cash) and, certain special items that we believe are not representative of core operations. \n \u2022 Cash Margins is defined as gross margin excluding depreciation and amortization, and stock-based compensation.  Adjusted EBITDA\nAdjusted EBITDA (and a reconciliation to Net loss, the nearest GAAP financial measure) for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 are as follows:\n\nComparison of the Year Ended December 31, 2015 to the Year Ended December 31, 2014\nFor the year ended December 31, 2015, Adjusted EBITDA on a consolidated basis was $(11.4) million, including investments of $13.8 million in the HyperSound business, compared to Adjusted EBITDA on a consolidated basis of $2.0 million, including investments of $10.0 million in the HyperSound business from the year ended December 31, 2014.\nHeadset Adjusted EBITDA totaled approximately $2.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $12.0 million in the prior year, which included the initial sell-in of the Company's and the industry's first ever Xbox One compatible headsets.\nIn addition to the lower sales volume driven primarily by the strong dollar on our international business, the current period was negatively impacted by promotional credits to continue to clear channel inventory and higher third party licensing and royalty costs which included $1.3 million of reserves for products associated with certain discontinued legacy license agreements.\nComparison of the Year Ended December 31, 2014 to the Year Ended December 31, 2013\nAdjusted EBITDA decreased for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2013 driven largely by our investment in the HyperSound business and an increased net loss reflecting the negative impact of costs to package the Microsoft Xbox One Headset Chat Adapter with our headsets and ship them to retailers, increased air freight usage to ensure certain new headsets were in the market for the holiday and in response to the labor uncertainty at the West Coast ports, and initial costs to support being a public company.\nFinancial Results\nThe following table sets forth the Company's statements of operations for the periods presented:\n\nNet Revenue and Gross Profit\nHeadset Segment\nThe following table summarizes net revenue and gross profit for the periods presented:\n\n(1) Excludes non-cash charges of $1.7 million, $0.5 million and $0.2 million, respectively.\nComparison of Fiscal Years 2015 and 2014\nNet revenues for year ended December 31, 2015, which decreased $23.4 million, or 12.6%, were negatively impacted by a more rapid than expected decline in old-gen revenues, which were down over $40 million compared to 2014 and, the strong dollar on our international business that declined 29.0% in the United Kingdom and 28.0% in Europe. These declines were\noffset, in part, by a 27.0% increase in new-gen revenues reflecting the continued positive consumer reaction to the XO ONE, XO FOUR Stealth and Stealth 500P headsets and the strong performance of our new products as we completed our headset portfolio transition with the launch of five new headsets for the holiday season.\nDespite the benefit of the product mix shift to higher margin new-gen headsets during the second half of the year, for the year ended December 31, 2015, gross profit as a percentage of net revenue decreased to 26.5% from 27.3% in the prior year. The year-over-year decrease in gross margin performance was primarily due to higher promotion credits to clear, and subsequent excess reserves of, old-gen and licensed headsets, incremental costs associated with our refurbishment model and contract manufacture transitions and, higher third party licensing and royalty costs. Excluding the impact of $1.8 million previous generation and licensed headset charges, gross profit as a percentage of net sales would have been 27.6% driven largely by sales of higher margin headsets.\nComparison of Fiscal Years 2014 and 2013\nIn spite of challenging overall market conditions that included a rapid decline in active user bases for Xbox 360 and PlayStation\u00ae3 and a more promotional environment, net revenues for year ended December 31, 2014 increased $7.7 million, or 4.3%, compared to the prior year on the strength of our new generation headset portfolio and the expansion of our international headset business with strong growth in several markets, including a 11.3% increase in the United Kingdom business and 29.7% in Europe, as well as the initial sales of our Xbox One headsets in China. Domestic sales increased 5.6% on strong consumer response to our new more advanced headsets. These gains were offset in part by a decline in sales to our Canadian distributor as fiscal 2013 included incremental initial stock orders.\nOur strategy to deliver innovative headsets across all price points drove a 6.6% increase in total Xbox compatible headsets sales as new generation console headsets bolstered by the launch of the XO FOUR, XO SEVEN, XO ONE and Stealth 500X outpaced the decline in previous generation headset sales. Sales of PlayStation\u00ae compatible headsets remained steady through the console transition on continued positive consumer reaction to the PX22 headset and the release of the ELITE 800, Stealth 500P, Ear Force Stealth 400 and P12 headsets.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2014, gross profit as a percentage of net revenue decreased to 27.2% from 28.2% in the prior year. In 2014, gross profit as a percentage of net revenue was negatively impacted by $2.5 million of incremental shipping and handling costs related to the Microsoft Xbox One Headset Chat Adapter necessary to have our headsets in retail stores for when Microsoft turned on gaming headset audio which had been delayed at the product launch and $3.4 million of incremental air freight costs to get certain new products (ELITE 800, Stealth 500X and XO ONE) to market for the holiday and in response to abnormal West Coast port delays due to labor disputes during contract negotiations. Excluding the impact of these additional shipping costs, gross profit as a percentage of net sales would have been 30.2% driven largely by sales of higher margin headsets.\nHyperSound Segment\n\n(1) Excludes non-cash charges of $1.2 million, $0.1 million and $0.0 million, respectively.\nComparison of Fiscal Years 2015 and 2014\nNet revenues for the year ended December 31, 2015 were $0.9 million and reflect the initial sales of the HyperSound Clear 500P product that launched in November 2015, compared to $0.7 million in the prior year primarily from the first wide-scale deployment of the commercial product in Activision Call of Duty\u00ae retail displays.\nAs a result of certain start-up costs related to the HyperSound Clear 500P product, including the incremental amortization expense related to technological feasibility of the purchased in-process research and development intangible asset, gross profit\nas a percentage of net revenue was negative for the year ended December 31, 2015. Excluding these costs, the cash margin was 39.8% reflecting the initial shipments of the higher margin HyperSound Clear 500P product.\nOperating Expenses\n\nOperating expenses increased largely due to additional costs associated with the expansion of the HyperSound business and additional headcount required of a public company partially offset by cost reductions in marketing.\nSelling and Marketing\nSelling and marketing expense for the year ended December 31, 2015 totaled $31.8 million, or 19.6% as a percentage of net revenues, compared to $33.4 million, or 18.0% as a percentage of net revenues, for the prior year. The 4.8% decrease was primarily due to lower direct media spend and licensing costs ($1.5 million) and a reduction in trade show spend ($0.9 million) in connection with a strategic shift to more targeted promotional activity, partially offset by incremental marketing costs and additional sales force related to the HyperSound Clear 500P product launch.\nSelling and marketing expense for the year ended December 31, 2014 totaled $33.4 million, or 18.0% as a percentage of net revenues, compared to $31.6 million, or 17.7% as a percentage of net revenues, for the prior year. The increase in expense was primarily due to $5.1 million of incremental costs related to the HyperSound business and higher depreciation driven by the addition of interactive retail display kiosks into two large retailers in the fourth quarter of 2013, partially offset by reduced trade show expenses ($0.7 million), direct media spend ($1.2 million) and, advertising and promotional expenses ($1.6 million) related to the media series headsets post their market launch in 2013.\nResearch and Development\nThe increase in research and development expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015 versus the prior year was primarily due to increased staffing levels to support the development of the HyperSound Clear 500P product ($1.9 million) as well as new advanced audio and wireless development initiatives to expand our Xbox One compatible headset portfolio and launch of our true multiplatform headset - the EarForce PX24 ($0.3 million).\nThe increase in research and development expenses for the year ended December 31, 2014 versus the comparable prior year was primarily due to HyperSound product development efforts ($3.6 million), increased staffing levels to support the development of technology leading headsets for the new generation consoles and, an investment in product development for the HyperSound Clear 500P product.\nGeneral and Administrative\nGeneral and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015 increased $4.3 million to $21.5 million compared to $17.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The year over year increase was primarily driven by higher employee costs as a result of the full year impact of additional headcount required of a public company ($1.5 million), legal fees associated with recent public filings in connection with our stock option exchange and financing activities ($0.7 million) and higher stock compensation expense ($0.7 million).\nGeneral and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2014 increased $8.8 million to $17.2 million compared to $8.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. The year over year increase was primarily driven by increased external\nexpenses to be a public company ($3.2 million), incremental costs related to HyperSound ($2.3 million), higher stock compensation expense ($1.1 million) and, additional headcount to build our internal capabilities and higher consultant fees for debt and equity capital activities ($1.4 million).\nGoodwill Impairment\nAs a result of our annual impairment test, we recorded a $49.8 million goodwill impairment charge in connection with the decline in implied fair value of the HyperSound reporting unit. There were no such charges in 2014 or 2013.\nBusiness Transaction\nBusiness transaction expenses for the year ended December 31, 2014 incurred in connection with the Merger included investment banker success fees of $2.2 million payable upon the close of the merger and legal and accounting fees required to complete the transaction compared to $3.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 related to due diligence and legal costs related to the acquisition of the HyperSound business that closed in January 2014.\nRestructuring Charges\nDuring 2014, we began to focus on company-wide overhead and operating expense cost reduction activities, such as closing excess facilities and reducing redundancies. In connection with our efforts to improve our operating efficiency and reduce costs, over the past two years, we completed the closure of certain warehouse operations and the production operations at one of our contract manufacturing operations in China.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense decreased $2.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily due to the write-off of $2.2 million of unamortized debt issuance costs related to the refinancing of our credit facility in the comparable period. Excluding this item, interest expense increased $0.1 million as additional interest related to the issuance of the Term Loan Due 2019 and subordinated notes offset by savings associated with rate reductions and lower average borrowings on our revolving line of credit.\nInterest expense increased $0.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 primarily due to higher deferred finance fees that included the write-off of $2.2 million of unamortized debt issuance costs related to the refinancing of our credit facility on March 31, 2014 and additional interest of $0.8 million related to the issuance of the subordinated notes. These factors were offset by rate reductions and lower average borrowings on our revolving line of credit.\nIncome Taxes\nDuring 2015, as a result of cumulative losses in recent years primarily due to incremental costs associated with the console transition, acquisition costs and initial investments in the HyperSound business, the Company concluded that a full valuation allowance is required on its net deferred tax assets.\nIncome tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $2.4 million at an effective tax rate of (3.0)% compared to income tax benefit $6.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 at an effective tax rate of 28.8%. The effective tax rate was primarily impacted by two discrete items, the release of certain reserves related to uncertain tax positions due to the closure of an IRS examination and the establishment of a valuation allowance on all of our deferred tax assets in the United States and the United Kingdom\nIncome tax benefit for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $6.3 million at an effective tax rate of 28.8% compared to income tax expense of $1.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 at an effective tax rate of 21.5%. The Company's effective tax rate for this year differed from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35% primarily due to differences in book and tax treatment of transaction costs, interest on the Series B Redeemable Preferred Stock and other non-deductible expenses.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur primary sources of working capital are cash flow from operations and availability of capital under our revolving credit facility. We have funded operations and acquisitions in recent periods with operating cash flows, and proceeds from debt and equity financings.\nThe following table summarizes our sources and uses of cash:\n\nOperating activities\nCash used for operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $15.1 million, a decline of $0.3 million as compared to $14.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The year-over-year decrease is primarily the result of lower net income adjusted for non-cash expenses and higher year-over-year payments of accounts payable due to incremental expenses incurred in connection with the launch of the HyperSound Clear 500P product. These impacts were offset, in part, by the valuation allowance recorded on the Company's deferred tax assets.\nCash used for operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $14.8 million, a decline of $33.1 million as compared to cash provided by operating activities of $18.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. The year-over-year decrease is primarily the result of lower net income adjusted for non-cash expenses and a reduction in net working capital (defined as accounts receivable and inventories less accounts payable). The reduction in net working capital was driven by payments of accounts payable that had increased during our debt refinancing process that started in late 2013 and was completed in March 2014.\nInvesting activities\nCash used for investing activities was $6.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to cash provided by investing activities of $0.6 million in 2014, which included $4.1 million of cash acquired in the Merger. Capital expenditures increased $3.2 million compared to the prior year to $6.7 million primarily due to expenditures on tooling related to the expansion of our headset portfolio and the initial production line for HyperSound Clear 500P as well as interactive display purchases in connection with our initial international headset display units.\nCash provided by investing activities was $0.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to cash used for investing activities of $6.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2013, as a result of $4.1 million of cash acquired in the Merger. During 2013, we refreshed demonstration units at key retailers and purchased new convention booth equipment in advance of the new generation console releases, and as such capital expenditures declined in the year ended December 31, 2014 to $3.5 million from $6.2 million in 2013.\nFinancing activities\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $21.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $16.0 million and $11.0 million of cash used in financing activities during the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Financing activities in 2015 included the issuance of a $15 million term loan and $16.3 million principal amount of subordinated notes, partially offset by repayments of term loans and net payments on our revolving credit facilities of $8.8 million.\nFinancing activities in 2014 included $37.2 million of proceeds from the sale of common stock, the issuance of $7.0 million principal amount of subordinated notes and a $7.7 million term loan borrowing partially offset by (i) net payments on our revolving credit facilities of $2.9 million, (ii) repayment of our $14.5 million legacy term loan and (iii) repayment of $18.5 million of outstanding subordinated notes.\nNet cash used in financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2013 was primarily related to net repayments of the legacy revolving line of credit and term loan, and was partially offset by the issuance of $10 million principal amount of subordinated notes.\nManagement assessment of liquidity\nManagement believes that our current cash and cash equivalents, the amounts available under our revolving credit facility, the impact of the proceeds from our recent term loans and subordinated notes, and equity raise and cash flows derived from operations will be sufficient to meet anticipated cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures for at least the next 12 months. Significant assumptions underlie this belief, including, among other things, that there will be no material adverse developments in our business, liquidity or capital requirements.\nOn February 5, 2016, we received approximately $6.2 million in net proceeds in connection with the successful closure of a public offering of 5.0 million shares of common stock and a separate, concurrent, side-by-side private placement of 1.7 million shares of common stock at a price of $1.00 per share. In accordance with certain amendments to our Credit Facility, these proceeds were applied against the outstanding principal balance of the working capital line of credit.\nWe believe the combination of our revolving credit facility, long-term debt and cash flow generated by our gaming headset business will cover incremental costs related to the continued launch of the HyperSound Clear 500P product and provide the necessary liquidity to fund our annual working capital needs, particularly during the gaming industry's seasonal slow period in the first half of the year.\nForeign cash balances at December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014 were $0.2 million and $2.5 million, respectively.\nRevolving Credit Facility\nOn March 31, 2014, Turtle Beach and certain of its subsidiaries entered into a new asset-based revolving credit agreement ( Credit Facility\u201d) with Bank of America, N.A., as Agent, Sole Lead Arranger and Sole Bookrunner, which replaced the then existing loan and security agreement. The Credit Facility, which expires on March 31, 2019, provides for a line of credit of up to $60 million inclusive of a sub-facility limit of $10 million for TB Europe, a wholly owned subsidiary of Turtle Beach. The Credit Facility may be used for working capital, the issuance of bank guarantees, letters of credit and other corporate purposes.\nThe maximum credit availability for loans and letters of credit under the Credit Facility is governed by a borrowing base determined by the application of specified percentages to certain eligible assets, primarily eligible trade accounts receivable and inventories, and is subject to discretionary reserves and revaluation adjustments.\nAmounts outstanding under the Credit Facility bear interest at a rate equal to either a rate published by Bank of America or the LIBOR rate, plus in each case, an applicable margin, which is between 1.00% to 1.50% for U.S. base rate loans and between 2.00% to 2.50% for U.S. LIBOR loans and U.K. loans. As of December 31, 2015, interest rates for outstanding borrowings were 5.00% for base rate loans and 2.92% for LIBOR rate loans. In addition, Turtle Beach is required to pay a commitment fee on the unused revolving loan commitment at a rate ranging from 0.25% to 0.50%, and letter of credit fees and agent fees.\nIf certain availability thresholds are not met, meaning that the Company does not have receivables and inventory which are eligible to borrow on under the Credit Facility in excess of amounts borrowed, the Credit Facility requires the Company and its restricted subsidiaries to maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio. The fixed charge ratio is defined as the ratio, determined on a consolidated basis for the most recent four fiscal quarters, of (a) EBITDA minus capital expenditures, excluding those financed through other instruments, and cash taxes paid, and (b) Fixed Charges defined as the sum of cash interest expense plus scheduled principal payments.\nThe Credit Facility also contains affirmative and negative covenants that, subject to certain exceptions, limit our ability to take certain actions, including our ability to incur debt, pay dividends and repurchase stock, make certain investments and other payments, enter into certain mergers and consolidations, engage in sale leaseback transactions and transactions with affiliates and encumber and dispose of assets. Obligations under the Credit Facility are secured by a security interest and lien upon substantially all of the Company's assets.\nIn March 2015, Bank of America notified the Company that certain events of default had occurred and were continuing under the Credit Agreement, including (i) the Company's failure to deliver in a timely matter certain monthly financial statements in accordance with the Credit Agreement, (ii) the Company's failure to deliver in a timely matter certain financial projections in accordance with the Credit Agreement, (iii) the Company's failure to repay an over-advance of approximately $100,000 that existed between March 6, 2015 and March 9, 2015, and (iv) the Company's failure to satisfy the fixed charge coverage ratio under the Credit Agreement for certain measurement dates during the fourth quarter of 2014 (in part as a result of certain\nretroactive changes to the calculation of such ratio pursuant to the second amendment, dated December 29, 2014) (the Existing Events of Default\u201d).\nOn March 16, 2015, the Company entered into a third amendment (the Third Amendment\u201d) to the Credit Facility pursuant to which Bank of America and the lenders under the Credit Facility agreed to waive the Existing Events of Default. In addition, the Third Amendment amends certain other provisions of the agreement and requires that we maintain an EBITDA ratio at the end of each month beginning April 30, 2015 on a cumulative basis through the remainder of 2015 and thereafter on a trailing twelve-month basis, our EBITDA (as defined under the Credit Facility) must be in an amount equal to at least 75% of our monthly projected EBITDA as set forth in projections delivered pursuant to the Credit Facility. The current fixed charge coverage ratio of at least 1.15 to 1.00 on the last day of each month while a Covenant Trigger Period (as defined in the agreement) is in effect will become effective again after the Company has complied with such ratio for six consecutive months.\nOn November 2, 2015, the Company entered into a sixth amendment to the Credit Facility that modified certain provisions to provide (i) that the Company will make certain periodic reports with respect to certain financial metrics, (ii) that the existing financial covenants are suspended and replaced by amended EBITDA levels during the months ended September 30, 2015 through the month ending November 30, 2015, and (iii) that the loan availability is decreased by an additional block.\nOn December 1, 2015, in connection with the sixth amendment, the Company further amended certain provisions of the Credit Facility to, among other things, amend the definition of EBITDA to exclude certain non-recurring expenses and replace certain financial covenants by amended EBITDA levels each month beginning with the month ended December 31, 2015 through (and including) the month ending March 31, 2017 (with revised financial covenants to be agreed based on new financial projections after such date) on both an overall and segment-by-segment basis.\nOn February 1, 2016, the Company further amended certain provisions of the Credit Facility to, among other things, provide that, on or prior to February 5, 2016, the Company receive net proceeds of not less than $6.0 million of additional equity capital or additional third lien debt financing and apply such proceeds against the outstanding principal balance of the working capital line of credit, amend the definition of EBITDA to exclude certain non-recurring expenses and replace certain financial covenants by amended EBITDA levels. The Company satisfied its paydown obligation with the proceeds from the recent offering and private placement.\nAs of December 31, 2015, the Company was in compliance with all the amended financial covenants, and excess borrowing availability was approximately $3.8 million, net of the outstanding Term Loan Due 2018 (as defined below) that is considered to be an additional outstanding amount under the Credit Facility.\nTerm Loans\nTerm Loan Due 2018\nOn December 29, 2014, the Company amended the Credit Facility to permit the repayment of $7.7 million of existing subordinated debt and accrued interest with the proceeds of an additional loan (the Term Loan\u201d). The Term Loan will result in modified financial covenants while it is outstanding, will bear interest at a rate of LIBOR for the applicable interest period plus 5% and will be repaid in equal monthly installments beginning on April 1, 2015 and ending on April 1, 2018. As of December 31, 2015, the outstanding principal balance was $5.8 million,\nTerm Loan Due 2019\nOn July 22, 2015, the Company and its subsidiaries, entered into a term loan, guaranty and security agreement (the Term Loan Due 2019\u201d) with Crystal Financial LLC, as agent, sole lead arranger and sole bookrunner, Crystal Financial SPV LLC and the other persons party thereto ( Crystal\u201d), which provides for an aggregate term loan commitment of $15 million that bears interest at a rate per annum equal to the 90-day LIBOR rate plus 10.25%. Under the terms of the Term Loan Due 2019, the Company is required to make payments of interest in arrears on the first day of each month beginning August 1, 2015 and will repay the principal in monthly payments beginning January 1, 2016, with a final payment on June 28, 2019, the maturity date.\nThe Term Loan Due 2019 is secured by a security interest in substantially all of the Company and each of its subsidiaries' working capital assets and is subject to the first-priority lien of Bank of America , N.A., as agent, under the Credit Facility, other than with respect to equipment, fixtures, real property interests, intellectual property, intercompany property, intercompany indebtedness, equity interest in their subsidiaries, and certain other assets specified in an inter-creditor agreement between Bank of America and Crystal.\nThe Company and its subsidiaries are required to comply with various customary covenants including, (i) maintaining minimum EBITDA and Headset EBITDA (each as defined in the Term Loan Due 2019) in each trailing twelve month period beginning August 31, 2015, (ii) maintaining a Consolidated Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Term Loan Due 2019) to be measured on the last day of each month while the term loans are outstanding of no more than 5.75:1 beginning December 31, 2015 with periodic step-downs to 3.00:1 on January 31, 2017, (iii) not making capital expenditures in excess of $11 million in the year ending December 31, 2015 and in excess of $7 million in each of the years ending December 31, 2016, 2017, 2018 and 2019, (iv) restrictions on the Company's and its subsidiaries ability to prepay its subordinated notes, pay dividends, incur debt, create or suffer liens and engage in certain fundamental transactions and (v) an obligation to provide certain financial and other information. The agreement permits certain equity holders of the Company to contribute funds to the Company to cure certain financial covenant defaults.\nThe Term Loan Due 2019 contains customary representations, mandatory prepayment events and events of default, including defaults triggered by the failure to make payments when due, breaches of covenants and representations, material impairment in the perfection of Crystal's security interest in the collateral and events related to bankruptcy and insolvency of the Company and its subsidiaries. Upon an event of default, Crystal may declare all outstanding obligations immediately due and payable (along with a prepayment fee), a default rate of an additional 2.0% may be applied to amounts outstanding and may take other actions including collecting or taking such other action with respect to the collateral pledged in connection with the term loan.\nOn February 1, 2016, the Company entered into a third amendment to amend certain provisions to, among other things, provide that net proceeds from additional equity capital or additional third lien debt financing are applied against the outstanding principal balance of the working capital line of credit, amend the definition of EBITDA to exclude certain non-recurring expenses and replace certain financial covenants by amended EBITDA levels each month beginning with the month ended December 31, 2015 and on a trailing twelve-month period basis beginning with the period ending October 31, 2016, through the termination date on both an overall and segment-by-segment basis.\nAs of December 31, 2015, the Company was in compliance with the amended financial covenants, and outstanding principal balance was $12.6 million.\nSubordination Agreement\nOn November 16, 2015, as a condition precedent to our lenders permitting certain subordinated notes, we entered into a subordinated agreement with and between certain parties that our obligations under any such notes would be subordinated in right of payment in full of all the Company's obligations under the Credit Facility and Term Loan Due 2019.\nSubordinated Notes - Related Party\nConcurrently with the completion of the Term Loan Due 2019, the Company amended and restated each of its outstanding subordinated notes (the Amended Notes\u201d). The $13.8 million obligation of the Company under the Amended Notes is subordinate and junior to the prior payment of amounts due under the Credit Facility and Term Loan Due 2019. In addition, the stated maturity date of the Amended Notes was extended to September 29, 2019, subject to acceleration in certain circumstances, such as a change of control in the Company. The Amended Notes bear interest at a rate per annum equal to LIBOR plus 10.5% and shall be paid-in-kind by adding the amount to the principal amount due. Further, as consideration for the concessions in the Amended Notes, the Company issued warrants to purchase 1.7 million of the Company's common stock at an exercise price of $2.54 per share.\nOn November 16, 2015, the Company issued a $2.5 million subordinated note (the November Note\u201d) to SG VTB, the proceeds of which, as set forth in the amendment to the Term Loan Due 2019, were applied against the outstanding balance of the Term Loan Due 2019. The November Note will bear interest at a rate of 15% per annum until its maturity date, which is September 29, 2019, and is subordinated to all senior debt of the Company. In connection with the November Note, the Company issued a warrant to purchase 1.4 million shares of the Company's common stock at an exercise price of $2.00 per share.\nSG VTB is an affiliate of Stripes Group LLC ( Stripes\u201d), a private equity firm focused on internet, software, healthcare IT and branded consumer products businesses. Kenneth A. Fox, one of our directors, is the managing general partner of Stripes and the sole manager of SG VTB and Ronald Doornink, our Chairman of the Board, is an operating partner of Stripes.\nSeries B redeemable preferred stock\nIn September 2010, VTBH issued 1,000,000 shares of its Series B Redeemable Preferred Stock with a fair value of $12.4 million. We are required to redeem the Series B Redeemable Preferred Stock on the earlier to occur of September 28, 2030 or the occurrence of a liquidation event (as defined in VTBH's Certificate of Incorporation) at its original issue price of $12.425371 per share plus any accrued but unpaid dividends. The redemption value was $16.1 million and $14.9 million as of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nOur discussion and analysis of our results of operations and capital resources are based on our condensed consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in conformity with GAAP. The preparation of these condensed consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Management bases its estimates, assumptions and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances.\nDifferent assumptions and judgments would change the estimates used in the preparation of the condensed consolidated financial statements, which, in turn, could change the results from those reported. Management evaluates its estimates, assumptions and judgments on an ongoing basis.\nBased on the above, we have determined that our most critical accounting policies are those related to revenue recognition and sales return reserve, inventory valuation, asset impairment, and income taxes.\nRevenue Recognition and Sales Return Reserve\nRevenue is recognized when products are shipped and title has been transferred to a customer, the sales price is fixed and determinable, and collection is reasonably assured. Product is considered delivered to the customer once it has been shipped and title and risk of loss have been transferred. Net revenue for on-line purchases is recognized when products are shipped from our distribution facilities.\nProvisions for cash discounts, quantity rebates, and sales returns in the period the sale is recorded, based upon our prior experience and current trends, as a reduction of revenue. These revenue reductions are established based upon management's best estimates at the time of sale following the historical trend, adjusted to reflect known changes in the factors that impact such reserves and allowances, and the terms of agreements with customers.\nInventory Valuation\nInventories are valued at the lower of weighted average cost or market, at the individual item level. Market is determined based on the estimated net realizable value, which is generally the selling price. Inventory levels are monitored to identify slow-moving items and markdowns are used to clear such product. Physical inventory counts are performed annually in January and estimates are made for any shortage between the date of the physical inventory count and the balance sheet date.\nAsset Impairment\nWe have significant long-lived tangible and intangible assets, including goodwill with indefinite lives, which are susceptible to valuation adjustments as a result of changes in various factors or conditions. We assess the potential impairment of intangible and fixed assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that full recoverability of net asset balances through future cash flows is in question. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are assessed at least annually, but also whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying values may not be recoverable. Factors we consider important, which could trigger an impairment of such assets include significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results; significant changes in the manner of or use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business; significant negative industry or economic trends; significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period; and a decline in our market capitalization below net book value.\nManagement estimates future pre-tax cash flows based on historical experience, knowledge and market data. Estimates of future cash flows require that we make assumptions and apply judgment, including forecasting future sales and expenses and estimating useful lives of the assets. These estimates can be affected by factors such as future product development and economic conditions that can be difficult to predict, as well as other factors such as those outlined in Risk Factors.\u201d If the expected future cash flows related to the long-lived assets are less than the assets' carrying value, an impairment loss would be recognized for the difference between estimated fair value and carrying value.\nIn connection with the Merger, the Company performed a valuation of the acquired goodwill and intangible assets and recorded $81.0 million of goodwill based on the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The Company conducted its annual impairment assessment as of November 1, 2015, and based on the two-step impairment test, recorded a $49.8 million goodwill impairment charge, which resulted in a $31.2 million remaining carrying value as of December 31, 2015. Refer to Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policy\u201d for further details.\nManagement's forecasts of planned revenue are largely dependent on the market acceptance and continued channel expansion of the Company's recently launched HyperSound Clear 500P product to generate the projected revenue in subsequent years. If the performance of the Company's HyperSound Clear 500P product in the hearing healthcare market does not meet expectations based on initial market data, a future impairment charge could result for a portion or all of the remaining goodwill. The amount of any impairment is dependent on the performance of the business which is dependent upon a number of variables which cannot be predicted with certainty.\nIncome Taxes\nWe account for income taxes using the asset and liability method. Under the asset and liability method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on the differences between the financial statement carrying value of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates and laws expected to be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. Inherent in the measurement of these deferred balances are certain judgments and interpretations of existing tax law and other published guidance as applied to our operations. Our effective tax rate considers our judgment of expected tax liabilities in the various jurisdictions within which we are subject to tax.\nThe determination of the need for a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets requires Management to make assumptions and to apply judgment, including forecasting future earnings, taxable income, and the mix of earnings in the jurisdictions in which we operate. During 2015, as a result of cumulative losses in recent years primarily due to incremental costs associated with the console transition, acquisition costs and initial investments in the HyperSound business, the Company concluded that a full valuation allowance is required on its net deferred tax assets.\nThe tax effects of uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in income tax returns are recognized only if they are more likely-than-not\u201d to be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits as of the reporting date. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. We recognize estimated accrued interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense.\nWe are currently under examination by certain state and local taxing jurisdictions. Further, at any given time, multiple tax years may be subject to examination by various taxing authorities. The recorded amounts of income tax are subject to adjustment upon examination, changes in interpretation and changes in judgment utilized in determining estimates.\nSee Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policy,\u201d in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for a complete discussion of recent accounting pronouncements. We are currently evaluating the impact of certain recently issued guidance on our financial condition and results of operations in future periods.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nOff balance sheet arrangements are transactions, agreements, or other contractual arrangements with an unconsolidated entity for which we have an obligation to the entity that is not recorded in the consolidated financial statements. As of December 31, 2015, there are no significant off-balance sheet arrangements.\nContractual Obligations\nOur principal commitments primarily consist of obligations for minimum payment commitments to leases for office space, redeemable preferred stock and the revolving credit facility. As of December 31, 2015, the future non-cancelable minimum payments under these commitments were as follows:\n\n(1) Contractual obligations exclude tax liabilities of $1.5 million related to uncertain tax positions because we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of settlement, if any, of these future payments.\n(2) Operating lease agreements represent obligations to make payments under non-cancelable lease agreements for its facilities.\n(3) In September 2010, VTBH issued shares of its Series B Redeemable Preferred Stock. If the Series B Redeemable Preferred Stock is still outstanding as of October 2030 or if the Company experiences a liquidation event as defined in VTBH's Certification of Incorporation, the Company will be required to redeem the shares for an aggregate of $51.9 million, which is comprised of the aggregate purchase price of $12.4 million plus cumulative preferred dividends of 8.0% per annum, or $39.5 million in the aggregate. See Note 13, Commitments and Contingencies\u201d, for further information.\n(4) On March 31, 2014 the Company entered into the Credit Facility that expires March 31, 2019. However, due to certain terms of the facility, the indebtedness is required to be classified as a current liability. Long term debt includes scheduled principal payments only. See Note 7, Credit Facilities and Long-Term Debt\u201d for further information.\n(5) These amounts reflect estimated interest payments under our outstanding long-term debt agreements based on the applicable rates in effect as of December 31, 2015, except for interest payments under our Credit Facility because the amount that will be borrowed in future years is uncertain.", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto. This discussion summarizes the significant factors affecting our results of operations and the financial condition of our business during each of the fiscal years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2015.\nOn January 15, 2014 the Company completed the merger (the Merger\u201d) with VTB Holdings, Inc. which was treated as a reverse acquisition\u201d with VTBH considered the accounting acquirer and surviving entity, as a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company (f/k/a Parametric Sound Corporation), a publicly-traded company. Accordingly, VTBH's historical results of operations on a stand-alone basis replace Parametric's historical results of operations for all periods on or prior to January 15, 2014, and for all periods following the Merger, the results of operations of both companies have been included.\nTurtle Beach Corporation (herein referred to as the Company,\u201d we,\u201d us,\u201d or our\u201d), headquartered in San Diego, California and incorporated in the state of Nevada in 2010, is a premier audio technology company with expertise and experience in developing, commercializing and marketing innovative products across a range of large addressable markets operating under two reportable segments, Turtle Beach\u00ae ( Headset ) and HyperSound\u00ae.\n \u2022 Turtle Beach is a worldwide leading provider of feature-rich headset solutions for use across multiple platforms, including video game and entertainment consoles, handheld consoles, personal computers, tablets and mobile devices. \n \u2022 HyperSound technology is an innovative patent-protected sound technology that delivers immersive, directional audio offering unique potential benefits in a variety of commercial settings and consumer devices. The recent launch of the HyperSound Clear\u2122 500P product has transitioned the business to the hearing healthcare market, where we believe a large percentage of people with hearing loss could use the product to improve their listening experiences from sources such as TV, CD/DVD players and stereo systems.  Business Trends\nHeadset\nSales in the gaming accessories market, which includes headsets and other peripherals such as gamepads, specialty controllers, adapters, batteries, memory and interactive gaming toys are heavily dependent on the global video game console industry. In 2013, the gaming industry experienced a cyclical event as Microsoft and Sony each announced new consoles for the first time in eight years, and the consumer response to the Xbox One and PlayStation\u00ae4 (the new generation\u201d or new-gen\u201d consoles) has been overwhelmingly positive, creating a growing installed base of gamers and a market for new-gen headsets. In 2016, we anticipate that Xbox 360 and Playstation\u00ae3 (the old generation\u201d or old-gen\u201d consoles) will take a final, large drop as the market completes the transition to new-gen compatible headsets.\nCumulative New Generation Console Sales (in millions)\nSource: DFC Intelligence Forecasts: Worldwide Console Forecast, May 2015.\nIn 2015, new-gen active installed base surpassed old-gen active installed base with, according to May 2015 Intelligence: Worldwide Console Forecast report by DFC Intelligence Forecasts, or DFC,\u201d over 60% of cumulative new generation console sales still to come including over 30 million consoles expected to be sold worldwide next year. Further, DFC estimates that cumulative new generation consoles will exceed $65 billion by 2018.\nHyperSound\nHearing Health Care. Gradual hearing loss can affect individuals of all ages, varying from mild to profound and is a growing, widespread issue. In the United States, there are nearly 50 million people with some degree of hearing loss significant enough to require a hearing aid.\nSource: World Health Organization, 2013.\nHyperSound technology offers a fundamentally new way to deliver sound, and our research indicates that it improves the home listening experience. We believe that a large percentage of people with hearing loss may be able to use HyperSound Clear 500P to improve their listening experiences from sources such as TV, CD/DVD players and stereo systems.\nCommercial. We are currently marketing our HyperSound technology to retailers and audio-visual integrators for use in settings where directed audio and sound zones are beneficial, such as digital signage and interactive retail displays. Convenience retailers and fast moving consumer good brands face ever-greater challenges as competition for customers intensifies, and as shoppers increasingly rely on in-store cues. As a result, digital signage is a growing form of direct advertising, capturing an increasing share of advertising spending as restaurants, banks, retail outlets, museums and other outlets and organizations employ commercial displays to communicate with patrons.\nResults of Operations\nManagement Overview\nOur net revenues, which decreased $23.4 million, or 12.6%, were impacted by several external factors, including the impact of the strong dollar on our international business and a more rapid than expected decline in old-gen revenues, which were down $40 million from 2014 to end at less than 12% of revenues. However, we completed our new-gen headset portfolio, launching seven new models, which resulted in a $23.8 million or 23.8% increase year-over-year, and continued to execute on initiatives to drive sustained growth and improved profitability, such as our global logistics partnership with Keuhne + Nagel and the transition of certain headset models to the world's largest contract manufacturer, Foxconn.\nDespite the product mix shift to higher margin new-gen headsets, gross profit as a percentage of net revenue decreased to 25.0% from 27.2% in the prior year. In addition to lower revenues, margins were negatively impacted by higher promotional credits to clear old-gen and licensed headset inventory, incremental costs associated with our new refurbishment model, contract manufacture transition costs and higher third party licensing and royalty costs associated with discontinued legacy license agreements. Looking ahead, we believe that margins and profitability will increase significantly as old-gen is now expected to be well under 10% of our headset business revenues in 2016.\nFor 2015, our reported net loss increased to $82.9 million driven largely by the Headset revenue decline, the negative non-cash impacts of the valuation allowance and goodwill impairment and, an increased investment in the HyperSound business ahead of the HyperSound Clear 500P launch. Diluted net loss per share of $1.96 was down compared to the prior year diluted net loss per share of $0.39.\nIn 2016, we believe that old-gen headset sales will take a final, large drop, which we expect to be roughly offset by continued strong growth in our new-gen headset business as our new core models capture further revenue share and, the initial full year of revenues from the HyperSound Clear 500P product, which will include the launch in Europe as well as continued channel expansion.\nKey Performance Indicators and Non-GAAP Measures\nManagement routinely reviews key performance indicators including revenue, operating income and margins, earnings per share, among others. In addition, we believe certain other measures provide useful information to management and investors about us and our financial condition and results of operations for the following reasons: (i) it is one of the measures used by our board of directors and management team to evaluate our operating performance; (ii) it is one of the measures used by our management team to make day-to-day operating decisions; (iii) the adjustments made are often viewed as either non-recurring or not reflective of ongoing financial performance or have no cash impact on operations; and (iv) it is used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties as a common operating performance measure to compare results across companies in our industry by backing out potential differences caused by variations in capital structures (affecting relative interest expense), and the age and book value of facilities and equipment (affecting relative depreciation and amortization expense). These metrics, however, are not measures of financial performance under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ( GAAP\u201d) and, given the limitations of these metrics as analytical tools, should not be considered a substitute for gross profit, gross margins, net income (loss) or other consolidated income statement data as determined in accordance with GAAP. We consider the following non-GAAP measure, which may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies, to be key performance indicators:\n \u2022 Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income (loss) before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation (non-cash) and, certain special items that we believe are not representative of core operations. \n \u2022 Cash Margins is defined as gross margin excluding depreciation and amortization, and stock-based compensation.  Adjusted EBITDA\nAdjusted EBITDA (and a reconciliation to Net loss, the nearest GAAP financial measure) for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 are as follows:\nTable 51: <table><tr><td>

2015, Adjusted EBITDA on a consolidated basis was $(11.4) million, including investments of $13.8 million in the HyperSound business, compared to Adjusted EBITDA on a consolidated basis of $2.0 million, including investments of $10.0 million in the HyperSound business from the year ended December 31, 2014.\nHeadset Adjusted EBITDA totaled approximately $2.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $12.0 million in the prior year, which included the initial sell-in of the Company's and the industry's first ever Xbox One compatible headsets.\nIn addition to the lower sales volume driven primarily by the strong dollar on our international business, the current period was negatively impacted by promotional credits to continue to clear channel inventory and higher third party licensing and royalty costs which included $1.3 million of reserves for products associated with certain discontinued legacy license agreements.\nComparison of the Year Ended December 31, 2014 to the Year Ended December 31, 2013\nAdjusted EBITDA decreased for the year ended December 31, 2014 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2013 driven largely by our investment in the HyperSound business and an increased net loss reflecting the negative impact of costs to package the Microsoft Xbox One Headset Chat Adapter with our headsets and ship them to retailers, increased air freight usage to ensure certain new headsets were in the market for the holiday and in response to the labor uncertainty at the West Coast ports, and initial costs to support being a public company.\nFinancial Results\nThe following table sets forth the Company's statements of operations for the periods presented:\nTable 52: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>

$40 million compared to 2014 and, the strong dollar on our international business that declined 29.0% in the United Kingdom and 28.0% in Europe. These declines were\noffset, in part, by a 27.0% increase in new-gen revenues reflecting the continued positive consumer reaction to the XO ONE, XO FOUR Stealth and Stealth 500P headsets and the strong performance of our new products as we completed our headset portfolio transition with the launch of five new headsets for the holiday season.\nDespite the benefit of the product mix shift to higher margin new-gen headsets during the second half of the year, for the year ended December 31, 2015, gross profit as a percentage of net revenue decreased to 26.5% from 27.3% in the prior year. The year-over-year decrease in gross margin performance was primarily due to higher promotion credits to clear, and subsequent excess reserves of, old-gen and licensed headsets, incremental costs associated with our refurbishment model and contract manufacture transitions and, higher third party licensing and royalty costs. Excluding the impact of $1.8 million previous generation and licensed headset charges, gross profit as a percentage of net sales would have been 27.6% driven largely by sales of higher margin headsets.\nComparison of Fiscal Years 2014 and 2013\nIn spite of challenging overall market conditions that included a rapid decline in active user bases for Xbox 360 and PlayStation\u00ae3 and a more promotional environment, net revenues for year ended December 31, 2014 increased $7.7 million, or 4.3%, compared to the prior year on the strength of our new generation headset portfolio and the expansion of our international headset business with strong growth in several markets, including a 11.3% increase in the United Kingdom business and 29.7% in Europe, as well as the initial sales of our Xbox One headsets in China. Domestic sales increased 5.6% on strong consumer response to our new more advanced headsets. These gains were offset in part by a decline in sales to our Canadian distributor as fiscal 2013 included incremental initial stock orders.\nOur strategy to deliver innovative headsets across all price points drove a 6.6% increase in total Xbox compatible headsets sales as new generation console headsets bolstered by the launch of the XO FOUR, XO SEVEN, XO ONE and Stealth 500X outpaced the decline in previous generation headset sales. Sales of PlayStation\u00ae compatible headsets remained steady through the console transition on continued positive consumer reaction to the PX22 headset and the release of the ELITE 800, Stealth 500P, Ear Force Stealth 400 and P12 headsets.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2014, gross profit as a percentage of net revenue decreased to 27.2% from 28.2% in the prior year. In 2014, gross profit as a percentage of net revenue was negatively impacted by $2.5 million of incremental shipping and handling costs related to the Microsoft Xbox One Headset Chat Adapter necessary to have our headsets in retail stores for when Microsoft turned on gaming headset audio which had been delayed at the product launch and $3.4 million of incremental air freight costs to get certain new products (ELITE 800, Stealth 500X and XO ONE) to market for the holiday and in response to abnormal West Coast port delays due to labor disputes during contract negotiations. Excluding the impact of these additional shipping costs, gross profit as a percentage of net sales would have been 30.2% driven largely by sales of higher margin headsets.\nHyperSound Segment\nTable 54: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>HyperSound\n</td> <td>912\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>707\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross Profit\n</td> <td>(2,141\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>117\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross Margin\n</td> <td>(234.8\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>16.5\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash Margin\n</td> <td>(105.8\n</td> <td>)%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>31.3\n</td> <td>%\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>%\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) Excludes non-cash charges of $1.2 million, $0.1 million and $0.0 million, respectively.\nComparison of Fiscal Years 2015 and 2014\nNet revenues for the year ended December 31, 2015 were $0.9 million and reflect the initial sales of the HyperSound Clear 500P product that launched in November 2015, compared to $0.7 million in the prior year primarily from the first wide-scale deployment of the commercial product in Activision Call of Duty\u00ae retail displays.\nAs a result of certain start-up costs related to the HyperSound Clear 500P product, including the incremental amortization expense related to technological feasibility of the purchased in-process research and development intangible asset, gross profit\nas a percentage of net revenue was negative for the year ended December 31, 2015. Excluding these costs, the cash margin was 39.8% reflecting the initial shipments of the higher margin HyperSound Clear 500P product.\nOperating Expenses\nTable 55: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>Year Ended\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>December 31,\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling and marketing\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>31,829\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>33,442\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>31,645\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Research and development\n</td> <td>11,556\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>9,400\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>4,873\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General and administrative\n</td> <td>21,484\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>17,159\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>8,349\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Business transaction costs\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,744\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3,864\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Goodwill impairment\n</td> <td>49,822\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Restructuring charges\n</td> <td>399\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>747\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total operating expenses\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>115,090\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>64,492\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>48,731\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating expenses increased largely due to additional costs associated with the expansion of the HyperSound business and additional headcount required of a public company partially offset by cost reductions in marketing.\nSelling and Marketing\nSelling and marketing expense for the year ended December 31, 2015 totaled $31.8 million, or 19.6% as a percentage of net revenues, compared to $33.4 million, or 18.0% as a percentage of net revenues, for the prior year. The 4.8% decrease was primarily due to lower direct media spend and licensing costs ($1.5 million) and a reduction in trade show spend ($0.9 million) in connection with a strategic shift to more targeted promotional activity, partially offset by incremental marketing costs and additional sales force related to the HyperSound Clear 500P product launch.\nSelling and marketing expense for the year ended December 31, 2014 totaled $33.4 million, or 18.0% as a percentage of net revenues, compared to $31.6 million, or 17.7% as a percentage of net revenues, for the prior year. The increase in expense was primarily due to $5.1 million of incremental costs related to the HyperSound business and higher depreciation driven by the addition of interactive retail display kiosks into two large retailers in the fourth quarter of 2013, partially offset by reduced trade show expenses ($0.7 million), direct media spend ($1.2 million) and, advertising and promotional expenses ($1.6 million) related to the media series headsets post their market launch in 2013.\nResearch and Development\nThe increase in research and development expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015 versus the prior year was primarily due to increased staffing levels to support the development of the HyperSound Clear 500P product ($1.9 million) as well as new advanced audio and wireless development initiatives to expand our Xbox One compatible headset portfolio and launch of our true multiplatform headset - the EarForce PX24 ($0.3 million).\nThe increase in research and development expenses for the year ended December 31, 2014 versus the comparable prior year was primarily due to HyperSound product development efforts ($3.6 million), increased staffing levels to support the development of technology leading headsets for the new generation consoles and, an investment in product development for the HyperSound Clear 500P product.\nGeneral and Administrative\nGeneral and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015 increased $4.3 million to $21.5 million compared to $17.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The year over year increase was primarily driven by higher employee costs as a result of the full year impact of additional headcount required of a public company ($1.5 million), legal fees associated with recent public filings in connection with our stock option exchange and financing activities ($0.7 million) and higher stock compensation expense ($0.7 million).\nGeneral and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2014 increased $8.8 million to $17.2 million compared to $8.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. The year over year increase was primarily driven by increased external\nexpenses to be a public company ($3.2 million), incremental costs related to HyperSound ($2.3 million), higher stock compensation expense ($1.1 million) and, additional headcount to build our internal capabilities and higher consultant fees for debt and equity capital activities ($1.4 million).\nGoodwill Impairment\nAs a result of our annual impairment test, we recorded a $49.8 million goodwill impairment charge in connection with the decline in implied fair value of the HyperSound reporting unit. There were no such charges in 2014 or 2013.\nBusiness Transaction\nBusiness transaction expenses for the year ended December 31, 2014 incurred in connection with the Merger included investment banker success fees of $2.2 million payable upon the close of the merger and legal and accounting fees required to complete the transaction compared to $3.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 related to due diligence and legal costs related to the acquisition of the HyperSound business that closed in January 2014.\nRestructuring Charges\nDuring 2014, we began to focus on company-wide overhead and operating expense cost reduction activities, such as closing excess facilities and reducing redundancies. In connection with our efforts to improve our operating efficiency and reduce costs, over the past two years, we completed the closure of certain warehouse operations and the production operations at one of our contract manufacturing operations in China.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense decreased $2.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily due to the write-off of $2.2 million of unamortized debt issuance costs related to the refinancing of our credit facility in the comparable period. Excluding this item, interest expense increased $0.1 million as additional interest related to the issuance of the Term Loan Due 2019 and subordinated notes offset by savings associated with rate reductions and lower average borrowings on our revolving line of credit.\nInterest expense increased $0.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 primarily due to higher deferred finance fees that included the write-off of $2.2 million of unamortized debt issuance costs related to the refinancing of our credit facility on March 31, 2014 and additional interest of $0.8 million related to the issuance of the subordinated notes. These factors were offset by rate reductions and lower average borrowings on our revolving line of credit.\nIncome Taxes\nDuring 2015, as a result of cumulative losses in recent years primarily due to incremental costs associated with the console transition, acquisition costs and initial investments in the HyperSound business, the Company concluded that a full valuation allowance is required on its net deferred tax assets.\nIncome tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $2.4 million at an effective tax rate of (3.0)% compared to income tax benefit $6.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 at an effective tax rate of 28.8%. The effective tax rate was primarily impacted by two discrete items, the release of certain reserves related to uncertain tax positions due to the closure of an IRS examination and the establishment of a valuation allowance on all of our deferred tax assets in the United States and the United Kingdom\nIncome tax benefit for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $6.3 million at an effective tax rate of 28.8% compared to income tax expense of $1.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 at an effective tax rate of 21.5%. The Company's effective tax rate for this year differed from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35% primarily due to differences in book and tax treatment of transaction costs, interest on the Series B Redeemable Preferred Stock and other non-deductible expenses.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur primary sources of working capital are cash flow from operations and availability of capital under our revolving credit facility. We have funded operations and acquisitions in recent periods with operating cash flows, and proceeds from debt and equity financings.\nThe following table summarizes our sources and uses of cash:\nTable 56: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>2015\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2014\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>2013\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash and cash equivalents at beginning of period\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,908\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,509\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>5,219\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by (used for) operating activities\n</td> <td>(15,133\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(14,834\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>18,290\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by (used for) investing activities\n</td> <td>(6,693\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>557\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(6,167\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by (used for) financing activities\n</td> <td>21,134\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>15,969\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(11,017\n</td> <td>)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Effect of foreign exchange on cash\n</td> <td>(102\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(293\n</td> <td>)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>184\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash and cash equivalents at end of period\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,114\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>7,908\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>6,509\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating activities\nCash used for operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $15.1 million, a decline of $0.3 million as compared to $14.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. The year-over-year decrease is primarily the result of lower net income adjusted for non-cash expenses and higher year-over-year payments of accounts payable due to incremental expenses incurred in connection with the launch of the HyperSound Clear 500P product. These impacts were offset, in part, by the valuation allowance recorded on the Company's deferred tax assets.\nCash used for operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $14.8 million, a decline of $33.1 million as compared to cash provided by operating activities of $18.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. The year-over-year decrease is primarily the result of lower net income adjusted for non-cash expenses and a reduction in net working capital (defined as accounts receivable and inventories less accounts payable). The reduction in net working capital was driven by payments of accounts payable that had increased during our debt refinancing process that started in late 2013 and was completed in March 2014.\nInvesting activities\nCash used for investing activities was $6.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to cash provided by investing activities of $0.6 million in 2014, which included $4.1 million of cash acquired in the Merger. Capital expenditures increased $3.2 million compared to the prior year to $6.7 million primarily due to expenditures on tooling related to the expansion of our headset portfolio and the initial production line for HyperSound Clear 500P as well as interactive display purchases in connection with our initial international headset display units.\nCash provided by investing activities was $0.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to cash used for investing activities of $6.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2013, as a result of $4.1 million of cash acquired in the Merger. During 2013, we refreshed demonstration units at key retailers and purchased new convention booth equipment in advance of the new generation console releases, and as such capital expenditures declined in the year ended December 31, 2014 to $3.5 million from $6.2 million in 2013.\nFinancing activities\nNet cash provided by financing activities was $21.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $16.0 million and $11.0 million of cash used in financing activities during the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Financing activities in 2015 included the issuance of a $15 million term loan and $16.3 million principal amount of subordinated notes, partially offset by repayments of term loans and net payments on our revolving credit facilities of $8.8 million.\nFinancing activities in 2014 included $37.2 million of proceeds from the sale of common stock, the issuance of $7.0 million principal amount of subordinated notes and a $7.7 million term loan borrowing partially offset by (i) net payments on our revolving credit facilities of $2.9 million, (ii) repayment of our $14.5 million legacy term loan and (iii) repayment of $18.5 million of outstanding subordinated notes.\nNet cash used in financing activities during the year ended December 31, 2013 was primarily related to net repayments of the legacy revolving line of credit and term loan, and was partially offset by the issuance of $10 million principal amount of subordinated notes.\nManagement assessment of liquidity\nManagement believes that our current cash and cash equivalents, the amounts available under our revolving credit facility, the impact of the proceeds from our recent term loans and subordinated notes, and equity raise and cash flows derived from operations will be sufficient to meet anticipated cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures for at least the next 12 months. Significant assumptions underlie this belief, including, among other things, that there will be no material adverse developments in our business, liquidity or capital requirements.\nOn February 5, 2016, we received approximately $6.2 million in net proceeds in connection with the successful closure of a public offering of 5.0 million shares of common stock and a separate, concurrent, side-by-side private placement of 1.7 million shares of common stock at a price of $1.00 per share. In accordance with certain amendments to our Credit Facility, these proceeds were applied against the outstanding principal balance of the working capital line of credit.\nWe believe the combination of our revolving credit facility, long-term debt and cash flow generated by our gaming headset business will cover incremental costs related to the continued launch of the HyperSound Clear 500P product and provide the necessary liquidity to fund our annual working capital needs, particularly during the gaming industry's seasonal slow period in the first half of the year.\nForeign cash balances at December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014 were $0.2 million and $2.5 million, respectively.\nRevolving Credit Facility\nOn March 31, 2014, Turtle Beach and certain of its subsidiaries entered into a new asset-based revolving credit agreement ( Credit Facility\u201d) with Bank of America, N.A., as Agent, Sole Lead Arranger and Sole Bookrunner, which replaced the then existing loan and security agreement. The Credit Facility, which expires on March 31, 2019, provides for a line of credit of up to $60 million inclusive of a sub-facility limit of $10 million for TB Europe, a wholly owned subsidiary of Turtle Beach. The Credit Facility may be used for working capital, the issuance of bank guarantees, letters of credit and other corporate purposes.\nThe maximum credit availability for loans and letters of credit under the Credit Facility is governed by a borrowing base determined by the application of specified percentages to certain eligible assets, primarily eligible trade accounts receivable and inventories, and is subject to discretionary reserves and revaluation adjustments.\nAmounts outstanding under the Credit Facility bear interest at a rate equal to either a rate published by Bank of America or the LIBOR rate, plus in each case, an applicable margin, which is between 1.00% to 1.50% for U.S. base rate loans and between 2.00% to 2.50% for U.S. LIBOR loans and U.K. loans. As of December 31, 2015, interest rates for outstanding borrowings were 5.00% for base rate loans and 2.92% for LIBOR rate loans. In addition, Turtle Beach is required to pay a commitment fee on the unused revolving loan commitment at a rate ranging from 0.25% to 0.50%, and letter of credit fees and agent fees.\nIf certain availability thresholds are not met, meaning that the Company does not have receivables and inventory which are eligible to borrow on under the Credit Facility in excess of amounts borrowed, the Credit Facility requires the Company and its restricted subsidiaries to maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio. The fixed charge ratio is defined as the ratio, determined on a consolidated basis for the most recent four fiscal quarters, of (a) EBITDA minus capital expenditures, excluding those financed through other instruments, and cash taxes paid, and (b) Fixed Charges defined as the sum of cash interest expense plus scheduled principal payments.\nThe Credit Facility also contains affirmative and negative covenants that, subject to certain exceptions, limit our ability to take certain actions, including our ability to incur debt, pay dividends and repurchase stock, make certain investments and other payments, enter into certain mergers and consolidations, engage in sale leaseback transactions and transactions with affiliates and encumber and dispose of assets. Obligations under the Credit Facility are secured by a security interest and lien upon substantially all of the Company's assets.\nIn March 2015, Bank of America notified the Company that certain events of default had occurred and were continuing under the Credit Agreement, including (i) the Company's failure to deliver in a timely matter certain monthly financial statements in accordance with the Credit Agreement, (ii) the Company's failure to deliver in a timely matter certain financial projections in accordance with the Credit Agreement, (iii) the Company's failure to repay an over-advance of approximately $100,000 that existed between March 6, 2015 and March 9, 2015, and (iv) the Company's failure to satisfy the fixed charge coverage ratio under the Credit Agreement for certain measurement dates during the fourth quarter of 2014 (in part as a result of certain\nretroactive changes to the calculation of such ratio pursuant to the second amendment, dated December 29, 2014) (the Existing Events of Default\u201d).\nOn March 16, 2015, the Company entered into a third amendment (the Third Amendment\u201d) to the Credit Facility pursuant to which Bank of America and the lenders under the Credit Facility agreed to waive the Existing Events of Default. In addition, the Third Amendment amends certain other provisions of the agreement and requires that we maintain an EBITDA ratio at the end of each month beginning April 30, 2015 on a cumulative basis through the remainder of 2015 and thereafter on a trailing twelve-month basis, our EBITDA (as defined under the Credit Facility) must be in an amount equal to at least 75% of our monthly projected EBITDA as set forth in projections delivered pursuant to the Credit Facility. The current fixed charge coverage ratio of at least 1.15 to 1.00 on the last day of each month while a Covenant Trigger Period (as defined in the agreement) is in effect will become effective again after the Company has complied with such ratio for six consecutive months.\nOn November 2, 2015, the Company entered into a sixth amendment to the Credit Facility that modified certain provisions to provide (i) that the Company will make certain periodic reports with respect to certain financial metrics, (ii) that the existing financial covenants are suspended and replaced by amended EBITDA levels during the months ended September 30, 2015 through the month ending November 30, 2015, and (iii) that the loan availability is decreased by an additional block.\nOn December 1, 2015, in connection with the sixth amendment, the Company further amended certain provisions of the Credit Facility to, among other things, amend the definition of EBITDA to exclude certain non-recurring expenses and replace certain financial covenants by amended EBITDA levels each month beginning with the month ended December 31, 2015 through (and including) the month ending March 31, 2017 (with revised financial covenants to be agreed based on new financial projections after such date) on both an overall and segment-by-segment basis.\nOn February 1, 2016, the Company further amended certain provisions of the Credit Facility to, among other things, provide that, on or prior to February 5, 2016, the Company receive net proceeds of not less than $6.0 million of additional equity capital or additional third lien debt financing and apply such proceeds against the outstanding principal balance of the working capital line of credit, amend the definition of EBITDA to exclude certain non-recurring expenses and replace certain financial covenants by amended EBITDA levels. The Company satisfied its paydown obligation with the proceeds from the recent offering and private placement.\nAs of December 31, 2015, the Company was in compliance with all the amended financial covenants, and excess borrowing availability was approximately $3.8 million, net of the outstanding Term Loan Due 2018 (as defined below) that is considered to be an additional outstanding amount under the Credit Facility.\nTerm Loans\nTerm Loan Due 2018\nOn December 29, 2014, the Company amended the Credit Facility to permit the repayment of $7.7 million of existing subordinated debt and accrued interest with the proceeds of an additional loan (the Term Loan\u201d). The Term Loan will result in modified financial covenants while it is outstanding, will bear interest at a rate of LIBOR for the applicable interest period plus 5% and will be repaid in equal monthly installments beginning on April 1, 2015 and ending on April 1, 2018. As of December 31, 2015, the outstanding principal balance was $5.8 million,\nTerm Loan Due 2019\nOn July 22, 2015, the Company and its subsidiaries, entered into a term loan, guaranty and security agreement (the Term Loan Due 2019\u201d) with Crystal Financial LLC, as agent, sole lead arranger and sole bookrunner, Crystal Financial SPV LLC and the other persons party thereto ( Crystal\u201d), which provides for an aggregate term loan commitment of $15 million that bears interest at a rate per annum equal to the 90-day LIBOR rate plus 10.25%. Under the terms of the Term Loan Due 2019, the Company is required to make payments of interest in arrears on the first day of each month beginning August 1, 2015 and will repay the principal in monthly payments beginning January 1, 2016, with a final payment on June 28, 2019, the maturity date.\nThe Term Loan Due 2019 is secured by a security interest in substantially all of the Company and each of its subsidiaries' working capital assets and is subject to the first-priority lien of Bank of America , N.A., as agent, under the Credit Facility, other than with respect to equipment, fixtures, real property interests, intellectual property, intercompany property, intercompany indebtedness, equity interest in their subsidiaries, and certain other assets specified in an inter-creditor agreement between Bank of America and Crystal.\nThe Company and its subsidiaries are required to comply with various customary covenants including, (i) maintaining minimum EBITDA and Headset EBITDA (each as defined in the Term Loan Due 2019) in each trailing twelve month period beginning August 31, 2015, (ii) maintaining a Consolidated Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Term Loan Due 2019) to be measured on the last day of each month while the term loans are outstanding of no more than 5.75:1 beginning December 31, 2015 with periodic step-downs to 3.00:1 on January 31, 2017, (iii) not making capital expenditures in excess of $11 million in the year ending December 31, 2015 and in excess of $7 million in each of the years ending December 31, 2016, 2017, 2018 and 2019, (iv) restrictions on the Company's and its subsidiaries ability to prepay its subordinated notes, pay dividends, incur debt, create or suffer liens and engage in certain fundamental transactions and (v) an obligation to provide certain financial and other information. The agreement permits certain equity holders of the Company to contribute funds to the Company to cure certain financial covenant defaults.\nThe Term Loan Due 2019 contains customary representations, mandatory prepayment events and events of default, including defaults triggered by the failure to make payments when due, breaches of covenants and representations, material impairment in the perfection of Crystal's security interest in the collateral and events related to bankruptcy and insolvency of the Company and its subsidiaries. Upon an event of default, Crystal may declare all outstanding obligations immediately due and payable (along with a prepayment fee), a default rate of an additional 2.0% may be applied to amounts outstanding and may take other actions including collecting or taking such other action with respect to the collateral pledged in connection with the term loan.\nOn February 1, 2016, the Company entered into a third amendment to amend certain provisions to, among other things, provide that net proceeds from additional equity capital or additional third lien debt financing are applied against the outstanding principal balance of the working capital line of credit, amend the definition of EBITDA to exclude certain non-recurring expenses and replace certain financial covenants by amended EBITDA levels each month beginning with the month ended December 31, 2015 and on a trailing twelve-month period basis beginning with the period ending October 31, 2016, through the termination date on both an overall and segment-by-segment basis.\nAs of December 31, 2015, the Company was in compliance with the amended financial covenants, and outstanding principal balance was $12.6 million.\nSubordination Agreement\nOn November 16, 2015, as a condition precedent to our lenders permitting certain subordinated notes, we entered into a subordinated agreement with and between certain parties that our obligations under any such notes would be subordinated in right of payment in full of all the Company's obligations under the Credit Facility and Term Loan Due 2019.\nSubordinated Notes - Related Party\nConcurrently with the completion of the Term Loan Due 2019, the Company amended and restated each of its outstanding subordinated notes (the Amended Notes\u201d). The $13.8 million obligation of the Company under the Amended Notes is subordinate and junior to the prior payment of amounts due under the Credit Facility and Term Loan Due 2019. In addition, the stated maturity date of the Amended Notes was extended to September 29, 2019, subject to acceleration in certain circumstances, such as a change of control in the Company. The Amended Notes bear interest at a rate per annum equal to LIBOR plus 10.5% and shall be paid-in-kind by adding the amount to the principal amount due. Further, as consideration for the concessions in the Amended Notes, the Company issued warrants to purchase 1.7 million of the Company's common stock at an exercise price of $2.54 per share.\nOn November 16, 2015, the Company issued a $2.5 million subordinated note (the November Note\u201d) to SG VTB, the proceeds of which, as set forth in the amendment to the Term Loan Due 2019, were applied against the outstanding balance of the Term Loan Due 2019. The November Note will bear interest at a rate of 15% per annum until its maturity date, which is September 29, 2019, and is subordinated to all senior debt of the Company. In connection with the November Note, the Company issued a warrant to purchase 1.4 million shares of the Company's common stock at an exercise price of $2.00 per share.\nSG VTB is an affiliate of Stripes Group LLC ( Stripes\u201d), a private equity firm focused on internet, software, healthcare IT and branded consumer products businesses. Kenneth A. Fox, one of our directors, is the managing general partner of Stripes and the sole manager of SG VTB and Ronald Doornink, our Chairman of the Board, is an operating partner of Stripes.\nSeries B redeemable preferred stock\nIn September 2010, VTBH issued 1,000,000 shares of its Series B Redeemable Preferred Stock with a fair value of $12.4 million. We are required to redeem the Series B Redeemable Preferred Stock on the earlier to occur of September 28, 2030 or the occurrence of a liquidation event (as defined in VTBH's Certificate of Incorporation) at its original issue price of $12.425371 per share plus any accrued but unpaid dividends. The redemption value was $16.1 million and $14.9 million as of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, respectively.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nOur discussion and analysis of our results of operations and capital resources are based on our condensed consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in conformity with GAAP. The preparation of these condensed consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Management bases its estimates, assumptions and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances.\nDifferent assumptions and judgments would change the estimates used in the preparation of the condensed consolidated financial statements, which, in turn, could change the results from those reported. Management evaluates its estimates, assumptions and judgments on an ongoing basis.\nBased on the above, we have determined that our most critical accounting policies are those related to revenue recognition and sales return reserve, inventory valuation, asset impairment, and income taxes.\nRevenue Recognition and Sales Return Reserve\nRevenue is recognized when products are shipped and title has been transferred to a customer, the sales price is fixed and determinable, and collection is reasonably assured. Product is considered delivered to the customer once it has been shipped and title and risk of loss have been transferred. Net revenue for on-line purchases is recognized when products are shipped from our distribution facilities.\nProvisions for cash discounts, quantity rebates, and sales returns in the period the sale is recorded, based upon our prior experience and current trends, as a reduction of revenue. These revenue reductions are established based upon management's best estimates at the time of sale following the historical trend, adjusted to reflect known changes in the factors that impact such reserves and allowances, and the terms of agreements with customers.\nInventory Valuation\nInventories are valued at the lower of weighted average cost or market, at the individual item level. Market is determined based on the estimated net realizable value, which is generally the selling price. Inventory levels are monitored to identify slow-moving items and markdowns are used to clear such product. Physical inventory counts are performed annually in January and estimates are made for any shortage between the date of the physical inventory count and the balance sheet date.\nAsset Impairment\nWe have significant long-lived tangible and intangible assets, including goodwill with indefinite lives, which are susceptible to valuation adjustments as a result of changes in various factors or conditions. We assess the potential impairment of intangible and fixed assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that full recoverability of net asset balances through future cash flows is in question. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are assessed at least annually, but also whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying values may not be recoverable. Factors we consider important, which could trigger an impairment of such assets include significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results; significant changes in the manner of or use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business; significant negative industry or economic trends; significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period; and a decline in our market capitalization below net book value.\nManagement estimates future pre-tax cash flows based on historical experience, knowledge and market data. Estimates of future cash flows require that we make assumptions and apply judgment, including forecasting future sales and expenses and estimating useful lives of the assets. These estimates can be affected by factors such as future product development and economic conditions that can be difficult to predict, as well as other factors such as those outlined in Risk Factors.\u201d If the expected future cash flows related to the long-lived assets are less than the assets' carrying value, an impairment loss would be recognized for the difference between estimated fair value and carrying value.\nIn connection with the Merger, the Company performed a valuation of the acquired goodwill and intangible assets and recorded $81.0 million of goodwill based on the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The Company conducted its annual impairment assessment as of November 1, 2015, and based on the two-step impairment test, recorded a $49.8 million goodwill impairment charge, which resulted in a $31.2 million remaining carrying value as of December 31, 2015. Refer to Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policy\u201d for further details.\nManagement's forecasts of planned revenue are largely dependent on the market acceptance and continued channel expansion of the Company's recently launched HyperSound Clear 500P product to generate the projected revenue in subsequent years. If the performance of the Company's HyperSound Clear 500P product in the hearing healthcare market does not meet expectations based on initial market data, a future impairment charge could result for a portion or all of the remaining goodwill. The amount of any impairment is dependent on the performance of the business which is dependent upon a number of variables which cannot be predicted with certainty.\nIncome Taxes\nWe account for income taxes using the asset and liability method. Under the asset and liability method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on the differences between the financial statement carrying value of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates and laws expected to be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. Inherent in the measurement of these deferred balances are certain judgments and interpretations of existing tax law and other published guidance as applied to our operations. Our effective tax rate considers our judgment of expected tax liabilities in the various jurisdictions within which we are subject to tax.\nThe determination of the need for a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets requires Management to make assumptions and to apply judgment, including forecasting future earnings, taxable income, and the mix of earnings in the jurisdictions in which we operate. During 2015, as a result of cumulative losses in recent years primarily due to incremental costs associated with the console transition, acquisition costs and initial investments in the HyperSound business, the Company concluded that a full valuation allowance is required on its net deferred tax assets.\nThe tax effects of uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in income tax returns are recognized only if they are more likely-than-not\u201d to be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits as of the reporting date. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. We recognize estimated accrued interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense.\nWe are currently under examination by certain state and local taxing jurisdictions. Further, at any given time, multiple tax years may be subject to examination by various taxing authorities. The recorded amounts of income tax are subject to adjustment upon examination, changes in interpretation and changes in judgment utilized in determining estimates.\nSee Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policy,\u201d in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for a complete discussion of recent accounting pronouncements. We are currently evaluating the impact of certain recently issued guidance on our financial condition and results of operations in future periods.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nOff balance sheet arrangements are transactions, agreements, or other contractual arrangements with an unconsolidated entity for which we have an obligation to the entity that is not recorded in the consolidated financial statements. As of December 31, 2015, there are no significant off-balance sheet arrangements.\nContractual Obligations\nOur principal commitments primarily consist of obligations for minimum payment commitments to leases for office space, redeemable preferred stock and the revolving credit facility. As of December 31, 2015, the future non-cancelable minimum payments under these commitments were as follows:\nTable 57: <table><tr><td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Payments Due by Period\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>(in thousands)\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>Less Than One Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1 - 3 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>3 - 5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>More Than Five Years\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Contractual Obligations: (1)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating lease obligations (2)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>8,750\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>1,608\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>3,369\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>2,360\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,413\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Series B Redeemable Preferred Stock (3)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>51,928\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>51,928\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Long term debt (4)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>68,079\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>37,267\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>7,705\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>23,107\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest payments on long-term debt (5)\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>13,386\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,449\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>1,810\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>10,127\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>-\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>142,143\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>40,324\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>12,884\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>35,594\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>$\n</td> <td>53,341\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) Contractual obligations exclude tax liabilities of $1.5 million related to uncertain tax positions because we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of settlement, if any, of these future payments.\n(2) Operating lease agreements represent obligations to make payments under non-cancelable lease agreements for its facilities.\n(3) In September 2010, VTBH issued shares of its Series B Redeemable Preferred Stock. If the Series B Redeemable Preferred Stock is still outstanding as of October 2030 or if the Company experiences a liquidation event as defined in VTBH's Certification of Incorporation, the Company will be required to redeem the shares for an aggregate of $51.9 million, which is comprised of the aggregate purchase price of $12.4 million plus cumulative preferred dividends of 8.0% per annum, or $39.5 million in the aggregate. See Note 13, Commitments and Contingencies\u201d, for further information.\n(4) On March 31, 2014 the Company entered into the Credit Facility that expires March 31, 2019. However, due to certain terms of the facility, the indebtedness is required to be classified as a current liability. Long term debt includes scheduled principal payments only. See Note 7, Credit Facilities and Long-Term Debt\u201d for further information.\n(5) These amounts reflect estimated interest payments under our outstanding long-term debt agreements based on the applicable rates in effect as of December 31, 2015, except for interest payments under our Credit Facility because the amount that will be borrowed in future years is uncertain."}
