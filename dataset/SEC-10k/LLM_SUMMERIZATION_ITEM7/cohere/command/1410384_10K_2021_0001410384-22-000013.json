Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In addition to historical consolidated financial information, the following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates and beliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those discussed below and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, particularly in the section titled \"Risk Factors.\"\nOverview\nWe are a leading provider of secure, cloud-based digital solutions that transform the ways in which financial institutions and other financial services providers engage with account holders and end users, or End Users. We offer our solutions to financial institutions, financial technology companies, or FinTechs, alternative finance companies, or Alt-FIs, and other innovative companies, or Brands, wishing to incorporate banking into their customer engagement and servicing strategies. Our solutions include a broad and deep portfolio of digital banking, lending solutions; an open technology platform, the Q2 Innovation Studio, that accelerates innovation by enabling a partnership ecosystem on the Q2 platform in which FinTechs and other digital solution providers can embed their offerings and customers can develop their own applications; and a comprehensive banking as a service, or BaaS, solution, which we re-branded as Helix in 2022, that enables innovative companies to incorporate banking directly into their products. We purpose-build our platforms and solutions to enable success for our customers and technology partners by allowing them to digitize their operations and offerings, differentiate their brands, and integrate traditional and emerging financial services, ultimately enhancing End-User acquisition, engagement and retention and improving operational efficiencies and profitability.\nThe effective delivery and management of secure and advanced digital solutions in the complex and heavily regulated financial services industry requires significant resources, personnel and expertise. We provide digital solutions that are designed to be highly configurable, scalable and adaptable to the specific needs of our customers. We design and develop our solutions with an open platform approach intended to provide comprehensive integration among our solution offerings and our customers' internal and third-party systems. This integrated approach allows our customers to deliver unified and robust financial experiences across digital channels. Our solutions provide our customers the flexibility to configure their digital services in a manner that is consistent with each customer's specific workflows, processes and controls. Our solutions also allow our customers to personalize the digital experiences they deliver to their End Users by extending their individual services and brand requirements across digital channels. Our solutions and our data center infrastructure and resources are designed to comply with the stringent security and technical regulations applicable to financial institutions and financial services providers and to safeguard our customers' data and that of their End Users.\nWe have deep domain expertise in developing and delivering secure, advanced digital solutions designed to help our customers and technology partners compete in the complex and heavily regulated financial services industry. Over 17 years ago Q2 began by providing digital banking solutions to regional and community financial institutions. We have rapidly grown since then through a combination of broad market acceptance of our award-winning solutions and relentless innovation, investment and acquisitions. Our portfolio of solutions now spans digital banking, lending, profitability, onboarding, security, and we now serve account holders and borrowers across retail, small business and commercial segments, in addition to our open technology platform and BaaS offerings. While we remain focused on our founding mission of building stronger and more diverse communities by strengthening their financial institutions, we intend to draw on our broad solution portfolio, deep domain expertise and robust customer base to lead the transformation into a new frontier of financial services.\nThe financial services industry is undergoing tremendous change, influenced by three major factors. First, financial institutions demand now, more than ever, to digitize their operations and offerings, and the COVID-19 pandemic has further accelerated this digital transformation. Second, the continued growth in the number of FinTechs and the innovation they bring to the market is increasing End-User demand and expectations for new, more engaging and meaningful digital financial experiences. And third, major innovative Brands recognize that incorporating banking into their strategy is an opportunity to leverage the trust that their End Users place in them, driving deeper engagement with those End Users. These three forces are converging to create what we believe is a new frontier in financial services in which financial institutions, FinTechs and Brands will have new roles and interdependencies, and which will require new technology, new partners, and new business models. We believe that lasting value creation in financial services will be achieved by those companies that can support and enhance the convergence of these forces. In addition, we have built a broad set of solutions that we believe equips us to accelerate and optimize this convergence - from digitizing the entire bank, to facilitating partnerships among financial institutions and FinTechs, to enabling Brands to incorporate banking into their products and customer relationships.\nWe deliver our solutions to most of our customers using a software-as-a-service, or SaaS, model under which our customers pay subscription fees for the use of our solutions. Our digital banking platform customers have numerous End Users, and those End Users can represent one or more account holders registered to use one or more of our solutions on our digital banking platform. We generally price our digital banking platform solutions based on the number of solutions purchased by our customers and the number of Registered Users or commercial account holders utilizing our solutions. We generally earn additional revenues from our digital banking platform customers based on the number of transactions that End Users perform on our solutions in excess of the levels included in our standard subscription fee. As a result, our revenues from digital banking platform customers grow as our customers buy more solutions from us and increase the number of End Users utilizing our solutions and as those users increase their number of transactions on our solutions. The structure and terms of our newer lending arrangements vary, but generally are also sold on a subscription basis through our direct sales organization, and the related revenues are recognized over the terms of the customer agreements. The structure and terms of our Helix arrangements with FinTechs and Brands vary, but typically involve relatively lower contracted minimum revenues and instead emphasize usage-based revenue, with such revenue recognized as it is incurred.\nWe have achieved significant growth since our inception. During each of the past nine years, our average number of Registered Users (as defined below) per installed customer on our digital banking platform, or Installed Customer, has grown, and in many instances we have been able to sell additional solutions to existing customers. Our revenues per Installed Customer and per Registered User vary period-to-period based on the length and timing of customer implementations, changes in the average number of Registered Users per customer, sales of additional solutions to existing customers, changes in the number of transactions on our solutions by Registered Users and variations among existing customers and new customers with respect to the mix of purchased solutions and related pricing. Please see \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Key Operating Measures\" for additional detail on how we define \"Installed Customers\" and \"Registered Users.\"\nWe believe we have a significant opportunity to continue to grow our business, and we continue to invest across our organization to increase our revenues and improve our operating efficiencies. These investments will increase our costs on an absolute dollar basis, but the timing and amount of these investments will vary based on the rate at which we expect to add new customers, the implementation and support needs of our customers, our software development plans, our technology and physical infrastructure requirements and the internal needs of our organization. Many of these investments will occur in advance of our realizing any resultant benefit which may make it difficult to determine if we are effectively allocating our resources. If we are successful in growing our revenues by increasing the number of customers and scope of our customer relationships, we anticipate that greater economies of scale and increased operating leverage will improve our margins over the long term.\nWe sell our solutions primarily through our professional sales organization. While the financial institutions market is well-defined due to the regulatory classifications of those financial institutions, markets for FinTech, Alt-FIs and brands are broader and more difficult to define due to the changing number of providers in each market. Over the long term, we intend to continue to invest in additional sales representatives to identify and address the financial institution, FinTech, Alt-FI and Brand markets across the U.S. and internationally and to increase our number of sales support and marketing personnel, as well as our investment in marketing initiatives designed to increase awareness of our solutions and generate new customer opportunities.\nWe have continuously invested in expanding and improving our digital banking platform since its introduction in 2005, and we intend to continue investing both organically and inorganically through acquisitions to expand our portfolio of solutions. Additionally, over the past several years we have acquired or developed new solutions and additional functionality that serve a broader range of needs of financial institutions as well as the needs of FinTechs, Alt-FIs and Brands. Our integrated, end-to-end collection of solutions includes retail, small business and commercial banking, regulatory and compliance, digital lending, relationship pricing, BaaS, digital account opening, account switching and data-driven sales enablement and portfolio management solutions among others. We have also introduced the Q2 Innovation Studio, an API-based and SDK-based open technology platform that allows our financial institution customers and other technology partners to develop unique extensions of and integrations to our digital banking platform, allowing financial institutions to quickly and easily deploy customized experiences and the latest financial services expected by End Users.\nWe believe that financial services providers are best served by a broad integrated portfolio of digital solutions that provide rapid, flexible and comprehensive integration with internal and third-party solutions allowing them to provide modern, intuitive digital financial services in a secure, regulatory-compliant manner. We also believe that the breadth and depth of our solution offerings and customer base, our open and flexible platform approach, our position as a leading provider of digital banking solutions to a large network of financial institutions, and our expertise in delivering new, innovative, secure and regulatory-compliant digital solutions uniquely position us to capitalize on the new frontier in financial services. We currently intend to increase investments in technology innovation and software development as we enhance our solutions and platforms and increase or expand the number of solutions that we offer.\nWe believe that delivery of consistent, high-quality customer support is a significant driver of purchasing and renewal decisions of our prospects and customers. To develop and maintain a reputation for high-quality service, we seek to build deep relationships with our customers through our customer service organization, which we staff with personnel who are motivated by our common mission of using technology to help our customers succeed and who are knowledgeable with respect to the regulated and complex nature of the financial services industry. As our business grows, we currently intend to continue to invest in and grow our services and delivery organization to support our customers' needs and maintain our reputation.\nCOVID-19 Pandemic\nGlobal health concerns with respect to the COVID-19 pandemic and related government actions taken to reduce the spread of the virus have caused disruption to the macroeconomic environment, and the pandemic has significantly increased economic uncertainty and reduced economic activity, including consumer and business spending. While there has been significant economic recovery in certain markets due to broad vaccination availability, loosening of lock-down measures and business re-openings, the recovery is characterized by additional uncertainty as a result of the disruption caused by the pandemic, including supply chain constraints in many industries, significant price increases for certain goods and services, rapid increases in demand as economies re-open, increased employee attrition, skilled labor shortages, wage inflation and businesses and labor markets navigating how they will operate post-pandemic. The extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operational and financial performance will depend on future developments unknown and unpredictable at this time, including the continued duration, severity and spread of the pandemic, including new variants, related restrictions on travel and transportation and other actions that may be taken by governmental authorities, the predictability and success of any re-opening efforts, the impacts of the pandemic on labor markets, the impact to our customers, their End Users, our suppliers and partners, and other items identified under \"Risk Factors\" above. Based on the information available to us to date, we believe we have taken an informed, proactive and effective approach to addressing the direct known effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on us, our customers and other third parties on which we rely and that we have been able to effectively deliver and support our solutions for our customers utilizing numerous remote capabilities and channels.\nBeginning mid-March 2020, almost all of our employees transitioned to working remotely from home. Through mid-2021, we continued to operate with the vast majority of our employees working remotely. However, during the quarter ended June 30, 2021, we began allowing employees to return to onsite work on a limited, voluntary basis, subject to health and safety protocols. Effective November 1, 2021, we re-opened all of our U.S. facilities, and have provided each of our U.S. employees with the choice of either continuing to work remotely, working in a hybrid capacity (one or two days per week onsite) or fully returning to onsite attendance, with any onsite attendance subject to health and safety protocols. With the rapid spread of the Omicron variant in early 2022, we have instituted additional safety protocols for employees choosing to work onsite, and have strongly encouraged our employees to work remotely when possible until the Omicron surge has passed. As we navigate the reopening of our onsite facilities, we believe employee preferences between remote, hybrid and onsite attendance are likely to change over time, and we will continue to adapt our physical facilities and IT infrastructure to accommodate a safe and successful work experience for our onsite, hybrid and remote employees. Throughout the pandemic we believe our corporate culture, business model, customer relations, and technology and information technology infrastructure have effectively allowed our employees to substantially perform their roles whether remote, hybrid or onsite.\nWe also have performed additional due diligence with critical vendors and other third parties on which we rely to assess their responses to the COVID-19 pandemic and impacts on their operations and services. To date, we have not experienced any material adverse impacts from any of our vendors or other third parties on which we rely. We intend to continue to conduct enhanced due diligence on such vendors and third parties for the foreseeable future as the uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic continues to persist.\nWe also are continuing to conduct outreach to our customers and many prospective customers to assess their needs in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic and their own re-opening efforts and to seek to identify ways that we may assist them with our solutions and services. We believe the impacts of COVID-19 and related re-opening efforts on our existing and prospective customers present both challenges and opportunities. While we believe the pandemic and related re-opening efforts have increased the importance and prominence of digital financial solutions, the increased economic uncertainty, reduced economic activity, including consumer and business spending, and challenges associated with re-opening have resulted in delays in certain purchasing decisions and implementations during 2020 and 2021. During the second half of 2021, we observed an improved sales environment relative to 2020 and the first half of 2021, and we believe that for 2022 the sales environment and the timing of purchasing decisions and implementations by customers will similarly reflect an improvement relative to 2020 and the first half of 2021. However, the duration and impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic continue to be highly unpredictable and may continue to disrupt any seasonality trends that may otherwise typically be inherent in our historical operating results.\nDespite these challenges among customers, the usage by End Users of digital financial solutions has never been higher and we are making additional investments to enhance our technology infrastructure to support this heightened usage. We have seen increased online banking activity as a result of shelter-in-place and similar orders as well as spikes in logins as End Users check accounts for items such as government stimulus funds. We believe the challenges and opportunities posed by the COVID-19 pandemic have and will continue to cause financial institutions to increase their focus on maintaining and improving their digital financial services offerings.\nKey Operating Measures\nIn addition to the U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, measures described below in \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Components of Operating Results,\" we monitor the following operating measures to evaluate growth trends, plan investments and measure the effectiveness of our sales and marketing efforts.\nWhile we believe the pandemic and related re-opening efforts have increased the importance and prominence of digital financial solutions, the increased economic uncertainty, reduced economic activity, including consumer and business spending, and challenges associated with re-opening resulted in delays in certain purchasing decisions and implementations and contract terminations during 2020 and 2021. During the second half of 2021, we observed an improved sales environment relative to 2020 and the first half of 2021, and we believe that for 2022 the sales environment and the predictability of purchasing decisions and implementations by customers will similarly reflect an improvement relative to 2020 and the first half of 2021, and thus we will see positive impacts on the rate at which we add new Installed Customers, and with them new Registered Users and annualized recurring revenue, in each case as compared to these prior periods.\nInstalled Customers\nWe define Installed Customers as the number of customers on live implementations (or installations) of our digital banking platforms. The average size of our Installed Customers, measured in both Registered Users per Installed Customer and revenues per Installed Customer, has increased over time as our existing Installed Customers continue to add Registered Users and commercial account holders, buy more solutions from us, and as we add larger financial institutions to our Installed Customer base. The net rate at which we add Installed Customers varies based on our implementation capacity, the size and unique needs of our customers, the readiness of our customers to implement our solutions and customer attrition, including as a result of merger and acquisition activity among financial institutions. We had 448, 450 and 414 Installed Customers on our digital banking platform as of December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nRegistered Users\nWe define a Registered User as an individual related to an account holder of an Installed Customer on our consumer digital banking platform who has registered to use one or more of our solutions and has current access to use those solutions as of the last day of the reporting period presented. We generally price our consumer digital banking platform solutions based on the number of Registered Users, while our commercial digital banking platform solutions are based on the number of commercial account holders. As the number of Registered Users of our solutions increases, our revenues generally tend to grow. Our average number of Registered Users per Installed Customer grows as our existing digital banking platform customers add more Registered Users and as we add larger financial institutions to our Installed Customer base. We anticipate that the number of Registered Users will grow at a faster rate than our number of Installed Customers. The rate at which our customers add Registered Users vary significantly period-to-period based on the timing of our implementations of new customers, the timing of registration of new End Users and customers performing inactive account clean-up. We add new Registered Users through both organic growth from existing customers and from the addition of End Users from new Installed Customers. Our aggregate number of Registered Users is negatively impacted to the extent Installed Customers terminate all or a portion of their arrangements with us. Our Installed Customers had approximately 19.2 million, 17.8 million and 14.6 million Registered Users as of December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nNet Revenue Retention Rate\nWe believe that our ability to retain our customers and expand their use of our products and services over time is an indicator of the stability of our revenue base and the long-term value of our customer relationships. We assess our performance in this area using a metric we refer to as our net revenue retention rate, which we previously referred to as our revenue retention rate. We calculate our net revenue retention rate as the total revenues in a calendar year, excluding any revenues from acquired customers during such year, from customers who were implemented on any of our solutions as of December 31 of the prior year, expressed as a percentage of the total revenues during the prior year from the same group of customers. Our net revenue retention rate provides insight into the impact on current year revenues of: the number of new customers implemented on any of our solutions during the prior year; the timing of our implementation of those new customers in the prior year; growth in the number of End Users on such solutions and changes in their usage of such solutions; sales of new products and services to our existing customers during the current year, excluding any products or services resulting from businesses acquired during such year and customer attrition. The most significant drivers of changes in our net revenue retention rate each year have historically been the number of new customers in the prior year and the timing of our implementation of those new customers. The timing of our implementation of new customers in the prior year is significant because we do not start recognizing revenues from new customers until they are implemented. If implementations are weighted more heavily in the first or second half of the prior year, our net revenue retention rate will be lower or higher, respectively. In the first half of 2021, our implementations were weighted more heavily, and we expect to see a lower net revenue retention rate in 2022 as a result. Our use of net revenue retention rate has limitations as an analytical tool, and investors should not consider it in isolation. Other companies in our industry may calculate net revenue retention rate differently, which reduces its usefulness as a comparative measure. Our net revenue retention rate was 119%, 122%, and 120% for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nAnnualized Recurring Revenue\nWe believe Annualized Recurring Revenue, or ARR, provides important information about our future revenue potential, our ability to acquire new clients, and our ability to maintain and expand our relationship with existing clients. We calculate ARR as the annualized value of all recurring revenue recognized in the last month of the reporting period, with the exception of variable revenue in excess of contracted amounts for which we instead take the average monthly run rate of the trailing three months within that reporting period. Our ARR also includes the contracted minimums associated with all contracts in place at the end of the quarter that have not yet commenced, and revenue generated from Premier Services. Premier Services revenue is generated from select established customer relationships where we have engaged with the customer for more tailored, premium professional services resulting in a deeper and ongoing level of engagement with them, which we deem to be recurring in nature. ARR does not include revenue from professional services or other sources of revenue that are not deemed to be recurring in nature. ARR is not a forecast of future revenue, which can be impacted by contract start and end dates and renewal rates. ARR should be viewed independently of revenue and deferred revenue as ARR is an operating metric and is not intended to be combined with or replace these items. Our use of ARR has limitations as an analytical tool, and investors should not consider it in isolation. Other companies in our industry may calculate ARR differently, which reduces its usefulness as a comparative measure. Our ARR was $574.2 million, $464.2 million and $400.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nRevenue Churn\nWe utilize revenue churn, which we previously have referred to simply as churn, to monitor the satisfaction of our customers and evaluate the effectiveness of our business strategies. We define revenue churn as the amount of any monthly recurring revenue losses due to customer cancellations and downgrades, net of upgrades and additions of new solutions, during a year, divided by our monthly recurring revenue at the beginning of the year. Cancellations refer to customers that have either stopped using our services completely or remained a customer but terminated a particular service. Downgrades are a result of customers taking less of a particular service or renewing their contract for identical services at a lower price. We had annual revenue churn of 5.4%, 5.9%, and 5.1% for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. Our use of revenue churn has limitations as an analytical tool, and investors should not consider it in isolation. Other companies in our industry may calculate revenue churn differently, which reduces its usefulness as a comparative measure.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nIn addition to financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP, we use certain non-GAAP financial measures to clarify and enhance our understanding, and aid in the period-to-period comparison, of our performance. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide supplemental information that is meaningful when assessing our operating performance because they exclude the impact of certain categories that our management and board of directors do not consider part of core operating results when assessing our operational performance, allocating resources, preparing annual budgets and determining compensation. Accordingly, these non-GAAP financial measures may provide insight to investors into the motivation and decision-making of management in operating the business. Set forth in the tables below are the corresponding GAAP financial measures for each non-GAAP financial measure. Investors are encouraged to review the reconciliation of each of these non-GAAP financial measures to its most comparable GAAP financial measure included below. While we believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful supplemental information, non-GAAP financial measures have limitations and should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, their most comparable GAAP measures. These non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP, do not reflect a comprehensive system of accounting and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies due to potential differences in their financing and accounting methods, the book value of their assets, their capital structures, the method by which their assets were acquired and the manner in which they define non-GAAP measures. Items such as the deferred revenue reduction from purchase accounting, stock-based compensation, acquisition related costs, amortization of acquired technology, amortization of acquired intangible assets, partnership termination charges and unoccupied lease charges can have a material impact on our GAAP financial results.\nNon-GAAP Revenue\nWe define non-GAAP revenue as total revenue excluding the impact of purchase accounting. We monitor these measures to assess our performance because we believe our revenue growth rates would be understated without these adjustments. We believe presenting non-GAAP revenue aids in the comparability between periods and in assessing our overall operating performance.\nTable 15: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenue: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>GAAP revenue </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>498,720 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>402,751 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>315,484 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Deferred revenue reduction from purchase accounting </td> <td> </td> <td>2,129 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,404 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,829 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Non-GAAP revenue </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>500,849 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>407,155 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>317,313 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nNon-GAAP Operating Income\nWe provide non-GAAP operating income using non-GAAP revenue as discussed above and excluding such items as deferred revenue reduction from purchase accounting, stock-based compensation, acquisition related costs, amortization of acquired technology, amortization of acquired intangible assets, partnership termination charges and unoccupied lease charges. We believe excluding these items is useful for the following reasons:\n\u2022Deferred revenue reduction from purchase accounting. We provide non-GAAP information that excludes the deferred revenue reduction from purchase accounting. We believe that the exclusion of deferred revenue reduction from purchase accounting allows users of our financial statements to better review and understand the historical and current results of our continuing operations.\n\u2022Amortization of acquired technology and intangible assets. We provide non-GAAP information that excludes expenses related to purchased technology and intangible assets associated with our acquisitions. We believe that eliminating these expenses from our non-GAAP measures is useful to investors, because the amortization of acquired technology and intangible assets can be inconsistent in amount and frequency and significantly impacted by the timing and magnitude of our acquisition transactions, which also vary in frequency from period to period. Accordingly, we analyze the performance of our operations in each period without regard to such expenses.\n\u2022Stock-based compensation. We provide non-GAAP information that excludes expenses related to stock-based compensation. We believe that the exclusion of stock-based compensation expense provides for a better comparison of our operating results to prior periods and to our peer companies as the calculations of stock-based compensation vary from period to period and company to company due to different valuation methodologies, subjective assumptions and the variety of award types. Because of these unique characteristics of stock-based compensation, we exclude these expenses when analyzing the organization's business performance.\n\u2022Acquisition related costs. We exclude certain expense items resulting from our acquisitions, such as legal, accounting and consulting fees, changes in fair value of contingent consideration and retention expense. We consider these adjustments, to some extent, to be unpredictable and dependent on a significant number of factors that are outside of our control. Furthermore, acquisitions result in operating expenses that would not otherwise have been incurred by us in the normal course of our organic business operations. We believe that providing these non-GAAP measures that exclude acquisition related costs, allows users of our financial statements to better review and understand the historical and current results of our continuing operations, and also facilitates comparisons to our historical results and results of less acquisitive peer companies, both with and without such adjustments.\n\u2022Partnership termination charges. In the quarter ended June 30, 2020, in connection with the termination of a strategic partnership, we agreed to pay a termination fee of $5.6 million in May 2020 and $7.6 million in the third quarter of 2021. We are excluding the charges associated with this partnership termination as they are non-recurring in nature and would not otherwise have been incurred by us in the normal course of our organic business operations. We believe that providing these non-GAAP measures that exclude partnership termination charges allows users of our financial statements to better review and understand the historical and current results of our continuing operations, and also facilitates comparisons to our historical results and results of peer companies, both with and without such adjustments.\n\u2022Unoccupied lease charges. We provide non-GAAP information that excludes restructuring charges related to the estimated costs of exiting and terminating facility lease commitments, as they relate to our corporate restructuring and exit activities. These charges are inconsistent in amount and are significantly impacted by the timing and nature of these events. Therefore, although we may incur these types of expenses in the future, we believe that eliminating these charges for purposes of calculating the non-GAAP financial measures facilitates a more meaningful evaluation of our operating performance and comparisons to our past operating performance.\nTable 16: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>GAAP operating loss </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(77,995) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(99,833) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(66,746) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Deferred revenue reduction from purchase accounting </td> <td> </td> <td>2,129 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,404 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,829 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Stock-based compensation </td> <td> </td> <td>54,334 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>49,235 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>39,378 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Acquisition related costs </td> <td> </td> <td>3,099 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,408 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16,316 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of acquired technology </td> <td> </td> <td>21,969 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>21,341 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9,871 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of acquired intangibles </td> <td> </td> <td>17,901 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17,888 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,339 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Partnership termination charges </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13,244 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unoccupied lease charges </td> <td> </td> <td>2,008 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,181 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>420 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-GAAP operating income </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>23,445 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>9,868 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>7,407 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nAdjusted EBITDA\nWe define adjusted EBITDA as net loss before depreciation, amortization, stock-based compensation, certain costs related to our recent acquisitions, (benefit from) provision for income taxes, interest and other (income) expense, net, deferred revenue reduction from purchase accounting, partnership termination charges, loss on extinguishment of debt, and unoccupied lease charges. We believe that adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results for the following reasons:\n\u2022adjusted EBITDA is widely used by investors and securities analysts to measure a company's operating performance without regard to items that can vary substantially from company to company depending upon their financing, capital structures and the method by which assets were acquired;\n\u2022our management uses adjusted EBITDA in conjunction with GAAP financial measures for planning purposes, in the preparation of our annual operating budget, as a measure of our operating performance, to assess the effectiveness of our business strategies and to communicate with our board of directors concerning our financial performance;\n\u2022adjusted EBITDA provides more consistency and comparability with our past financial performance, facilitates period-to-period comparisons of our operations and also facilitates comparisons with other companies, many of which use similar non-GAAP financial measures to supplement their GAAP results; and\n\u2022our investor and analyst presentations include adjusted EBITDA as a supplemental measure of our overall operating performance.\nAdjusted EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to net loss or any other measure of financial performance calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. The use of adjusted EBITDA as an analytical tool has limitations such as:\n\u2022depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, and the assets being depreciated or amortized will often have to be replaced in the future and adjusted EBITDA does not reflect cash requirements for such replacements;\n\u2022adjusted EBITDA may not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs or contractual commitments;\n\u2022adjusted EBITDA does not reflect the potentially dilutive impact of stock-based compensation;\n\u2022adjusted EBITDA does not reflect interest or tax payments that could reduce cash available for use; and\n\u2022other companies, including companies in our industry, might calculate adjusted EBITDA or similarly titled measures differently, which reduces their usefulness as comparative measures.\nBecause of these and other limitations, you should consider adjusted EBITDA together with our GAAP financial measures including cash flow from operations and net loss. The following table presents a reconciliation of net loss to adjusted EBITDA for each of the periods indicated (in thousands):\nTable 17: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Reconciliation of net loss to adjusted EBITDA: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net loss </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(112,746) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(137,620) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(70,877) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization </td> <td> </td> <td>54,833 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>51,840 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>28,457 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Stock-based compensation expense </td> <td> </td> <td>54,334 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>49,235 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>39,378 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Acquisition related costs </td> <td> </td> <td>3,099 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,408 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16,316 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Benefit from) provision for income taxes </td> <td> </td> <td>1,643 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,416 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(12,487) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest and other (income) expense, net </td> <td> </td> <td>31,063 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>27,180 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16,572 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Deferred revenue reduction from purchase accounting </td> <td> </td> <td>2,129 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,404 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,829 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Partnership termination charges </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13,244 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss on extinguishment of debt </td> <td> </td> <td>1,513 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,932 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unoccupied lease charges </td> <td> </td> <td>2,008 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,181 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>420 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted EBITDA </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>37,876 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>22,220 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>19,608 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nComponents of Operating Results\nRevenues\nRevenue-generating activities directly relate to the sale, implementation and support of our solutions within a single operating segment. We derive the majority of our revenues from subscription fees for the use of our solutions hosted in either our data centers or with cloud-based services, transactional revenue from bill-pay solutions, and revenues for customer support and implementation services related to our solutions. We recognize the corresponding revenues over time on a ratable basis over the customer agreement term. A small portion of our revenues are derived from customers which host and manage our solutions on-premises or in third-party data centers under term license and maintenance agreements. We recognize the software license revenue once the customer obtains control of the license and the remaining arrangement consideration for maintenance revenue over time on a ratable basis over the term of the software license.\nSubscription fees are based on the number of solutions purchased by our customers, the number of End Users using the solutions and the number of bill-pay and certain other transactions those users conduct using our solutions in excess of the levels included in our standard subscription fee. Subscription fees are billed monthly, quarterly or annually and are recognized monthly over the term of our customer agreements. The initial term of our digital banking platform agreements averages over five years, although it varies by customer. The structure and terms of our newer lending arrangements vary, but generally are also sold on a subscription basis through our direct sales organization, and the related revenues are recognized over the terms of the customer agreements. The structure and terms of our Helix arrangements with FinTechs and Brands vary, but typically involve relatively lower contracted minimum revenues and instead emphasize usage-based revenue, with such revenue recognized as it is incurred. We begin recognizing subscription fees when the control of the service transfers to the customer, generally when the solution is implemented and made available to the customer. We recognize revenue for bill-pay transaction services generated when End Users utilize debit cards integrated with its Q2 CorePro API or Q2 Biller Direct products in the month incurred based on actual or estimated transactions. The timing of our implementations varies period-to-period based on our implementation capacity, the number of solutions purchased by our customers, the size and unique needs of our customers\nand the readiness of our customers to implement our solutions. We recognize any related implementation services revenues ratably over the initial customer agreement term beginning on the date we commence recognizing subscription fees. Contract asset balances arise primarily when we provide services in advance of billing for those services. Amounts that have been invoiced but not paid are recorded in accounts receivable or other long-term assets, depending on the timing of expected billing, and in revenues or deferred revenues, depending on when control of the service transfers to the customer.\nAs a result of the economic and operational impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our customers, in 2020 and 2021 our bookings, in particular with respect to new customer agreements, were adversely impacted relative to pre-pandemic levels. Specifically, we experienced delays and unpredictability in the purchasing decisions of our customers and prospective customers and a slowing of net new customer deals, relative to pre-pandemic levels, partially offset by an increase in cross sales of additional features and functionality to our existing customer base due to the increased utilization and demand for digital banking solutions caused by the decreased in-branch operations resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. However, during the second half of 2021, we observed an improved sales environment relative to 2020 and the first half of 2021. We believe that for 2022 the sales environment and the predictability of purchasing decisions and implementations by customers will similarly reflect an improvement relative to 2020 and the first half of 2021. However, our revenues for 2022 will continue to reflect the negative impacts from these prior periods and the duration and impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic continue to be highly unpredictable and may continue to disrupt any seasonality trends that may otherwise typically be inherent in our historical operating results.\nCost of Revenues\nCost of revenues is comprised primarily of salaries and other personnel-related costs, including employee benefits, bonuses and stock-based compensation, for employees providing services to our customers. This includes the costs of our personnel performing implementation, certain software development, customer support, data center and customer training activities. Cost of revenues also includes the direct costs of bill-pay and other third-party intellectual property included in our solutions, the amortization of deferred solution and services costs, co-location facility costs and depreciation of our data center assets, debit card related pass-through fees, cloud-based hosting services, an allocation of general overhead costs, the amortization of acquired technology, and referral fees. We allocate general overhead expenses to all departments based on the number of employees in each department, which we consider to be a fair and representative means of allocation.\nWe capitalize certain personnel costs directly related to the implementation of our solutions to the extent those costs are recoverable from future revenues. We amortize the costs for an implementation once revenue recognition commences, and we amortize those implementation costs to cost of revenues over the expected period of customer benefit, which has been determined to be the estimated life of the technology. Other costs not directly recoverable from future revenues are expensed in the period incurred.\nWe capitalize certain software development costs related to programmers, software engineers, quality control teams and third-party development costs for those who are directly associated with and who devote time to our software solutions on an individual product basis. Software development costs are amortized to cost of revenues when products, upgrades and enhancements are released or made available over the products' estimated economic lives.\nWe intend to continue to increase our investments in our implementation and customer support teams and technology infrastructure to serve our customers and support our growth. Over the long-term, we expect cost of revenues to continue to grow in absolute dollars as we grow our business, but to fluctuate as a percentage of revenues based principally on the level and timing of implementation support activities, debit card related pass-through fees, and other related costs, including during periods where revenues are lower or implementations are delayed due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nOperating Expenses\nOperating expenses consist of sales and marketing, research and development and general and administrative expenses. They also include costs related to our acquisitions and the resulting amortization of acquired intangible assets from those acquisitions. Over the long term, we intend to continue to hire new employees and make other investments to support our anticipated growth. As a result, we expect our operating expenses to increase in absolute dollars but to decrease as a percentage of revenues over the long term as we grow our business.\nThe uncertainties and risks posed by the continuing COVID-19 pandemic were considered while preparing our 2022 budget and hiring plans. Beginning in 2021, our hiring began to return to more normal levels, and we anticipate this trend to continue in 2022, with our hiring plans more closely resembling pre-pandemic levels. However, during the second half of 2021, we experienced an exceptionally challenging hiring environment and we expect to see continued intense competition for technical talent in 2022, which has the potential to drive increased inflation in the wages we have to pay to hire and retain qualified employees. Additionally, while throughout 2021 most of our employees continued to work remotely from home and we suspended most non-essential business travel and conference participation, we expect that in 2022 some of these activities,\nincluding costs associated with onsite attendance, will return. As a result, we anticipate that we will continue to see a gradual increase in certain costs associated with operating physical locations and facilitating employee travel during 2022. As we navigate the reopening of our onsite facilities, we believe employee preferences between remote, hybrid and onsite attendance are likely to change over time, and we will continue to adapt our physical facilities and IT infrastructure to accommodate a safe and successful work experience for our onsite, hybrid and remote employees.\nSales and Marketing\nSales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries and other personnel-related costs, including commissions, employee benefits, bonuses and stock-based compensation. Sales and marketing expenses also include expenses related to advertising, lead generation, promotional event programs, corporate communications, travel and allocated overhead.\nSales and marketing expenses as a percentage of total revenues will change in any given period based on several factors including the addition of newly hired sales professionals, the number and timing of newly-installed customers and the amount of sales commissions expense amortized related to those customers, including during periods where revenues are lower or implementations are delayed due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Commissions are generally capitalized and then amortized over the expected period of customer benefit.\nResearch and Development\nWe believe that continuing to improve and enhance our solutions is essential to maintaining our reputation for innovation and growing our customer base and revenues. Research and development expenses include salaries and personnel-related costs, including employee benefits, bonuses and stock-based compensation, third-party contractor expenses, software development costs, allocated overhead and other related expenses incurred in developing new solutions and enhancing existing solutions.\nCertain research and development costs that are related to our software development, which include salaries and other personnel-related costs, including employee benefits and bonuses attributed to programmers, software engineers and quality control teams working on our software solutions, are capitalized and are included in intangible assets, net on the consolidated balance sheets.\nGeneral and Administrative\nGeneral and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and other personnel-related costs, including employee benefits, bonuses and stock-based compensation, of our administrative, finance and accounting, information systems, legal and human resources employees. General and administrative expenses also include consulting and professional fees, insurance and travel. We expect to continue to incur incremental expenses associated with the growth of our business and to meet increased compliance requirements associated with operating as a regulated, public company.\nAcquisition Related Costs\nAcquisition related costs include compensation expenses related to milestone provisions and retention agreements with certain former shareholders and employees of acquired businesses, which are recognized as earned, changes in fair value of the contingent consideration related to potential acquisition earnout payments and various legal and professional service expenses incurred in connection with the acquisitions, which are recognized when incurred.\nAmortization of Acquired Intangibles\nAmortization of acquired intangibles represents the amortization of intangibles recorded in connection with our business acquisitions which are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the related assets.\nPartnership Termination Charges\nPartnership termination charges represent the fees paid related to termination of a strategic partnership during the quarter ended June 30, 2020. These charges are non-recurring in nature and would not otherwise have been incurred by us in the normal course of our organic business operations.\nUnoccupied Lease Charges\nUnoccupied lease charges include costs related to the early vacating of certain facilities, partially offset by anticipated sublease income from the associated facilities.\nTotal Other Income (Expense), Net\nTotal other income (expense), net, consists primarily of interest income and expense, other non-operating income and expense, loss on disposal of long-lived assets, foreign currency translation adjustment and loss on extinguishment of debt. We earn interest income on our cash, cash equivalents and investments. Interest expense consists primarily of the interest from the amortization of debt discount, issuance costs, and coupon interest attributable to our convertible notes issued in February 2018, or 2023 Notes, our convertible notes issued in June 2019, or 2026 Notes, and our convertible notes issued in November 2020, or 2025 Notes, as well as fees and interest associated with the letter of credit issued to our landlord for the security deposit for our corporate headquarters.\nBenefit from (Provision for) Income Taxes\nAs a result of our current net operating loss position, current income tax expenses and benefits consist primarily of state income tax expense, deferred income tax expense relating to the tax amortization of recently acquired goodwill, and income tax expense from foreign operations. We incurred state and foreign income taxes for each of the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019. Our net operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax purposes were $633.8 million and $536.5 million at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, which $201.2 million will expire at various dates beginning in 2026, if not utilized, and $432.6 million have an indefinite carryforward period. Federal net operating losses generated during and after the year ended December 31, 2018 will have an indefinite carryforward period. We also held state tax credit carry overs of $3.0 million and $2.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and federal R&D tax credit carry overs of $8.9 million and $8.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The state tax credits will begin to expire 2033 if not utilized and the federal R&D tax credits will begin to expire in 2036, if not utilized.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates\nOur management's discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses. In accordance with GAAP, we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results might differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nOur significant accounting policies are described in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, and we believe that the accounting policies discussed below involve the greatest degree of complexity and exercise of significant judgments and estimates by our management. The methods, estimates and judgments that we use in applying our accounting policies have a significant impact on our results of operations and, accordingly, we believe the policies described below are the most critical for understanding and evaluating our financial condition and results of operations.\nRevenue Recognition\nRevenues are recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to our customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services over the term of the agreement, generally when our solutions are implemented and made available to our customers. The promised consideration may include fixed amounts, variable amounts or both. Revenues are recognized net of sales credits and allowances.\nRevenue-generating activities are directly related to the sale, implementation and support of our solutions within a single operating segment. We derive the majority of our revenues from subscription fees for the use of our solutions hosted in either our data centers or cloud-based hosting services, transactional revenue from bill-pay solutions and revenues for customer support and implementation services related to our solutions.\nSubscription Revenues\nOur software solutions are available for use as hosted application arrangements under subscription fee agreements without licensing perpetual rights to the software. Subscription fees from these applications, including contractual periodic price increases, are recognized over time on a ratable basis over the customer agreement term beginning on the date our solution is made available to the customer. Amounts that have been invoiced are recorded in accounts receivable and deferred revenues or revenues, depending on whether the revenue recognition criteria have been met. Periodic price increases are estimated at contract inception and result in contract assets as revenue recognition may exceed the amount billed early in the contract. Additional fees for monthly usage above the levels included in the standard subscription fee are recognized as revenue in the month when the usage amounts are determined and reported.\nA small portion of our customers host and manage our solutions on-premises or in third-party data centers under term license and maintenance agreements. Term licenses sold with maintenance entitle the customer to technical support, upgrades and updates to the software on a when-and-if-available basis. We recognize software license revenue once the customer obtains control of the license, which generally occurs at the start of each license term. We recognize the remaining arrangement consideration for maintenance revenue over time on a ratable basis over the term of the software license. If the expected length of time between when we transfer the software license to the customer and when the customer pays for it results in a significant financing component, we adjust the promised amount of consideration for the effects of the time value of money, which reflects the price the customer would have paid when the license was transferred. Revenues from term licenses and maintenance agreements and the related financing component were not significant in the periods presented.\nTransactional Revenues\nWe generate the majority of our transactional revenues based on the number of bill-pay transactions that End Users initiate on our digital banking platform. We also generate a smaller portion of our transactional revenues from interchange fees generated when End Users utilize debit cards integrated with our Q2 CorePro API or Q2 Biller Direct products. We recognize revenue for bill-pay transaction services in the month incurred based on actual or estimated transactions.\nServices and Other Revenues\nImplementation services are required for each new digital banking and lending platform and Centrix standalone contract, and there is a significant level of integration and configuration for each customer. Our revenue for upfront implementation services is billed upfront and generally recognized over time on a ratable basis over the customer agreement term for our hosted application agreements. Upfront implementation services for on-premises agreements are recognized at commencement date. Under certain circumstances, we partner with third-party professional system integrators to support the installation and configuration process for certain products, and therefore, we have determined that these services qualify as a separate performance obligation in certain markets and geographies, and the implementation services for these agreements are recognized over time as services are performed.\nProfessional services revenues, which primarily consist of training, advisory services, core conversion services, web design, and other general professional services, are generally billed and recognized when delivered.\nCertain out-of-pocket expenses billed to customers are recorded as revenues rather than an offset to the related expense.\nSignificant Judgments\nPerformance Obligations and Standalone Selling Price\nA performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct good or service to the customer and is the unit of accounting. Determining whether products and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately versus together may require significant judgment. We have contracts with customers that often include multiple performance obligations, usually including multiple subscription and implementation services. For these contracts, we account for individual performance obligations that are separately identifiable by allocating the contract's total transaction price to each performance obligation in an amount based on the relative standalone selling price, or SSP, of each distinct good or service in the contract. In determining whether implementation services are distinct from subscription services, we considered various factors including the significant level of integration, interdependency, and interrelation between the implementation and subscription service, as well as the inability of the customer's personnel or other service providers to perform significant portions of the services. We have concluded that the implementation services included in contracts with multiple performance obligations in the North American banking market are not distinct and, as a result, we defer any arrangement fees for implementation services and recognize such amounts over time on a ratable basis as one performance obligation with the underlying subscription revenue for the initial agreement term of the hosted application agreements. We have concluded that outside the North American banking market, the implementation services for our lending platform included in contracts with multiple performance obligations are distinct and, as a result, we recognize implementation fees on such arrangements over time as services are performed.\nThe majority of our revenue recognized at a particular point in time is for usage revenue and on-premise software licenses. These services are recognized at the point in time in which the customer obtains control of the asset, which is generally upon completion of the service or the point the customer obtained control of the software.\nJudgment is required to determine the SSP for each distinct performance obligation. A contract's transaction price is allocated to each distinct performance obligation and recognized as revenue when, or as, the performance obligation is satisfied. The primary method used to estimate SSP is the adjusted market assessment approach, which considers its overall pricing objectives, market conditions and other factors, including the value of our contracts, our discounting practices, the size and volume of our transactions, customer characteristics, price lists, go-to-market strategy, historical standalone sales and agreement prices, and the number and types of users within our contracts.\nVariable Consideration\nWe recognize usage revenue related to bill-pay transactions that End Users initiate on our digital banking platform and interchange fees that End Users generate using our solutions. Judgment is required to determine the accounting for these types of revenue. We consider various factors including the degree to which usage is interdependent or interrelated to past services, costs to us per user over the contract, and contractual price per user changes and their relationship to market terms, forecasted data, and our cost to fulfill the obligation. We have concluded that our usage revenue relates specifically to the transfer of the service to the customer and is consistent with the allocation objective of Topic 606 when considering all of the performance obligations and payment terms in the contract. Therefore, we recognize usage revenue on a monthly or quarterly basis in accordance with the agreement, as determined and reported. This allocation reflects the amount we expect to receive for the services for the given period.\nWe sometimes provide credits or incentives to our customers. Known and estimable credits and incentives represent a form of variable consideration, which are estimated at contract inception and generally result in reductions to revenues recognized for a particular contract. These estimates are updated at the end of each reporting period as additional information becomes available. We believe that there will not be significant changes to our estimates of variable consideration as of December 31, 2021.\nOther Considerations\nWe evaluate whether we are the principal (i.e., report revenues on a gross basis) or agent (i.e., report revenues on a net basis) with respect to the vendor reseller agreements pursuant to which we resell certain third-party solutions along with our solutions. Generally, we report revenues from these types of contracts on a gross basis, meaning the amounts billed to customers are recorded as revenues, and expenses incurred are recorded as cost of revenues. Where we are the principal, we first obtain control of the inputs to the specific good or service and direct their use to create the combined output. Our control is evidenced by our involvement in the integration of the good or service on our platform before it is transferred to our customers and is further supported by us being primarily responsible to our customers and having a level of discretion in establishing pricing. Revenues provided from agreements in which we are an agent are insignificant.\nDeferred Revenues\nDeferred revenues primarily consist of amounts that have been billed to or received from customers in advance of revenue recognition and prepayments received from customers in advance for implementation, maintenance and other services, as well as initial subscription fees. We recognize deferred revenues as revenues when the services are performed and the corresponding revenue recognition criteria are met. Customer prepayments are generally applied against invoices issued to customers when services are performed and billed.\nOur payment terms vary by the type and location of our customer and the products or services offered. The period of time between invoicing and when payment is due is not significant. For certain products or services and customer types, we require payment before the products or services are delivered to the customer.\nDeferred Implementation Costs\nWe capitalize certain personnel and other costs, such as employee salaries, stock-based compensation, benefits and the associated payroll taxes that are direct and incremental to the implementation of our solutions. We analyze implementation costs that may be capitalized to assess their recoverability, and only capitalize costs that we anticipate to be recoverable through the terms of the associated contract. We begin amortizing the deferred implementation costs for an implementation to cost of revenues once the revenue recognition criteria have been met, and we amortize those deferred implementation costs ratably over the expected period of customer benefit, which has been determined to be the estimated life of the technology, which we estimate to be five to seven years. We determined the period of benefit by considering factors such as historically high renewal rates with similar customers and contracts, initial contract length, an expectation that there will still be a demand for the product at the end of its term, and the significant costs to switch to a competitor's product, all of which are governed by the estimated useful life of the technology. We monitor deferred implementation costs for impairment and record impairment when customers terminate or allow services to lapse, due to contract modifications, and/or from other assessments as needed. Any impairment losses identified are recognized in the form of an expense acceleration with the applicable amount recorded to deferred implementation costs, current portion and/or deferred implementation costs, net of current portion on the consolidated balance sheet and in cost of revenues in the consolidated statements of comprehensive loss.\nThe portion of deferred implementation costs expected to be amortized during the succeeding twelve-month period is recorded in current assets as deferred implementation costs, current portion, and the remainder is recorded in long-term assets as deferred implementation costs, net of current portion on the consolidated balance sheets.\nDeferred Solution and Other Costs\nWe capitalize sales commissions and other third-party costs such as third-party licenses and maintenance related to our customer agreements. We capitalize sales commissions because the commission expenses are considered incremental and recoverable costs of obtaining a contract with a customer. We capitalize commissions and bonuses for those involved in the sale, including direct employees and indirect supervisors, as these are incremental to the sale. Historically, we typically paid commissions in two increments. The initial payment was made after the contract had been executed and the initial deposit had been received from the customer, and the final payment was made upon commencement date. We required that an individual remain employed to collect a commission when it was due. The service period between the first and second payment was considered to be a substantive service period and as a result, we expensed the final payment when made. Beginning in 2020, substantially all commissions were paid in a single payment once the contract had been executed and the initial deposit had been received from the customer. We begin amortizing deferred solution and other costs for a particular customer agreement once the revenue recognition criteria are met and amortize those deferred costs over the expected period of customer benefit, which has been determined to be the estimated life of the technology, which we estimate to be five to seven years. We determined the period of benefit by considering factors such as historically high renewal rates with similar customers and contracts, initial contract length, an expectation that there will still be a demand for the product at the end of its term, and the significant costs to switch to a competitor's product, all of which are governed by the estimated useful life of the technology.\nWe analyze capitalized solution and other costs to assess their recoverability. The portion of capitalized costs expected to be amortized during the succeeding twelve-month period is recorded in current assets as deferred solution and other costs, current portion, and the remainder is recorded in long-term assets as deferred solution and other costs, net of current portion.\nContract Balances\nThe timing of revenue recognition, billings and cash collections can result in billed accounts receivable, unbilled receivables or contract assets, and deferred revenues, or contract liabilities. Billings scheduled to occur after the performance obligation has been satisfied and revenue recognition has occurred result in contract assets. Contract assets that are expected to be billed during the succeeding twelve-month period are recorded in contract assets, current portion, and the remaining portion is recorded in contract assets, net of current portion on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets at the end of each reporting period. A contract liability results when we receive prepayments or deposits from customers in advance for implementation, maintenance and other services, as well as initial subscription fees. Customer prepayments are generally applied against invoices issued to customers when services are performed and billed. We recognize contract liabilities as revenues when the services are performed, and the corresponding revenue recognition criteria are met. Contract liabilities that are expected to be recognized as revenues during the succeeding twelve-month period are recorded in deferred revenues, current portion, and the remaining portion is recorded in deferred revenues, net of current portion, on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets at the end of each reporting period.\nWe are exposed to credit losses primarily through sales of products and services. We assess the collectability of outstanding contract assets on an ongoing basis and maintain a reserve which is included in the allowance for credit losses for contract assets deemed uncollectible. We analyze the contract asset portfolio for significant risks by considering historical collection experience and forecasting future collectability to determine the amount of revenues that will ultimately be collected from our customers. Customer type has been identified as the primary specific risk affecting the company's contract assets, and the estimate for losses is analyzed quarterly and adjusted as necessary. Future collectability is contingent upon current and anticipated macroeconomic conditions that could impact our customers such as unemployment, inflation and regulatory matters. Additionally, specific allowance amounts may be established to record the appropriate provision for customers that have a higher probability of default.\nAccounts Receivable\nAccounts receivable are stated at net realizable value, including both billed and unbilled receivables to customers. Unbilled receivable balances arise primarily when we provide services in advance of billing for those services. Generally, billing for revenues related to the number of End Users and the number of transactions processed by our End Users that are included in our minimum subscription fee occurs in the month the revenue is recognized, resulting in accounts receivable. Billing for revenues relating to the number of End Users and the number of transactions processed by our End Users that are in excess of our minimum subscription fees are, generally, billed in the month following the month the revenues were earned, resulting in an unbilled receivable.\nWe assess the collectability of outstanding accounts receivable on an ongoing basis and maintain an allowance for credit losses for accounts receivable deemed uncollectible. We analyze the accounts receivable portfolio for significant risks and consider prior periods and forecast future collectability to determine the amount of revenues that will ultimately be collected from our customers. This estimate is analyzed quarterly and adjusted as necessary. Identified risks pertaining to our accounts receivable include the delinquency level and customer type. Future collectability is contingent upon current and anticipated macroeconomic conditions that could impact our customers such as unemployment, inflation and regulation matters. Due to the short-term nature of such receivables, the estimate of the amount of accounts receivable that may not be collected is based on aging of the accounts receivable balances and the financial condition of customers. Historically, our collection experience has not varied significantly, and bad debt expenses have been insignificant.\nWe maintain a reserve for estimated sales credits issued to customers for billing disputes or other service-related reasons. This allowance is recorded as a reduction against current period revenues and accounts receivable. In estimating this allowance, we analyze prior periods to determine the amounts of sales credits issued to customers compared to the revenues in the period that related to the original customer invoice. This estimate is analyzed semi-annually and adjusted as necessary.\nStock-Based Compensation\nStock options, restricted stock units, and market stock units awarded to employees, directors, and consultants are measured at fair value at each grant date. We do not use a forfeiture rate to recognize compensation expense. Generally, options vest 25% on the one-year anniversary of the grant date with the balance vesting monthly over the following 36 months, and restricted stock unit awards vest in four annual installments of 25% each. Market stock units are performance-based awards that vest based on our stockholder return relative to the total stockholder return of the Russell 2000 Index, or Index. Market stock units granted prior to fiscal 2021 vest over a three-year period on the anniversary of the date of grant, generally with up to one-third of the target shares of our common stock subject to each market stock unit award eligible to be earned after the first and second years and up to 200% of the full target number of shares subject to each market stock unit award eligible to be earned after the completion of the three-year performance period (less any shares earned for years one and two) based on the average price of our common stock relative to the Index during the performance period. Beginning in March 2021, newly granted market stock units vest over a two-year and three-year period, each running from approximately the date of grant, with up to one-third of the target shares of our common stock subject to each market stock unit award eligible to be earned after completion of the two-year performance period and up to 200% of the full target number of shares subject to each market stock unit award eligible to be earned after the completion of the three-year performance period (less any shares earned for the two-year performance period) based on the average price of our common stock relative to the Index during the performance period. From time to time, we may make grants of restricted stock units or market stock units with vesting formulas that vary from those described above.\nWe value stock options using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, which requires the input of subjective assumptions, including the risk-free interest rate, expected life, expected stock price volatility and dividend yield. The risk-free interest rate assumption is based upon observed interest rates for constant maturity U.S. Treasury securities consistent with the expected term of our employee stock options. The expected life represents the time the stock options are expected to be outstanding and is based on the simplified method. Under the simplified method, the expected life of an option is presumed to be the mid-point between the vesting date and end of the contractual term. We use the simplified method due to the lack of sufficient historical exercise data to provide a reasonable basis upon which to otherwise estimate the expected life of the stock options. Expected volatility is based on historical volatilities for publicly traded stock of comparable companies over the estimated expected life of the stock options. We assume no dividend yield because we do not expect to pay dividends in the near future, which is consistent with our history of not paying dividends. We recognize compensation expense ratably over the requisite service period of the stock option award.\nWe value restricted stock units at the closing market price on the date of grant and recognize compensation expense ratably over the requisite service period of the restricted stock unit award.\nWe estimate the fair value of market stock units on the date of grant using a Monte Carlo simulation model. The determination of fair value of the market stock units is affected by our stock price and a number of assumptions including the expected volatility and the risk-free interest rate. Our expected volatility at the date of grant was based on the historical volatilities of our stock and peer firms' stocks and the Index over the performance period. We assume no dividend yield and recognize compensation expense ratably over the performance period of the market stock unit award. We recognize compensation expense using the graded attribution method on a straight-line basis over the performance period for each market stock unit award.\nConvertible Senior Notes\nIn February 2018, we issued $230.0 million principal amount of convertible senior notes due in February 2023, or the 2023 Notes. In June 2019, we issued $316.3 million principal amount of convertible senior notes due in June 2026, or the 2026 Notes. In November 2020, we issued $350.0 million principal amount of convertible senior notes due in November 2025, or the 2025 Notes. This was achieved by exchanging $181.9 million principal amount of the 2023 Notes for $210.7 million principal amount of the 2025 Notes and issuing an additional $139.3 million of new notes. In May 2021, the Company repurchased $37.1 million principal amount of the 2023 Notes. As of December 31, 2021, the aggregate principal amount outstanding related to the 2023 Notes was $10.9 million.\nWhen accounting for the issuance of convertible notes, we separate each of the convertible notes into liability and equity components. The carrying amount of the liability component is calculated by measuring the fair value, as of the date of issuance, of a similar debt without the conversion feature. The carrying amount of the equity component representing the conversion feature is determined by deducting the fair value of the liability components from the total initial proceeds. The difference between the par amount of the convertible notes and the carrying amount of the liability component represents debt discounts that are amortized to interest expense over the respective terms of the convertible notes using the effective interest rate method. The equity components are not remeasured as long as they continue to meet the conditions for equity classification. In accounting for the issuance costs related to its convertible notes, we allocate the total amount of issuance costs incurred to liability and equity components based on their relative values. Issuance costs attributable to the liability components are amortized to interest expense over the respective terms of the convertible notes using the effective interest rate method. The issuance costs attributable to the equity components were netted against the respective equity components in additional paid-in capital.\nWhen accounting for an exchange of convertible notes, we evaluate whether the transaction should be evaluated as a modification or extinguishment transaction. The partial exchange of the 2023 Notes and issuance of the 2025 Notes in November 2020 were deemed to have substantially different terms due to the significant difference between the value of the conversion option immediately prior to and after the exchange, and consequently, the 2023 Notes partial exchange was accounted for as a debt extinguishment. In an exchange or repurchase transaction, we will allocate a portion of the settlement consideration to the reacquisition of the liability component, which is equal to the fair value of that component immediately prior to the extinguishment, and allocate the remaining settlement consideration to the reacquisition of the equity component and recognize that amount as a reduction of additional paid in capital. The difference between the consideration attributed to the liability component and the sum of the net carrying amount of the liability component and any unamortized debt issuance costs is recognized as a gain or loss on debt extinguishment in our consolidated statements of comprehensive loss.\nPurchase Price Allocation, Intangible Assets and Goodwill\nThe purchase price allocation for business combinations and asset acquisitions requires extensive use of accounting estimates and judgments to allocate the purchase price to the identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their respective fair values. We determine whether substantially all the fair value of the gross assets acquired is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or a group of similar identifiable assets. If this threshold is met, the single asset or group of assets, as applicable, is not a business. If it is not met, we determine whether the single asset or group of assets, as applicable, meets the definition of a business.\nIn connection with our business combinations, we recorded certain intangible assets, including acquired technology, customer relationships, trademarks and non-compete agreements. Amounts allocated to the acquired intangible assets are being amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives. We periodically review the estimated useful lives and fair values of our identifiable intangible assets, taking into consideration any events or circumstances which might result in a diminished fair value or revised useful life.\nThe excess purchase price over the fair value of assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. We test goodwill for impairment annually in October, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate an impairment may have occurred. Because we operate as a single reporting unit, the impairment test is performed at the consolidated entity level by comparing the estimated fair value of the company to the carrying value of the company. We estimate the fair value of the reporting unit using a \"step one\" analysis using a fair-value-based approach based on the market capitalization or a discounted cash flow analysis of projected future results to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. Determining the fair value of goodwill is subjective in nature and often involves the use of estimates and assumptions including, without limitation, use of estimates of future prices and volumes for our products, capital needs, economic trends and other factors which are inherently difficult to forecast. If actual results, or the plans and estimates used in future impairment analyses are lower than the original estimates used to assess the recoverability of these assets, we could incur impairment charges in a future period. The annual impairment test was performed as of October 31, 2021. No impairment of goodwill was identified during 2021.\nSoftware Development Costs\nWe capitalize certain software development costs under accounting frameworks that differ based on the nature of the software. Software development costs include salaries and other personnel-related costs, including employee benefits, stock-based compensation and bonuses attributed to programmers, software engineers, quality control teams and third-party development costs for those who are directly associated with and who devote time to our software solutions. Costs incurred in the preliminary stages of development and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred. Capitalized software development costs are computed on an individual product basis. We also capitalize certain costs related to specific upgrades and enhancements when it is probable the expenditures will result in significant additional functionality. Capitalization ceases for products, upgrades and enhancements when released or made available. Internal-use software is amortized to cost of revenues over the products' estimated economic lives, which are expected to be three to five years. The costs related to software development are included in intangible assets, net on the consolidated balance sheets.\nWe capitalize certain development costs associated with software that is to be sold, leased or otherwise marketed that are incurred between reaching technological feasibility of a solution and the point at which the solution is ready for general release.\nWe capitalize certain development costs associated with internal use software and our SaaS platform, incurred during the application development stage. We expense costs associated with preliminary project phase activities, training, maintenance and any post-implementation costs as incurred.\nIncome Taxes\nDeferred income taxes are provided for the tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and their respective tax bases and operating loss carryforwards and credits using enacted tax rates expected to be in effect in the years in which the differences are expected to reverse. We assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be realized and recognize a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. This assessment requires judgment as to the likelihood and amounts of future taxable income by tax jurisdiction. To date, we have provided a valuation allowance against most of our deferred tax assets as we believe the objective and verifiable evidence of our historical pretax net losses outweighs any positive evidence of our forecasted future results. We will continue to monitor the positive and negative evidence, and we will adjust the valuation allowance as sufficient objective positive evidence becomes available.\nWe evaluate our uncertain tax positions based on a determination of whether and how much of a tax benefit taken by us in our tax filings or positions is more likely than not to be realized. We believe we have accrued adequate reserves related to our uncertain tax positions; however, ultimate determination of our liability is subject to audit by taxing authorities in the ordinary course of business. We record interest and penalties associated with any uncertain tax positions as a component of income tax expense.\nResults of Operations\nConsolidated Statements of Operations\nThe following table sets forth our consolidated statements of operations data for each of the periods indicated (in thousands):\nTable 18: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenues(1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>498,720 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>402,751 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>315,484 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of revenues(2)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>273,685 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>228,152 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>162,485 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross profit </td> <td> </td> <td>225,035 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>174,599 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>152,999 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating expenses: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Sales and marketing </td> <td> </td> <td>85,564 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>72,323 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>63,947 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Research and development </td> <td> </td> <td>116,952 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>97,381 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>76,273 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General and administrative </td> <td> </td> <td>77,915 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>70,937 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>56,739 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Acquisition related costs </td> <td> </td> <td>2,690 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>478 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16,027 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of acquired intangibles </td> <td> </td> <td>17,901 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17,888 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,339 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Partnership termination charges </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13,244 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unoccupied lease charges(3)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>2,008 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,181 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>420 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total operating expenses </td> <td> </td> <td>303,030 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>274,432 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>219,745 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss from operations </td> <td> </td> <td>(77,995) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(99,833) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(66,746) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total other income (expense), net(4)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>(33,108) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(36,371) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(16,618) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss before income taxes </td> <td> </td> <td>(111,103) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(136,204) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(83,364) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Benefit from (provision for) income taxes </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,643) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,416) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12,487 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net loss </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(112,746) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(137,620) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(70,877) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table> ______________________________________________________________________________\n(1) Includes deferred revenue reduction from purchase accounting of $2.1 million, $4.4 million and $1.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\n(2) Includes amortization of acquired technology of $22.0 million, $21.3 million and $9.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\n(3) Unoccupied lease charges include costs related to the early vacating of various facilities, partially offset by anticipated sublease income from these facilities.

A discussion regarding year-to-year comparisons between the year ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 can be found under Item 7 in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020.\nRevenues\nThe following table presents our revenues for each of the periods indicated (dollars in thousands):\nTable 20: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> </td> <td>(%) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenues </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>498,720 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>402,751 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>95,969 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>23.8 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nYear Ended December 31, 2021 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2020. Revenues increased by $96.0 million, or 23.8%, from $402.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 to $498.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. This increase was primarily attributable to a $82.7 million increase from the sale of additional solutions to new and existing customers and growth in End Users from new and existing customers. In addition, $13.2 million of the increase was generated from an increase in the number of transactions processed using our solutions.\nCost of Revenues\nThe following table presents our cost of revenues for each of the periods indicated (dollars in thousands):\nTable 21: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> </td> <td>(%) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cost of revenues </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>273,685 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>228,152 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>45,533 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>20.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Percentage of revenues </td> <td> </td> <td>54.9 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>56.6 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nYear Ended December 31, 2021 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2020.

This increase was attributable to a $19.8 million increase in personnel costs due to an increase in the number of personnel who provide implementation and customer support services and maintain our data centers and other technical infrastructure, a $15.6 million increase in co-location facility costs and depreciation for our data center assets resulting from the increased infrastructure necessary to support our growing customer base, a $10.9 million increase in third-party costs related to intellectual property included in our solutions, transaction processing costs incurred as a result of the increase in End Users from new and existing customers, a higher mix of debit card related pass-through fees, as well as implementation and support personnel expenses that are reimbursable from our customers, and a $0.6 million increase from amortization of acquired customer technology resulting from the business acquired in the second quarter of 2021. These increases were partially offset by a $1.8 million decrease from amortization of capitalized implementation services.\nWe defer certain personnel and other costs directly related to the implementation of our solutions to the extent those costs are recoverable from future revenues. However, a substantial portion of our implementation costs are not eligible for deferral and, as a result, are expensed in the period incurred. Costs related to implementations that have been deferred are amortized over the expected period of customer benefit. Additionally, we invest in personnel, business processes and systems infrastructure to standardize our business processes and drive future efficiency in our implementations, customer support and data center operations. We expect these investments will increase cost of revenues in absolute dollars as we continue to make investments in capacity, process improvement and systems infrastructure, and we expect such expenses to decline as a percentage of revenue as our operations continue to scale and revenues grow.\nOperating Expenses\nThe following tables present our operating expenses for each of the periods indicated (dollars in thousands):\nSales and Marketing\nTable 22: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> </td> <td>(%) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Sales and marketing </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>85,564 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>72,323 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>13,241 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18.3 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Percentage of revenues </td> <td> </td> <td>17.2 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>18.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nYear Ended December 31, 2021 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2020. Sales and marketing expenses increased by $13.2 million, or 18.3%, from $72.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 to $85.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. This increase was primarily attributable to a $10.7 million increase in personnel costs due to the growth of our sales and marketing organizations to support bookings and revenue growth and a $2.0 million increase in other discretionary expenses, including stadium sponsorship expenses.\nWe anticipate that sales and marketing expenses will continue to increase in absolute dollars in the future as we add personnel to support our revenue growth and as we increase marketing spend to attract new customers, retain and grow existing customers and build brand awareness. While we anticipate sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenue may fluctuate on a quarter-over-quarter basis, we expect such expenses to decline as a percentage of our revenues over the longer-term as our revenues grow.\nResearch and Development\nTable 23: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> </td> <td>(%) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Research and development </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>116,952 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>97,381 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>19,571 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>20.1 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Percentage of revenues </td> <td> </td> <td>23.5 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>24.2 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nYear Ended December 31, 2021 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2020. Research and development expenses increased by $19.6 million, or 20.1%, from $97.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 to $117.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. This increase was primarily attributable to a $17.2 million increase in personnel costs as a result of the growth in our research and development organization to support continued enhancements to our solutions, a $4.1 million increase overhead costs, and a $0.4 million increase in other discretionary expenses. These increases were partially offset by a $2.4 million decrease in expenses as a result of increased capitalized software development costs.\nWe anticipate that research and development expenses will increase in absolute dollars in the future as we continue to support and expand our platform and enhance our existing solutions, as we believe existing customers will have an increased focus on maintaining and improving their digital banking offerings, including functionality such as digital account opening and online lending.\nGeneral and Administrative\nTable 24: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> </td> <td>(%) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General and administrative </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>77,915 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>70,937 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>6,978 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9.8 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Percentage of revenues </td> <td> </td> <td>15.6 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>17.6 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nYear Ended December 31, 2021 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2020. General and administrative expenses increased by $7.0 million, or 9.8%, from $70.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 to $77.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily attributable to an $8.2 million increase in personnel costs to support the growth of our business and a $0.7 million increase in professional services for legal and compliance fees. These increases were partially offset by a $1.0 million decrease in bad debt expense due to additional credit losses from the adoption of ASU 2016-13 in 2020 and a $0.5 million decrease for price concessions given to customers in 2020.\nGeneral and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and other personnel-related costs of our administrative, finance and accounting, information systems, legal and human resources employees. General and administrative expenses also include costs to comply with regulations governing public companies and financial institutions, costs of directors' and officers' liability insurance, investor relations activities and costs to comply with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, or SOX. Over the long term, we anticipate that general and administrative expenses will continue to increase in absolute dollars as we continue to incur both increased external audit fees as well as additional spending to ensure continued regulatory and SOX compliance. We expect such expenses to decline as a percentage of our revenues over the longer term as our revenues grow.\nAcquisition Related Costs\nTable 25: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> </td> <td>(%) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Acquisition related costs </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,690 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>478 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,212 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>462.8 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Percentage of revenues </td> <td> </td> <td>0.5 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>0.1 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nYear Ended December 31, 2021 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2020. Acquisition related costs increased by $2.2 million, or 462.8%, from $0.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 to $2.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The expense for the year ended December 31, 2021 included $1.5 million of compensation expense related to the retention bonuses for employees of previous acquisitions and $1.1 million of legal, professional services and other costs related to our acquisition of ClickSWITCH on April 1, 2021.\nAmortization of Acquired Intangibles\nTable 26: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> </td> <td>(%) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of acquired intangibles </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>17,901 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>17,888 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>13 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.1 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Percentage of revenues </td> <td> </td> <td>3.6 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>4.4 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nYear Ended December 31, 2021 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2020. Amortization of acquired intangibles remained relatively unchanged from the year ended December 31, 2020 to the year ended December 31, 2021. Increases due to amortization of intangible assets acquired during the acquisition of ClickSWITCH on April 1, 2021 were mostly offset by decreases in amortization of intangible assets that became fully amortized. These amounts are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the related assets.\nUnoccupied Lease Charges\nTable 27: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> </td> <td>(%) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unoccupied lease charges </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,008 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,181 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(173) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(7.9) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Percentage of revenues </td> <td> </td> <td>0.4 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>0.5 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nYear Ended December 31, 2021 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2020.

During the year ended December 31, 2021, the charges included costs related to an updated assessment and vacating of facilities in North Carolina, Georgia, Texas and Nebraska, partially offset by anticipated sublease income from these facilities.\nTotal Other Income (Expense), Net\nTable 28: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> </td> <td>(%) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total other income (expense), net </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(33,108) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(36,371) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,263 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(9.0) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Percentage of revenues </td> <td> </td> <td>(6.6) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>(9.0) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nYear Ended December 31, 2021 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2020. Total other income (expense), net represented a net expense of $33.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to a net expense of $36.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The change was primarily attributable to a $7.4 million decrease in expense for additional loss from the early extinguishment of a portion of our 2023 Notes in 2020 compared to 2021 and a $0.8 million increase in other income related to a gain resulting from a favorable settlement of an ordinary course dispute, partially offset by a $4.6 million increase in interest expense from the amortization of debt discount and issuance costs attributable to our convertible notes and a $0.4 million loss on disposal of long-lived assets.\nProvision for income taxes\nTable 29: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> </td> <td>(%) </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Provision for income taxes </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(1,643) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(1,416) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(227) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Percentage of revenues </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.3) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.4) </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nYear Ended December 31, 2021 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2020. Total provision for income taxes increased by $0.2 million from an expense of $1.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 to an expense of $1.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase in the tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2021 related to the operations of the business.\nSeasonality and Quarterly Results\nOur overall operating results fluctuate from quarter to quarter as a result of a variety of factors, including the timing of investments to grow our business. The timing of our implementation activities and corresponding revenues from new customers are subject to fluctuations based on the timing of our sales. Historically, sales have tended to be lower in the first quarter of each year than in subsequent quarters of the same year, but any resulting impact on our results of operation has been difficult to measure due to the timing of our implementations and overall growth in our business. The timing of our implementations also varies period-to-period based on our implementation capacity, the number of solutions purchased by our customers, the size and unique needs of our customers and the readiness of our customers to implement our solutions.\nWhile we believe the pandemic and related re-opening efforts have increased the importance and prominence of digital financial solutions, the increased economic uncertainty, reduced economic activity, including consumer and business spending, and challenges associated with re-opening resulted in delays in certain purchasing decisions and implementations during 2020 and 2021. During the second half of 2021, we observed an improved sales environment relative to 2020 and the first half of 2021, and we believe that for 2022 the sales environment and the timing of purchasing decisions and implementations by customers will similarly reflect an improvement relative to 2020 and the first half of 2021. However, the duration and impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic continue to be highly unpredictable and may continue to disrupt any seasonality trends that may otherwise typically be inherent in our historical operating results.\nOur solutions are often the most frequent point of engagement between our customers and their End Users. As a result, we and our customers are very deliberate and measured in our implementation activities to help ensure a successful roll-out of the solutions to End Users and increase the registration of new End Users. Unusually long or short implementations, for even a small number of customers, may result in short-term quarterly variability in our financial results.\nOur quarterly results of operations may vary significantly in the future and period-to-period comparisons of our operating results may not be meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of future results.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nSources of Liquidity\nWe have financed our operations primarily through the proceeds from the issuance of common stock in our initial public offering in March 2014, additional registered common stock offerings, including our June 2019 and May 2020 common stock offerings, our February 2018 convertible note offering, our June 2019 convertible note offering, our November 2020 convertible note offering, and cash flows from operations. As of December 31, 2021, our principal sources of liquidity were cash, cash equivalents and investments of $427.7 million. Based upon our current levels of operations, we believe that our cash flow from operations along with our other sources of liquidity are adequate to meet our cash requirements for the next twelve months. However, if we determine the need for additional short-term liquidity, there is no assurance that such financing, if pursued, would be adequate or available on terms acceptable to us.\nCash Flows\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows for the periods indicated (in thousands):\nTable 30: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net cash provided by (used in): </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating activities </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>30,925 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(2,890) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>567 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Investing activities </td> <td> </td> <td>(65,129) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(124,163) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(483,252) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Financing activities </td> <td> </td> <td>(51,160) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>434,676 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>476,091 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net increase (decrease) in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(85,364) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>307,623 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(6,594) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\nCash provided by (used in) operating activities is primarily influenced by net loss less non-cash items, the amount and timing of customer receipts and vendor payments, fair value re-measurement related to contingent earnout payment liabilities and by the amount of cash we invest in personnel and infrastructure to support the anticipated growth of our business and increase in the number of installed customers.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, our net cash and cash equivalents provided by operating activities was $30.9 million, which consisted of non-cash adjustments of $168.3 million, partially offset by a net loss of $112.7 million and cash outflows from changes in operating assets and liabilities of $24.6 million. Non-cash adjustments primarily consisted of depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, amortization of debt discount and issuance costs, amortization of deferred implementation and deferred solution and other costs, loss on the early extinguishment of a portion of our convertible notes, and unoccupied lease charges. The primary driver of the changes in operating assets and liabilities related to a $25.6 million increase in deferred solution and implementation costs due to our increased customer growth and new and existing customers undergoing implementations during the period.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, our net cash and cash equivalents used in operating activities was $2.9 million, which consisted of a net loss of $137.6 million and cash outflows from changes in operating assets and liabilities of $26.9 million, partially offset by non-cash adjustments of $161.6 million. The primary drivers of the changes in operating assets and liabilities related to a $32.2 million increase in deferred solution and implementation costs due to our increased customer growth and new and existing customers undergoing implementations during the period and a $14.6 million increase in accounts receivable due to the timing of payments received, partially offset by a $20.4 million increase in deferred revenue due to increased payments and deposits received from customers prior to the recognition of revenue from those related payments. Non-cash adjustments primarily consisted of depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, amortization of debt discount and issuance costs, amortization of deferred implementation and deferred solution and other costs, loss on the early extinguishment of a portion of our convertible notes, and unoccupied lease charges.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, our net cash and cash equivalents provided by operating activities was $0.6 million, which consisted of a net loss of $70.9 million and cash outflows from changes in operating assets and liabilities of $16.1 million, offset by non-cash adjustments of $87.6 million. The primary drivers of the changes in operating assets and liabilities related to a $37.8 million increase in deferred solution and implementation costs due to our increased customer growth and new and existing customers undergoing implementations during the period and an $8.0 million decrease in deferred rents and other long-term liabilities, partially offset by a $15.8 million net increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities due to timing of payments in support of our expanding customer base and related growth in our technical infrastructure and expanded facilities and a $13.4 million increase in deferred revenue due to increased payments and deposits received from customers prior to the recognition of revenue from those related payments. Non-cash adjustments primarily consisted of depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, amortization of debt discount and issuance costs, amortization of deferred implementation and deferred solution and other costs, loss on the early extinguishment of a portion of our convertible notes, unoccupied lease charges, and deferred income taxes from the acquisition of PrecisionLender.\nCash Flows from Investing Activities\nOur investing activities have consisted primarily of purchases and maturities of investments, our recent acquisitions, purchases of property and equipment to support our growth and costs incurred for the development of capitalized software. Purchases of property and equipment may vary period-to-period due to the timing of the expansion of our operations, data center and other technical infrastructure.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, net cash used in investing activities was $65.1 million, consisting of $124.0 million for the purchase of investments, $64.7 million for the acquisition of ClickSWITCH, net of cash acquired, $19.8 million for the purchase of property and equipment, and $5.9 million in capitalized software development costs. These outflows were partially offset by $149.2 million received from the maturities of investments.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, net cash used in investing activities was $124.2 million, consisting of $131.3 million for the purchase of investments, $23.7 million for the purchase of property and equipment, and $1.0 million in capitalized software development costs. These outflows were partially offset by $31.8 million received from the maturities of investments.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, net cash used in investing activities was $483.3 million, consisting of $505.6 million for the acquisition of PrecisionLender, $27.3 million for the purchase of investments, and $13.9 million for the purchase of property and equipment. These outflows were partially offset by $64.0 million received from the maturities of investments.\nCash Flows from Financing Activities\nOur recent financing activities have consisted primarily of our June 2019 and May 2020 common stock offerings, our June 2019 offering of the 2026 Notes, our November 2020 offering of the 2025 Notes, our partial repurchase of the 2023 Notes, the payment of contingent consideration related to the acquisition of Cloud Lending, as well as net proceeds from exercises of options to purchase our common stock.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, net cash used in financing activities was $51.2 million, consisting of $63.7 million for the partial repurchase of 2023 Notes, partially offset by $6.6 million of net proceeds received in connection with the early termination of bond hedges and warrants related to the 2023 Notes, and $5.9 million of cash received from the exercise of stock options.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, net cash provided by financing activities was $434.7 million, consisting of proceeds from the issuance of common stock of $311.3 million, net of issuance costs, from the May 2020 common stock offering, issuance of $132.6 million principal amount of the 2025 Notes, net of issuance costs, from the November 2020 offering of the 2025 Notes, $34.1 million in net proceeds received in connection with the early termination of bond hedges and warrants related to the 2023 Notes, and $13.3 million of cash received from the exercise of stock options, partially offset by the Capped Call transactions of $39.8 million and payment of contingent consideration related to the acquisition of Cloud Lending, of which $16.9 million of the payment was estimated at acquisition date fair value and included in financing activities.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, net cash provided by financing activities was $476.1 million, consisting of the issuance of $307.0 million principal amount of the 2026 Notes, net of issuance costs, proceeds from the issuance of common stock of $195.3 million, net of issuance costs, from the June 2019 common stock offering, and $14.6 million of cash received from the exercise of stock options partially offset by the Capped Call transactions of $40.8 million.\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nOur principal commitments consist of the 2023 Notes, 2025 Notes, 2026 Notes, non-cancelable operating leases related to our facilities, minimum purchase commitments for sponsorship obligations, third-party products, co-location fees and other product costs. Our obligations under our convertible senior notes are described in Note 11 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Information regarding our non-cancellable lease and other purchase commitments as of December 31, 2021 can be found in Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nIn August 2020, the FASB issued ASU No. 2020-06, \"Debt - Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging - Contracts in Entity's Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40)\" which simplifies the accounting for convertible debt instruments by eliminating the requirement to separate embedded conversion features from the host contract when the conversion features are not required to be accounted for as derivatives under Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging, or that do not result in substantial premiums accounted for as paid-in capital. In addition, the guidance eliminates the treasury stock method to calculate diluted earnings per share for convertible instruments and requires the use of the if-converted method. The standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted, but no earlier than fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Adoption of the standard can either be on a modified retrospective or full retrospective basis.\nWe will adopt the new guidance for the fiscal year beginning January 1, 2022, using the modified retrospective approach. The impact to the consolidated balance sheets is expected to result in an increase to our convertible notes balance of approximately $113.0 million to $116.0 million to reflect the full principal amount of the convertible notes outstanding net of issuance costs, a reduction to our additional paid in capital balance of approximately $155.0 million to $158.0 million to remove the equity component separately recorded for the conversion features associated with the convertible notes, and an increase to the beginning balance of accumulated deficit of approximately $41.0 million to $44.0 million. We also expect the adoption of this standard to result in a reduction of non-cash interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2022 until the affected notes have been settled.\nIn May 2021, the FASB issued ASU No. 2021-04, \"Earnings Per Share (Topic 260), Debt - Modifications and Extinguishments (Subtopic 470-50), Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718), and Derivatives and Hedging - Contracts in Entity's Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40)\" which clarifies and reduces diversity in the accounting for modifications or exchanges of freestanding equity classified written call options that remain equity classified after modification or exchange. The ASU provides a principles-based framework to determine whether an issuer should recognize the modification or exchange as an adjustment to equity or an expense. The standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim period. Issuers should apply the new standard prospectively to modifications or exchanges occurring after the effective date of the new standard. We have not adopted the provisions of the new standard and will assess its impact on our consolidated financial statements upon adoption.\nIn October 2021, the FASB issued ASU No. 2021-08, \"Business Combinations (Topic 805): Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers\" which clarifies and reduces diversity in the accounting related to recognition of an acquired contract liability and payment terms and their effect on subsequent revenue recognized by the acquirer. This standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim period. Issuers should apply the new standard prospectively to business combinations occurring on or after the effective date of the new standard. We have not adopted the provisions of the new standard and will assess its impact on our consolidated financial statements upon adoption.", "summary": "- Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In addition to historical consolidated financial information, the following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates and beliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those discussed below and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, particularly in the section titled \"Risk Factors.\"\nOverview\nWe are a leading provider of secure, cloud-based digital solutions that transform the ways in which financial institutions and other financial services providers engage with account holders and end users, or End Users. We offer our solutions to financial institutions, financial technology companies, or FinTechs, alternative finance companies, or Alt-FIs, and other innovative companies, or Brands, wishing to incorporate banking into their customer engagement and servicing strategies. Our solutions include a broad and deep portfolio of digital banking, lending solutions; an open technology platform, the Q2 Innovation Studio, that accelerates innovation by enabling a partnership ecosystem on the Q2 platform in which FinTechs and other digital solution providers can embed their offerings and customers can develop their own applications; and a comprehensive banking as a service, or BaaS, solution, which we re-branded as Helix in 2022, that enables innovative companies to incorporate banking directly into their products. We purpose-build our platforms and solutions to enable success for our customers and technology partners by allowing them to digitize their operations and offerings, differentiate their brands, and integrate traditional and emerging financial services, ultimately enhancing End-User acquisition, engagement and retention and improving operational efficiencies and profitability.\nThe effective delivery and management of secure and advanced digital solutions in the complex and heavily regulated financial services industry requires significant resources, personnel and expertise. We provide digital solutions that are designed to be highly configurable, scalable and adaptable to the specific needs of our customers. We design and develop our solutions with an open platform approach intended to provide comprehensive integration among our solution offerings and our customers' internal and third-party systems. This integrated approach allows our customers to deliver unified and robust financial experiences across digital channels. Our solutions provide our customers the flexibility to configure their digital services in a manner that is consistent with each customer's specific workflows, processes and controls. Our solutions also allow our customers to personalize the digital experiences they deliver to their End Users by extending their individual services and brand requirements across digital channels. Our solutions and our data center infrastructure and resources are designed to comply with the stringent security and technical regulations applicable to financial institutions and financial services providers and to safeguard our customers' data and that of their End Users.\nWe have deep domain expertise in developing and delivering secure, advanced digital solutions designed to help our customers and technology partners compete in the complex and heavily regulated financial services industry. Over 17 years ago Q2 began by providing digital banking solutions to regional and community financial institutions. We have rapidly grown since then through a combination of broad market acceptance of our award-winning solutions and relentless innovation, investment and acquisitions. Our portfolio of solutions now spans digital banking, lending, profitability, onboarding, security, and we now serve account holders and borrowers across retail, small business and commercial segments, in addition to our open technology platform and BaaS offerings. While we remain focused on our founding mission of building stronger and more diverse communities by strengthening their financial institutions, we intend to draw on our broad solution portfolio, deep domain expertise and robust customer base to lead the transformation into a new frontier of financial services.\nThe financial services industry is undergoing tremendous change, influenced by three major factors. First, financial institutions demand now, more than ever, to digitize their operations and offerings, and the COVID-19 pandemic has further accelerated this digital transformation. Second, the continued growth in the number of FinTechs and the innovation they bring to the market is increasing End-User demand and expectations for new, more engaging and meaningful digital financial experiences. And third, major innovative Brands recognize that incorporating banking into their strategy is an opportunity to leverage the trust that their End Users place in them, driving deeper engagement with those End Users. These three forces are converging to create what we believe is a new frontier in financial services in which financial institutions, FinTechs and Brands will have new roles and interdependencies, and which will require new technology, new partners, and new business models. We believe that lasting value creation in financial services will be achieved by those companies that can support and enhance the convergence of these forces. In addition, we have built a broad set of solutions that we believe equips us to accelerate and optimize this convergence - from digitizing the entire bank, to facilitating partnerships among financial institutions and FinTechs, to enabling Brands to incorporate banking into their products and customer relationships.\nWe deliver our solutions to most of our customers using a software-as-a-service, or SaaS, model under which our customers pay subscription fees for the use of our solutions. Our digital banking platform customers have numerous End Users, and those End Users can represent one or more account holders registered to use one or more of our solutions on our digital banking platform. We generally price our digital banking platform solutions based on the number of solutions purchased by our customers and the number of Registered Users or commercial account holders utilizing our solutions. We generally earn additional revenues from our digital banking platform customers based on the number of transactions that End Users perform on our solutions in excess of the levels included in our standard subscription fee. As a result, our revenues from digital banking platform customers grow as our customers buy more solutions from us and increase the number of End Users utilizing our solutions and as those users increase their number of transactions on our solutions. The structure and terms of our newer lending arrangements vary, but generally are also sold on a subscription basis through our direct sales organization, and the related revenues are recognized over the terms of the customer agreements. The structure and terms of our Helix arrangements with FinTechs and Brands vary, but typically involve relatively lower contracted minimum revenues and instead emphasize usage-based revenue, with such revenue recognized as it is incurred.\nWe have achieved significant growth since our inception. During each of the past nine years, our average number of Registered Users (as defined below) per installed customer on our digital banking platform, or Installed Customer, has grown, and in many instances we have been able to sell additional solutions to existing customers. Our revenues per Installed Customer and per Registered User vary period-to-period based on the length and timing of customer implementations, changes in the average number of Registered Users per customer, sales of additional solutions to existing customers, changes in the number of transactions on our solutions by Registered Users and variations among existing customers and new customers with respect to the mix of purchased solutions and related pricing. Please see \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Key Operating Measures\" for additional detail on how we define \"Installed Customers\" and \"Registered Users.\"\nWe believe we have a significant opportunity to continue to grow our business, and we continue to invest across our organization to increase our revenues and improve our operating efficiencies. These investments will increase our costs on an absolute dollar basis, but the timing and amount of these investments will vary based on the rate at which we expect to add new customers, the implementation and support needs of our customers, our software development plans, our technology and physical infrastructure requirements and the internal needs of our organization. Many of these investments will occur in advance of our realizing any resultant benefit which may make it difficult to determine if we are effectively allocating our resources. If we are successful in growing our revenues by increasing the number of customers and scope of our customer relationships, we anticipate that greater economies of scale and increased operating leverage will improve our margins over the long term.\nWe sell our solutions primarily through our professional sales organization. While the financial institutions market is well-defined due to the regulatory classifications of those financial institutions, markets for FinTech, Alt-FIs and brands are broader and more difficult to define due to the changing number of providers in each market. Over the long term, we intend to continue to invest in additional sales representatives to identify and address the financial institution, FinTech, Alt-FI and Brand markets across the U.S. and internationally and to increase our number of sales support and marketing personnel, as well as our investment in marketing initiatives designed to increase awareness of our solutions and generate new customer opportunities.\nWe have continuously invested in expanding and improving our digital banking platform since its introduction in 2005, and we intend to continue investing both organically and inorganically through acquisitions to expand our portfolio of solutions. Additionally, over the past several years we have acquired or developed new solutions and additional functionality that serve a broader range of needs of financial institutions as well as the needs of FinTechs, Alt-FIs and Brands. Our integrated, end-to-end collection of solutions includes retail, small business and commercial banking, regulatory and compliance, digital lending, relationship pricing, BaaS, digital account opening, account switching and data-driven sales enablement and portfolio management solutions among others. We have also introduced the Q2 Innovation Studio, an API-based and SDK-based open technology platform that allows our financial institution customers and other technology partners to develop unique extensions of and integrations to our digital banking platform, allowing financial institutions to quickly and easily deploy customized experiences and the latest financial services expected by End Users.\nWe believe that financial services providers are best served by a broad integrated portfolio of digital solutions that provide rapid, flexible and comprehensive integration with internal and third-party solutions allowing them to provide modern, intuitive digital financial services in a secure, regulatory-compliant manner. We also believe that the breadth and depth of our solution offerings and customer base, our open and flexible platform approach, our position as a leading provider of digital banking solutions to a large network of financial institutions, and our expertise in delivering new, innovative, secure and regulatory-compliant digital solutions uniquely position us to capitalize on the new frontier in financial services. We currently intend to increase investments in technology innovation and software development as we enhance our solutions and platforms and increase or expand the number of solutions that we offer.\nWe believe that delivery of consistent, high-quality customer support is a significant driver of purchasing and renewal decisions of our prospects and customers. To develop and maintain a reputation for high-quality service, we seek to build deep relationships with our customers through our customer service organization, which we staff with personnel who are motivated by our common mission of using technology to help our customers succeed and who are knowledgeable with respect to the regulated and complex nature of the financial services industry. As our business grows, we currently intend to continue to invest in and grow our services and delivery organization to support our customers' needs and maintain our reputation.\nCOVID-19 Pandemic\nGlobal health concerns with respect to the COVID-19 pandemic and related government actions taken to reduce the spread of the virus have caused disruption to the macroeconomic environment, and the pandemic has significantly increased economic uncertainty and reduced economic activity, including consumer and business spending. While there has been significant economic recovery in certain markets due to broad vaccination availability, loosening of lock-down measures and business re-openings, the recovery is characterized by additional uncertainty as a result of the disruption caused by the pandemic, including supply chain constraints in many industries, significant price increases for certain goods and services, rapid increases in demand as economies re-open, increased employee attrition, skilled labor shortages, wage inflation and businesses and labor markets navigating how they will operate post-pandemic. The extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operational and financial performance will depend on future developments unknown and unpredictable at this time, including the continued duration, severity and spread of the pandemic, including new variants, related restrictions on travel and transportation and other actions that may be taken by governmental authorities, the predictability and success of any re-opening efforts, the impacts of the pandemic on labor markets, the impact to our customers, their End Users, our suppliers and partners, and other items identified under \"Risk Factors\" above. Based on the information available to us to date, we believe we have taken an informed, proactive and effective approach to addressing the direct known effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on us, our customers and other third parties on which we rely and that we have been able to effectively deliver and support our solutions for our customers utilizing numerous remote capabilities and channels.\nBeginning mid-March 2020, almost all of our employees transitioned to working remotely from home. Through mid-2021, we continued to operate with the vast majority of our employees working remotely. However, during the quarter ended June 30, 2021, we began allowing employees to return to onsite work on a limited, voluntary basis, subject to health and safety protocols. Effective November 1, 2021, we re-opened all of our U.S. facilities, and have provided each of our U.S. employees with the choice of either continuing to work remotely, working in a hybrid capacity (one or two days per week onsite) or fully returning to onsite attendance, with any onsite attendance subject to health and safety protocols. With the rapid spread of the Omicron variant in early 2022, we have instituted additional safety protocols for employees choosing to work onsite, and have strongly encouraged our employees to work remotely when possible until the Omicron surge has passed. As we navigate the reopening of our onsite facilities, we believe employee preferences between remote, hybrid and onsite attendance are likely to change over time, and we will continue to adapt our physical facilities and IT infrastructure to accommodate a safe and successful work experience for our onsite, hybrid and remote employees. Throughout the pandemic we believe our corporate culture, business model, customer relations, and technology and information technology infrastructure have effectively allowed our employees to substantially perform their roles whether remote, hybrid or onsite.\nWe also have performed additional due diligence with critical vendors and other third parties on which we rely to assess their responses to the COVID-19 pandemic and impacts on their operations and services. To date, we have not experienced any material adverse impacts from any of our vendors or other third parties on which we rely. We intend to continue to conduct enhanced due diligence on such vendors and third parties for the foreseeable future as the uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic continues to persist.\nWe also are continuing to conduct outreach to our customers and many prospective customers to assess their needs in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic and their own re-opening efforts and to seek to identify ways that we may assist them with our solutions and services. We believe the impacts of COVID-19 and related re-opening efforts on our existing and prospective customers present both challenges and opportunities. While we believe the pandemic and related re-opening efforts have increased the importance and prominence of digital financial solutions, the increased economic uncertainty, reduced economic activity, including consumer and business spending, and challenges associated with re-opening have resulted in delays in certain purchasing decisions and implementations during 2020 and 2021. During the second half of 2021, we observed an improved sales environment relative to 2020 and the first half of 2021, and we believe that for 2022 the sales environment and the timing of purchasing decisions and implementations by customers will similarly reflect an improvement relative to 2020 and the first half of 2021. However, the duration and impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic continue to be highly unpredictable and may continue to disrupt any seasonality trends that may otherwise typically be inherent in our historical operating results.\nDespite these challenges among customers, the usage by End Users of digital financial solutions has never been higher and we are making additional investments to enhance our technology infrastructure to support this heightened usage. We have seen increased online banking activity as a result of shelter-in-place and similar orders as well as spikes in logins as End Users check accounts for items such as government stimulus funds. We believe the challenges and opportunities posed by the COVID-19 pandemic have and will continue to cause financial institutions to increase their focus on maintaining and improving their digital financial services offerings.\nKey Operating Measures\nIn addition to the U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, measures described below in \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Components of Operating Results,\" we monitor the following operating measures to evaluate growth trends, plan investments and measure the effectiveness of our sales and marketing efforts.\nWhile we believe the pandemic and related re-opening efforts have increased the importance and prominence of digital financial solutions, the increased economic uncertainty, reduced economic activity, including consumer and business spending, and challenges associated with re-opening resulted in delays in certain purchasing decisions and implementations and contract terminations during 2020 and 2021. During the second half of 2021, we observed an improved sales environment relative to 2020 and the first half of 2021, and we believe that for 2022 the sales environment and the predictability of purchasing decisions and implementations by customers will similarly reflect an improvement relative to 2020 and the first half of 2021, and thus we will see positive impacts on the rate at which we add new Installed Customers, and with them new Registered Users and annualized recurring revenue, in each case as compared to these prior periods.\nInstalled Customers\nWe define Installed Customers as the number of customers on live implementations (or installations) of our digital banking platforms. The average size of our Installed Customers, measured in both Registered Users per Installed Customer and revenues per Installed Customer, has increased over time as our existing Installed Customers continue to add Registered Users and commercial account holders, buy more solutions from us, and as we add larger financial institutions to our Installed Customer base. The net rate at which we add Installed Customers varies based on our implementation capacity, the size and unique needs of our customers, the readiness of our customers to implement our solutions and customer attrition, including as a result of merger and acquisition activity among financial institutions. We had 448, 450 and 414 Installed Customers on our digital banking platform as of December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nRegistered Users\nWe define a Registered User as an individual related to an account holder of an Installed Customer on our consumer digital banking platform who has registered to use one or more of our solutions and has current access to use those solutions as of the last day of the reporting period presented. We generally price our consumer digital banking platform solutions based on the number of Registered Users, while our commercial digital banking platform solutions are based on the number of commercial account holders. As the number of Registered Users of our solutions increases, our revenues generally tend to grow. Our average number of Registered Users per Installed Customer grows as our existing digital banking platform customers add more Registered Users and as we add larger financial institutions to our Installed Customer base. We anticipate that the number of Registered Users will grow at a faster rate than our number of Installed Customers. The rate at which our customers add Registered Users vary significantly period-to-period based on the timing of our implementations of new customers, the timing of registration of new End Users and customers performing inactive account clean-up. We add new Registered Users through both organic growth from existing customers and from the addition of End Users from new Installed Customers. Our aggregate number of Registered Users is negatively impacted to the extent Installed Customers terminate all or a portion of their arrangements with us. Our Installed Customers had approximately 19.2 million, 17.8 million and 14.6 million Registered Users as of December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nNet Revenue Retention Rate\nWe believe that our ability to retain our customers and expand their use of our products and services over time is an indicator of the stability of our revenue base and the long-term value of our customer relationships. We assess our performance in this area using a metric we refer to as our net revenue retention rate, which we previously referred to as our revenue retention rate. We calculate our net revenue retention rate as the total revenues in a calendar year, excluding any revenues from acquired customers during such year, from customers who were implemented on any of our solutions as of December 31 of the prior year, expressed as a percentage of the total revenues during the prior year from the same group of customers. Our net revenue retention rate provides insight into the impact on current year revenues of: the number of new customers implemented on any of our solutions during the prior year; the timing of our implementation of those new customers in the prior year; growth in the number of End Users on such solutions and changes in their usage of such solutions; sales of new products and services to our existing customers during the current year, excluding any products or services resulting from businesses acquired during such year and customer attrition. The most significant drivers of changes in our net revenue retention rate each year have historically been the number of new customers in the prior year and the timing of our implementation of those new customers. The timing of our implementation of new customers in the prior year is significant because we do not start recognizing revenues from new customers until they are implemented. If implementations are weighted more heavily in the first or second half of the prior year, our net revenue retention rate will be lower or higher, respectively. In the first half of 2021, our implementations were weighted more heavily, and we expect to see a lower net revenue retention rate in 2022 as a result. Our use of net revenue retention rate has limitations as an analytical tool, and investors should not consider it in isolation. Other companies in our industry may calculate net revenue retention rate differently, which reduces its usefulness as a comparative measure. Our net revenue retention rate was 119%, 122%, and 120% for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nAnnualized Recurring Revenue\nWe believe Annualized Recurring Revenue, or ARR, provides important information about our future revenue potential, our ability to acquire new clients, and our ability to maintain and expand our relationship with existing clients. We calculate ARR as the annualized value of all recurring revenue recognized in the last month of the reporting period, with the exception of variable revenue in excess of contracted amounts for which we instead take the average monthly run rate of the trailing three months within that reporting period. Our ARR also includes the contracted minimums associated with all contracts in place at the end of the quarter that have not yet commenced, and revenue generated from Premier Services. Premier Services revenue is generated from select established customer relationships where we have engaged with the customer for more tailored, premium professional services resulting in a deeper and ongoing level of engagement with them, which we deem to be recurring in nature. ARR does not include revenue from professional services or other sources of revenue that are not deemed to be recurring in nature. ARR is not a forecast of future revenue, which can be impacted by contract start and end dates and renewal rates. ARR should be viewed independently of revenue and deferred revenue as ARR is an operating metric and is not intended to be combined with or replace these items. Our use of ARR has limitations as an analytical tool, and investors should not consider it in isolation. Other companies in our industry may calculate ARR differently, which reduces its usefulness as a comparative measure. Our ARR was $574.2 million, $464.2 million and $400.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nRevenue Churn\nWe utilize revenue churn, which we previously have referred to simply as churn, to monitor the satisfaction of our customers and evaluate the effectiveness of our business strategies. We define revenue churn as the amount of any monthly recurring revenue losses due to customer cancellations and downgrades, net of upgrades and additions of new solutions, during a year, divided by our monthly recurring revenue at the beginning of the year. Cancellations refer to customers that have either stopped using our services completely or remained a customer but terminated a particular service. Downgrades are a result of customers taking less of a particular service or renewing their contract for identical services at a lower price. We had annual revenue churn of 5.4%, 5.9%, and 5.1% for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. Our use of revenue churn has limitations as an analytical tool, and investors should not consider it in isolation. Other companies in our industry may calculate revenue churn differently, which reduces its usefulness as a comparative measure.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nIn addition to financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP, we use certain non-GAAP financial measures to clarify and enhance our understanding, and aid in the period-to-period comparison, of our performance. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide supplemental information that is meaningful when assessing our operating performance because they exclude the impact of certain categories that our management and board of directors do not consider part of core operating results when assessing our operational performance, allocating resources, preparing annual budgets and determining compensation. Accordingly, these non-GAAP financial measures may provide insight to investors into the motivation and decision-making of management in operating the business. Set forth in the tables below are the corresponding GAAP financial measures for each non-GAAP financial measure. Investors are encouraged to review the reconciliation of each of these non-GAAP financial measures to its most comparable GAAP financial measure included below. While we believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful supplemental information, non-GAAP financial measures have limitations and should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, their most comparable GAAP measures. These non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP, do not reflect a comprehensive system of accounting and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies due to potential differences in their financing and accounting methods, the book value of their assets, their capital structures, the method by which their assets were acquired and the manner in which they define non-GAAP measures. Items such as the deferred revenue reduction from purchase accounting, stock-based compensation, acquisition related costs, amortization of acquired technology, amortization of acquired intangible assets, partnership termination charges and unoccupied lease charges can have a material impact on our GAAP financial results.\nNon-GAAP Revenue\nWe define non-GAAP revenue as total revenue excluding the impact of purchase accounting. We monitor these measures to assess our performance because we believe our revenue growth rates would be understated without these adjustments. We believe presenting non-GAAP revenue aids in the comparability between periods and in assessing our overall operating performance.\n\nNon-GAAP Operating Income\nWe provide non-GAAP operating income using non-GAAP revenue as discussed above and excluding such items as deferred revenue reduction from purchase accounting, stock-based compensation, acquisition related costs, amortization of acquired technology, amortization of acquired intangible assets, partnership termination charges and unoccupied lease charges. We believe excluding these items is useful for the following reasons:\n\u2022Deferred revenue reduction from purchase accounting. We provide non-GAAP information that excludes the deferred revenue reduction from purchase accounting. We believe that the exclusion of deferred revenue reduction from purchase accounting allows users of our financial statements to better review and understand the historical and current results of our continuing operations.\n\u2022Amortization of acquired technology and intangible assets. We provide non-GAAP information that excludes expenses related to purchased technology and intangible assets associated with our acquisitions. We believe that eliminating these expenses from our non-GAAP measures is useful to investors, because the amortization of acquired technology and intangible assets can be inconsistent in amount and frequency and significantly impacted by the timing and magnitude of our acquisition transactions, which also vary in frequency from period to period. Accordingly, we analyze the performance of our operations in each period without regard to such expenses.\n\u2022Stock-based compensation. We provide non-GAAP information that excludes expenses related to stock-based compensation. We believe that the exclusion of stock-based compensation expense provides for a better comparison of our operating results to prior periods and to our peer companies as the calculations of stock-based compensation vary from period to period and company to company due to different valuation methodologies, subjective assumptions and the variety of award types. Because of these unique characteristics of stock-based compensation, we exclude these expenses when analyzing the organization's business performance.\n\u2022Acquisition related costs. We exclude certain expense items resulting from our acquisitions, such as legal, accounting and consulting fees, changes in fair value of contingent consideration and retention expense. We consider these adjustments, to some extent, to be unpredictable and dependent on a significant number of factors that are outside of our control. Furthermore, acquisitions result in operating expenses that would not otherwise have been incurred by us in the normal course of our organic business operations. We believe that providing these non-GAAP measures that exclude acquisition related costs, allows users of our financial statements to better review and understand the historical and current results of our continuing operations, and also facilitates comparisons to our historical results and results of less acquisitive peer companies, both with and without such adjustments.\n\u2022Partnership termination charges. In the quarter ended June 30, 2020, in connection with the termination of a strategic partnership, we agreed to pay a termination fee of $5.6 million in May 2020 and $7.6 million in the third quarter of 2021. We are excluding the charges associated with this partnership termination as they are non-recurring in nature and would not otherwise have been incurred by us in the normal course of our organic business operations. We believe that providing these non-GAAP measures that exclude partnership termination charges allows users of our financial statements to better review and understand the historical and current results of our continuing operations, and also facilitates comparisons to our historical results and results of peer companies, both with and without such adjustments.\n\u2022Unoccupied lease charges. We provide non-GAAP information that excludes restructuring charges related to the estimated costs of exiting and terminating facility lease commitments, as they relate to our corporate restructuring and exit activities. These charges are inconsistent in amount and are significantly impacted by the timing and nature of these events. Therefore, although we may incur these types of expenses in the future, we believe that eliminating these charges for purposes of calculating the non-GAAP financial measures facilitates a more meaningful evaluation of our operating performance and comparisons to our past operating performance.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA\nWe define adjusted EBITDA as net loss before depreciation, amortization, stock-based compensation, certain costs related to our recent acquisitions, (benefit from) provision for income taxes, interest and other (income) expense, net, deferred revenue reduction from purchase accounting, partnership termination charges, loss on extinguishment of debt, and unoccupied lease charges. We believe that adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results for the following reasons:\n\u2022adjusted EBITDA is widely used by investors and securities analysts to measure a company's operating performance without regard to items that can vary substantially from company to company depending upon their financing, capital structures and the method by which assets were acquired;\n\u2022our management uses adjusted EBITDA in conjunction with GAAP financial measures for planning purposes, in the preparation of our annual operating budget, as a measure of our operating performance, to assess the effectiveness of our business strategies and to communicate with our board of directors concerning our financial performance;\n\u2022adjusted EBITDA provides more consistency and comparability with our past financial performance, facilitates period-to-period comparisons of our operations and also facilitates comparisons with other companies, many of which use similar non-GAAP financial measures to supplement their GAAP results; and\n\u2022our investor and analyst presentations include adjusted EBITDA as a supplemental measure of our overall operating performance.\nAdjusted EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to net loss or any other measure of financial performance calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. The use of adjusted EBITDA as an analytical tool has limitations such as:\n\u2022depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, and the assets being depreciated or amortized will often have to be replaced in the future and adjusted EBITDA does not reflect cash requirements for such replacements;\n\u2022adjusted EBITDA may not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs or contractual commitments;\n\u2022adjusted EBITDA does not reflect the potentially dilutive impact of stock-based compensation;\n\u2022adjusted EBITDA does not reflect interest or tax payments that could reduce cash available for use; and\n\u2022other companies, including companies in our industry, might calculate adjusted EBITDA or similarly titled measures differently, which reduces their usefulness as comparative measures.\nBecause of these and other limitations, you should consider adjusted EBITDA together with our GAAP financial measures including cash flow from operations and net loss. The following table presents a reconciliation of net loss to adjusted EBITDA for each of the periods indicated (in thousands):\n\nComponents of Operating Results\nRevenues\nRevenue-generating activities directly relate to the sale, implementation and support of our solutions within a single operating segment. We derive the majority of our revenues from subscription fees for the use of our solutions hosted in either our data centers or with cloud-based services, transactional revenue from bill-pay solutions, and revenues for customer support and implementation services related to our solutions. We recognize the corresponding revenues over time on a ratable basis over the customer agreement term. A small portion of our revenues are derived from customers which host and manage our solutions on-premises or in third-party data centers under term license and maintenance agreements. We recognize the software license revenue once the customer obtains control of the license and the remaining arrangement consideration for maintenance revenue over time on a ratable basis over the term of the software license.\nSubscription fees are based on the number of solutions purchased by our customers, the number of End Users using the solutions and the number of bill-pay and certain other transactions those users conduct using our solutions in excess of the levels included in our standard subscription fee. Subscription fees are billed monthly, quarterly or annually and are recognized monthly over the term of our customer agreements. The initial term of our digital banking platform agreements averages over five years, although it varies by customer. The structure and terms of our newer lending arrangements vary, but generally are also sold on a subscription basis through our direct sales organization, and the related revenues are recognized over the terms of the customer agreements. The structure and terms of our Helix arrangements with FinTechs and Brands vary, but typically involve relatively lower contracted minimum revenues and instead emphasize usage-based revenue, with such revenue recognized as it is incurred. We begin recognizing subscription fees when the control of the service transfers to the customer, generally when the solution is implemented and made available to the customer. We recognize revenue for bill-pay transaction services generated when End Users utilize debit cards integrated with its Q2 CorePro API or Q2 Biller Direct products in the month incurred based on actual or estimated transactions. The timing of our implementations varies period-to-period based on our implementation capacity, the number of solutions purchased by our customers, the size and unique needs of our customers\nand the readiness of our customers to implement our solutions. We recognize any related implementation services revenues ratably over the initial customer agreement term beginning on the date we commence recognizing subscription fees. Contract asset balances arise primarily when we provide services in advance of billing for those services. Amounts that have been invoiced but not paid are recorded in accounts receivable or other long-term assets, depending on the timing of expected billing, and in revenues or deferred revenues, depending on when control of the service transfers to the customer.\nAs a result of the economic and operational impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our customers, in 2020 and 2021 our bookings, in particular with respect to new customer agreements, were adversely impacted relative to pre-pandemic levels. Specifically, we experienced delays and unpredictability in the purchasing decisions of our customers and prospective customers and a slowing of net new customer deals, relative to pre-pandemic levels, partially offset by an increase in cross sales of additional features and functionality to our existing customer base due to the increased utilization and demand for digital banking solutions caused by the decreased in-branch operations resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. However, during the second half of 2021, we observed an improved sales environment relative to 2020 and the first half of 2021. We believe that for 2022 the sales environment and the predictability of purchasing decisions and implementations by customers will similarly reflect an improvement relative to 2020 and the first half of 2021. However, our revenues for 2022 will continue to reflect the negative impacts from these prior periods and the duration and impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic continue to be highly unpredictable and may continue to disrupt any seasonality trends that may otherwise typically be inherent in our historical operating results.\nCost of Revenues\nCost of revenues is comprised primarily of salaries and other personnel-related costs, including employee benefits, bonuses and stock-based compensation, for employees providing services to our customers. This includes the costs of our personnel performing implementation, certain software development, customer support, data center and customer training activities. Cost of revenues also includes the direct costs of bill-pay and other third-party intellectual property included in our solutions, the amortization of deferred solution and services costs, co-location facility costs and depreciation of our data center assets, debit card related pass-through fees, cloud-based hosting services, an allocation of general overhead costs, the amortization of acquired technology, and referral fees. We allocate general overhead expenses to all departments based on the number of employees in each department, which we consider to be a fair and representative means of allocation.\nWe capitalize certain personnel costs directly related to the implementation of our solutions to the extent those costs are recoverable from future revenues. We amortize the costs for an implementation once revenue recognition commences, and we amortize those implementation costs to cost of revenues over the expected period of customer benefit, which has been determined to be the estimated life of the technology. Other costs not directly recoverable from future revenues are expensed in the period incurred.\nWe capitalize certain software development costs related to programmers, software engineers, quality control teams and third-party development costs for those who are directly associated with and who devote time to our software solutions on an individual product basis. Software development costs are amortized to cost of revenues when products, upgrades and enhancements are released or made available over the products' estimated economic lives.\nWe intend to continue to increase our investments in our implementation and customer support teams and technology infrastructure to serve our customers and support our growth. Over the long-term, we expect cost of revenues to continue to grow in absolute dollars as we grow our business, but to fluctuate as a percentage of revenues based principally on the level and timing of implementation support activities, debit card related pass-through fees, and other related costs, including during periods where revenues are lower or implementations are delayed due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nOperating Expenses\nOperating expenses consist of sales and marketing, research and development and general and administrative expenses. They also include costs related to our acquisitions and the resulting amortization of acquired intangible assets from those acquisitions. Over the long term, we intend to continue to hire new employees and make other investments to support our anticipated growth. As a result, we expect our operating expenses to increase in absolute dollars but to decrease as a percentage of revenues over the long term as we grow our business.\nThe uncertainties and risks posed by the continuing COVID-19 pandemic were considered while preparing our 2022 budget and hiring plans. Beginning in 2021, our hiring began to return to more normal levels, and we anticipate this trend to continue in 2022, with our hiring plans more closely resembling pre-pandemic levels. However, during the second half of 2021, we experienced an exceptionally challenging hiring environment and we expect to see continued intense competition for technical talent in 2022, which has the potential to drive increased inflation in the wages we have to pay to hire and retain qualified employees. Additionally, while throughout 2021 most of our employees continued to work remotely from home and we suspended most non-essential business travel and conference participation, we expect that in 2022 some of these activities,\nincluding costs associated with onsite attendance, will return. As a result, we anticipate that we will continue to see a gradual increase in certain costs associated with operating physical locations and facilitating employee travel during 2022. As we navigate the reopening of our onsite facilities, we believe employee preferences between remote, hybrid and onsite attendance are likely to change over time, and we will continue to adapt our physical facilities and IT infrastructure to accommodate a safe and successful work experience for our onsite, hybrid and remote employees.\nSales and Marketing\nSales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries and other personnel-related costs, including commissions, employee benefits, bonuses and stock-based compensation. Sales and marketing expenses also include expenses related to advertising, lead generation, promotional event programs, corporate communications, travel and allocated overhead.\nSales and marketing expenses as a percentage of total revenues will change in any given period based on several factors including the addition of newly hired sales professionals, the number and timing of newly-installed customers and the amount of sales commissions expense amortized related to those customers, including during periods where revenues are lower or implementations are delayed due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Commissions are generally capitalized and then amortized over the expected period of customer benefit.\nResearch and Development\nWe believe that continuing to improve and enhance our solutions is essential to maintaining our reputation for innovation and growing our customer base and revenues. Research and development expenses include salaries and personnel-related costs, including employee benefits, bonuses and stock-based compensation, third-party contractor expenses, software development costs, allocated overhead and other related expenses incurred in developing new solutions and enhancing existing solutions.\nCertain research and development costs that are related to our software development, which include salaries and other personnel-related costs, including employee benefits and bonuses attributed to programmers, software engineers and quality control teams working on our software solutions, are capitalized and are included in intangible assets, net on the consolidated balance sheets.\nGeneral and Administrative\nGeneral and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and other personnel-related costs, including employee benefits, bonuses and stock-based compensation, of our administrative, finance and accounting, information systems, legal and human resources employees. General and administrative expenses also include consulting and professional fees, insurance and travel. We expect to continue to incur incremental expenses associated with the growth of our business and to meet increased compliance requirements associated with operating as a regulated, public company.\nAcquisition Related Costs\nAcquisition related costs include compensation expenses related to milestone provisions and retention agreements with certain former shareholders and employees of acquired businesses, which are recognized as earned, changes in fair value of the contingent consideration related to potential acquisition earnout payments and various legal and professional service expenses incurred in connection with the acquisitions, which are recognized when incurred.\nAmortization of Acquired Intangibles\nAmortization of acquired intangibles represents the amortization of intangibles recorded in connection with our business acquisitions which are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the related assets.\nPartnership Termination Charges\nPartnership termination charges represent the fees paid related to termination of a strategic partnership during the quarter ended June 30, 2020. These charges are non-recurring in nature and would not otherwise have been incurred by us in the normal course of our organic business operations.\nUnoccupied Lease Charges\nUnoccupied lease charges include costs related to the early vacating of certain facilities, partially offset by anticipated sublease income from the associated facilities.\nTotal Other Income (Expense), Net\nTotal other income (expense), net, consists primarily of interest income and expense, other non-operating income and expense, loss on disposal of long-lived assets, foreign currency translation adjustment and loss on extinguishment of debt. We earn interest income on our cash, cash equivalents and investments. Interest expense consists primarily of the interest from the amortization of debt discount, issuance costs, and coupon interest attributable to our convertible notes issued in February 2018, or 2023 Notes, our convertible notes issued in June 2019, or 2026 Notes, and our convertible notes issued in November 2020, or 2025 Notes, as well as fees and interest associated with the letter of credit issued to our landlord for the security deposit for our corporate headquarters.\nBenefit from (Provision for) Income Taxes\nAs a result of our current net operating loss position, current income tax expenses and benefits consist primarily of state income tax expense, deferred income tax expense relating to the tax amortization of recently acquired goodwill, and income tax expense from foreign operations. We incurred state and foreign income taxes for each of the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019. Our net operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax purposes were $633.8 million and $536.5 million at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, which $201.2 million will expire at various dates beginning in 2026, if not utilized, and $432.6 million have an indefinite carryforward period. Federal net operating losses generated during and after the year ended December 31, 2018 will have an indefinite carryforward period. We also held state tax credit carry overs of $3.0 million and $2.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and federal R&D tax credit carry overs of $8.9 million and $8.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The state tax credits will begin to expire 2033 if not utilized and the federal R&D tax credits will begin to expire in 2036, if not utilized.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates\nOur management's discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses. In accordance with GAAP, we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results might differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nOur significant accounting policies are described in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, and we believe that the accounting policies discussed below involve the greatest degree of complexity and exercise of significant judgments and estimates by our management. The methods, estimates and judgments that we use in applying our accounting policies have a significant impact on our results of operations and, accordingly, we believe the policies described below are the most critical for understanding and evaluating our financial condition and results of operations.\nRevenue Recognition\nRevenues are recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to our customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services over the term of the agreement, generally when our solutions are implemented and made available to our customers. The promised consideration may include fixed amounts, variable amounts or both. Revenues are recognized net of sales credits and allowances.\nRevenue-generating activities are directly related to the sale, implementation and support of our solutions within a single operating segment. We derive the majority of our revenues from subscription fees for the use of our solutions hosted in either our data centers or cloud-based hosting services, transactional revenue from bill-pay solutions and revenues for customer support and implementation services related to our solutions.\nSubscription Revenues\nOur software solutions are available for use as hosted application arrangements under subscription fee agreements without licensing perpetual rights to the software. Subscription fees from these applications, including contractual periodic price increases, are recognized over time on a ratable basis over the customer agreement term beginning on the date our solution is made available to the customer. Amounts that have been invoiced are recorded in accounts receivable and deferred revenues or revenues, depending on whether the revenue recognition criteria have been met. Periodic price increases are estimated at contract inception and result in contract assets as revenue recognition may exceed the amount billed early in the contract. Additional fees for monthly usage above the levels included in the standard subscription fee are recognized as revenue in the month when the usage amounts are determined and reported.\nA small portion of our customers host and manage our solutions on-premises or in third-party data centers under term license and maintenance agreements. Term licenses sold with maintenance entitle the customer to technical support, upgrades and updates to the software on a when-and-if-available basis. We recognize software license revenue once the customer obtains control of the license, which generally occurs at the start of each license term. We recognize the remaining arrangement consideration for maintenance revenue over time on a ratable basis over the term of the software license. If the expected length of time between when we transfer the software license to the customer and when the customer pays for it results in a significant financing component, we adjust the promised amount of consideration for the effects of the time value of money, which reflects the price the customer would have paid when the license was transferred. Revenues from term licenses and maintenance agreements and the related financing component were not significant in the periods presented.\nTransactional Revenues\nWe generate the majority of our transactional revenues based on the number of bill-pay transactions that End Users initiate on our digital banking platform. We also generate a smaller portion of our transactional revenues from interchange fees generated when End Users utilize debit cards integrated with our Q2 CorePro API or Q2 Biller Direct products. We recognize revenue for bill-pay transaction services in the month incurred based on actual or estimated transactions.\nServices and Other Revenues\nImplementation services are required for each new digital banking and lending platform and Centrix standalone contract, and there is a significant level of integration and configuration for each customer. Our revenue for upfront implementation services is billed upfront and generally recognized over time on a ratable basis over the customer agreement term for our hosted application agreements. Upfront implementation services for on-premises agreements are recognized at commencement date. Under certain circumstances, we partner with third-party professional system integrators to support the installation and configuration process for certain products, and therefore, we have determined that these services qualify as a separate performance obligation in certain markets and geographies, and the implementation services for these agreements are recognized over time as services are performed.\nProfessional services revenues, which primarily consist of training, advisory services, core conversion services, web design, and other general professional services, are generally billed and recognized when delivered.\nCertain out-of-pocket expenses billed to customers are recorded as revenues rather than an offset to the related expense.\nSignificant Judgments\nPerformance Obligations and Standalone Selling Price\nA performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct good or service to the customer and is the unit of accounting. Determining whether products and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately versus together may require significant judgment. We have contracts with customers that often include multiple performance obligations, usually including multiple subscription and implementation services. For these contracts, we account for individual performance obligations that are separately identifiable by allocating the contract's total transaction price to each performance obligation in an amount based on the relative standalone selling price, or SSP, of each distinct good or service in the contract. In determining whether implementation services are distinct from subscription services, we considered various factors including the significant level of integration, interdependency, and interrelation between the implementation and subscription service, as well as the inability of the customer's personnel or other service providers to perform significant portions of the services. We have concluded that the implementation services included in contracts with multiple performance obligations in the North American banking market are not distinct and, as a result, we defer any arrangement fees for implementation services and recognize such amounts over time on a ratable basis as one performance obligation with the underlying subscription revenue for the initial agreement term of the hosted application agreements. We have concluded that outside the North American banking market, the implementation services for our lending platform included in contracts with multiple performance obligations are distinct and, as a result, we recognize implementation fees on such arrangements over time as services are performed.\nThe majority of our revenue recognized at a particular point in time is for usage revenue and on-premise software licenses. These services are recognized at the point in time in which the customer obtains control of the asset, which is generally upon completion of the service or the point the customer obtained control of the software.\nJudgment is required to determine the SSP for each distinct performance obligation. A contract's transaction price is allocated to each distinct performance obligation and recognized as revenue when, or as, the performance obligation is satisfied. The primary method used to estimate SSP is the adjusted market assessment approach, which considers its overall pricing objectives, market conditions and other factors, including the value of our contracts, our discounting practices, the size and volume of our transactions, customer characteristics, price lists, go-to-market strategy, historical standalone sales and agreement prices, and the number and types of users within our contracts.\nVariable Consideration\nWe recognize usage revenue related to bill-pay transactions that End Users initiate on our digital banking platform and interchange fees that End Users generate using our solutions. Judgment is required to determine the accounting for these types of revenue. We consider various factors including the degree to which usage is interdependent or interrelated to past services, costs to us per user over the contract, and contractual price per user changes and their relationship to market terms, forecasted data, and our cost to fulfill the obligation. We have concluded that our usage revenue relates specifically to the transfer of the service to the customer and is consistent with the allocation objective of Topic 606 when considering all of the performance obligations and payment terms in the contract. Therefore, we", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In addition to historical consolidated financial information, the following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates and beliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those discussed below and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, particularly in the section titled \"Risk Factors.\"\nOverview\nWe are a leading provider of secure, cloud-based digital solutions that transform the ways in which financial institutions and other financial services providers engage with account holders and end users, or End Users. We offer our solutions to financial institutions, financial technology companies, or FinTechs, alternative finance companies, or Alt-FIs, and other innovative companies, or Brands, wishing to incorporate banking into their customer engagement and servicing strategies. Our solutions include a broad and deep portfolio of digital banking, lending solutions; an open technology platform, the Q2 Innovation Studio, that accelerates innovation by enabling a partnership ecosystem on the Q2 platform in which FinTechs and other digital solution providers can embed their offerings and customers can develop their own applications; and a comprehensive banking as a service, or BaaS, solution, which we re-branded as Helix in 2022, that enables innovative companies to incorporate banking directly into their products. We purpose-build our platforms and solutions to enable success for our customers and technology partners by allowing them to digitize their operations and offerings, differentiate their brands, and integrate traditional and emerging financial services, ultimately enhancing End-User acquisition, engagement and retention and improving operational efficiencies and profitability.\nThe effective delivery and management of secure and advanced digital solutions in the complex and heavily regulated financial services industry requires significant resources, personnel and expertise. We provide digital solutions that are designed to be highly configurable, scalable and adaptable to the specific needs of our customers. We design and develop our solutions with an open platform approach intended to provide comprehensive integration among our solution offerings and our customers' internal and third-party systems. This integrated approach allows our customers to deliver unified and robust financial experiences across digital channels. Our solutions provide our customers the flexibility to configure their digital services in a manner that is consistent with each customer's specific workflows, processes and controls. Our solutions also allow our customers to personalize the digital experiences they deliver to their End Users by extending their individual services and brand requirements across digital channels. Our solutions and our data center infrastructure and resources are designed to comply with the stringent security and technical regulations applicable to financial institutions and financial services providers and to safeguard our customers' data and that of their End Users.\nWe have deep domain expertise in developing and delivering secure, advanced digital solutions designed to help our customers and technology partners compete in the complex and heavily regulated financial services industry. Over 17 years ago Q2 began by providing digital banking solutions to regional and community financial institutions. We have rapidly grown since then through a combination of broad market acceptance of our award-winning solutions and relentless innovation, investment and acquisitions. Our portfolio of solutions now spans digital banking, lending, profitability, onboarding, security, and we now serve account holders and borrowers across retail, small business and commercial segments, in addition to our open technology platform and BaaS offerings. While we remain focused on our founding mission of building stronger and more diverse communities by strengthening their financial institutions, we intend to draw on our broad solution portfolio, deep domain expertise and robust customer base to lead the transformation into a new frontier of financial services.\nThe financial services industry is undergoing tremendous change, influenced by three major factors. First, financial institutions demand now, more than ever, to digitize their operations and offerings, and the COVID-19 pandemic has further accelerated this digital transformation. Second, the continued growth in the number of FinTechs and the innovation they bring to the market is increasing End-User demand and expectations for new, more engaging and meaningful digital financial experiences. And third, major innovative Brands recognize that incorporating banking into their strategy is an opportunity to leverage the trust that their End Users place in them, driving deeper engagement with those End Users. These three forces are converging to create what we believe is a new frontier in financial services in which financial institutions, FinTechs and Brands will have new roles and interdependencies, and which will require new technology, new partners, and new business models. We believe that lasting value creation in financial services will be achieved by those companies that can support and enhance the convergence of these forces. In addition, we have built a broad set of solutions that we believe equips us to accelerate and optimize this convergence - from digitizing the entire bank, to facilitating partnerships among financial institutions and FinTechs, to enabling Brands to incorporate banking into their products and customer relationships.\nWe deliver our solutions to most of our customers using a software-as-a-service, or SaaS, model under which our customers pay subscription fees for the use of our solutions. Our digital banking platform customers have numerous End Users, and those End Users can represent one or more account holders registered to use one or more of our solutions on our digital banking platform. We generally price our digital banking platform solutions based on the number of solutions purchased by our customers and the number of Registered Users or commercial account holders utilizing our solutions. We generally earn additional revenues from our digital banking platform customers based on the number of transactions that End Users perform on our solutions in excess of the levels included in our standard subscription fee. As a result, our revenues from digital banking platform customers grow as our customers buy more solutions from us and increase the number of End Users utilizing our solutions and as those users increase their number of transactions on our solutions. The structure and terms of our newer lending arrangements vary, but generally are also sold on a subscription basis through our direct sales organization, and the related revenues are recognized over the terms of the customer agreements. The structure and terms of our Helix arrangements with FinTechs and Brands vary, but typically involve relatively lower contracted minimum revenues and instead emphasize usage-based revenue, with such revenue recognized as it is incurred.\nWe have achieved significant growth since our inception. During each of the past nine years, our average number of Registered Users (as defined below) per installed customer on our digital banking platform, or Installed Customer, has grown, and in many instances we have been able to sell additional solutions to existing customers. Our revenues per Installed Customer and per Registered User vary period-to-period based on the length and timing of customer implementations, changes in the average number of Registered Users per customer, sales of additional solutions to existing customers, changes in the number of transactions on our solutions by Registered Users and variations among existing customers and new customers with respect to the mix of purchased solutions and related pricing. Please see \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Key Operating Measures\" for additional detail on how we define \"Installed Customers\" and \"Registered Users.\"\nWe believe we have a significant opportunity to continue to grow our business, and we continue to invest across our organization to increase our revenues and improve our operating efficiencies. These investments will increase our costs on an absolute dollar basis, but the timing and amount of these investments will vary based on the rate at which we expect to add new customers, the implementation and support needs of our customers, our software development plans, our technology and physical infrastructure requirements and the internal needs of our organization. Many of these investments will occur in advance of our realizing any resultant benefit which may make it difficult to determine if we are effectively allocating our resources. If we are successful in growing our revenues by increasing the number of customers and scope of our customer relationships, we anticipate that greater economies of scale and increased operating leverage will improve our margins over the long term.\nWe sell our solutions primarily through our professional sales organization. While the financial institutions market is well-defined due to the regulatory classifications of those financial institutions, markets for FinTech, Alt-FIs and brands are broader and more difficult to define due to the changing number of providers in each market. Over the long term, we intend to continue to invest in additional sales representatives to identify and address the financial institution, FinTech, Alt-FI and Brand markets across the U.S. and internationally and to increase our number of sales support and marketing personnel, as well as our investment in marketing initiatives designed to increase awareness of our solutions and generate new customer opportunities.\nWe have continuously invested in expanding and improving our digital banking platform since its introduction in 2005, and we intend to continue investing both organically and inorganically through acquisitions to expand our portfolio of solutions. Additionally, over the past several years we have acquired or developed new solutions and additional functionality that serve a broader range of needs of financial institutions as well as the needs of FinTechs, Alt-FIs and Brands. Our integrated, end-to-end collection of solutions includes retail, small business and commercial banking, regulatory and compliance, digital lending, relationship pricing, BaaS, digital account opening, account switching and data-driven sales enablement and portfolio management solutions among others. We have also introduced the Q2 Innovation Studio, an API-based and SDK-based open technology platform that allows our financial institution customers and other technology partners to develop unique extensions of and integrations to our digital banking platform, allowing financial institutions to quickly and easily deploy customized experiences and the latest financial services expected by End Users.\nWe believe that financial services providers are best served by a broad integrated portfolio of digital solutions that provide rapid, flexible and comprehensive integration with internal and third-party solutions allowing them to provide modern, intuitive digital financial services in a secure, regulatory-compliant manner. We also believe that the breadth and depth of our solution offerings and customer base, our open and flexible platform approach, our position as a leading provider of digital banking solutions to a large network of financial institutions, and our expertise in delivering new, innovative, secure and regulatory-compliant digital solutions uniquely position us to capitalize on the new frontier in financial services. We currently intend to increase investments in technology innovation and software development as we enhance our solutions and platforms and increase or expand the number of solutions that we offer.\nWe believe that delivery of consistent, high-quality customer support is a significant driver of purchasing and renewal decisions of our prospects and customers. To develop and maintain a reputation for high-quality service, we seek to build deep relationships with our customers through our customer service organization, which we staff with personnel who are motivated by our common mission of using technology to help our customers succeed and who are knowledgeable with respect to the regulated and complex nature of the financial services industry. As our business grows, we currently intend to continue to invest in and grow our services and delivery organization to support our customers' needs and maintain our reputation.\nCOVID-19 Pandemic\nGlobal health concerns with respect to the COVID-19 pandemic and related government actions taken to reduce the spread of the virus have caused disruption to the macroeconomic environment, and the pandemic has significantly increased economic uncertainty and reduced economic activity, including consumer and business spending. While there has been significant economic recovery in certain markets due to broad vaccination availability, loosening of lock-down measures and business re-openings, the recovery is characterized by additional uncertainty as a result of the disruption caused by the pandemic, including supply chain constraints in many industries, significant price increases for certain goods and services, rapid increases in demand as economies re-open, increased employee attrition, skilled labor shortages, wage inflation and businesses and labor markets navigating how they will operate post-pandemic. The extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operational and financial performance will depend on future developments unknown and unpredictable at this time, including the continued duration, severity and spread of the pandemic, including new variants, related restrictions on travel and transportation and other actions that may be taken by governmental authorities, the predictability and success of any re-opening efforts, the impacts of the pandemic on labor markets, the impact to our customers, their End Users, our suppliers and partners, and other items identified under \"Risk Factors\" above. Based on the information available to us to date, we believe we have taken an informed, proactive and effective approach to addressing the direct known effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on us, our customers and other third parties on which we rely and that we have been able to effectively deliver and support our solutions for our customers utilizing numerous remote capabilities and channels.\nBeginning mid-March 2020, almost all of our employees transitioned to working remotely from home. Through mid-2021, we continued to operate with the vast majority of our employees working remotely. However, during the quarter ended June 30, 2021, we began allowing employees to return to onsite work on a limited, voluntary basis, subject to health and safety protocols. Effective November 1, 2021, we re-opened all of our U.S. facilities, and have provided each of our U.S. employees with the choice of either continuing to work remotely, working in a hybrid capacity (one or two days per week onsite) or fully returning to onsite attendance, with any onsite attendance subject to health and safety protocols. With the rapid spread of the Omicron variant in early 2022, we have instituted additional safety protocols for employees choosing to work onsite, and have strongly encouraged our employees to work remotely when possible until the Omicron surge has passed. As we navigate the reopening of our onsite facilities, we believe employee preferences between remote, hybrid and onsite attendance are likely to change over time, and we will continue to adapt our physical facilities and IT infrastructure to accommodate a safe and successful work experience for our onsite, hybrid and remote employees. Throughout the pandemic we believe our corporate culture, business model, customer relations, and technology and information technology infrastructure have effectively allowed our employees to substantially perform their roles whether remote, hybrid or onsite.\nWe also have performed additional due diligence with critical vendors and other third parties on which we rely to assess their responses to the COVID-19 pandemic and impacts on their operations and services. To date, we have not experienced any material adverse impacts from any of our vendors or other third parties on which we rely. We intend to continue to conduct enhanced due diligence on such vendors and third parties for the foreseeable future as the uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic continues to persist.\nWe also are continuing to conduct outreach to our customers and many prospective customers to assess their needs in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic and their own re-opening efforts and to seek to identify ways that we may assist them with our solutions and services. We believe the impacts of COVID-19 and related re-opening efforts on our existing and prospective customers present both challenges and opportunities. While we believe the pandemic and related re-opening efforts have increased the importance and prominence of digital financial solutions, the increased economic uncertainty, reduced economic activity, including consumer and business spending, and challenges associated with re-opening have resulted in delays in certain purchasing decisions and implementations during 2020 and 2021. During the second half of 2021, we observed an improved sales environment relative to 2020 and the first half of 2021, and we believe that for 2022 the sales environment and the timing of purchasing decisions and implementations by customers will similarly reflect an improvement relative to 2020 and the first half of 2021. However, the duration and impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic continue to be highly unpredictable and may continue to disrupt any seasonality trends that may otherwise typically be inherent in our historical operating results.\nDespite these challenges among customers, the usage by End Users of digital financial solutions has never been higher and we are making additional investments to enhance our technology infrastructure to support this heightened usage. We have seen increased online banking activity as a result of shelter-in-place and similar orders as well as spikes in logins as End Users check accounts for items such as government stimulus funds. We believe the challenges and opportunities posed by the COVID-19 pandemic have and will continue to cause financial institutions to increase their focus on maintaining and improving their digital financial services offerings.\nKey Operating Measures\nIn addition to the U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, measures described below in \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Components of Operating Results,\" we monitor the following operating measures to evaluate growth trends, plan investments and measure the effectiveness of our sales and marketing efforts.\nWhile we believe the pandemic and related re-opening efforts have increased the importance and prominence of digital financial solutions, the increased economic uncertainty, reduced economic activity, including consumer and business spending, and challenges associated with re-opening resulted in delays in certain purchasing decisions and implementations and contract terminations during 2020 and 2021. During the second half of 2021, we observed an improved sales environment relative to 2020 and the first half of 2021, and we believe that for 2022 the sales environment and the predictability of purchasing decisions and implementations by customers will similarly reflect an improvement relative to 2020 and the first half of 2021, and thus we will see positive impacts on the rate at which we add new Installed Customers, and with them new Registered Users and annualized recurring revenue, in each case as compared to these prior periods.\nInstalled Customers\nWe define Installed Customers as the number of customers on live implementations (or installations) of our digital banking platforms. The average size of our Installed Customers, measured in both Registered Users per Installed Customer and revenues per Installed Customer, has increased over time as our existing Installed Customers continue to add Registered Users and commercial account holders, buy more solutions from us, and as we add larger financial institutions to our Installed Customer base. The net rate at which we add Installed Customers varies based on our implementation capacity, the size and unique needs of our customers, the readiness of our customers to implement our solutions and customer attrition, including as a result of merger and acquisition activity among financial institutions. We had 448, 450 and 414 Installed Customers on our digital banking platform as of December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nRegistered Users\nWe define a Registered User as an individual related to an account holder of an Installed Customer on our consumer digital banking platform who has registered to use one or more of our solutions and has current access to use those solutions as of the last day of the reporting period presented. We generally price our consumer digital banking platform solutions based on the number of Registered Users, while our commercial digital banking platform solutions are based on the number of commercial account holders. As the number of Registered Users of our solutions increases, our revenues generally tend to grow. Our average number of Registered Users per Installed Customer grows as our existing digital banking platform customers add more Registered Users and as we add larger financial institutions to our Installed Customer base. We anticipate that the number of Registered Users will grow at a faster rate than our number of Installed Customers. The rate at which our customers add Registered Users vary significantly period-to-period based on the timing of our implementations of new customers, the timing of registration of new End Users and customers performing inactive account clean-up. We add new Registered Users through both organic growth from existing customers and from the addition of End Users from new Installed Customers. Our aggregate number of Registered Users is negatively impacted to the extent Installed Customers terminate all or a portion of their arrangements with us. Our Installed Customers had approximately 19.2 million, 17.8 million and 14.6 million Registered Users as of December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nNet Revenue Retention Rate\nWe believe that our ability to retain our customers and expand their use of our products and services over time is an indicator of the stability of our revenue base and the long-term value of our customer relationships. We assess our performance in this area using a metric we refer to as our net revenue retention rate, which we previously referred to as our revenue retention rate. We calculate our net revenue retention rate as the total revenues in a calendar year, excluding any revenues from acquired customers during such year, from customers who were implemented on any of our solutions as of December 31 of the prior year, expressed as a percentage of the total revenues during the prior year from the same group of customers. Our net revenue retention rate provides insight into the impact on current year revenues of: the number of new customers implemented on any of our solutions during the prior year; the timing of our implementation of those new customers in the prior year; growth in the number of End Users on such solutions and changes in their usage of such solutions; sales of new products and services to our existing customers during the current year, excluding any products or services resulting from businesses acquired during such year and customer attrition. The most significant drivers of changes in our net revenue retention rate each year have historically been the number of new customers in the prior year and the timing of our implementation of those new customers. The timing of our implementation of new customers in the prior year is significant because we do not start recognizing revenues from new customers until they are implemented. If implementations are weighted more heavily in the first or second half of the prior year, our net revenue retention rate will be lower or higher, respectively. In the first half of 2021, our implementations were weighted more heavily, and we expect to see a lower net revenue retention rate in 2022 as a result. Our use of net revenue retention rate has limitations as an analytical tool, and investors should not consider it in isolation. Other companies in our industry may calculate net revenue retention rate differently, which reduces its usefulness as a comparative measure. Our net revenue retention rate was 119%, 122%, and 120% for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nAnnualized Recurring Revenue\nWe believe Annualized Recurring Revenue, or ARR, provides important information about our future revenue potential, our ability to acquire new clients, and our ability to maintain and expand our relationship with existing clients. We calculate ARR as the annualized value of all recurring revenue recognized in the last month of the reporting period, with the exception of variable revenue in excess of contracted amounts for which we instead take the average monthly run rate of the trailing three months within that reporting period. Our ARR also includes the contracted minimums associated with all contracts in place at the end of the quarter that have not yet commenced, and revenue generated from Premier Services. Premier Services revenue is generated from select established customer relationships where we have engaged with the customer for more tailored, premium professional services resulting in a deeper and ongoing level of engagement with them, which we deem to be recurring in nature. ARR does not include revenue from professional services or other sources of revenue that are not deemed to be recurring in nature. ARR is not a forecast of future revenue, which can be impacted by contract start and end dates and renewal rates. ARR should be viewed independently of revenue and deferred revenue as ARR is an operating metric and is not intended to be combined with or replace these items. Our use of ARR has limitations as an analytical tool, and investors should not consider it in isolation. Other companies in our industry may calculate ARR differently, which reduces its usefulness as a comparative measure. Our ARR was $574.2 million, $464.2 million and $400.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nRevenue Churn\nWe utilize revenue churn, which we previously have referred to simply as churn, to monitor the satisfaction of our customers and evaluate the effectiveness of our business strategies. We define revenue churn as the amount of any monthly recurring revenue losses due to customer cancellations and downgrades, net of upgrades and additions of new solutions, during a year, divided by our monthly recurring revenue at the beginning of the year. Cancellations refer to customers that have either stopped using our services completely or remained a customer but terminated a particular service. Downgrades are a result of customers taking less of a particular service or renewing their contract for identical services at a lower price. We had annual revenue churn of 5.4%, 5.9%, and 5.1% for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. Our use of revenue churn has limitations as an analytical tool, and investors should not consider it in isolation. Other companies in our industry may calculate revenue churn differently, which reduces its usefulness as a comparative measure.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nIn addition to financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP, we use certain non-GAAP financial measures to clarify and enhance our understanding, and aid in the period-to-period comparison, of our performance. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide supplemental information that is meaningful when assessing our operating performance because they exclude the impact of certain categories that our management and board of directors do not consider part of core operating results when assessing our operational performance, allocating resources, preparing annual budgets and determining compensation. Accordingly, these non-GAAP financial measures may provide insight to investors into the motivation and decision-making of management in operating the business. Set forth in the tables below are the corresponding GAAP financial measures for each non-GAAP financial measure. Investors are encouraged to review the reconciliation of each of these non-GAAP financial measures to its most comparable GAAP financial measure included below. While we believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful supplemental information, non-GAAP financial measures have limitations and should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, their most comparable GAAP measures. These non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP, do not reflect a comprehensive system of accounting and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies due to potential differences in their financing and accounting methods, the book value of their assets, their capital structures, the method by which their assets were acquired and the manner in which they define non-GAAP measures. Items such as the deferred revenue reduction from purchase accounting, stock-based compensation, acquisition related costs, amortization of acquired technology, amortization of acquired intangible assets, partnership termination charges and unoccupied lease charges can have a material impact on our GAAP financial results.\nNon-GAAP Revenue\nWe define non-GAAP revenue as total revenue excluding the impact of purchase accounting. We monitor these measures to assess our performance because we believe our revenue growth rates would be understated without these adjustments. We believe presenting non-GAAP revenue aids in the comparability between periods and in assessing our overall operating performance.\nTable 15: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Revenue: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>GAAP revenue </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>498,720 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>402,751 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>315,484 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Deferred revenue reduction from purchase accounting </td> <td> </td> <td>2,129 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,404 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,829 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Non-GAAP revenue </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>500,849 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>407,155 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>317,313 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nNon-GAAP Operating Income\nWe provide non-GAAP operating income using non-GAAP revenue as discussed above and excluding such items as deferred revenue reduction from purchase accounting, stock-based compensation, acquisition related costs, amortization of acquired technology, amortization of acquired intangible assets, partnership termination charges and unoccupied lease charges. We believe excluding these items is useful for the following reasons:\n\u2022Deferred revenue reduction from purchase accounting. We provide non-GAAP information that excludes the deferred revenue reduction from purchase accounting. We believe that the exclusion of deferred revenue reduction from purchase accounting allows users of our financial statements to better review and understand the historical and current results of our continuing operations.\n\u2022Amortization of acquired technology and intangible assets. We provide non-GAAP information that excludes expenses related to purchased technology and intangible assets associated with our acquisitions. We believe that eliminating these expenses from our non-GAAP measures is useful to investors, because the amortization of acquired technology and intangible assets can be inconsistent in amount and frequency and significantly impacted by the timing and magnitude of our acquisition transactions, which also vary in frequency from period to period. Accordingly, we analyze the performance of our operations in each period without regard to such expenses.\n\u2022Stock-based compensation. We provide non-GAAP information that excludes expenses related to stock-based compensation. We believe that the exclusion of stock-based compensation expense provides for a better comparison of our operating results to prior periods and to our peer companies as the calculations of stock-based compensation vary from period to period and company to company due to different valuation methodologies, subjective assumptions and the variety of award types. Because of these unique characteristics of stock-based compensation, we exclude these expenses when analyzing the organization's business performance.\n\u2022Acquisition related costs. We exclude certain expense items resulting from our acquisitions, such as legal, accounting and consulting fees, changes in fair value of contingent consideration and retention expense. We consider these adjustments, to some extent, to be unpredictable and dependent on a significant number of factors that are outside of our control. Furthermore, acquisitions result in operating expenses that would not otherwise have been incurred by us in the normal course of our organic business operations. We believe that providing these non-GAAP measures that exclude acquisition related costs, allows users of our financial statements to better review and understand the historical and current results of our continuing operations, and also facilitates comparisons to our historical results and results of less acquisitive peer companies, both with and without such adjustments.\n\u2022Partnership termination charges. In the quarter ended June 30, 2020, in connection with the termination of a strategic partnership, we agreed to pay a termination fee of $5.6 million in May 2020 and $7.6 million in the third quarter of 2021. We are excluding the charges associated with this partnership termination as they are non-recurring in nature and would not otherwise have been incurred by us in the normal course of our organic business operations. We believe that providing these non-GAAP measures that exclude partnership termination charges allows users of our financial statements to better review and understand the historical and current results of our continuing operations, and also facilitates comparisons to our historical results and results of peer companies, both with and without such adjustments.\n\u2022Unoccupied lease charges. We provide non-GAAP information that excludes restructuring charges related to the estimated costs of exiting and terminating facility lease commitments, as they relate to our corporate restructuring and exit activities. These charges are inconsistent in amount and are significantly impacted by the timing and nature of these events. Therefore, although we may incur these types of expenses in the future, we believe that eliminating these charges for purposes of calculating the non-GAAP financial measures facilitates a more meaningful evaluation of our operating performance and comparisons to our past operating performance.\nTable 16: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>GAAP operating loss </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(77,995) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(99,833) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(66,746) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Deferred revenue reduction from purchase accounting </td> <td> </td> <td>2,129 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,404 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,829 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Stock-based compensation </td> <td> </td> <td>54,334 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>49,235 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>39,378 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Acquisition related costs </td> <td> </td> <td>3,099 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,408 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16,316 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of acquired technology </td> <td> </td> <td>21,969 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>21,341 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9,871 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of acquired intangibles </td> <td> </td> <td>17,901 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>17,888 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,339 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Partnership termination charges </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13,244 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unoccupied lease charges </td> <td> </td> <td>2,008 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,181 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>420 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-GAAP operating income </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>23,445 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>9,868 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>7,407 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nAdjusted EBITDA\nWe define adjusted EBITDA as net loss before depreciation, amortization, stock-based compensation, certain costs related to our recent acquisitions, (benefit from) provision for income taxes, interest and other (income) expense, net, deferred revenue reduction from purchase accounting, partnership termination charges, loss on extinguishment of debt, and unoccupied lease charges. We believe that adjusted EBITDA provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating our operating results for the following reasons:\n\u2022adjusted EBITDA is widely used by investors and securities analysts to measure a company's operating performance without regard to items that can vary substantially from company to company depending upon their financing, capital structures and the method by which assets were acquired;\n\u2022our management uses adjusted EBITDA in conjunction with GAAP financial measures for planning purposes, in the preparation of our annual operating budget, as a measure of our operating performance, to assess the effectiveness of our business strategies and to communicate with our board of directors concerning our financial performance;\n\u2022adjusted EBITDA provides more consistency and comparability with our past financial performance, facilitates period-to-period comparisons of our operations and also facilitates comparisons with other companies, many of which use similar non-GAAP financial measures to supplement their GAAP results; and\n\u2022our investor and analyst presentations include adjusted EBITDA as a supplemental measure of our overall operating performance.\nAdjusted EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to net loss or any other measure of financial performance calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. The use of adjusted EBITDA as an analytical tool has limitations such as:\n\u2022depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, and the assets being depreciated or amortized will often have to be replaced in the future and adjusted EBITDA does not reflect cash requirements for such replacements;\n\u2022adjusted EBITDA may not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs or contractual commitments;\n\u2022adjusted EBITDA does not reflect the potentially dilutive impact of stock-based compensation;\n\u2022adjusted EBITDA does not reflect interest or tax payments that could reduce cash available for use; and\n\u2022other companies, including companies in our industry, might calculate adjusted EBITDA or similarly titled measures differently, which reduces their usefulness as comparative measures.\nBecause of these and other limitations, you should consider adjusted EBITDA together with our GAAP financial measures including cash flow from operations and net loss. The following table presents a reconciliation of net loss to adjusted EBITDA for each of the periods indicated (in thousands):\nTable 17: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Reconciliation of net loss to adjusted EBITDA: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net loss </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(112,746) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(137,620) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(70,877) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization </td> <td> </td> <td>54,833 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>51,840 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>28,457 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Stock-based compensation expense </td> <td> </td> <td>54,334 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>49,235 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>39,378 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Acquisition related costs </td> <td> </td> <td>3,099 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,408 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16,316 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Benefit from) provision for income taxes </td> <td> </td> <td>1,643 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,416 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(12,487) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest and other (income) expense, net </td> <td> </td> <td>31,063 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>27,180 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16,572 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Deferred revenue reduction from purchase accounting </td> <td> </td> <td>2,129 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,404 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,829 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Partnership termination charges </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13,244 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loss on extinguishment of debt </td> <td> </td> <td>1,513 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,932 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Unoccupied lease charges </td> <td> </td> <td>2,008 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,181 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>420 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted EBITDA </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>37,876 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>22,220 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>19,608 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nComponents of Operating Results\nRevenues\nRevenue-generating activities directly relate to the sale, implementation and support of our solutions within a single operating segment. We derive the majority of our revenues from subscription fees for the use of our solutions hosted in either our data centers or with cloud-based services, transactional revenue from bill-pay solutions, and revenues for customer support and implementation services related to our solutions. We recognize the corresponding revenues over time on a ratable basis over the customer agreement term. A small portion of our revenues are derived from customers which host and manage our solutions on-premises or in third-party data centers under term license and maintenance agreements. We recognize the software license revenue once the customer obtains control of the license and the remaining arrangement consideration for maintenance revenue over time on a ratable basis over the term of the software license.\nSubscription fees are based on the number of solutions purchased by our customers, the number of End Users using the solutions and the number of bill-pay and certain other transactions those users conduct using our solutions in excess of the levels included in our standard subscription fee. Subscription fees are billed monthly, quarterly or annually and are recognized monthly over the term of our customer agreements. The initial term of our digital banking platform agreements averages over five years, although it varies by customer. The structure and terms of our newer lending arrangements vary, but generally are also sold on a subscription basis through our direct sales organization, and the related revenues are recognized over the terms of the customer agreements. The structure and terms of our Helix arrangements with FinTechs and Brands vary, but typically involve relatively lower contracted minimum revenues and instead emphasize usage-based revenue, with such revenue recognized as it is incurred. We begin recognizing subscription fees when the control of the service transfers to the customer, generally when the solution is implemented and made available to the customer. We recognize revenue for bill-pay transaction services generated when End Users utilize debit cards integrated with its Q2 CorePro API or Q2 Biller Direct products in the month incurred based on actual or estimated transactions. The timing of our implementations varies period-to-period based on our implementation capacity, the number of solutions purchased by our customers, the size and unique needs of our customers\nand the readiness of our customers to implement our solutions. We recognize any related implementation services revenues ratably over the initial customer agreement term beginning on the date we commence recognizing subscription fees. Contract asset balances arise primarily when we provide services in advance of billing for those services. Amounts that have been invoiced but not paid are recorded in accounts receivable or other long-term assets, depending on the timing of expected billing, and in revenues or deferred revenues, depending on when control of the service transfers to the customer.\nAs a result of the economic and operational impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our customers, in 2020 and 2021 our bookings, in particular with respect to new customer agreements, were adversely impacted relative to pre-pandemic levels. Specifically, we experienced delays and unpredictability in the purchasing decisions of our customers and prospective customers and a slowing of net new customer deals, relative to pre-pandemic levels, partially offset by an increase in cross sales of additional features and functionality to our existing customer base due to the increased utilization and demand for digital banking solutions caused by the decreased in-branch operations resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. However, during the second half of 2021, we observed an improved sales environment relative to 2020 and the first half of 2021. We believe that for 2022 the sales environment and the predictability of purchasing decisions and implementations by customers will similarly reflect an improvement relative to 2020 and the first half of 2021. However, our revenues for 2022 will continue to reflect the negative impacts from these prior periods and the duration and impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic continue to be highly unpredictable and may continue to disrupt any seasonality trends that may otherwise typically be inherent in our historical operating results.\nCost of Revenues\nCost of revenues is comprised primarily of salaries and other personnel-related costs, including employee benefits, bonuses and stock-based compensation, for employees providing services to our customers. This includes the costs of our personnel performing implementation, certain software development, customer support, data center and customer training activities. Cost of revenues also includes the direct costs of bill-pay and other third-party intellectual property included in our solutions, the amortization of deferred solution and services costs, co-location facility costs and depreciation of our data center assets, debit card related pass-through fees, cloud-based hosting services, an allocation of general overhead costs, the amortization of acquired technology, and referral fees. We allocate general overhead expenses to all departments based on the number of employees in each department, which we consider to be a fair and representative means of allocation.\nWe capitalize certain personnel costs directly related to the implementation of our solutions to the extent those costs are recoverable from future revenues. We amortize the costs for an implementation once revenue recognition commences, and we amortize those implementation costs to cost of revenues over the expected period of customer benefit, which has been determined to be the estimated life of the technology. Other costs not directly recoverable from future revenues are expensed in the period incurred.\nWe capitalize certain software development costs related to programmers, software engineers, quality control teams and third-party development costs for those who are directly associated with and who devote time to our software solutions on an individual product basis. Software development costs are amortized to cost of revenues when products, upgrades and enhancements are released or made available over the products' estimated economic lives.\nWe intend to continue to increase our investments in our implementation and customer support teams and technology infrastructure to serve our customers and support our growth. Over the long-term, we expect cost of revenues to continue to grow in absolute dollars as we grow our business, but to fluctuate as a percentage of revenues based principally on the level and timing of implementation support activities, debit card related pass-through fees, and other related costs, including during periods where revenues are lower or implementations are delayed due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nOperating Expenses\nOperating expenses consist of sales and marketing, research and development and general and administrative expenses. They also include costs related to our acquisitions and the resulting amortization of acquired intangible assets from those acquisitions. Over the long term, we intend to continue to hire new employees and make other investments to support our anticipated growth. As a result, we expect our operating expenses to increase in absolute dollars but to decrease as a percentage of revenues over the long term as we grow our business.\nThe uncertainties and risks posed by the continuing COVID-19 pandemic were considered while preparing our 2022 budget and hiring plans. Beginning in 2021, our hiring began to return to more normal levels, and we anticipate this trend to continue in 2022, with our hiring plans more closely resembling pre-pandemic levels. However, during the second half of 2021, we experienced an exceptionally challenging hiring environment and we expect to see continued intense competition for technical talent in 2022, which has the potential to drive increased inflation in the wages we have to pay to hire and retain qualified employees. Additionally, while throughout 2021 most of our employees continued to work remotely from home and we suspended most non-essential business travel and conference participation, we expect that in 2022 some of these activities,\nincluding costs associated with onsite attendance, will return. As a result, we anticipate that we will continue to see a gradual increase in certain costs associated with operating physical locations and facilitating employee travel during 2022. As we navigate the reopening of our onsite facilities, we believe employee preferences between remote, hybrid and onsite attendance are likely to change over time, and we will continue to adapt our physical facilities and IT infrastructure to accommodate a safe and successful work experience for our onsite, hybrid and remote employees.\nSales and Marketing\nSales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries and other personnel-related costs, including commissions, employee benefits, bonuses and stock-based compensation. Sales and marketing expenses also include expenses related to advertising, lead generation, promotional event programs, corporate communications, travel and allocated overhead.\nSales and marketing expenses as a percentage of total revenues will change in any given period based on several factors including the addition of newly hired sales professionals, the number and timing of newly-installed customers and the amount of sales commissions expense amortized related to those customers, including during periods where revenues are lower or implementations are delayed due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Commissions are generally capitalized and then amortized over the expected period of customer benefit.\nResearch and Development\nWe believe that continuing to improve and enhance our solutions is essential to maintaining our reputation for innovation and growing our customer base and revenues. Research and development expenses include salaries and personnel-related costs, including employee benefits, bonuses and stock-based compensation, third-party contractor expenses, software development costs, allocated overhead and other related expenses incurred in developing new solutions and enhancing existing solutions.\nCertain research and development costs that are related to our software development, which include salaries and other personnel-related costs, including employee benefits and bonuses attributed to programmers, software engineers and quality control teams working on our software solutions, are capitalized and are included in intangible assets, net on the consolidated balance sheets.\nGeneral and Administrative\nGeneral and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and other personnel-related costs, including employee benefits, bonuses and stock-based compensation, of our administrative, finance and accounting, information systems, legal and human resources employees. General and administrative expenses also include consulting and professional fees, insurance and travel. We expect to continue to incur incremental expenses associated with the growth of our business and to meet increased compliance requirements associated with operating as a regulated, public company.\nAcquisition Related Costs\nAcquisition related costs include compensation expenses related to milestone provisions and retention agreements with certain former shareholders and employees of acquired businesses, which are recognized as earned, changes in fair value of the contingent consideration related to potential acquisition earnout payments and various legal and professional service expenses incurred in connection with the acquisitions, which are recognized when incurred.\nAmortization of Acquired Intangibles\nAmortization of acquired intangibles represents the amortization of intangibles recorded in connection with our business acquisitions which are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the related assets.\nPartnership Termination Charges\nPartnership termination charges represent the fees paid related to termination of a strategic partnership during the quarter ended June 30, 2020. These charges are non-recurring in nature and would not otherwise have been incurred by us in the normal course of our organic business operations.\nUnoccupied Lease Charges\nUnoccupied lease charges include costs related to the early vacating of certain facilities, partially offset by anticipated sublease income from the associated facilities.\nTotal Other Income (Expense), Net\nTotal other income (expense), net, consists primarily of interest income and expense, other non-operating income and expense, loss on disposal of long-lived assets, foreign currency translation adjustment and loss on extinguishment of debt. We earn interest income on our cash, cash equivalents and investments. Interest expense consists primarily of the interest from the amortization of debt discount, issuance costs, and coupon interest attributable to our convertible notes issued in February 2018, or 2023 Notes, our convertible notes issued in June 2019, or 2026 Notes, and our convertible notes issued in November 2020, or 2025 Notes, as well as fees and interest associated with the letter of credit issued to our landlord for the security deposit for our corporate headquarters.\nBenefit from (Provision for) Income Taxes\nAs a result of our current net operating loss position, current income tax expenses and benefits consist primarily of state income tax expense, deferred income tax expense relating to the tax amortization of recently acquired goodwill, and income tax expense from foreign operations. We incurred state and foreign income taxes for each of the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019. Our net operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax purposes were $633.8 million and $536.5 million at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, which $201.2 million will expire at various dates beginning in 2026, if not utilized, and $432.6 million have an indefinite carryforward period. Federal net operating losses generated during and after the year ended December 31, 2018 will have an indefinite carryforward period. We also held state tax credit carry overs of $3.0 million and $2.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and federal R&D tax credit carry overs of $8.9 million and $8.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The state tax credits will begin to expire 2033 if not utilized and the federal R&D tax credits will begin to expire in 2036, if not utilized.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates\nOur management's discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses. In accordance with GAAP, we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results might differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nOur significant accounting policies are described in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, and we believe that the accounting policies discussed below involve the greatest degree of complexity and exercise of significant judgments and estimates by our management. The methods, estimates and judgments that we use in applying our accounting policies have a significant impact on our results of operations and, accordingly, we believe the policies described below are the most critical for understanding and evaluating our financial condition and results of operations.\nRevenue Recognition\nRevenues are recognized when control of the promised goods or services is transferred to our customers, in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services over the term of the agreement, generally when our solutions are implemented and made available to our customers. The promised consideration may include fixed amounts, variable amounts or both. Revenues are recognized net of sales credits and allowances.\nRevenue-generating activities are directly related to the sale, implementation and support of our solutions within a single operating segment. We derive the majority of our revenues from subscription fees for the use of our solutions hosted in either our data centers or cloud-based hosting services, transactional revenue from bill-pay solutions and revenues for customer support and implementation services related to our solutions.\nSubscription Revenues\nOur software solutions are available for use as hosted application arrangements under subscription fee agreements without licensing perpetual rights to the software. Subscription fees from these applications, including contractual periodic price increases, are recognized over time on a ratable basis over the customer agreement term beginning on the date our solution is made available to the customer. Amounts that have been invoiced are recorded in accounts receivable and deferred revenues or revenues, depending on whether the revenue recognition criteria have been met. Periodic price increases are estimated at contract inception and result in contract assets as revenue recognition may exceed the amount billed early in the contract. Additional fees for monthly usage above the levels included in the standard subscription fee are recognized as revenue in the month when the usage amounts are determined and reported.\nA small portion of our customers host and manage our solutions on-premises or in third-party data centers under term license and maintenance agreements. Term licenses sold with maintenance entitle the customer to technical support, upgrades and updates to the software on a when-and-if-available basis. We recognize software license revenue once the customer obtains control of the license, which generally occurs at the start of each license term. We recognize the remaining arrangement consideration for maintenance revenue over time on a ratable basis over the term of the software license. If the expected length of time between when we transfer the software license to the customer and when the customer pays for it results in a significant financing component, we adjust the promised amount of consideration for the effects of the time value of money, which reflects the price the customer would have paid when the license was transferred. Revenues from term licenses and maintenance agreements and the related financing component were not significant in the periods presented.\nTransactional Revenues\nWe generate the majority of our transactional revenues based on the number of bill-pay transactions that End Users initiate on our digital banking platform. We also generate a smaller portion of our transactional revenues from interchange fees generated when End Users utilize debit cards integrated with our Q2 CorePro API or Q2 Biller Direct products. We recognize revenue for bill-pay transaction services in the month incurred based on actual or estimated transactions.\nServices and Other Revenues\nImplementation services are required for each new digital banking and lending platform and Centrix standalone contract, and there is a significant level of integration and configuration for each customer. Our revenue for upfront implementation services is billed upfront and generally recognized over time on a ratable basis over the customer agreement term for our hosted application agreements. Upfront implementation services for on-premises agreements are recognized at commencement date. Under certain circumstances, we partner with third-party professional system integrators to support the installation and configuration process for certain products, and therefore, we have determined that these services qualify as a separate performance obligation in certain markets and geographies, and the implementation services for these agreements are recognized over time as services are performed.\nProfessional services revenues, which primarily consist of training, advisory services, core conversion services, web design, and other general professional services, are generally billed and recognized when delivered.\nCertain out-of-pocket expenses billed to customers are recorded as revenues rather than an offset to the related expense.\nSignificant Judgments\nPerformance Obligations and Standalone Selling Price\nA performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct good or service to the customer and is the unit of accounting. Determining whether products and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately versus together may require significant judgment. We have contracts with customers that often include multiple performance obligations, usually including multiple subscription and implementation services. For these contracts, we account for individual performance obligations that are separately identifiable by allocating the contract's total transaction price to each performance obligation in an amount based on the relative standalone selling price, or SSP, of each distinct good or service in the contract. In determining whether implementation services are distinct from subscription services, we considered various factors including the significant level of integration, interdependency, and interrelation between the implementation and subscription service, as well as the inability of the customer's personnel or other service providers to perform significant portions of the services. We have concluded that the implementation services included in contracts with multiple performance obligations in the North American banking market are not distinct and, as a result, we defer any arrangement fees for implementation services and recognize such amounts over time on a ratable basis as one performance obligation with the underlying subscription revenue for the initial agreement term of the hosted application agreements. We have concluded that outside the North American banking market, the implementation services for our lending platform included in contracts with multiple performance obligations are distinct and, as a result, we recognize implementation fees on such arrangements over time as services are performed.\nThe majority of our revenue recognized at a particular point in time is for usage revenue and on-premise software licenses. These services are recognized at the point in time in which the customer obtains control of the asset, which is generally upon completion of the service or the point the customer obtained control of the software.\nJudgment is required to determine the SSP for each distinct performance obligation. A contract's transaction price is allocated to each distinct performance obligation and recognized as revenue when, or as, the performance obligation is satisfied. The primary method used to estimate SSP is the adjusted market assessment approach, which considers its overall pricing objectives, market conditions and other factors, including the value of our contracts, our discounting practices, the size and volume of our transactions, customer characteristics, price lists, go-to-market strategy, historical standalone sales and agreement prices, and the number and types of users within our contracts.\nVariable Consideration\nWe recognize usage revenue related to bill-pay transactions that End Users initiate on our digital banking platform and interchange fees that End Users generate using our solutions. Judgment is required to determine the accounting for these types of revenue. We consider various factors including the degree to which usage is interdependent or interrelated to past services, costs to us per user over the contract, and contractual price per user changes and their relationship to market terms, forecasted data, and our cost to fulfill the obligation. We have concluded that our usage revenue relates specifically to the transfer of the service to the customer and is consistent with the allocation objective of Topic 606 when considering all of the performance obligations and payment terms in the contract. Therefore, we"}
