Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nGeneral\nThis discussion and analysis reflects Kearny Financial Corp.'s consolidated financial statements and other relevant statistical data, and is intended to enhance your understanding of our financial condition and results of operations. You should read the information in this section in conjunction with the business and financial information regarding Kearny Financial Corp. and the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOverview\nFinancial Condition. Total assets increased $262.9 million to $4.50 billion at June 30, 2016 from $4.24 billion at June 30, 2015. The increase in total assets reflected an increase in net loans receivable that was partially offset by decreases in securities and cash and cash equivalents. The increase in total assets was largely funded by increases in deposits and borrowings that were partially offset by a decrease in stockholders' equity. The decrease in stockholders' equity primarily reflected the Company's share repurchases that outpaced the accretion from earnings during the year.\nFor the year ended June 30, 2016, loans receivable, excluding loans held for sale, increased by $571.1 million to $2.67 billion, or 64.6% of earning assets, at June 30, 2016 from $2.10 billion, or 54.1% of earning assets, at June 30, 2015. The growth in loans during fiscal 2016 continued to reflect our strategic emphasis in growing our commercial loan portfolio, including multi-family loans, nonresidential mortgage loans and commercial business loans. The increase in commercial mortgage and commercial business loans during fiscal 2016 totaled $540.6 million, or 38.4%, to $1.95 billion, or 73.0% of total loans at June 30, 2016, from to $1.41 billion, or 67.0% of total loans, at June 30, 2015. For those same comparative periods, one- to four-family mortgage loans, including first mortgages and home equity loans and lines of credit, increased by $10.8 million to $694.8 million, or 26.0% of total loans, from $684.0 million, or 32.5% of total loans.\nFor those same comparative periods, total securities decreased by $175.2 million to $1.26 billion, or 30.3% of earning assets, at June 30, 2016 from $1.43 billion, or 36.8% of earning assets, at June 30, 2015. We generally maintained the overall composition and allocation of our securities portfolio during fiscal 2016. Non-mortgage-backed securities, including U.S. agency debentures, corporate bonds, single-issuer trust preferred securities, collateralized loan obligations, municipal obligations, and asset-backed securities decreased by $83.4 million to $557.1 million, or 44.5% of securities, at June 30, 2016 from $640.5 million, or 44.8% of securities, at June 30, 2015. For those same comparative periods, the balance of mortgage-backed securities, comprised primarily of U.S. government and agency pass-through securities and collateralized mortgage obligations, decreased by $96.4 million to $693.7 million, or 55.5% of securities, from $790.1 million, or 55.2% of securities.\nFor the year ended June 30, 2016, our total deposits increased by $229.2 million to $2.69 billion from $2.47 billion at June 30, 2015. The net increase in deposits reflected a $23.4 million increase in the balance of non-maturity deposits, including a $20.2 million increase in the balance of non-interest-bearing accounts, coupled with a $205.8 million increase in certificates of deposit.\nThe balance of borrowings increased by $42.9 million to $614.4 million at June 30, 2016 from $571.5 million at June 30, 2015. The increase in borrowings was primarily attributable to a $42.4 million net increase in FHLB advances representing new advances drawn to fund a portion of the loan growth reported during fiscal 2016 that were partially offset by the balance of advances repaid during the year. Interest rate derivatives were used to effectively extend duration of the new borrowings drawn for interest rate risk management purposes. The increase in borrowings also reflected a $541,000 increase in the balance of overnight borrowings in the form of depositor sweep accounts.\nStockholders' equity decreased by $19.7 million to $1.15 billion at June 30, 2016 from $1.17 billion at June 30, 2015. The decrease in stockholders' equity largely reflected the impact of the Company's share repurchases during fiscal 2016. The Company initiated a new share repurchase program in May 2016 through which it intends to repurchase a total of 9,352,809 shares, or 10%, of its outstanding shares. Through June 30, 2016, the Company repurchased 1,706,182 shares, or 18.2% of the shares to be repurchased under the current program, at a total cost of $22.3 million and at an average cost of $13.06 per share. The net decrease in stockholders' equity also reflected a decrease in accumulated other comprehensive income arising from changes in the fair value of the Company's available for sale securities and derivatives portfolios.\nThe noted decreases in stockholders' equity were partially offset by net income of $15.8 million, of which $7.2 million were distributed as cash dividends to stockholders during fiscal 2016, as well as a $1.9 million decrease in unearned ESOP reflecting the effects of shares earned by plan participants during the year.\nAt June 30, 2016, the Company had 91,821,910 shares outstanding, comprising 93,528,092 shares originally issued less 1,706,182 shares repurchased and cancelled.\nResults of Operations. Our results of operations depend primarily on our net interest income. Net interest income is the difference between the interest income we earn on our interest-earning assets and the interest we pay on our interest-bearing liabilities. It is a function of the average balances of loans and investments versus deposits and borrowed funds outstanding in any one period and the yields earned on those loans and investments and the cost of those deposits and borrowed funds. Our results of operations are also affected by our provision for loan losses, non-interest income and non-interest expense.\nNet income for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016 was $15.8 million or $0.18 per diluted share; an increase of $10.2 million from $5.6 million, or $0.06 per diluted share, for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015. Net income for fiscal 2015 reflected a $10.0 million charitable contribution made by the Company to the KearnyBank Foundation in conjunction with the closing of the Company's second-step conversion and stock offering. The contribution included $5.0 million in cash and 500,000 shares of the Company's common stock valued at $10.00 per share for a total contribution of $10.0 million. After giving effect to the income tax benefit, the contribution reduced net income for the year ended June 30, 2015 by approximately $6.1 million or $0.07 per basic and diluted share.\nOur net interest income increased $14.4 million to $95.0 million for the year ended June 30, 2016 from $80.6 million for the year ended June 30, 2015. The increase in net interest income primarily reflected a $20.9 million increase in interest income to $126.9 million from $106.0 million. The increase in interest income primarily reflected an increase in the average balance of interest-earning assets coupled with an increase in their average yield. For the year ended June 30, 2016, the average balance of interest-earning assets increased by $603.4 million to $4.05 billion compared to $3.45 billion for the year ended June 30, 2015. For those same comparative periods, the average yield on interest-earning assets increased by five basis points to 3.13% from 3.08%.\nThe increase in interest income for the year ended June 30, 2016 was partially offset by a $6.5 million increase in interest expense. The increase in interest expense between the two periods reflected an increase in the average balance of interest-bearing liabilities coupled with an increase in their average cost. For the year ended June 30, 2016 the average balance of interest-bearing liabilities increased by $78.5 million to $2.97 billion compared to $2.90 billion for the year ended June 30, 2015. For those same comparative periods, the average cost of interest-bearing liabilities increased 19 basis points to 1.07% from 0.88%.\nThe net interest rate spread decreased 14 basis points to 2.06% for fiscal 2016 from 2.20% for fiscal 2015 while the net interest margin increased one basis point to 2.35% from 2.34% for those same comparative periods. The increase in the Company's net interest margin primarily reflected the beneficial impact to net interest income arising from the increase in the average balance of interest-earning assets that was attributable to the investment of the net capital proceeds raised in conjunction with the closing of the Company's second step conversion and stock offering in May 2016.\nThe provision for loan losses increased $4.6 million to $10.7 million for fiscal 2016 from $6.1 million for fiscal 2015. The net increase in the provision primarily reflected updates to historical and environmental loss factors utilized to measure impairment on collectively evaluated loans. The increase in provision expense also reflected the greater growth in such loans during fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015. The increase in provision expense attributable to these factors was partially offset by a net decrease in specific losses recognized on loans evaluated individually for impairment that largely reflected a higher level of recoveries recognized on such loans during fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015.\nNon-interest income increased $2.8 million to $10.7 million for fiscal 2016 from $7.9 million for fiscal 2015. The increase was partly attributable to an increase in the income arising from our investment in bank-owned life insurance due largely to the growth in the average balance of the cash surrender value of the various policies held by the Company. The increase in non-interest income also reflected an increase in fees and service charges that was primarily attributable to an increase in loan prepayment charges and increases in electronic banking fees and charges. Additionally, the increase in non-interest income reflected an increase in loan sale gains attributable to an increase in SBA loans originated and sold as well as reflecting gains on sale of residential mortgage loans arising from the initial implementation of the Company's mortgage banking business strategy during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. These increases in non-interest income were augmented by a decrease in net losses relating to write downs and sales of real estate owned between comparative periods. The noted increases in non-interest income were partially offset by a decrease in miscellaneous income that primarily reflected the recognition of a non-recurring adjustment to gain on bargain purchase during the year ended June 30, 2015 relating to the prior acquisition of Atlas Bank.\nNon-interest expense decreased by $5.7 million to $72.4 million for the year ended June 30, 2016 from $78.1 million for the year ended June 30, 2015. The decrease in non-interest expense primarily reflected the non-recurring $10.0 million charitable contribution that was made by the Company to the KearnyBank Foundation in conjunction with the closing of the Company's second-step conversion and stock offering that was included in miscellaneous expense in fiscal 2015. The decrease in miscellaneous expense also reflected a non-recurring recovery of pension plan expense during fiscal 2016 resulting from the Company's amendment of its Directors Consultation and Retirement Plan (the DCRP\u201d) during the year.\nThe noted decreases in non-interest expense were partially offset by increases in other categories including salaries and employee benefits, advertising and marketing, deposit insurance and director compensation expenses. The increase in compensation-related expense partly reflected the limited and controlled expansion of the Company's human resources within the Company's various business lines and, where needed, the supporting operating and risk management departments. The incremental increase in expense associated with these new resources was partially defrayed by the Company's efforts to improve overall operating efficiency during fiscal 2016 that resulted in a net decrease in the number of full time equivalent ( FTE\u201d) employees for the year.\nThe changes in non-interest expense also reflected an increase in advertising and marketing expenses coupled with an increase in director compensation expense attributable to the addition of two independent directors during fiscal 2016. The increase in non-interest expense also included an increase in deposit insurance expense largely reflected the overall growth in Company's total assets.\nThe combined effects of these factors resulted in an increase in pre-tax net income during fiscal 2016 compared with fiscal 2015. Given the comparative effects of the Company's recurring tax-favored income sources on taxable net income between periods, including income from municipal obligations and bank-owned life insurance, coupled with the recognition of other non-recurring tax-related adjustments arising, in part, from our second step conversion and prior acquisition of Atlas Bank, the Company recognized income tax expense for fiscal 2016 compared to an income tax benefit recognized for fiscal 2015.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nOur accounting policies are integral to understanding the results reported. We describe them in detail in Note 1 to our audited consolidated financial statements included as an exhibit to this document. In preparing the audited consolidated financial statements, management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the dates of the consolidated statements of financial condition and revenues and expenses for the periods then ended. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. Material estimates that are particularly susceptible to significant changes relate to the determination of the allowance for loan losses, the evaluation of securities impairment and the impairment testing of goodwill.\nAllowance for Loan Losses. The allowance for loan losses is a valuation account that reflects our estimation of the losses in our loan portfolio to the extent they are both probable and reasonable to estimate. The balance of the allowance is generally maintained through provisions for loan losses that are charged to income in the period that estimated losses on loans are identified by our loan review system. We charge losses on loans against the allowance as such losses are actually incurred. Recoveries on loans previously charged-off are added back to the allowance.\nAs described in greater detail in the notes to audited consolidated financial statements, our allowance for loan loss calculation methodology utilizes a two-tier\u201d loss measurement process that is performed quarterly. Through the first tier of the process, we identify the loans that must be reviewed individually for impairment. Such loans generally include our larger and/or more complex loans including commercial mortgage loans, as well as our one- to four-family mortgage loans, home equity loans and home equity lines of credit. A reviewed loan is deemed to be impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. Once a loan is determined to be impaired, management measures the amount of the estimated impairment associated with that loan which is generally defined as the amount by which the carrying value of a loan exceeds its fair value. We establish valuation allowances for loan impairments in the fiscal period during which they are identified. Impairments on individually evaluated loans generally are charged off against the applicable valuation allowance when they are determined to be confirmed, expected losses.\nThe second tier of the loss measurement process involves estimating the probable and estimable losses on loans not otherwise individually reviewed for impairment. Such loans generally comprise large groups of smaller-balance homogeneous loans as well as the remaining non-impaired loans of those types noted above that are otherwise eligible for individual impairment evaluation.\nValuation allowances established through the second tier of the loss measurement process utilize historical and environmental loss factors to collectively estimate the level of probable losses within defined segments of our loan portfolio. To calculate the historical loss factors, our allowance for loan loss methodology generally utilizes a 24-month moving average of annual net charge-off rates (charge-offs net of recoveries) by loan segment, where available, to calculate the actual, historical loss experience. The outstanding principal balance of each loan segment is multiplied by the applicable historical loss factor to estimate the level of probable losses based upon our historical loss experience.\nEnvironmental loss factors are based upon specific qualitative criteria representing key sources of risk within the loan portfolio. Such risk criteria includes the level of and trends in nonperforming loans; the effects of changes in credit policy; the experience, ability and depth of the lending function's management and staff; national and local economic trends and conditions; credit risk concentrations; changes in local and regional real estate values; changes in the nature, volume and terms of loans; changes in the quality of loan review systems and resources and the effects of regulatory, legal and other external factors. The outstanding principal\nbalance of each loan segment is multiplied by the applicable environmental loss factor to estimate the level of probable losses based upon the qualitative risk criteria.\nThe sum of the probable and estimable loan losses calculated in accordance with loss measurement processes, as described above, represents the total targeted balance for our allowance for loan losses at the end of a fiscal period. A more detailed discussion of our allowance for loan loss calculation methodology is presented in Note 1 to our audited consolidated financial statements.\nImpairment Testing of Goodwill. We record goodwill, representing the excess of amounts paid over the fair value of net assets of the institutions acquired in purchase transactions, at its fair value at the date of acquisition. Goodwill is tested and deemed impaired when the carrying value of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value. Goodwill was most recently tested as of June 30, 2016, at which time no impairment was indicated. As of that date, we reported goodwill of $108.6 million. The value of the goodwill can change in the future. We expect the value of the goodwill to decrease if there is a significant decrease in the franchise value of Kearny Bank. If an impairment is determined in the future, we will reflect the loss as an expense in the period in which the impairment is determined, leading to a reduction of our net income for that period by the amount of the impairment.\nOther-than-Temporary Impairment ( OTTI\u201d) of Securities. If the fair value of a security is less than its amortized cost, the security is deemed to be impaired. Management evaluates all securities with unrealized losses quarterly to determine if such impairments are temporary\u201d or other-than-temporary\u201d in accordance with applicable accounting guidance.\nWe account for temporary impairments based upon the classification of the related security as either available for sale, held to maturity or trading. Temporary impairments on available for sale\u201d securities are recognized, on a tax-effected basis, through accumulated other comprehensive income with offsetting entries adjusting the carrying value of the security and the balance of deferred taxes. Conversely, we do not adjust the carrying value of held to maturity\u201d securities for temporary impairments, although information concerning the amount and duration of impairments on held to maturity securities is generally disclosed in periodic financial statements. The carrying value of securities held in a trading portfolio is adjusted to their fair value through earnings on a daily basis. However, we maintained no securities in trading portfolios at or during the periods presented in these financial statements.\nWe account for OTTI based upon several considerations. First, OTTI on securities that we have decided to sell as of the close of a fiscal period, or will, more likely than not, be required to sell prior to the full recovery of their fair value to a level equal to or exceeding their amortized cost, are recognized in earnings. If neither of these conditions regarding the likelihood of the security's sale is applicable, then the OTTI is bifurcated into credit-related and noncredit-related components. A credit-related impairment generally represents the amount by which the present value of the cash flows that are expected to be collected on an other-than-temporarily impaired security fall below its amortized cost. The noncredit-related component represents the remaining portion of the impairment not otherwise designated as credit-related. We recognize credit-related, OTTI in earnings. However, noncredit-related, other-than-temporary impairments on debt securities are recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income.\nComparison of Financial Condition at June 30, 2016 and June 30, 2015\nGeneral. Total assets increased $262.9 million to $4.50 billion at June 30, 2016 from $4.24 billion at June 30, 2015. The net increase in total assets reflected an increase in net loans receivable that was partially offset by decreases in securities and cash and cash equivalents. The net increase in total assets was largely funded by increases in deposits and borrowings that were partially offset by a net decrease in stockholders' equity.\nCash and Cash Equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents, which consist primarily of interest-earning and non-interest-earning deposits in other banks, decreased by $140.9 million to $199.2 million at June 30, 2016 from $340.1 million at June 30, 2015. The decrease in cash and cash equivalents reflected the deployment of the remaining proceeds raised through the Company's second-step conversion and stock offering that were not yet fully invested at June 30, 2015. Such funds were primarily reinvested into the loan portfolio during the first quarter of fiscal 2016.\nNotwithstanding the overall decrease between periods, the balance of cash and cash equivalents at June 30, 2016 reflected a temporary accumulation of short-term, liquid assets arising from an increase in loan prepayments during the quarter ended June 30, 2016. The Company intends to reinvest a significant portion of that excess liquidity back into the loan portfolio during the first quarter of fiscal 2017.\nManagement actively monitors the level of short term, liquid assets in relation to the expected need for such liquidity to fund the Company's strategic initiatives while meeting its performance and risk management objectives. Where appropriate, the Company may alter its liquidity management strategies based upon those objectives. In that regard, the Company generally expects to reduce\nthe balance of cash and cash equivalents maintained, compared to those balances held at June 30, 2016, to further reduce the opportunity cost of maintaining excess liquidity.\nDebt Securities Available for Sale. Debt securities classified as available for sale decreased by $30.8 million to $389.9 million at June 30, 2016 from $420.7 million at June 30, 2015. The decrease partly reflected principal repayments, net of premium amortization and discount accretion, totaling $20.8 million during the year ended June 30, 2016. The decrease also reflected a $10.0 million increase in the net unrealized loss of the portfolio to a net unrealized loss of $12.2 million at June 30, 2016 from a net unrealized loss of $2.2 million at June 30, 2015. The increase in the net unrealized loss reflected changes in the fair value of various sectors within the portfolio arising from movements in market interest rates coupled with a widening of pricing spreads within certain sectors in the portfolio.\nThe increase in the net unrealized loss on debt securities available for sale was primarily reflected within the applicable credit sectors\u201d of the portfolio which include asset-backed securities, collateralized loan obligations, corporate bonds and non-pooled trust preferred securities. The net unrealized loss on this subset of securities increased by $11.7 million to a net unrealized loss of $13.3 million at June 30, 2016 from a net unrealized loss of $1.6 million at June 30, 2015. The increase largely reflected a general widening of pricing spreads in the marketplace resulting in an overall decrease in the market price of such securities coupled with the adverse effect of certain credit-rating downgrades on specific corporate securities within the portfolio. The increase in the net unrealized loss on the noted securities was partially offset by a $1.7 million change to an unrealized gain of $1.0 million on government and agency securities, including U.S. agency debentures and municipal obligations, from a net unrealized loss of $623,000 on such securities for the same comparative periods.\nBased on its evaluation, management has concluded that no other-than-temporary impairment is present within this segment of the investment portfolio as of June 30, 2016. However, volatility in the financial markets may result in additional decreases in the fair value of the Company's available for sale securities. Such volatility may impact the fair value of the securities within the credit sectors\u201d of the portfolio more adversely than the Company's government and agency securities. The adverse effects of such volatility on the current and prospective financial strength of specific corporate issuers, and the resulting impact on the fair value of the related securities held by the Company, will be carefully monitored by management.\nMortgage-backed Securities Available for Sale. Mortgage-backed securities available for sale decreased by $63.0 million to $283.6 million at June 30, 2016 from $346.6 million at June 30, 2015. The net decrease reflected cash repayment of principal, net of discount accretion and premium amortization, totaling $68.4 million that was partially offset by a $5.4 million increase in the net unrealized gain on the portfolio to a net unrealized gain of $7.5 million at June 30, 2016 from a net unrealized gain of $2.1 million at June 30, 2015.\nAt June 30, 2016, the available for sale mortgage-backed securities portfolio primarily included agency pass-through securities and agency collateralized mortgage obligations. As of that date, we also held one non-agency mortgage-backed security within the available for sale portfolio whose aggregate carrying value totaled $124,000. Based on its evaluation, management has concluded that no other-than-temporary impairment is present within this segment of the investment portfolio as of that date.\nAdditional information regarding securities available for sale at June 30, 2016 is presented in the Business\u201d section of this report as well as in Note 5 and Note 7 to the audited consolidated financial statements.\nDebt Securities Held to Maturity. Debt securities classified as held to maturity decreased by $52.7 million to $167.2 million at June 30, 2016 from $219.9 million at June 30, 2015. The net decrease in the portfolio largely reflected principal repayments, net of premium amortization and discount accretion, totaling $64.9 million during the year ended June 30, 2016. The net decrease was partially offset by the purchase of $12.2 million in securities during the same period.\nAt June 30, 2016, the held to maturity debt securities portfolio included U.S. agency debentures and municipal obligations, a small portion of which represent non-rated, short term, bond anticipation notes ( BANs\u201d) issued by New Jersey municipalities. Based on its evaluation, management has concluded that no other-than-temporary impairment is present within this segment of the investment portfolio as of that date.\nMortgage-backed Securities Held to Maturity. Mortgage-backed securities held to maturity decreased by $33.4 million to $410.1 million at June 30, 2016 from $443.5 million at June 30, 2015. The decrease in the portfolio reflected cash repayment of principal, net of discount accretion and premium amortization, totaling $51.0 million during the year ended June 30, 2016. These decreases were partially offset by purchases of securities totaling $17.6 million during the same period.\nAt June 30, 2016, the held to maturity mortgage-backed securities portfolio primarily included agency pass-through securities and agency collateralized mortgage obligations. As of that date, we also held four non-agency mortgage-backed securities in the held to maturity portfolio whose aggregate carrying value and fair value totaled $33,000 and $32,000, respectively. Based on its evaluation,\nmanagement has concluded that no other-than-temporary impairment is present within this segment of the investment portfolio as of that date.\nAdditional information regarding securities available for sale at June 30, 2016 is presented in the Business\u201d section of this report as well as in Note 6 and Note 7 to the audited consolidated financial statements.\nLoans Held-for-Sale. The Company expanded its residential lending infrastructure during fiscal 2016 to support strategies focused on increasing the origination volume of residential mortgage loans for sale into the secondary market. Toward that end, the Company hired a new Director of Residential Lending during the quarter ended December 31, 2015 who evaluated and modified the Company's residential lending function to support that objective. The anticipated increase in residential mortgage loan origination and sale activity is expected to increase the Company's level of non-interest income over time through the recognition of additional sources of recurring loan sale gains while serving to help manage the Company's exposure to interest rate risk. The noted enhancements to the Company's residential mortgage lending infrastructure and business strategies were completed during the fourth quarter ended June 30, 2016 and mortgage banking sales activity commenced. During the quarter ended June 30, 2016, we sold $5.9 million of residential mortgage loans resulting in net sale gains totaling $82,000 for the period. Loans held for sale at June 30, 2016 totaled $3.3 million and are reported separately from balance of net loans receivable as of that date.\nLoans Receivable. Loans receivable, net of unamortized premiums, deferred costs and the allowance for loan losses, increased by $562.5 million or 26.9% to $2.65 billion at June 30, 2016 from $2.09 billion at June 30, 2015. The increase in net loans receivable was primarily attributable to new loan origination and purchase volume outpacing loan repayments during the year ended June 30, 2016.\nResidential mortgage loans held in portfolio, including home equity loans and lines of credit, increased by $10.8 million to $694.8 million at June 30, 2016 from $684.0 million at June 30, 2015. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in the balance of one-to-four family first mortgage loans of $12.9 million to $605.2 million at June 30, 2016 from $592.3 million at June 30, 2015. The net increase also reflected an $87,000 increase in the balance of home equity loans to $70.3 million at June 30, 2016. These increases were partially offset by a $2.2 million decrease in the balance of home equity lines of credit to $19.2 million at June 30, 2016 from $21.4 million at June 30, 2015.\nThe growth in the portfolio during fiscal 2016 reflected the Company's intent to modestly increase the outstanding balance of residential mortgage loans held in portfolio while allowing the segment to continue to decline as a percentage of total loans and earning assets. In total, the origination and purchase volume of portfolio residential mortgage loans for the year ended June 30, 2016 were $87.2 million and $36.3 million, respectively, while aggregate originations of home equity loans and home equity lines of credit totaled $22.7 million for that same period.\nCommercial loans, in aggregate, increased by $540.6 million to $1.95 billion at June 30, 2016 from $1.41 billion at June 30, 2015. The components of the aggregate increase included an increase in commercial mortgage loans totaling $551.9 million that was partially offset by an $11.2 million decrease in commercial business loans. The ending balances of commercial mortgage loans and commercial business loans at June 30, 2016 were $1.86 billion and $88.2 million, respectively.\nCommercial loan origination volume for the year ended June 30, 2016 totaled $510.1 million, comprising $489.3 million and $20.8 million of commercial mortgage and commercial business loan originations, respectively. Commercial loan originations were augmented with the purchase of commercial mortgage loans and participations totaling $274.9 million coupled with the purchase of commercial business loans totaling $19.8 million during the year ended June 30, 2016.\nThe outstanding balance of construction loans, net of loans-in-process, decreased by $3.7 million to $2.0 million at June 30, 2016 from $5.7 million at June 30, 2015. Construction loan disbursements for the year ended June 30, 2016 totaled $1.1 million.\nOther loans, primarily comprising account loans, deposit account overdraft lines of credit and other consumer loans, increased by $21.1 million to $25.4 million at June 30, 2016 from $4.3 million at June 30, 2015. The balance of consumer loans at June 30, 2016 includes loans acquired through the Company's relationship with Lending Club, an established peer-to-peer (i.e. marketplace) lender. Through this relationship, the Company has purchased high-quality, unsecured consumer loans originated through Lending Club's online platform. The Company generally limits its purchases of Lending Club loans to those issued to qualified borrowers falling within the three highest credit tiers defined within Lending Club's proprietary credit risk model.\nAt June 30, 2016, the outstanding balance of the Company's Lending Club loans totaled $21.8 million, representing the outstanding balance of 1,252 loans with a weighted average interest rate of 9.78% and weighted average FICO scores and debt-to-income ratios of 729 and 17.9%, respectively. A total of 14 Lending Club loans with aggregate outstanding balances totaling\n$260,000, or 1.20% of total Lending Club loans, were 120 days or less past due\u201d at June 30, 2016 while three loans totaling $51,000 were charged off during the year ended June 30, 2016.\nThe Company generally intends to limit the outstanding balance of its Lending Club loan portfolio to an initial threshold of approximately $25.0 million in aggregate outstanding balances. However, the Company temporarily suspended its purchases of Lending Club loans during the quarter ended June 30, 2016 based upon recently disclosed events that resulted in the resignation of the Lending Club's founder and CEO. Subject to a satisfactory resolution of these matters, the Company generally intends to maintain the balance of its portfolio within the noted threshold for a period of time while continuing to independently monitor and validate the performance of the portfolio in relation to the Company's expectations as well as those of Lending Club's proprietary credit risk model. Additional investment in Lending Club loans may be considered by the Company after a sufficient period of time to properly gauge performance of the initial portfolio and quality of loan servicing and reporting rendered by Lending Club.\nThe Company purchased a total of $25.5 million through Lending Club during the year ended June 30, 2016 while internal originations of other consumer loans totaled approximately $1.1 million for the same period.\nNonperforming Loans. Nonperforming loans decreased by $1.8 million to $21.1 million, or 0.79% of total loans at June 30, 2016, from $22.9 million or 1.09% of total loans at June 30, 2015. Nonperforming generally include loans reported as accruing loans over 90 days past due\u201d and loans reported as nonaccrual\u201d with such balances totaling $38,000 and $21.0 million, respectively, at June 30, 2016.\nAdditional information about the Company's nonperforming loans at June 30, 2016 is presented in the Business\u201d section of this report as well as in Note 9 to the audited consolidated financial statements.\nAllowance for Loan Losses. During the year ended June 30, 2016, the balance of the allowance for loan losses increased by $8.6 million to $24.2 million or 0.90% of total loans at June 30, 2016 from $15.6 million or 0.74% of total loans at June 30, 2015. The increase resulted from provisions of $10.7 million during the year ended June 30, 2016 that were partially offset by charge-offs, net of recoveries, totaling $2.1 million.\nAdditional information about the allowance for loan losses at June 30, 2016 is presented in the Business\u201d section of this report as well as in Note 1 and Note 9 to the audited consolidated financial statements.\nOther Assets. The aggregate balance of other assets, including premises and equipment, FHLB stock, interest receivable, goodwill, bank owned life insurance, deferred income taxes and other miscellaneous assets, increased by $17.8 million to $397.0 million at June 30, 2016 from $379.2 million at June 30, 2015.\nThe increase in other assets reflected a $8.1 million increase in deferred income tax assets arising primarily from changes in the fair value of the Company's available for sale securities and derivatives portfolios coupled with an increase in the allowance for loan losses. The increase also reflected a $3.1 million increase in FHLB stock resulting from an increase in short-term advances drawn during the year ended June 30, 2016 coupled with a $5.6 million increase in the cash surrender value of the Company's bank-owned life insurance policies.\nThe noted increases in other assets included a $116,000 decrease in the balance of real estate owned ( REO\u201d) to $826,000, representing the carrying value of three properties at June 30, 2016, from $942,000, representing the carrying value of two properties at June 30, 2015.\nThe remaining increases and decreases in other assets during the year ended June 30, 2016 generally comprised normal operating fluctuations in their respective balances.\nDeposits. Total deposits increased by $229.2 million to $2.69 billion at June 30, 2016 from $2.47 billion at June 30, 2015. The increase in deposit balances reflected a $209.0 million increase in interest-bearing deposits coupled with a $20.2 million increase in non-interest-bearing checking accounts. The net increase in interest-bearing deposits comprised increases in certificates of deposit and interest-bearing checking accounts totaling $205.7 million and $8.2 million, respectively, that were partially offset by a $4.9 million decrease in the balance of savings and club accounts for the year ended June 30, 2016.\nThe increase in the balance of certificates of deposit largely reflected the effects of attractive retail pricing offered on a limited number of promotional products during specific periods in fiscal 2016 to fund a portion of the growth in loans during the period while also providing opportunities to cross-sell core deposit products to newly acquired customers. The attractive pricing on certain certificate of deposit products resulted in a limited amount of disintermediation from interest-bearing checking accounts which contributed to the limited growth or declines in those balances. The concurrent increase in non-interest-bearing deposits partly\nreflected fluctuating balances within certain large commercial deposit accounts. Notwithstanding these day-to-day fluctuations, the average balance of non-interest-bearing deposits has increased by $7.5 million to $225.4 million for the year ended June 30, 2016 compared to $217.9 million for the year ended June 30, 2015.\nThe change in deposit balances for the period reflected changes in the balances of retail deposits as well as non-retail\u201d deposits acquired through various wholesale channels. The $8.2 million increase in the balance of interest-bearing checking accounts reflected a $10.2 million increase in the balance of retail accounts that was partially offset by a $2.0 million decrease in the balance of brokered money market deposits acquired through Promontory's IND program whose balances decreased to $224.1 million, or 8.3% of total deposits at June 30, 2016, from $226.2 million, or 9.2% of total deposits at June 30, 2015. The terms of the IND program generally establish a reciprocal commitment for Promontory to deliver and for us to accept such deposits for a period of no less than five years during which time total aggregate balances shall be maintained within a range of $200.0 million to $230.0 million. Such deposits are generally sourced by Promontory from large retail and institutional brokerage firms whose individual clients seek to have a portion of their investments held in interest-bearing accounts at FDIC-insured institutions. The decrease in IND program balances was more than offset by a $10.2 million increase in retail interest-bearing checking accounts.\nWe continued to utilize a deposit listing service through which we attract non-brokered\u201d wholesale time deposits targeting institutional investors with an original investment horizon of three-to-five years. We generally prohibit the withdrawal of our listing service deposits prior to maturity. The balance of the Bank's listing service time deposits remained stable at $89.9 million representing 3.3% and 3.6% of total deposits at June 30, 2016 and June 30, 2015, respectively.\nWe also maintain a small portfolio of longer-term, brokered certificates of deposit that were originally acquired during fiscal 2014 whose balances decreased by approximately $10.0 million to $8.4 million at June 30, 2016 from $18.4 million at June 30, 2015. In combination with our Promontory IND money market deposits, our brokered deposits totaled $232.5 million, or 8.6% of deposits at June 30, 2016 compared to $244.6 million, or 9.9% of total deposits at June 30, 2015.\nGiven the decline in the balances of wholesale time deposits, the net increase in certificates of deposit was primarily attributable to an increase in retail time deposits.\nBorrowings. The balance of borrowings increased by $42.9 million to $614.4 million at June 30, 2016 from $571.5 million at June 30, 2015. The increase in borrowings primarily reflected an additional short-term advance of $50.0 million drawn during the year ended June 30, 2016 whose cost had been effectively fixed over a five-year period based on a previously executed interest rate swap transaction whose terms became effective during the period. At June 30, 2016, the wholesale funding associated with all of the Company's outstanding interest rate derivatives has been fully drawn with such swaps and caps expected to serve as effective cash flow hedges over their remaining terms to maturity.\nThe increase in borrowings also reflected a $541,000 increase in outstanding overnight sweep account\u201d balances linked to customer demand deposits.\nOther Liabilities. The balance of other liabilities, including advance payments by borrowers for taxes and other miscellaneous liabilities, increased by $10.5 million to $43.2 million at June 30, 2016 from $32.7 million at June 30, 2015. The increase primarily reflected changes in the fair value of the Company's derivatives coupled with normal operating fluctuations in the balances of other liabilities.\nStockholders' Equity. Stockholders' equity decreased by $19.7 million to $1.15 billion at June 30, 2016 from $1.17 billion at June 30, 2015. As noted above, the decrease in stockholders' equity largely reflected the impact of the Company's share repurchases during fiscal 2016. The Company initiated a new share repurchase program in May 2016 through which it intends to repurchase a total of 9,352,809 shares, or 10%, of its outstanding shares. Through June 30, 2016, the Company repurchased 1,706,182 shares, or 18.2% of the shares to be repurchased under the current program, at a total cost of $22.3 million and at an average cost of $13.06 per share. The net decrease in stockholders' equity also reflected a $9.0 million increase in accumulated other comprehensive loss due primarily to changes in the fair value of the Company's available for sale securities portfolio and outstanding derivatives. This decrease was partially offset by net income of $15.8 million, less $7.2 million in cash dividends paid to shareholders, coupled with a $1.9 million reduction of unearned ESOP shares for plan shares earned during the year ended June 30, 2016.\nComparison of Operating Results for the Years Ended June 30, 2016 and June 30, 2015\nGeneral. Net income for the year ended June 30, 2016 was $15.8 million or $0.18 per diluted share, an increase of $10.2 million compared to $5.6 million or $0.06 per diluted share for the year ended June 30, 2015. The increase in net income was partly attributable to the effect of the non-recurring $10.0 million charitable contribution that was made by the Company to the KearnyBank Foundation in conjunction with the closing of the Company's second-step conversion and stock offering in fiscal 2015. The increase\nin net income also reflected increases in net interest income and non-interest income that were partially offset by an increase in the provision for loan losses and an increase in non-interest expense, excluding the effects of charitable contribution noted earlier. In total, these factors resulted in an increase in pre-tax net income between comparative periods. The Company recorded income tax expense for the year ended June 30, 2016. However, the effects of the Company's tax-favored income sources, coupled with other reductions in income tax expense, resulted in the Company recording a net income tax benefit for the year ended June 30, 2015.\nNet Interest Income. Net interest income for the year ended June 30, 2016 was $95.0 million, an increase of $14.4 million from $80.6 million for the year ended June 30, 2015. The increase in net interest income between the comparative periods resulted from an increase in interest income that was partially offset by an increase in interest expense. As discussed in greater detail below, the increase in interest income was attributable to an increase in the average balance of interest-earning assets augmented by an increase in their average yield. The increase in interest expense resulted from an increase in the average balance of interest-bearing liabilities coupled with an increase their average cost. The average yields and average costs between comparative periods continued to reflect the effects of low interest rates that were prevalent in the marketplace throughout most of fiscal 2016.\nAs a result of these factors, our net interest rate spread decreased 14 basis points to 2.06% for the year ended June 30, 2016 from 2.20% for the year ended June 30, 2015. The decrease in the net interest rate spread reflected a 19 basis point increase in the average cost of interest-bearing liabilities to 1.07% from 0.88% while the yield on earning assets increased by five basis points to 3.13% from 3.08% between those same comparative periods. A discussion of the factors contributing to the overall change in yield on interest-earning assets and average cost of interest-bearing liabilities is presented in the separate discussion and analysis of interest income and interest expense below.\nThe factors resulting in the decrease in net interest rate spread also adversely affected our net interest margin. However, the effects of those factors were more than offset by the beneficial impact to net interest income arising from the increase in the average balance of interest-earning assets that was attributable to the investment of the net capital proceeds raised in conjunction with the closing of the Company's second step conversion and stock offering in May 2015. Consequently, the Company's net interest margin increased by one basis point to 2.35% for the year ended June 30, 2016 from 2.34% for the year ended June 30, 2015.\nInterest Income. Total interest income increased $20.8 million to $126.9 million for the year ended June 30, 2016 from $106.0 million for the year ended June 30, 2015. As noted above, the increase in interest income reflected increases in both the average balance and average yield of interest-earning assets. The average balance of interest-earning assets increased by $603.4 million to $4.05 billion for the year ended June 30, 2016 from $3.45 billion for the year ended June 30, 2015. For those same comparative periods, the average yield on interest-earning assets declined five basis points to 3.13% from 3.08%.\nInterest income from loans increased $21.3 million to $98.0 million for the year ended June 30, 2016 from $76.6 million for the year ended June 30, 2015. The increase in interest income on loans was attributable to a net increase in the average balance of loans that was partially offset by a decline in their average yield.\nThe average balance of loans increased by $662.5 million to $2.51 billion for the year ended June 30, 2016 from $1.85 billion for the year ended June 30, 2015. The reported increase in the average balance of loans primarily reflected an aggregate increase of $607.5 million in the average balance of commercial loans to $1.78 billion for the year ended June 30, 2016 from $1.18 billion for the year ended June 30, 2015. Our commercial loans generally comprise commercial mortgage loans, including multi-family and nonresidential mortgage loans, as well as secured and unsecured commercial business loans. The increase in the average balance of commercial loans include the effects of loan purchases funded with a portion of the proceeds raised in the Company's second-step conversion and stock offering that closed in May 2015.\nThe increase in the average balance of total loans also reflected a net increase in the average balance of residential mortgage loans which increased by $43.5 million to $706.3 million for the year ended June 30, 2016 from $662.9 million for the year ended June 30, 2015. Our residential mortgages generally comprise one- to four-family first mortgage loans, home equity loans and home equity lines of credit.\nFor those same comparative periods, the average balance of construction loans decreased $2.8 million to $4.2 million from $7.0 million while the average balance of consumer loans increased $10.8 million to $15.5 million from $4.7 million. The increase in the average balance of consumer loans for fiscal 2016 primarily reflected the effects of the loans acquired through the Company's relationship with Lending Club.\nThe effect on interest income attributable to the net increase in the average balance of loans was partially offset by the noted decrease in their average yield. The average yield on loans decreased by 24 basis points to 3.90% for the year ended June 30, 2016 from 4.14% for the year ended June 30, 2015. The reduction in the overall yield on our loan portfolio largely reflects the continuing effect of low market interest rates. Specifically, the average yield on the newly originated loans that have provided the incremental\ngrowth in the portfolio during fiscal 2016 reflects the generally low level of interest rates prevalent in the marketplace which reduces the overall yield of the loan portfolio.\nInterest income from mortgage-backed securities decreased by $1.3 million to $17.3 million for the year ended June 30, 2016 from $18.6 million for the year ended June 30, 2015. The decrease in interest income reflected a decrease in the average yield of mortgage-backed securities that was partially offset by an increase in their average balance.\nThe average yield on mortgage-backed securities decreased by 32 basis points to 2.33% for the year ended June 30, 2016 from 2.65% for the year ended June 30, 2015. The decrease in the overall yield of the mortgage-backed securities portfolio largely reflected the comparatively lower yields of securities purchased during fiscal 2016.\nFor those same comparative periods, the average balance of mortgage-backed securities increased by $37.6 million to $741.2 million from $703.6 million. The increase in the average balance of mortgage-backed securities largely reflects the effects of security purchases that outpaced principal repayments between comparative periods. The increase in the average balance of mortgage-backed securities include the effects of security purchases funded with a portion of the proceeds raised in the Company's second-step conversion and stock offering that closed in May 2015.\nInterest income from debt securities increased by $717,000 to $9.9 million for the year ended June 30, 2016 from $9.2 million for the year ended June 30, 2015. The increase in interest income reflected an increase in the average yield on debt securities that was partially offset by a decrease in their average balance. The average yield on debt securities increased 21 basis points to 1.65% for the year ended June 30, 2016 from 1.44 % for the year ended June 30, 2015. For those same comparative periods, the average balance of debt securities decreased $34.8 million to $602.4 million from $637.2 million.\nThe increase in the average yield on debt securities reflected a 22 basis point increase in the yield on taxable securities to 1.57% during the year ended June 30, 2016 from 1.35% during the year ended June 30, 2015. For those same comparative periods, the yield on tax-exempt securities increased four basis points to 1.99% from 1.95%.\nThe decrease in the average balance of debt securities was largely attributable to a $43.5 million decrease in the average balance of taxable securities to $492.4 million for the year ended June 30, 2016 from $535.9 million for the year ended June 30, 2015. For those same comparative periods, the average balance of tax-exempt securities increased by $8.7 million to $110.0 million from $101.3 million.\nInterest income from other interest-earning assets increased by $173,000 to $1.8 million for the year ended June 30, 2016 from $1.6 million for the year ended June 30, 2015 reflecting an increase in the average yield that was partially offset by a decline in the average balance. The average yield on other interest-earning assets increased by 29 basis points to 0.91% for the year ended June 30, 2016 from 0.62% for the year ended June 30, 2015. For those same comparative periods, the average balance of other interest-earning assets decreased by $61.7 million to $194.5 million from $256.2 million.\nThe changes in the average balance and average yield on other interest-earning assets between comparative periods largely reflects the effects of a temporary increase in low-yielding cash and cash equivalents held during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015. The increase in these short-term liquid assets during that quarter largely reflected the funds received and held during the subscription phase of our second-step conversion and stock offering as well as the excess liquidity held after the closing of the transaction pending their investment into other higher yielding assets during the first quarter of fiscal 2016.\nInterest Expense. Total interest expense increased by $6.5 million to $31.9 million for the year ended June 30, 2016 from $25.4 million for the year ended June 30, 2015. The increase in interest expense resulted from an increase in the average balance of interest-bearing liabilities as well as an increase in their average cost. The average balance of interest-bearing liabilities increased by $78.5 million to $2.97 billion for the year ended June 30, 2016 from $2.90 billion for the year ended June 30, 2015. For those same comparative periods, the average cost of interest-bearing liabilities increased 19 basis points to 1.07% from 0.88%.\nInterest expense attributed to deposits increased by $2.8 million to $18.7 million for the year ended June 30, 2016 from $15.9 million for the year ended June 30, 2015. The increase in interest expense was attributable to an increase in the average balance of interest-bearing deposits coupled with an increase in their average cost.\nThe average balance of interest-bearing deposits increased by $18.2 million to $2.36 billion for the year ended June 30, 2016 from $2.34 billion for the year ended June 30, 2015. For the comparative periods noted, the average balance of certificates of deposit increased by $91.4 million to $1.12 billion from $1.03 billion, while the average balance of savings and club accounts increased $566,000 to $516.4 million from $515.8 million. These increases were partially offset by a $73.8 million decrease in the average balance of interest-bearing checking accounts to $723.1 million from $797.0 million.\nThe cost of interest-bearing deposits increased by 11 basis points to 0.79% for the year ended June 30, 2016 from 0.68% for the year ended June 30, 2015. The net increase in the average cost was partly attributable to a 13 basis point increase in the average cost of certificates of deposit which increased to 1.22% for the year ended June 30, 2016 from 1.09% for the year ended June 30, 2015. For those same comparative periods, the average cost of interest-bearing checking accounts increased nine basis points to 0.59% from 0.50%, while the average cost of savings and club accounts remained stable at 0.16% between those same comparative periods.\nThe decrease in the average balance of interest-bearing checking accounts and the corresponding increase in their average cost largely reflected the effects of the low-cost funds held in such accounts during the subscription phase of our second step conversion and stock offering in fiscal 2015. Conversely, the increase in the average balance and average cost of certificates of deposits largely reflected the effects of attracting higher-cost, longer-term funding through our retail deposit channels for interest rate risk management purposes.\nInterest expense attributed to borrowings increased by $3.7 million to $13.2 million for the year ended June 30, 2016 from $9.5 million for the year ended June 30, 2015. The increase in interest expense on borrowings reflected increases in their average balance and average cost. The average balance of borrowings increased by $60.3 million to $617.5 million for the year ended June 30, 2016 from $557.2 million for the year ended June 30, 2015. For those same comparative periods, the average cost of borrowings increased 44 basis points to 2.14% from 1.70%.\nThe net increase in the average balance of borrowings largely reflected a $55.6 million increase in the average balance of FHLB advances which increased to $582.1 million for the year ended June 30, 2016 from $526.5 million for the year ended June 30, 2015. For those same comparative periods, the average cost of FHLB advances increased 47 basis points to 2.24% from 1.77%. As noted earlier, the increase in the average balance of FHLB advances primarily reflected an additional short-term advance of $50.0 million drawn during the year ended June 30, 2016 whose cost had been effectively fixed over a five-year period based on a previously executed interest rate swap transaction whose terms became effective during the period.\nThe net increase in the average balance of borrowings also reflected a $4.7 million increase in the average balance of other borrowings, comprised primarily of depositor sweep accounts, to $35.4 million from $30.7 million. The average cost of sweep accounts increased one basis point to 0.51% from 0.50% between comparative periods.\nProvision for Loan Losses. The provision for loan losses increased $4.6 million to $10.7 million for the year ended June 30, 2016 from $6.1 million for the year ended June 30, 2015. The net increase in the provision primarily reflected updates to historical and environmental loss factors utilized to measure impairment on collectively evaluated loans. The increase in provision expense also reflected the greater growth in such loans during fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015. The increase in provision expense attributable to these factors was partially offset by a net decrease in specific losses recognized on loans evaluated individually for impairment that largely reflected a higher level of recoveries recognized on such loans during fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015.\nAdditional information regarding the allowance for loan losses and the associated provisions recognized during the year ended June 30, 2016 is presented in the Business\u201d section of this report as well as in Note 1 and Note 9 to the audited consolidated financial statements.\nNon-Interest Income. Non-interest income, excluding gains and losses on the sale of securities and REO, increased by $2.2 million to $10.9 million for the year ended June 30, 2016 from $8.7 million for the year ended June 30, 2015. The increase was partly attributable an increase in the income arising from our investment in bank-owned life insurance due largely to the growth in the average balance of the cash surrender value of the various policies held by the Company. The Company had also recognized payouts on life insurance policies totaling $1.4 million during the prior year ended June 30, 2015 for which no such payouts were recognized during the year ended June 30, 2016. Absent the effect of these payouts, income from bank owned life insurance increased by approximately $3.0 million reflecting the noted increase in the average balance of the policies less the effects of a decrease in the earnings rate on such policies attributable to the sustained effects of lower long-term market interest rates.\nThe increase in non-interest income also reflected a net increase in fees and service charges that was primarily attributable to an increase in loan prepayment charges. The increase in loan prepayment charges were augmented, to a lesser degree, by a net increase in deposit-related fees and service charges, including ATM and debit card transaction fees separately reported under electronic banking fees and charges.\nThe increase in non-interest income reflected an increase in loan sale gains attributable to a $243,000 increase in SBA loan sale gains reflecting an overall increase in related loan origination and sale activity. The increase in loan sale gains also reflected $82,000 in gains on sale of residential mortgage loans arising from the initial implementation of the Company's mortgage banking business strategy during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016.\nThe noted increases in non-interest income were partially offset by a decrease in miscellaneous income that primarily reflected the recognition of a $370,000 non-recurring adjustment to gain on bargain purchase during the year ended June 30, 2015 relating to the Company's prior acquisition of Atlas Bank.\nThe noted net increase in non-interest income was augmented by a decrease in net losses relating to write downs and sales of real estate owned between comparative periods. The decrease in losses relating to the disposal of real estate owned were partially offset by a nominal decrease in gains arising from the sale and call of securities.\nNon-Interest Expenses. Non-interest expense decreased by $5.7 million to $72.4 million for the year ended June 30, 2016 from $78.1 million for the year ended June 30, 2015. However, non-interest expense for fiscal 2015 included a non-recurring $10.0 million charitable contribution that was made by the Company to the KearnyBank Foundation in conjunction with the closing of the Company's second-step conversion and stock offering. Excluding the effect of that charitable contribution, included in miscellaneous expense during the prior fiscal year, non-interest expense increased by $4.3 million during fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015.\nThe increase in non-interest expense, as adjusted, reflected increases in salaries and employee benefits, advertising and marketing, deposit insurance and director compensation expenses that were partially offset by a decrease in other miscellaneous expense coupled with less noteworthy decreases in premises occupancy expense and equipment and systems expense that generally reflected normal operating fluctuations within those categories.\nThe increase in salaries and employee benefits expense partly reflected the limited and controlled expansion of the human resources within our various business lines and, where needed, the supporting operating and risk management departments. The incremental increase in expense associated with these new resources was partially defrayed by our efforts to improve overall operating efficiency during fiscal 2016 that resulted in a net decrease in the number of full time equivalent ( FTE\u201d) employees for the year that was achieved largely through reallocation and attrition of resources. The increase in compensation-related expenses also included an increase in the cost of employee healthcare benefits as well as an increase in ESOP expense that was primarily attributable to the increase in the Company's average share price between comparative periods.\nThe noted increase in advertising and marketing expenses was largely attributable to expanded corporate and business line advertising campaigns across the print, electronic media and outdoor advertising formats while the reported increase in deposit insurance expense largely reflected the overall growth in Company's total assets that serves as a contributing basis to the calculation of FDIC insurance premiums.\nThe increase in non-interest expense also reflected an increase in director compensation expense that was primarily attributable to the addition of two independent directors during fiscal 2016. This increase in director compensation was more than offset by the effect of a non-recurring curtailment gain on pension plan expense totaling $931,000 that was recognized in miscellaneous expense during fiscal 2016. The curtailment gain resulted from the amendment of the Company's Directors Consultation and Retirement Plan (the DCRP\u201d) during the year. The noted amendments froze the DCRP such that no additional DCRP benefits accrue to any participant after December 31, 2015 and revised the minimum age requirement for benefit vesting purposes.\nProvision for Income Taxes. The provision for income taxes increased by $8.1 million to income tax expense of $6.8 million for the year ended June 30, 2016 from an income tax benefit of $1.3 million for the year ended June 30, 2015. The provision for both periods reflected the effects of the Company's recurring sources of tax-favored income on taxable net income for each year. Such recurring tax-favored income sources include interest income on municipal obligations and the income arising from periodic increases in the cash surrender value of bank owned life insurance.\nHowever, the taxable portion of the Company's net income for fiscal 2015 also reflected the effects of certain non-recurring sources of non-taxable income including a $1.4 million payout on bank-owned life insurance policies. In that regard, we also recognized a non-taxable adjustment to gain on bargain purchase totaling $370,000 during fiscal 2015 relating to the acquisition of Atlas Bank that exceeded the original bargain purchase gain of $226,000 recognized on that transaction during fiscal 2014.\nIn addition to these items, the income tax provision for fiscal 2015 reflected the utilization of a net operating loss carry forward originated by Kearny MHC, our prior mutual holding company, arising from its merger into the Company in conjunction with the second step conversion and stock offering. The value of that carryforward had not been recognized in prior years resulting in a $354,000 income tax benefit to the Company during fiscal 2015. The income tax provision for fiscal 2015 also reflected a $416,000 income tax benefit arising from the exercise of stock options during the year.\nAfter adjusting for the effects of these recurring and non-recurring factors, the overall increase in the income tax provision largely reflected the underlying differences in the taxable portion of pre-tax income between comparative periods. Our effective income tax rate for the year ended June 30, 2016 was 30.0%, which primarily reflected the effects of recurring sources of tax-favored\nincome. By comparison, our effective income tax rate (benefit) during the year ended June 30, 2015 was (29.1)% which, in relation to statutory income tax rates, reflected the effects of the recurring and non-recurring items noted above.\nComparison of Operating Results for the Years Ended June 30, 2015 and June 30, 2014\nGeneral. Net income for the year ended June 30, 2015 was $5.6 million or $0.06 per diluted share, a decrease of $4.6 million compared to $10.2 million or $0.11 per diluted share for the year ended June 30, 2014. The decrease in net income was largely attributable to the charitable contribution to the KearnyBank Foundation discussed in the preceding section. The decrease in net income also reflected an increase in other non-interest expense and in the provision for loan losses coupled with a decrease in non-interest income. These factors were partially offset by an increase in net interest income. In total, these factors resulted in a decrease in pre-tax net income between comparative periods. The effects of the Company's tax-favored income sources coupled with other reductions in income tax expense resulted in the recognition of a net income tax benefit during the year ended June 30, 2015. By comparison, the Company recorded income tax expense for the year ended June 30, 2014 as taxable sources of net income outweighed the effects of the Company's tax favored income sources during the year.\nNet Interest Income. Net interest income for the year ended June 30, 2015 was $80.6 million, an increase of $6.8 million from $73.8 million for the year ended June 30, 2014. The increase in net interest income between the comparative periods resulted primarily from an increase in interest income that was partially offset by an increase in interest expense. The increase in interest income was primarily attributable to an increase in the average balance of interest-earning assets that was partially offset by a decline in their average yield. The increase in interest expense resulted from an increase in the average balance of interest-bearing liabilities coupled with an increase in their average cost. The average yields and average costs between comparative periods continued to reflect the effects of low interest rates that were prevalent in the marketplace throughout most of fiscal 2015.\nAs a result of these factors, our net interest rate spread decreased 12 basis points to 2.20% for the year ended June 30, 2015 from 2.32% for the year ended June 30, 2014. The decrease in the net interest rate spread reflected a nine basis point decline in the yield on earning assets to 3.08% from 3.17% coupled with a three basis point increase in the average cost of interest-bearing liabilities to 0.88% from 0.85% for the same comparative periods. A discussion of the factors contributing to the overall change in yield on interest-earning assets and average cost of interest-bearing liabilities is presented in the separate discussion and analysis of interest income and interest expense below.\nThe factors resulting in the decrease in net interest income and net interest rate spread also adversely affected our net interest margin which decreased by ten basis points to 2.34% for the year ended June 30, 2015 from 2.44% for the year ended June 30, 2014.\nInterest Income. Total interest income increased $10.2 million to $106.0 million for the year ended June 30, 2015 from $95.8 million for the year ended June 30, 2014. The increase in interest income reflected an increase in the average balance of interest-earning assets that was partially offset by a decline in their average yield. The average balance of interest-earning assets increased by $419.6 million to $3.45 billion for the year ended June 30, 2015 from $3.03 billion for the year ended June 30, 2014. For those same comparative periods, the average yield on interest-earning assets declined nine basis points to 3.08% from 3.17%.\nInterest income from loans increased $9.8 million to $76.6 million for the year ended June 30, 2015 from $66.8 million for the year ended June 30, 2014. The increase in interest income on loans was attributable to a net increase in the average balance of loans that was partially offset by a decline in their average yield.\nThe average balance of loans increased by $301.0 million to $1.85 billion for the year ended June 30, 2015 from $1.55 billion for the year ended June 30, 2014. The reported increase in the average balance of loans primarily reflected an aggregate increase of $255.3 million in the average balance of commercial loans to $1.18 billion for the year ended June 30, 2015 from $921.0 million for the year ended June 30, 2014. Our commercial loans generally comprise commercial mortgage loans, including multi-family and nonresidential mortgage loans, as well as secured and unsecured commercial business loans.\nThe increase in the average balance of total loans also reflected a net increase in the average balance of residential mortgage loans which increased by $47.7 million to $662.9 million for the year ended June 30, 2015 from $615.2 million for the year ended June 30, 2014. Our residential mortgages generally comprise one- to four-family first mortgage loans, home equity loans and home equity lines of credit.\nFor those same comparative periods, the average balance of construction loans decreased $2.5 million to $7.0 million from $9.5 million while the average balance of consumer loans increased $172,000 to $4.7 million from $4.5 million.\nThe effect on interest income attributable to the net increase in the average balance of loans was partially offset by the noted decrease in their average yield. The average yield on loans decreased by 17 basis points to 4.14% for the year ended June 30, 2015\nfrom 4.31% for the year ended June 30, 2014. The reduction in the overall yield on our loan portfolio partly reflects the overall effect of lower market interest rates. Specifically, the average yield on the newly originated loans that have provided the incremental growth in the portfolio during fiscal 2015 reflected the generally low level of interest rates prevalent in the marketplace during the year which reduced the overall yield of the loan portfolio.\nInterest income from mortgage-backed securities decreased by $2.2 million to $18.6 million for the year ended June 30, 2015 from $20.8 million for the year ended June 30, 2014. The decrease in interest income reflected a decrease in the average balance of mortgage-backed securities that was partially offset by an increase in their average yield.\nThe average balance of mortgage-backed securities decreased by $99.6 million to $703.6 million for the year ended June 30, 2015 from $803.2 million for the year ended June 30, 2014. The decrease in the average balance of mortgage-backed securities largely reflected principal repayments and security sales that outpaced the level of security purchases between comparative periods.\nFor those same comparative periods, the average yield on mortgage-backed securities increased by six basis points to 2.65% from 2.59%. The increase in the overall yield of the mortgage-backed securities portfolio partly reflected the comparatively higher yields of securities purchased during the year. However, the increase in yield also reflected a decrease in purchased premium amortization during fiscal 2015 resulting from a decline in loan prepayments attributable to a modest increase in market rates from their historical lows and the resulting decline in rate reduction\u201d refinancing incentive to mortgagors.\nInterest income from debt securities increased by $2.0 million to $9.2 million for the year ended June 30, 2015 from $7.2 million for the year ended June 30, 2014. The increase in interest income reflected an increase in the average balance of debt securities augmented by an increase in their average yield. The average balance of debt securities increased $95.8 million to $637.2 million for the year ended June 30, 2015 from $541.4 million for the year ended June 30, 2014. For those same comparative periods, the average yield of debt securities increased 11 basis points to 1.44% from 1.33%.\nThe increase in the average balance of debt securities was partly attributable to an $89.3 million increase in the average balance of taxable securities to $535.9 million for the year ended June 30, 2015 from $446.6 million for the year ended June 30, 2014. For those same comparative periods, the average balance of tax-exempt securities increased by $6.6 million to $101.3 million from $94.7 million.\nThe increase in the average yield on debt securities reflected a 15 basis point increase in the yield on taxable securities to 1.35% during the year ended June 30, 2015 from 1.20% during the year ended June 30, 2014. For those same comparative periods, the yield on tax-exempt securities increased one basis point to 1.95% from 1.94%.\nInterest income from other interest-earning assets increased by $580,000 to $1.6 million for the year ended June 30, 2015 from $1.0 million for the year ended June 30, 2014 reflecting an increase in the average balance that was partially offset by a decline in the average yield. The average balance of other interest-earning assets increased by $122.3 million to $256.2 million for the year ended June 30, 2015 from $133.9 million for the year ended June 30, 2014. For those same comparative periods, the average yield of other interest-earning assets decreased by 14 basis points to 0.62% from 0.76%.\nThe changes in the average balance and average yield on other interest-earning assets between comparative periods largely reflected the effects of the increase in low-yielding cash and cash equivalents held during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015. The increase in these short-term liquid assets during that quarter reflected the funds received and held during the subscription phase of our second step conversion and stock offering as well as the excess liquidity held after the closing of the transaction pending their investment into other higher yielding assets.\nInterest Expense. Total interest expense increased by $3.4 million to $25.4 million for the year ended June 30, 2015 from $22.0 million for the year ended June 30, 2014. The increase in interest expense resulted from an increase in the average balance of interest-bearing liabilities as well as an increase in their average cost. The average balance of interest-bearing liabilities increased by $303.8 million to $2.90 billion for the year ended June 30, 2015 from $2.59 billion for the year ended June 30, 2014. For those same comparative periods, the average cost of interest-bearing liabilities increased three basis points to 0.88% from 0.85%.\nInterest expense attributed to deposits increased by $1.4 million to $15.9 million for the year ended June 30, 2015 from $14.5 million for the year ended June 30, 2014. The increase in interest expense was attributable to an increase in the average balance of interest-bearing deposits coupled with increase in their average cost.\nThe average balance of interest-bearing deposits increased by $166.9 million to $2.34 billion for the year ended June 30, 2015 from $2.17 billion for the year ended June 30, 2014. The net increase in the average balance was reflected across all categories of interest-bearing deposits. For the comparative periods noted, the average balance of interest-bearing checking accounts increased by\n$74.0 million to $797.0 million from $723.0 million, the average balance of savings and club accounts increased $41.9 million to $515.8 million from $473.9 million and the average balance of certificates of deposit increased by $51.1 million to $1.03 billion from $974.4 million.\nThe cost of interest-bearing deposits increased by one basis point to 0.68% for the year ended June 30, 2015 from 0.67% for the year ended June 30, 2014. The net increase in the average cost was partly attributable to a six basis point increase in the average cost of certificates of deposit which increased to 1.09% for the year ended June 30, 2015 from 1.03% for the year ended June 30, 2014. The increase in the cost of certificates of deposit was partially offset by a two basis point decrease in the average cost of interest-bearing checking accounts to 0.50% from 0.52% while the average cost of savings and club accounts remained stable at 0.16% between those same comparative periods.\nThe increase in the average balance of interest-bearing checking accounts and the corresponding decrease in their average cost partly reflected the effects of the low-costing funds held in such accounts during the subscription phase of our second step conversion and stock offering. Conversely, the increase in the average balance and average cost of certificates of deposits largely reflected the effects of attracting higher-cost, longer-term funding through the wholesale deposit channels for interest rate risk management purposes.\nInterest expense attributed to borrowings increased by $2.0 million to $9.5 million for the year ended June 30, 2015 from $7.5 million for the year ended June 30, 2014. The increase in interest expense on borrowings primarily reflected an increase in their average balance that was partially offset by a decrease in their average cost. The average balance of borrowings increased by $136.9 million to $557.2 million for the year ended June 30, 2015 from $420.3 million for the year ended June 30, 2014. For those same comparative periods, the average cost of borrowings declined seven basis points to 1.70% from 1.77%.\nThe net increase in the average balance of borrowings largely reflected a $138.9 million increase in the average balance of FHLB advances which increased to $526.5 million for the year ended June 30, 2015 from $387.6 million for the year ended June 30, 2014. For those same comparative periods, the average cost of FHLB advances decreased 11 basis points to 1.77% from 1.88%. The noted increase in the average balance of FHLB advances was partially offset by a $2.0 million decrease in the average balance of other borrowings, comprised primarily of depositor sweep accounts, to $30.7 million from $32.7 million. The average cost of sweep accounts remained stable at 0.50% for both comparative periods.\nProvision for Loan Losses. The provision for loan losses increased $2.7 million to $6.1 million for the year ended June 30, 2015 from $3.4 million for the year ended June 30, 2014. The net increase in the provision primarily reflected updates to historical and environmental loss factors utilized to measure impairment on collectively evaluated loans which increased the required allowance to be maintained against such loans in accordance with our allowance for loan loss calculation methodology. These increases were partially offset by comparatively lower net growth in such loans during the year ended June 30, 2015. The increase in provision expense also reflected an increase in specific losses recognized on loans evaluated individually for impairment during the year ended June 30, 2015. This increase in specific losses was exacerbated by a lower level of recoveries recognized on such loans between comparative periods.\nAdditional information regarding the allowance for loan losses and the associated provisions recognized during the year ended June 30, 2015 is presented in the Business\u201d section of this report as well as in Note 1 and Note 9 to the audited consolidated financial statements.\nNon-Interest Income. Non-interest income, excluding gains and losses on the sale of securities and REO, increased by $1.7 million to $8.7 million for the year ended June 30, 2015 from $7.0 million for the year ended June 30, 2014. The increase was largely attributable to the recognition of payouts on life insurance policies totaling $1.4 million during the year ended June 30, 2015 that were included in income from bank-owned life insurance. Absent the effect of these payouts, income from bank owned life insurance decreased by approximately $170,000 reflecting the lower level of income earned on such assets between comparative periods resulting from the sustained effects of lower long-term market interest rates on policy income earned.\nThe increase in non-interest income also included a net increase in fees and service charges attributable to an increase in loan prepayment fees that more than offset a net decline in deposit-related service fees as well as an increase in sale gains on SBA loans reflecting an overall increase in related loan origination and sale activity. Additionally, we recognized a non-recurring adjustment of $370,000 to gain on bargain purchase included in miscellaneous income during the year ended June 30, 2015 relating to the prior acquisition of Atlas Bank. The Company had originally recorded a $226,000 gain on bargain purchase during the year ended June 30, 2014 associated with that acquisition. These increases in non-interest income were partially offset by less noteworthy declines in miscellaneous income coupled with a decline in electronic banking fees and charges primarily reflecting fluctuations in ATM and debit card transaction volume.\nIn addition to the changes in non-interest income noted above, we also recognized net security sale gains totaling $7,000 during the year ended June 30, 2015 compared to $1.5 million of such gains recognized during the year ended June 30, 2014. We also recognized net losses totaling $793,000 arising from the write down and sale of real estate owned during the year ended June 30, 2015 compared to net losses of $441,000 recognized during the earlier comparative period. The increase in losses primarily reflected a $510,000 write down on one foreclosed property held in real estate owned during the year ended June 30, 2015 to reflect a decline in its fair value based on an updated property appraisal and listing agreement. The property, located in Absecon, New Jersey, had been operated as a hotel until both the property and business were abandoned by the borrower, which resulted in a rapid and severe deterioration of the property's condition and decline in fair value. The property was cleaned and secured and was listed for sale at June 30, 2015 and subsequently sold during the quarter ended December 31, 2015.\nNon-Interest Expenses. Non-interest expense, excluding our charitable contribution to the KearnyBank Foundation and merger-related expenses, increased $4.3 million to $68.1 million for the year ended June 30, 2015 from $63.8 million for the year ended June 30, 2014. The net increase in non-interest expense primarily reflected increases in salaries and employee benefits expense, premises occupancy expense, and miscellaneous expense. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in equipment and systems expense. Less noteworthy variances in other categories of non-interest expense such as advertising and marketing, federal deposit insurance and directors' compensation expenses, reflected normal growth or operating fluctuations within those categories.\nSalaries and employee benefits increased by $3.5 million to $39.2 million for the year ended June 30, 2015 from $35.8 million for the year ended June 30, 2014. The increase partly reflected overall increases in wage and salary expense and benefits expense attributable to our strategic efforts to expand our commercial lending origination and support staff. The increase also included the recognition of additional compensation costs resulting from the acquisition of Atlas on June 30, 2014. Such costs included the ongoing wages and salary expense of retained staff as well as a portion of the severance costs resulting from the acquisition. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in compensation expense reflecting the higher level of overtime compensation paid to employees during the earlier comparative period to support the Fiserv conversion.\nThe increase in salaries and employee benefits also reflected an increase in non-executive compensation expense arising from the realignment of the Company's annual employee performance assessment and compensation review process from a calendar year to fiscal year cycle. Additionally, the increase reflected the Company's adoption and implementation of the Senior Management Incentive Compensation Plan during fiscal 2015. Through this plan, senior and executive management's annual bonus compensation is based directly on the Company's actual fiscal year performance in relation to specific corporate profitability, growth and risk management goals and objectives outlined in its business plan.\nTo a lesser extent, the noted increase in salaries and employee benefits expense also reflected an increase in ESOP expense attributable to the increase in our share value between comparative periods coupled with an increase in stock benefit plan expenses attributable to stock options and shares of restricted stock granted to employees during the fourth quarters of fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2015. The increase also reflected an increase in health insurance premiums that went into effect during fiscal 2015.\nThe noted increases in salaries and employee benefits were partially offset by adjustments to accrued employee pension expense during the year ended June 30, 2015 arising from changes to actuarial assumptions relating to the Company's multi-employer defined benefit pension plan for employees. Such adjustments reduced the required contributions and associated expense that were recognized during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015.\nFinally, the variance in salaries and employee benefits reflected an increase in employer payroll tax expense that was partly attributable to the taxable compensation recognized by certain employees resulting from the exercise of stock options during the quarter ended September 30, 2014 while also reflecting the corresponding increase in employee wages and salaries noted above.\nThe increase in premises occupancy expense generally reflected higher levels of non-capitalized facility repair and maintenance charges between comparative periods. Such costs included a noteworthy increase in snow removal expense during the winter months of fiscal 2015 reflecting the adverse weather conditions that challenged the region during that period compared to the same period one year earlier. The increase in premises occupancy expense also reflected the effect of property tax refunds received during the prior year ended June 30, 2014 in conjunction with several successful tax appeal strategies enacted during that year. Additionally, the increase in expense reflected the ongoing costs of operating the two branch facilities originally acquired from Atlas Bank on June 30, 2014.\nThe increase in miscellaneous expense was partly attributable to an increase in professional and consulting service fees including, but not limited to, those relating to personnel recruitment expenses supporting expansion of our commercial lending resources as well as certain consulting expenses relating to our second step conversion that were not considered direct costs of the stock offering and were therefore expensed as incurred. Such increases also include additional audit and income tax-related expenses arising from the Company's acquisition of Atlas. The increase also reflected growth in loan-related underwriting and processing charges as well as an increase in loan-related servicing fees. Less noteworthy increases in miscellaneous expense were also reflected\nin corporate insurance, postage, telephone, regulatory assessment and REO-related expenses as well as an increase in core deposit intangible amortization expense resulting from the Atlas acquisition.\nThe noted increases in non-interest expense were partially offset by a decrease in equipment and systems expenses that largely reflected the recognition of certain non-recurring expenses supporting the Company's initial conversion to Fiserv systems during fiscal 2014 resulting in a comparatively lower level of expense recognized during fiscal 2015.\nWe implemented several technology-based systems available through our master service agreement with Fiserv, Inc. during the year ended June 30, 2015 which included mobile banking and person-to-person payment systems. We expect to implement additional systems over the next several quarters, including online account opening systems as well as additional back-office\u201d systems supporting loan underwriting, credit risk analysis and loan administration as well as financial systems supporting corporate asset/liability management, budgeting and forecasting analysis.\nWe expect to recognize a reduced level of non-recurring technology-related expenditures relating to the implementation of these additional technologies over the next several quarters. Upon completing all applicable system conversions and integrations with Fiserv, Inc., we anticipate that our recurring technology service provider expenses will be reduced compared to pre-conversion\u201d levels. Such anticipated cost savings are based upon the current composition and transactional characteristics of our customer account base and may vary over time based upon changes to those factors.\nIn addition to the non-recurring expenses associated with the Fiserv conversion during the prior year ended June 30, 2014, we also recognized $391,000 of non-recurring, merger-related expenses attributable to our acquisition of Atlas Bank during the prior year for which no such expenses were recognized during the year ended June 30, 2015. Additional information regarding our acquisition of Atlas Bank is presented in Note 2 to the audited consolidated financial statements.\nFinally, the overall increase in non-interest expense included a $10.0 million charitable contribution made by the Company to the KearnyBank Foundation in conjunction with the closing of the Company's second-step conversion and stock offering on May 18, 2015. The Company funded the contribution by issuing an additional 500,000 shares of its common stock with an aggregate value of $5.0 million and contributed these shares with an additional $5.0 million in cash to the KearnyBank Foundation.\nProvision for Income Taxes. The provision for income taxes decreased by $5.5 million to an income tax benefit of $1.3 million for the year ended June 30, 2015 compared to income tax expense of $4.2 million for the year ended June 30, 2014. The provision for both periods reflected the effects of the Company's recurring sources of tax-favored income on taxable net income for each year. Such recurring tax-favored income sources include interest income on municipal obligations and the income arising from periodic increases in the cash surrender value of bank owned life insurance.\nHowever, the taxable portion of the Company's net income for fiscal 2015 also reflected the effects of certain non-recurring sources of non-taxable income including a $1.4 million payout on bank-owned life insurance policies. In that regard, we also recognized a non-taxable adjustment to gain on bargain purchase totaling $370,000 during fiscal 2015 relating to the Atlas acquisition that exceeded the original bargain purchase gain of $226,000 recognized on that transaction during fiscal 2014.\nIn addition to these items, the income tax provision for fiscal 2015 reflected the utilization of a net operating loss carry forward originated by Kearny MHC, our prior mutual holding company, arising from its merger into the Company in conjunction with the second step conversion and stock offering. The value of that carryforward had not been recognized in prior years resulting in a $354,000 income tax benefit to the Company during fiscal 2015. The income tax provision for fiscal 2015 also reflected a $416,000 income tax benefit arising from the exercise of stock options during the year.\nAfter adjusting for the effects of these recurring and non-recurring factors, the overall decrease in the income tax provision largely reflected the underlying differences in the taxable portion of pre-tax income between comparative periods. Our effective income tax rate (benefit) during the year ended June 30, 2015 was (29.1)% which, in relation to statutory income tax rates, reflected the effects of the recurring and non-recurring items noted above. By comparison, our effective income tax rate for the year ended June 30, 2014 was 29.3% which primarily reflected the effects of recurring sources of tax-favored income and a comparatively lesser effect from non-recurring factors.\nAverage Balance Sheet. The following table sets forth certain information relating to Kearny Financial at and for the periods indicated. We derived the average yields and costs by dividing income or expense by the average balance of assets or liabilities, respectively, for the periods presented with daily balances used to derive average balances. No tax equivalent adjustments have been made to yield or costs.\nTable 114: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td>

is a product of our operating, investing and financing activities. Our primary sources of funds are deposits, amortization, prepayments and maturities of mortgage-backed securities and outstanding loans, maturities and calls of securities and funds provided from operations. In addition, we invest excess funds in short-term interest-earning assets, such as overnight deposits, which provide liquidity to meet lending requirements. While scheduled payments from the amortization of loans and mortgage-backed securities and maturing securities and short-term investments are relatively predictable sources of funds, general interest rates, economic conditions and competition greatly influence deposit flows and prepayments on loans and mortgage-backed securities.\nKearny Bank is required to have enough investments that qualify as liquid assets in order to maintain sufficient liquidity to ensure a safe operation. Liquidity may increase or decrease depending upon the availability of funds and comparative yields on investments in relation to the return on loans. We attempt to maintain adequate but not excessive liquidity and liquidity management is both a daily and long-term function of business management.\nCash and cash equivalents, consisting primarily of deposits in other banks, decreased $140.9 million to $199.2 million at June 30, 2016 from $340.1 million at June 30, 2015. The decrease largely reflected the deployment of the remaining portion of the new capital proceeds raised through the Company's second-step conversion and stock offering that were temporarily held in cash and cash equivalents at June 30, 2015. The balance of cash and cash equivalents at June 30, 2016 included funds on deposit at other institutions totaling $180.8 million and other cash-related items, consisting primarily of vault cash and cash held by, or in transit to/from, our cash repository service provider, totaling $18.4 million. Cash and equivalents on deposit at other institutions at June 30, 2016 included $11.2 million held by the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York ( FHLB\u201d), $147.0 million held by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York ( FRB\u201d) as well as $22.6 million held at three U.S. domestic money center banks representing funds on deposit totaling $13.4 million, $8.9 million and $281,000, respectively, at June 30, 2016.\nManagement reviews cash flow projections regularly and updates them monthly in order to maintain liquid assets at levels believed to meet the requirements of normal operations, including loan commitments and potential deposit outflows from maturing certificates of deposit and other deposit withdrawals. At June 30, 2016, Kearny Bank had commitments to originate and purchase loans totaling $35.6 million compared to $67.2 million at June 30, 2015. As of those same comparative dates, construction loans in process and unused lines of credit were $73,000 and $55.4 million, respectively, compared to $775,000 and $58.2 million, respectively. Kearny Bank had $666.1 million of certificates of deposit maturing in one year at June 30, 2016 compared to $526.5 million at June 30, 2015.\nDeposits increased $229.2 million to $2.69 billion at June 30, 2016 from $2.47 billion at June 30, 2015. Between those comparative periods, non-interest-bearing demand deposits increased $20.2 million to $238.8 million, interest-bearing demand deposits increased $8.1 million to $732.6 million, savings and club deposits decreased $4.9 million to $516.0 million while certificates of deposit increased $205.7 million to $1.21 billion. The net increase in interest-bearing checking accounts largely reflects an increase in retail deposits that was partially offset by a decrease in the balances of non-retail\u201d funding sources in the form of brokered money market deposits.\nBorrowings from the FHLB of New York and other sources are generally available to supplement Kearny Bank's liquidity position and to the extent that maturing deposits do not remain with us, management may replace the funds with such borrowings. Kearny Bank has the capacity to borrow additional funds from the FHLB by taking additional long-term or short-term advances including overnight borrowings. As of June 30, 2016, Kearny Bank's borrowing potential was $407.6 million without pledging additional collateral.\nThe following table sets forth information concerning balances and interest rates on

<table> <tr> <td> (1)\n</td> <td> Represents amounts committed to customers.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn addition to the loan commitments noted above, the Company has outstanding commitments to originate loans held for sale totaling $16.7 million at June 30, 2016. Origination commitments on loans held for sale whose terms include interest rate locks to borrowers are generally paired with a non-binding\u201d best-efforts commitment to sell the loan to a buyer at a fixed price and within a predetermined timeframe after the sale commitment is established.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe are a party to financial instruments with off-balance-sheet risk in the normal course of our business of investing in loans and securities as well as in the normal course of maintaining and improving Kearny Bank's facilities. These financial instruments include significant purchase commitments, such as commitments related to capital expenditure plans and commitments to purchase securities or mortgage-backed securities and commitments to extend credit to meet the financing needs of our customers. We had no significant off-balance sheet commitments to purchase securities as of June 30, 2016.\nIn addition to the commitments noted above, Kearny Bank is party to standby letters of credit totaling approximately $514,000 at June 30, 2016 through which we guarantee certain specific business obligations of our commercial customers.\nCommitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee. Our exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to the financial instrument for commitments to extend credit is represented by the contractual notional amount of those instruments. We use the same credit policies in making commitments and conditional obligations as we do for on-balance-sheet instruments.\nAt June 30, 2016, outstanding loan commitments relating to loans held in portfolio totaled $91.0 million compared to $126.2 million at June 30, 2015. As of that same date, the Company also had outstanding commitments to originate loans held for sale totaling $16.7 million that are considered derivative instruments whose values are not considered to be material for financial statement reporting purposes. Since some of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. For additional information regarding our outstanding lending commitments at June 30, 2016, see Notes 15 and 19 to the audited consolidated financial statements.\nCapital\nConsistent with our goals to operate as a sound and profitable financial organization, Kearny Financial and Kearny Bank actively seek to maintain our well capitalized status in accordance with regulatory standards. As of June 30, 2016, Kearny Financial and Kearny Bank exceeded all capital requirements of the federal banking regulators and were considered well capitalized\u201d.\nKearny Bank's regulatory capital ratios at June 30, 2016 were as follows: Tier 1 leverage ratio 15.88%; Common Equity Tier I risk-based capital 25.16%; Tier I risk-based capital 25.16%; and total risk-based capital 26.03%.\nKearny Financial's regulatory capital ratios at June 30, 2016 were as follows: Tier 1 leverage ratio 23.93%; Common Equity Tier I risk-based capital 37.91%; Tier I risk-based capital 37.91%; and total risk-based capital 38.78%.\nThe regulatory capital requirements to be considered well capitalized at June 30, 2016 were as follows: Tier 1 leverage ratio 5.0%; Common Equity Tier I risk-based capital 6.5%; Tier I risk-based capital 8.0%; and total risk-based capital 10.0%.\nFor additional information regarding regulatory capital at June 30, 2016, see Note 17 to the audited consolidated financial statements.\nImpact of Inflation\nThe financial statements included in this document have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. These principles require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars, without considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation.\nOur primary assets and liabilities are monetary in nature. As a result, interest rates have a more significant impact on our performance than the effects of general levels of inflation. Interest rates, however, do not necessarily move in the same direction or with the same magnitude as the price of goods and services, since such prices are affected by inflation. In a period of rapidly rising interest rates, the liquidity and maturities of our assets and liabilities are critical to the maintenance of acceptable performance levels.\nThe principal effect of inflation on earnings, as distinct from levels of interest rates, is in the area of non-interest expense. Expense items such as employee compensation, employee benefits and occupancy and equipment costs may be subject to increases as a result of inflation. An additional effect of inflation is the possible increase in the dollar value of the collateral securing loans that we have made. We are unable to determine the extent, if any, to which properties securing our loans have appreciated in dollar value due to inflation.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nFor a discussion of the expected impact of recently issued accounting pronouncements that have yet to be adopted by us, please refer to Note 3 to the audited consolidated financial statements.", "summary": "- For the year ended June 30, 2016, loans receivable, excluding loans held for sale, increased by $571.1 million to $2.67 billion, or 64.6% of earning assets, at June 30, 2016 from $2.10 billion, or 54.1% of earning assets, at June 30, 2015.\n- The growth in loans during fiscal 2016 continued to reflect our strategic emphasis in growing our commercial loan portfolio, including multi-family loans, nonresidential mortgage loans and commercial business loans.\n- For the year ended June 30, 2016, our total deposits increased by $229.2 million to $2.69 billion from $2.47 billion at June 30, 2015.\n- The net increase in deposits reflected a $23.4 million increase in the balance of non-maturity deposits, including a $20.2 million increase in the balance of non-interest-bearing accounts, coupled with a $205.8 million increase in certificates of deposit.\n- The balance of borrowings increased by $42.9 million to $614.4 million at June 30, 2016 from $571.5 million at June 30, 2015.", "item_7_tables": "", "item_7_text": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nGeneral\nThis discussion and analysis reflects Kearny Financial Corp.'s consolidated financial statements and other relevant statistical data, and is intended to enhance your understanding of our financial condition and results of operations. You should read the information in this section in conjunction with the business and financial information regarding Kearny Financial Corp. and the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOverview\nFinancial Condition. Total assets increased $262.9 million to $4.50 billion at June 30, 2016 from $4.24 billion at June 30, 2015. The increase in total assets reflected an increase in net loans receivable that was partially offset by decreases in securities and cash and cash equivalents. The increase in total assets was largely funded by increases in deposits and borrowings that were partially offset by a decrease in stockholders' equity. The decrease in stockholders' equity primarily reflected the Company's share repurchases that outpaced the accretion from earnings during the year.\nFor the year ended June 30, 2016, loans receivable, excluding loans held for sale, increased by $571.1 million to $2.67 billion, or 64.6% of earning assets, at June 30, 2016 from $2.10 billion, or 54.1% of earning assets, at June 30, 2015. The growth in loans during fiscal 2016 continued to reflect our strategic emphasis in growing our commercial loan portfolio, including multi-family loans, nonresidential mortgage loans and commercial business loans. The increase in commercial mortgage and commercial business loans during fiscal 2016 totaled $540.6 million, or 38.4%, to $1.95 billion, or 73.0% of total loans at June 30, 2016, from to $1.41 billion, or 67.0% of total loans, at June 30, 2015. For those same comparative periods, one- to four-family mortgage loans, including first mortgages and home equity loans and lines of credit, increased by $10.8 million to $694.8 million, or 26.0% of total loans, from $684.0 million, or 32.5% of total loans.\nFor those same comparative periods, total securities decreased by $175.2 million to $1.26 billion, or 30.3% of earning assets, at June 30, 2016 from $1.43 billion, or 36.8% of earning assets, at June 30, 2015. We generally maintained the overall composition and allocation of our securities portfolio during fiscal 2016. Non-mortgage-backed securities, including U.S. agency debentures, corporate bonds, single-issuer trust preferred securities, collateralized loan obligations, municipal obligations, and asset-backed securities decreased by $83.4 million to $557.1 million, or 44.5% of securities, at June 30, 2016 from $640.5 million, or 44.8% of securities, at June 30, 2015. For those same comparative periods, the balance of mortgage-backed securities, comprised primarily of U.S. government and agency pass-through securities and collateralized mortgage obligations, decreased by $96.4 million to $693.7 million, or 55.5% of securities, from $790.1 million, or 55.2% of securities.\nFor the year ended June 30, 2016, our total deposits increased by $229.2 million to $2.69 billion from $2.47 billion at June 30, 2015. The net increase in deposits reflected a $23.4 million increase in the balance of non-maturity deposits, including a $20.2 million increase in the balance of non-interest-bearing accounts, coupled with a $205.8 million increase in certificates of deposit.\nThe balance of borrowings increased by $42.9 million to $614.4 million at June 30, 2016 from $571.5 million at June 30, 2015. The increase in borrowings was primarily attributable to a $42.4 million net increase in FHLB advances representing new advances drawn to fund a portion of the loan growth reported during fiscal 2016 that were partially offset by the balance of advances repaid during the year. Interest rate derivatives were used to effectively extend duration of the new borrowings drawn for interest rate risk management purposes. The increase in borrowings also reflected a $541,000 increase in the balance of overnight borrowings in the form of depositor sweep accounts.\nStockholders' equity decreased by $19.7 million to $1.15 billion at June 30, 2016 from $1.17 billion at June 30, 2015. The decrease in stockholders' equity largely reflected the impact of the Company's share repurchases during fiscal 2016. The Company initiated a new share repurchase program in May 2016 through which it intends to repurchase a total of 9,352,809 shares, or 10%, of its outstanding shares. Through June 30, 2016, the Company repurchased 1,706,182 shares, or 18.2% of the shares to be repurchased under the current program, at a total cost of $22.3 million and at an average cost of $13.06 per share. The net decrease in stockholders' equity also reflected a decrease in accumulated other comprehensive income arising from changes in the fair value of the Company's available for sale securities and derivatives portfolios.\nThe noted decreases in stockholders' equity were partially offset by net income of $15.8 million, of which $7.2 million were distributed as cash dividends to stockholders during fiscal 2016, as well as a $1.9 million decrease in unearned ESOP reflecting the effects of shares earned by plan participants during the year.\nAt June 30, 2016, the Company had 91,821,910 shares outstanding, comprising 93,528,092 shares originally issued less 1,706,182 shares repurchased and cancelled.\nResults of Operations. Our results of operations depend primarily on our net interest income. Net interest income is the difference between the interest income we earn on our interest-earning assets and the interest we pay on our interest-bearing liabilities. It is a function of the average balances of loans and investments versus deposits and borrowed funds outstanding in any one period and the yields earned on those loans and investments and the cost of those deposits and borrowed funds. Our results of operations are also affected by our provision for loan losses, non-interest income and non-interest expense.\nNet income for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016 was $15.8 million or $0.18 per diluted share; an increase of $10.2 million from $5.6 million, or $0.06 per diluted share, for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015. Net income for fiscal 2015 reflected a $10.0 million charitable contribution made by the Company to the KearnyBank Foundation in conjunction with the closing of the Company's second-step conversion and stock offering. The contribution included $5.0 million in cash and 500,000 shares of the Company's common stock valued at $10.00 per share for a total contribution of $10.0 million. After giving effect to the income tax benefit, the contribution reduced net income for the year ended June 30, 2015 by approximately $6.1 million or $0.07 per basic and diluted share.\nOur net interest income increased $14.4 million to $95.0 million for the year ended June 30, 2016 from $80.6 million for the year ended June 30, 2015. The increase in net interest income primarily reflected a $20.9 million increase in interest income to $126.9 million from $106.0 million. The increase in interest income primarily reflected an increase in the average balance of interest-earning assets coupled with an increase in their average yield. For the year ended June 30, 2016, the average balance of interest-earning assets increased by $603.4 million to $4.05 billion compared to $3.45 billion for the year ended June 30, 2015. For those same comparative periods, the average yield on interest-earning assets increased by five basis points to 3.13% from 3.08%.\nThe increase in interest income for the year ended June 30, 2016 was partially offset by a $6.5 million increase in interest expense. The increase in interest expense between the two periods reflected an increase in the average balance of interest-bearing liabilities coupled with an increase in their average cost. For the year ended June 30, 2016 the average balance of interest-bearing liabilities increased by $78.5 million to $2.97 billion compared to $2.90 billion for the year ended June 30, 2015. For those same comparative periods, the average cost of interest-bearing liabilities increased 19 basis points to 1.07% from 0.88%.\nThe net interest rate spread decreased 14 basis points to 2.06% for fiscal 2016 from 2.20% for fiscal 2015 while the net interest margin increased one basis point to 2.35% from 2.34% for those same comparative periods. The increase in the Company's net interest margin primarily reflected the beneficial impact to net interest income arising from the increase in the average balance of interest-earning assets that was attributable to the investment of the net capital proceeds raised in conjunction with the closing of the Company's second step conversion and stock offering in May 2016.\nThe provision for loan losses increased $4.6 million to $10.7 million for fiscal 2016 from $6.1 million for fiscal 2015. The net increase in the provision primarily reflected updates to historical and environmental loss factors utilized to measure impairment on collectively evaluated loans. The increase in provision expense also reflected the greater growth in such loans during fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015. The increase in provision expense attributable to these factors was partially offset by a net decrease in specific losses recognized on loans evaluated individually for impairment that largely reflected a higher level of recoveries recognized on such loans during fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015.\nNon-interest income increased $2.8 million to $10.7 million for fiscal 2016 from $7.9 million for fiscal 2015. The increase was partly attributable to an increase in the income arising from our investment in bank-owned life insurance due largely to the growth in the average balance of the cash surrender value of the various policies held by the Company. The increase in non-interest income also reflected an increase in fees and service charges that was primarily attributable to an increase in loan prepayment charges and increases in electronic banking fees and charges. Additionally, the increase in non-interest income reflected an increase in loan sale gains attributable to an increase in SBA loans originated and sold as well as reflecting gains on sale of residential mortgage loans arising from the initial implementation of the Company's mortgage banking business strategy during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. These increases in non-interest income were augmented by a decrease in net losses relating to write downs and sales of real estate owned between comparative periods. The noted increases in non-interest income were partially offset by a decrease in miscellaneous income that primarily reflected the recognition of a non-recurring adjustment to gain on bargain purchase during the year ended June 30, 2015 relating to the prior acquisition of Atlas Bank.\nNon-interest expense decreased by $5.7 million to $72.4 million for the year ended June 30, 2016 from $78.1 million for the year ended June 30, 2015. The decrease in non-interest expense primarily reflected the non-recurring $10.0 million charitable contribution that was made by the Company to the KearnyBank Foundation in conjunction with the closing of the Company's second-step conversion and stock offering that was included in miscellaneous expense in fiscal 2015. The decrease in miscellaneous expense also reflected a non-recurring recovery of pension plan expense during fiscal 2016 resulting from the Company's amendment of its Directors Consultation and Retirement Plan (the DCRP\u201d) during the year.\nThe noted decreases in non-interest expense were partially offset by increases in other categories including salaries and employee benefits, advertising and marketing, deposit insurance and director compensation expenses. The increase in compensation-related expense partly reflected the limited and controlled expansion of the Company's human resources within the Company's various business lines and, where needed, the supporting operating and risk management departments. The incremental increase in expense associated with these new resources was partially defrayed by the Company's efforts to improve overall operating efficiency during fiscal 2016 that resulted in a net decrease in the number of full time equivalent ( FTE\u201d) employees for the year.\nThe changes in non-interest expense also reflected an increase in advertising and marketing expenses coupled with an increase in director compensation expense attributable to the addition of two independent directors during fiscal 2016. The increase in non-interest expense also included an increase in deposit insurance expense largely reflected the overall growth in Company's total assets.\nThe combined effects of these factors resulted in an increase in pre-tax net income during fiscal 2016 compared with fiscal 2015. Given the comparative effects of the Company's recurring tax-favored income sources on taxable net income between periods, including income from municipal obligations and bank-owned life insurance, coupled with the recognition of other non-recurring tax-related adjustments arising, in part, from our second step conversion and prior acquisition of Atlas Bank, the Company recognized income tax expense for fiscal 2016 compared to an income tax benefit recognized for fiscal 2015.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nOur accounting policies are integral to understanding the results reported. We describe them in detail in Note 1 to our audited consolidated financial statements included as an exhibit to this document. In preparing the audited consolidated financial statements, management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the dates of the consolidated statements of financial condition and revenues and expenses for the periods then ended. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. Material estimates that are particularly susceptible to significant changes relate to the determination of the allowance for loan losses, the evaluation of securities impairment and the impairment testing of goodwill.\nAllowance for Loan Losses. The allowance for loan losses is a valuation account that reflects our estimation of the losses in our loan portfolio to the extent they are both probable and reasonable to estimate. The balance of the allowance is generally maintained through provisions for loan losses that are charged to income in the period that estimated losses on loans are identified by our loan review system. We charge losses on loans against the allowance as such losses are actually incurred. Recoveries on loans previously charged-off are added back to the allowance.\nAs described in greater detail in the notes to audited consolidated financial statements, our allowance for loan loss calculation methodology utilizes a two-tier\u201d loss measurement process that is performed quarterly. Through the first tier of the process, we identify the loans that must be reviewed individually for impairment. Such loans generally include our larger and/or more complex loans including commercial mortgage loans, as well as our one- to four-family mortgage loans, home equity loans and home equity lines of credit. A reviewed loan is deemed to be impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. Once a loan is determined to be impaired, management measures the amount of the estimated impairment associated with that loan which is generally defined as the amount by which the carrying value of a loan exceeds its fair value. We establish valuation allowances for loan impairments in the fiscal period during which they are identified. Impairments on individually evaluated loans generally are charged off against the applicable valuation allowance when they are determined to be confirmed, expected losses.\nThe second tier of the loss measurement process involves estimating the probable and estimable losses on loans not otherwise individually reviewed for impairment. Such loans generally comprise large groups of smaller-balance homogeneous loans as well as the remaining non-impaired loans of those types noted above that are otherwise eligible for individual impairment evaluation.\nValuation allowances established through the second tier of the loss measurement process utilize historical and environmental loss factors to collectively estimate the level of probable losses within defined segments of our loan portfolio. To calculate the historical loss factors, our allowance for loan loss methodology generally utilizes a 24-month moving average of annual net charge-off rates (charge-offs net of recoveries) by loan segment, where available, to calculate the actual, historical loss experience. The outstanding principal balance of each loan segment is multiplied by the applicable historical loss factor to estimate the level of probable losses based upon our historical loss experience.\nEnvironmental loss factors are based upon specific qualitative criteria representing key sources of risk within the loan portfolio. Such risk criteria includes the level of and trends in nonperforming loans; the effects of changes in credit policy; the experience, ability and depth of the lending function's management and staff; national and local economic trends and conditions; credit risk concentrations; changes in local and regional real estate values; changes in the nature, volume and terms of loans; changes in the quality of loan review systems and resources and the effects of regulatory, legal and other external factors. The outstanding principal\nbalance of each loan segment is multiplied by the applicable environmental loss factor to estimate the level of probable losses based upon the qualitative risk criteria.\nThe sum of the probable and estimable loan losses calculated in accordance with loss measurement processes, as described above, represents the total targeted balance for our allowance for loan losses at the end of a fiscal period. A more detailed discussion of our allowance for loan loss calculation methodology is presented in Note 1 to our audited consolidated financial statements.\nImpairment Testing of Goodwill. We record goodwill, representing the excess of amounts paid over the fair value of net assets of the institutions acquired in purchase transactions, at its fair value at the date of acquisition. Goodwill is tested and deemed impaired when the carrying value of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value. Goodwill was most recently tested as of June 30, 2016, at which time no impairment was indicated. As of that date, we reported goodwill of $108.6 million. The value of the goodwill can change in the future. We expect the value of the goodwill to decrease if there is a significant decrease in the franchise value of Kearny Bank. If an impairment is determined in the future, we will reflect the loss as an expense in the period in which the impairment is determined, leading to a reduction of our net income for that period by the amount of the impairment.\nOther-than-Temporary Impairment ( OTTI\u201d) of Securities. If the fair value of a security is less than its amortized cost, the security is deemed to be impaired. Management evaluates all securities with unrealized losses quarterly to determine if such impairments are temporary\u201d or other-than-temporary\u201d in accordance with applicable accounting guidance.\nWe account for temporary impairments based upon the classification of the related security as either available for sale, held to maturity or trading. Temporary impairments on available for sale\u201d securities are recognized, on a tax-effected basis, through accumulated other comprehensive income with offsetting entries adjusting the carrying value of the security and the balance of deferred taxes. Conversely, we do not adjust the carrying value of held to maturity\u201d securities for temporary impairments, although information concerning the amount and duration of impairments on held to maturity securities is generally disclosed in periodic financial statements. The carrying value of securities held in a trading portfolio is adjusted to their fair value through earnings on a daily basis. However, we maintained no securities in trading portfolios at or during the periods presented in these financial statements.\nWe account for OTTI based upon several considerations. First, OTTI on securities that we have decided to sell as of the close of a fiscal period, or will, more likely than not, be required to sell prior to the full recovery of their fair value to a level equal to or exceeding their amortized cost, are recognized in earnings. If neither of these conditions regarding the likelihood of the security's sale is applicable, then the OTTI is bifurcated into credit-related and noncredit-related components. A credit-related impairment generally represents the amount by which the present value of the cash flows that are expected to be collected on an other-than-temporarily impaired security fall below its amortized cost. The noncredit-related component represents the remaining portion of the impairment not otherwise designated as credit-related. We recognize credit-related, OTTI in earnings. However, noncredit-related, other-than-temporary impairments on debt securities are recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income.\nComparison of Financial Condition at June 30, 2016 and June 30, 2015\nGeneral. Total assets increased $262.9 million to $4.50 billion at June 30, 2016 from $4.24 billion at June 30, 2015. The net increase in total assets reflected an increase in net loans receivable that was partially offset by decreases in securities and cash and cash equivalents. The net increase in total assets was largely funded by increases in deposits and borrowings that were partially offset by a net decrease in stockholders' equity.\nCash and Cash Equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents, which consist primarily of interest-earning and non-interest-earning deposits in other banks, decreased by $140.9 million to $199.2 million at June 30, 2016 from $340.1 million at June 30, 2015. The decrease in cash and cash equivalents reflected the deployment of the remaining proceeds raised through the Company's second-step conversion and stock offering that were not yet fully invested at June 30, 2015. Such funds were primarily reinvested into the loan portfolio during the first quarter of fiscal 2016.\nNotwithstanding the overall decrease between periods, the balance of cash and cash equivalents at June 30, 2016 reflected a temporary accumulation of short-term, liquid assets arising from an increase in loan prepayments during the quarter ended June 30, 2016. The Company intends to reinvest a significant portion of that excess liquidity back into the loan portfolio during the first quarter of fiscal 2017.\nManagement actively monitors the level of short term, liquid assets in relation to the expected need for such liquidity to fund the Company's strategic initiatives while meeting its performance and risk management objectives. Where appropriate, the Company may alter its liquidity management strategies based upon those objectives. In that regard, the Company generally expects to reduce\nthe balance of cash and cash equivalents maintained, compared to those balances held at June 30, 2016, to further reduce the opportunity cost of maintaining excess liquidity.\nDebt Securities Available for Sale. Debt securities classified as available for sale decreased by $30.8 million to $389.9 million at June 30, 2016 from $420.7 million at June 30, 2015. The decrease partly reflected principal repayments, net of premium amortization and discount accretion, totaling $20.8 million during the year ended June 30, 2016. The decrease also reflected a $10.0 million increase in the net unrealized loss of the portfolio to a net unrealized loss of $12.2 million at June 30, 2016 from a net unrealized loss of $2.2 million at June 30, 2015. The increase in the net unrealized loss reflected changes in the fair value of various sectors within the portfolio arising from movements in market interest rates coupled with a widening of pricing spreads within certain sectors in the portfolio.\nThe increase in the net unrealized loss on debt securities available for sale was primarily reflected within the applicable credit sectors\u201d of the portfolio which include asset-backed securities, collateralized loan obligations, corporate bonds and non-pooled trust preferred securities. The net unrealized loss on this subset of securities increased by $11.7 million to a net unrealized loss of $13.3 million at June 30, 2016 from a net unrealized loss of $1.6 million at June 30, 2015. The increase largely reflected a general widening of pricing spreads in the marketplace resulting in an overall decrease in the market price of such securities coupled with the adverse effect of certain credit-rating downgrades on specific corporate securities within the portfolio. The increase in the net unrealized loss on the noted securities was partially offset by a $1.7 million change to an unrealized gain of $1.0 million on government and agency securities, including U.S. agency debentures and municipal obligations, from a net unrealized loss of $623,000 on such securities for the same comparative periods.\nBased on its evaluation, management has concluded that no other-than-temporary impairment is present within this segment of the investment portfolio as of June 30, 2016. However, volatility in the financial markets may result in additional decreases in the fair value of the Company's available for sale securities. Such volatility may impact the fair value of the securities within the credit sectors\u201d of the portfolio more adversely than the Company's government and agency securities. The adverse effects of such volatility on the current and prospective financial strength of specific corporate issuers, and the resulting impact on the fair value of the related securities held by the Company, will be carefully monitored by management.\nMortgage-backed Securities Available for Sale. Mortgage-backed securities available for sale decreased by $63.0 million to $283.6 million at June 30, 2016 from $346.6 million at June 30, 2015. The net decrease reflected cash repayment of principal, net of discount accretion and premium amortization, totaling $68.4 million that was partially offset by a $5.4 million increase in the net unrealized gain on the portfolio to a net unrealized gain of $7.5 million at June 30, 2016 from a net unrealized gain of $2.1 million at June 30, 2015.\nAt June 30, 2016, the available for sale mortgage-backed securities portfolio primarily included agency pass-through securities and agency collateralized mortgage obligations. As of that date, we also held one non-agency mortgage-backed security within the available for sale portfolio whose aggregate carrying value totaled $124,000. Based on its evaluation, management has concluded that no other-than-temporary impairment is present within this segment of the investment portfolio as of that date.\nAdditional information regarding securities available for sale at June 30, 2016 is presented in the Business\u201d section of this report as well as in Note 5 and Note 7 to the audited consolidated financial statements.\nDebt Securities Held to Maturity. Debt securities classified as held to maturity decreased by $52.7 million to $167.2 million at June 30, 2016 from $219.9 million at June 30, 2015. The net decrease in the portfolio largely reflected principal repayments, net of premium amortization and discount accretion, totaling $64.9 million during the year ended June 30, 2016. The net decrease was partially offset by the purchase of $12.2 million in securities during the same period.\nAt June 30, 2016, the held to maturity debt securities portfolio included U.S. agency debentures and municipal obligations, a small portion of which represent non-rated, short term, bond anticipation notes ( BANs\u201d) issued by New Jersey municipalities. Based on its evaluation, management has concluded that no other-than-temporary impairment is present within this segment of the investment portfolio as of that date.\nMortgage-backed Securities Held to Maturity. Mortgage-backed securities held to maturity decreased by $33.4 million to $410.1 million at June 30, 2016 from $443.5 million at June 30, 2015. The decrease in the portfolio reflected cash repayment of principal, net of discount accretion and premium amortization, totaling $51.0 million during the year ended June 30, 2016. These decreases were partially offset by purchases of securities totaling $17.6 million during the same period.\nAt June 30, 2016, the held to maturity mortgage-backed securities portfolio primarily included agency pass-through securities and agency collateralized mortgage obligations. As of that date, we also held four non-agency mortgage-backed securities in the held to maturity portfolio whose aggregate carrying value and fair value totaled $33,000 and $32,000, respectively. Based on its evaluation,\nmanagement has concluded that no other-than-temporary impairment is present within this segment of the investment portfolio as of that date.\nAdditional information regarding securities available for sale at June 30, 2016 is presented in the Business\u201d section of this report as well as in Note 6 and Note 7 to the audited consolidated financial statements.\nLoans Held-for-Sale. The Company expanded its residential lending infrastructure during fiscal 2016 to support strategies focused on increasing the origination volume of residential mortgage loans for sale into the secondary market. Toward that end, the Company hired a new Director of Residential Lending during the quarter ended December 31, 2015 who evaluated and modified the Company's residential lending function to support that objective. The anticipated increase in residential mortgage loan origination and sale activity is expected to increase the Company's level of non-interest income over time through the recognition of additional sources of recurring loan sale gains while serving to help manage the Company's exposure to interest rate risk. The noted enhancements to the Company's residential mortgage lending infrastructure and business strategies were completed during the fourth quarter ended June 30, 2016 and mortgage banking sales activity commenced. During the quarter ended June 30, 2016, we sold $5.9 million of residential mortgage loans resulting in net sale gains totaling $82,000 for the period. Loans held for sale at June 30, 2016 totaled $3.3 million and are reported separately from balance of net loans receivable as of that date.\nLoans Receivable. Loans receivable, net of unamortized premiums, deferred costs and the allowance for loan losses, increased by $562.5 million or 26.9% to $2.65 billion at June 30, 2016 from $2.09 billion at June 30, 2015. The increase in net loans receivable was primarily attributable to new loan origination and purchase volume outpacing loan repayments during the year ended June 30, 2016.\nResidential mortgage loans held in portfolio, including home equity loans and lines of credit, increased by $10.8 million to $694.8 million at June 30, 2016 from $684.0 million at June 30, 2015. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in the balance of one-to-four family first mortgage loans of $12.9 million to $605.2 million at June 30, 2016 from $592.3 million at June 30, 2015. The net increase also reflected an $87,000 increase in the balance of home equity loans to $70.3 million at June 30, 2016. These increases were partially offset by a $2.2 million decrease in the balance of home equity lines of credit to $19.2 million at June 30, 2016 from $21.4 million at June 30, 2015.\nThe growth in the portfolio during fiscal 2016 reflected the Company's intent to modestly increase the outstanding balance of residential mortgage loans held in portfolio while allowing the segment to continue to decline as a percentage of total loans and earning assets. In total, the origination and purchase volume of portfolio residential mortgage loans for the year ended June 30, 2016 were $87.2 million and $36.3 million, respectively, while aggregate originations of home equity loans and home equity lines of credit totaled $22.7 million for that same period.\nCommercial loans, in aggregate, increased by $540.6 million to $1.95 billion at June 30, 2016 from $1.41 billion at June 30, 2015. The components of the aggregate increase included an increase in commercial mortgage loans totaling $551.9 million that was partially offset by an $11.2 million decrease in commercial business loans. The ending balances of commercial mortgage loans and commercial business loans at June 30, 2016 were $1.86 billion and $88.2 million, respectively.\nCommercial loan origination volume for the year ended June 30, 2016 totaled $510.1 million, comprising $489.3 million and $20.8 million of commercial mortgage and commercial business loan originations, respectively. Commercial loan originations were augmented with the purchase of commercial mortgage loans and participations totaling $274.9 million coupled with the purchase of commercial business loans totaling $19.8 million during the year ended June 30, 2016.\nThe outstanding balance of construction loans, net of loans-in-process, decreased by $3.7 million to $2.0 million at June 30, 2016 from $5.7 million at June 30, 2015. Construction loan disbursements for the year ended June 30, 2016 totaled $1.1 million.\nOther loans, primarily comprising account loans, deposit account overdraft lines of credit and other consumer loans, increased by $21.1 million to $25.4 million at June 30, 2016 from $4.3 million at June 30, 2015. The balance of consumer loans at June 30, 2016 includes loans acquired through the Company's relationship with Lending Club, an established peer-to-peer (i.e. marketplace) lender. Through this relationship, the Company has purchased high-quality, unsecured consumer loans originated through Lending Club's online platform. The Company generally limits its purchases of Lending Club loans to those issued to qualified borrowers falling within the three highest credit tiers defined within Lending Club's proprietary credit risk model.\nAt June 30, 2016, the outstanding balance of the Company's Lending Club loans totaled $21.8 million, representing the outstanding balance of 1,252 loans with a weighted average interest rate of 9.78% and weighted average FICO scores and debt-to-income ratios of 729 and 17.9%, respectively. A total of 14 Lending Club loans with aggregate outstanding balances totaling\n$260,000, or 1.20% of total Lending Club loans, were 120 days or less past due\u201d at June 30, 2016 while three loans totaling $51,000 were charged off during the year ended June 30, 2016.\nThe Company generally intends to limit the outstanding balance of its Lending Club loan portfolio to an initial threshold of approximately $25.0 million in aggregate outstanding balances. However, the Company temporarily suspended its purchases of Lending Club loans during the quarter ended June 30, 2016 based upon recently disclosed events that resulted in the resignation of the Lending Club's founder and CEO. Subject to a satisfactory resolution of these matters, the Company generally intends to maintain the balance of its portfolio within the noted threshold for a period of time while continuing to independently monitor and validate the performance of the portfolio in relation to the Company's expectations as well as those of Lending Club's proprietary credit risk model. Additional investment in Lending Club loans may be considered by the Company after a sufficient period of time to properly gauge performance of the initial portfolio and quality of loan servicing and reporting rendered by Lending Club.\nThe Company purchased a total of $25.5 million through Lending Club during the year ended June 30, 2016 while internal originations of other consumer loans totaled approximately $1.1 million for the same period.\nNonperforming Loans. Nonperforming loans decreased by $1.8 million to $21.1 million, or 0.79% of total loans at June 30, 2016, from $22.9 million or 1.09% of total loans at June 30, 2015. Nonperforming generally include loans reported as accruing loans over 90 days past due\u201d and loans reported as nonaccrual\u201d with such balances totaling $38,000 and $21.0 million, respectively, at June 30, 2016.\nAdditional information about the Company's nonperforming loans at June 30, 2016 is presented in the Business\u201d section of this report as well as in Note 9 to the audited consolidated financial statements.\nAllowance for Loan Losses. During the year ended June 30, 2016, the balance of the allowance for loan losses increased by $8.6 million to $24.2 million or 0.90% of total loans at June 30, 2016 from $15.6 million or 0.74% of total loans at June 30, 2015. The increase resulted from provisions of $10.7 million during the year ended June 30, 2016 that were partially offset by charge-offs, net of recoveries, totaling $2.1 million.\nAdditional information about the allowance for loan losses at June 30, 2016 is presented in the Business\u201d section of this report as well as in Note 1 and Note 9 to the audited consolidated financial statements.\nOther Assets. The aggregate balance of other assets, including premises and equipment, FHLB stock, interest receivable, goodwill, bank owned life insurance, deferred income taxes and other miscellaneous assets, increased by $17.8 million to $397.0 million at June 30, 2016 from $379.2 million at June 30, 2015.\nThe increase in other assets reflected a $8.1 million increase in deferred income tax assets arising primarily from changes in the fair value of the Company's available for sale securities and derivatives portfolios coupled with an increase in the allowance for loan losses. The increase also reflected a $3.1 million increase in FHLB stock resulting from an increase in short-term advances drawn during the year ended June 30, 2016 coupled with a $5.6 million increase in the cash surrender value of the Company's bank-owned life insurance policies.\nThe noted increases in other assets included a $116,000 decrease in the balance of real estate owned ( REO\u201d) to $826,000, representing the carrying value of three properties at June 30, 2016, from $942,000, representing the carrying value of two properties at June 30, 2015.\nThe remaining increases and decreases in other assets during the year ended June 30, 2016 generally comprised normal operating fluctuations in their respective balances.\nDeposits. Total deposits increased by $229.2 million to $2.69 billion at June 30, 2016 from $2.47 billion at June 30, 2015. The increase in deposit balances reflected a $209.0 million increase in interest-bearing deposits coupled with a $20.2 million increase in non-interest-bearing checking accounts. The net increase in interest-bearing deposits comprised increases in certificates of deposit and interest-bearing checking accounts totaling $205.7 million and $8.2 million, respectively, that were partially offset by a $4.9 million decrease in the balance of savings and club accounts for the year ended June 30, 2016.\nThe increase in the balance of certificates of deposit largely reflected the effects of attractive retail pricing offered on a limited number of promotional products during specific periods in fiscal 2016 to fund a portion of the growth in loans during the period while also providing opportunities to cross-sell core deposit products to newly acquired customers. The attractive pricing on certain certificate of deposit products resulted in a limited amount of disintermediation from interest-bearing checking accounts which contributed to the limited growth or declines in those balances. The concurrent increase in non-interest-bearing deposits partly\nreflected fluctuating balances within certain large commercial deposit accounts. Notwithstanding these day-to-day fluctuations, the average balance of non-interest-bearing deposits has increased by $7.5 million to $225.4 million for the year ended June 30, 2016 compared to $217.9 million for the year ended June 30, 2015.\nThe change in deposit balances for the period reflected changes in the balances of retail deposits as well as non-retail\u201d deposits acquired through various wholesale channels. The $8.2 million increase in the balance of interest-bearing checking accounts reflected a $10.2 million increase in the balance of retail accounts that was partially offset by a $2.0 million decrease in the balance of brokered money market deposits acquired through Promontory's IND program whose balances decreased to $224.1 million, or 8.3% of total deposits at June 30, 2016, from $226.2 million, or 9.2% of total deposits at June 30, 2015. The terms of the IND program generally establish a reciprocal commitment for Promontory to deliver and for us to accept such deposits for a period of no less than five years during which time total aggregate balances shall be maintained within a range of $200.0 million to $230.0 million. Such deposits are generally sourced by Promontory from large retail and institutional brokerage firms whose individual clients seek to have a portion of their investments held in interest-bearing accounts at FDIC-insured institutions. The decrease in IND program balances was more than offset by a $10.2 million increase in retail interest-bearing checking accounts.\nWe continued to utilize a deposit listing service through which we attract non-brokered\u201d wholesale time deposits targeting institutional investors with an original investment horizon of three-to-five years. We generally prohibit the withdrawal of our listing service deposits prior to maturity. The balance of the Bank's listing service time deposits remained stable at $89.9 million representing 3.3% and 3.6% of total deposits at June 30, 2016 and June 30, 2015, respectively.\nWe also maintain a small portfolio of longer-term, brokered certificates of deposit that were originally acquired during fiscal 2014 whose balances decreased by approximately $10.0 million to $8.4 million at June 30, 2016 from $18.4 million at June 30, 2015. In combination with our Promontory IND money market deposits, our brokered deposits totaled $232.5 million, or 8.6% of deposits at June 30, 2016 compared to $244.6 million, or 9.9% of total deposits at June 30, 2015.\nGiven the decline in the balances of wholesale time deposits, the net increase in certificates of deposit was primarily attributable to an increase in retail time deposits.\nBorrowings. The balance of borrowings increased by $42.9 million to $614.4 million at June 30, 2016 from $571.5 million at June 30, 2015. The increase in borrowings primarily reflected an additional short-term advance of $50.0 million drawn during the year ended June 30, 2016 whose cost had been effectively fixed over a five-year period based on a previously executed interest rate swap transaction whose terms became effective during the period. At June 30, 2016, the wholesale funding associated with all of the Company's outstanding interest rate derivatives has been fully drawn with such swaps and caps expected to serve as effective cash flow hedges over their remaining terms to maturity.\nThe increase in borrowings also reflected a $541,000 increase in outstanding overnight sweep account\u201d balances linked to customer demand deposits.\nOther Liabilities. The balance of other liabilities, including advance payments by borrowers for taxes and other miscellaneous liabilities, increased by $10.5 million to $43.2 million at June 30, 2016 from $32.7 million at June 30, 2015. The increase primarily reflected changes in the fair value of the Company's derivatives coupled with normal operating fluctuations in the balances of other liabilities.\nStockholders' Equity. Stockholders' equity decreased by $19.7 million to $1.15 billion at June 30, 2016 from $1.17 billion at June 30, 2015. As noted above, the decrease in stockholders' equity largely reflected the impact of the Company's share repurchases during fiscal 2016. The Company initiated a new share repurchase program in May 2016 through which it intends to repurchase a total of 9,352,809 shares, or 10%, of its outstanding shares. Through June 30, 2016, the Company repurchased 1,706,182 shares, or 18.2% of the shares to be repurchased under the current program, at a total cost of $22.3 million and at an average cost of $13.06 per share. The net decrease in stockholders' equity also reflected a $9.0 million increase in accumulated other comprehensive loss due primarily to changes in the fair value of the Company's available for sale securities portfolio and outstanding derivatives. This decrease was partially offset by net income of $15.8 million, less $7.2 million in cash dividends paid to shareholders, coupled with a $1.9 million reduction of unearned ESOP shares for plan shares earned during the year ended June 30, 2016.\nComparison of Operating Results for the Years Ended June 30, 2016 and June 30, 2015\nGeneral. Net income for the year ended June 30, 2016 was $15.8 million or $0.18 per diluted share, an increase of $10.2 million compared to $5.6 million or $0.06 per diluted share for the year ended June 30, 2015. The increase in net income was partly attributable to the effect of the non-recurring $10.0 million charitable contribution that was made by the Company to the KearnyBank Foundation in conjunction with the closing of the Company's second-step conversion and stock offering in fiscal 2015. The increase\nin net income also reflected increases in net interest income and non-interest income that were partially offset by an increase in the provision for loan losses and an increase in non-interest expense, excluding the effects of charitable contribution noted earlier. In total, these factors resulted in an increase in pre-tax net income between comparative periods. The Company recorded income tax expense for the year ended June 30, 2016. However, the effects of the Company's tax-favored income sources, coupled with other reductions in income tax expense, resulted in the Company recording a net income tax benefit for the year ended June 30, 2015.\nNet Interest Income. Net interest income for the year ended June 30, 2016 was $95.0 million, an increase of $14.4 million from $80.6 million for the year ended June 30, 2015. The increase in net interest income between the comparative periods resulted from an increase in interest income that was partially offset by an increase in interest expense. As discussed in greater detail below, the increase in interest income was attributable to an increase in the average balance of interest-earning assets augmented by an increase in their average yield. The increase in interest expense resulted from an increase in the average balance of interest-bearing liabilities coupled with an increase their average cost. The average yields and average costs between comparative periods continued to reflect the effects of low interest rates that were prevalent in the marketplace throughout most of fiscal 2016.\nAs a result of these factors, our net interest rate spread decreased 14 basis points to 2.06% for the year ended June 30, 2016 from 2.20% for the year ended June 30, 2015. The decrease in the net interest rate spread reflected a 19 basis point increase in the average cost of interest-bearing liabilities to 1.07% from 0.88% while the yield on earning assets increased by five basis points to 3.13% from 3.08% between those same comparative periods. A discussion of the factors contributing to the overall change in yield on interest-earning assets and average cost of interest-bearing liabilities is presented in the separate discussion and analysis of interest income and interest expense below.\nThe factors resulting in the decrease in net interest rate spread also adversely affected our net interest margin. However, the effects of those factors were more than offset by the beneficial impact to net interest income arising from the increase in the average balance of interest-earning assets that was attributable to the investment of the net capital proceeds raised in conjunction with the closing of the Company's second step conversion and stock offering in May 2015. Consequently, the Company's net interest margin increased by one basis point to 2.35% for the year ended June 30, 2016 from 2.34% for the year ended June 30, 2015.\nInterest Income. Total interest income increased $20.8 million to $126.9 million for the year ended June 30, 2016 from $106.0 million for the year ended June 30, 2015. As noted above, the increase in interest income reflected increases in both the average balance and average yield of interest-earning assets. The average balance of interest-earning assets increased by $603.4 million to $4.05 billion for the year ended June 30, 2016 from $3.45 billion for the year ended June 30, 2015. For those same comparative periods, the average yield on interest-earning assets declined five basis points to 3.13% from 3.08%.\nInterest income from loans increased $21.3 million to $98.0 million for the year ended June 30, 2016 from $76.6 million for the year ended June 30, 2015. The increase in interest income on loans was attributable to a net increase in the average balance of loans that was partially offset by a decline in their average yield.\nThe average balance of loans increased by $662.5 million to $2.51 billion for the year ended June 30, 2016 from $1.85 billion for the year ended June 30, 2015. The reported increase in the average balance of loans primarily reflected an aggregate increase of $607.5 million in the average balance of commercial loans to $1.78 billion for the year ended June 30, 2016 from $1.18 billion for the year ended June 30, 2015. Our commercial loans generally comprise commercial mortgage loans, including multi-family and nonresidential mortgage loans, as well as secured and unsecured commercial business loans. The increase in the average balance of commercial loans include the effects of loan purchases funded with a portion of the proceeds raised in the Company's second-step conversion and stock offering that closed in May 2015.\nThe increase in the average balance of total loans also reflected a net increase in the average balance of residential mortgage loans which increased by $43.5 million to $706.3 million for the year ended June 30, 2016 from $662.9 million for the year ended June 30, 2015. Our residential mortgages generally comprise one- to four-family first mortgage loans, home equity loans and home equity lines of credit.\nFor those same comparative periods, the average balance of construction loans decreased $2.8 million to $4.2 million from $7.0 million while the average balance of consumer loans increased $10.8 million to $15.5 million from $4.7 million. The increase in the average balance of consumer loans for fiscal 2016 primarily reflected the effects of the loans acquired through the Company's relationship with Lending Club.\nThe effect on interest income attributable to the net increase in the average balance of loans was partially offset by the noted decrease in their average yield. The average yield on loans decreased by 24 basis points to 3.90% for the year ended June 30, 2016 from 4.14% for the year ended June 30, 2015. The reduction in the overall yield on our loan portfolio largely reflects the continuing effect of low market interest rates. Specifically, the average yield on the newly originated loans that have provided the incremental\ngrowth in the portfolio during fiscal 2016 reflects the generally low level of interest rates prevalent in the marketplace which reduces the overall yield of the loan portfolio.\nInterest income from mortgage-backed securities decreased by $1.3 million to $17.3 million for the year ended June 30, 2016 from $18.6 million for the year ended June 30, 2015. The decrease in interest income reflected a decrease in the average yield of mortgage-backed securities that was partially offset by an increase in their average balance.\nThe average yield on mortgage-backed securities decreased by 32 basis points to 2.33% for the year ended June 30, 2016 from 2.65% for the year ended June 30, 2015. The decrease in the overall yield of the mortgage-backed securities portfolio largely reflected the comparatively lower yields of securities purchased during fiscal 2016.\nFor those same comparative periods, the average balance of mortgage-backed securities increased by $37.6 million to $741.2 million from $703.6 million. The increase in the average balance of mortgage-backed securities largely reflects the effects of security purchases that outpaced principal repayments between comparative periods. The increase in the average balance of mortgage-backed securities include the effects of security purchases funded with a portion of the proceeds raised in the Company's second-step conversion and stock offering that closed in May 2015.\nInterest income from debt securities increased by $717,000 to $9.9 million for the year ended June 30, 2016 from $9.2 million for the year ended June 30, 2015. The increase in interest income reflected an increase in the average yield on debt securities that was partially offset by a decrease in their average balance. The average yield on debt securities increased 21 basis points to 1.65% for the year ended June 30, 2016 from 1.44 % for the year ended June 30, 2015. For those same comparative periods, the average balance of debt securities decreased $34.8 million to $602.4 million from $637.2 million.\nThe increase in the average yield on debt securities reflected a 22 basis point increase in the yield on taxable securities to 1.57% during the year ended June 30, 2016 from 1.35% during the year ended June 30, 2015. For those same comparative periods, the yield on tax-exempt securities increased four basis points to 1.99% from 1.95%.\nThe decrease in the average balance of debt securities was largely attributable to a $43.5 million decrease in the average balance of taxable securities to $492.4 million for the year ended June 30, 2016 from $535.9 million for the year ended June 30, 2015. For those same comparative periods, the average balance of tax-exempt securities increased by $8.7 million to $110.0 million from $101.3 million.\nInterest income from other interest-earning assets increased by $173,000 to $1.8 million for the year ended June 30, 2016 from $1.6 million for the year ended June 30, 2015 reflecting an increase in the average yield that was partially offset by a decline in the average balance. The average yield on other interest-earning assets increased by 29 basis points to 0.91% for the year ended June 30, 2016 from 0.62% for the year ended June 30, 2015. For those same comparative periods, the average balance of other interest-earning assets decreased by $61.7 million to $194.5 million from $256.2 million.\nThe changes in the average balance and average yield on other interest-earning assets between comparative periods largely reflects the effects of a temporary increase in low-yielding cash and cash equivalents held during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015. The increase in these short-term liquid assets during that quarter largely reflected the funds received and held during the subscription phase of our second-step conversion and stock offering as well as the excess liquidity held after the closing of the transaction pending their investment into other higher yielding assets during the first quarter of fiscal 2016.\nInterest Expense. Total interest expense increased by $6.5 million to $31.9 million for the year ended June 30, 2016 from $25.4 million for the year ended June 30, 2015. The increase in interest expense resulted from an increase in the average balance of interest-bearing liabilities as well as an increase in their average cost. The average balance of interest-bearing liabilities increased by $78.5 million to $2.97 billion for the year ended June 30, 2016 from $2.90 billion for the year ended June 30, 2015. For those same comparative periods, the average cost of interest-bearing liabilities increased 19 basis points to 1.07% from 0.88%.\nInterest expense attributed to deposits increased by $2.8 million to $18.7 million for the year ended June 30, 2016 from $15.9 million for the year ended June 30, 2015. The increase in interest expense was attributable to an increase in the average balance of interest-bearing deposits coupled with an increase in their average cost.\nThe average balance of interest-bearing deposits increased by $18.2 million to $2.36 billion for the year ended June 30, 2016 from $2.34 billion for the year ended June 30, 2015. For the comparative periods noted, the average balance of certificates of deposit increased by $91.4 million to $1.12 billion from $1.03 billion, while the average balance of savings and club accounts increased $566,000 to $516.4 million from $515.8 million. These increases were partially offset by a $73.8 million decrease in the average balance of interest-bearing checking accounts to $723.1 million from $797.0 million.\nThe cost of interest-bearing deposits increased by 11 basis points to 0.79% for the year ended June 30, 2016 from 0.68% for the year ended June 30, 2015. The net increase in the average cost was partly attributable to a 13 basis point increase in the average cost of certificates of deposit which increased to 1.22% for the year ended June 30, 2016 from 1.09% for the year ended June 30, 2015. For those same comparative periods, the average cost of interest-bearing checking accounts increased nine basis points to 0.59% from 0.50%, while the average cost of savings and club accounts remained stable at 0.16% between those same comparative periods.\nThe decrease in the average balance of interest-bearing checking accounts and the corresponding increase in their average cost largely reflected the effects of the low-cost funds held in such accounts during the subscription phase of our second step conversion and stock offering in fiscal 2015. Conversely, the increase in the average balance and average cost of certificates of deposits largely reflected the effects of attracting higher-cost, longer-term funding through our retail deposit channels for interest rate risk management purposes.\nInterest expense attributed to borrowings increased by $3.7 million to $13.2 million for the year ended June 30, 2016 from $9.5 million for the year ended June 30, 2015. The increase in interest expense on borrowings reflected increases in their average balance and average cost. The average balance of borrowings increased by $60.3 million to $617.5 million for the year ended June 30, 2016 from $557.2 million for the year ended June 30, 2015. For those same comparative periods, the average cost of borrowings increased 44 basis points to 2.14% from 1.70%.\nThe net increase in the average balance of borrowings largely reflected a $55.6 million increase in the average balance of FHLB advances which increased to $582.1 million for the year ended June 30, 2016 from $526.5 million for the year ended June 30, 2015. For those same comparative periods, the average cost of FHLB advances increased 47 basis points to 2.24% from 1.77%. As noted earlier, the increase in the average balance of FHLB advances primarily reflected an additional short-term advance of $50.0 million drawn during the year ended June 30, 2016 whose cost had been effectively fixed over a five-year period based on a previously executed interest rate swap transaction whose terms became effective during the period.\nThe net increase in the average balance of borrowings also reflected a $4.7 million increase in the average balance of other borrowings, comprised primarily of depositor sweep accounts, to $35.4 million from $30.7 million. The average cost of sweep accounts increased one basis point to 0.51% from 0.50% between comparative periods.\nProvision for Loan Losses. The provision for loan losses increased $4.6 million to $10.7 million for the year ended June 30, 2016 from $6.1 million for the year ended June 30, 2015. The net increase in the provision primarily reflected updates to historical and environmental loss factors utilized to measure impairment on collectively evaluated loans. The increase in provision expense also reflected the greater growth in such loans during fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015. The increase in provision expense attributable to these factors was partially offset by a net decrease in specific losses recognized on loans evaluated individually for impairment that largely reflected a higher level of recoveries recognized on such loans during fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015.\nAdditional information regarding the allowance for loan losses and the associated provisions recognized during the year ended June 30, 2016 is presented in the Business\u201d section of this report as well as in Note 1 and Note 9 to the audited consolidated financial statements.\nNon-Interest Income. Non-interest income, excluding gains and losses on the sale of securities and REO, increased by $2.2 million to $10.9 million for the year ended June 30, 2016 from $8.7 million for the year ended June 30, 2015. The increase was partly attributable an increase in the income arising from our investment in bank-owned life insurance due largely to the growth in the average balance of the cash surrender value of the various policies held by the Company. The Company had also recognized payouts on life insurance policies totaling $1.4 million during the prior year ended June 30, 2015 for which no such payouts were recognized during the year ended June 30, 2016. Absent the effect of these payouts, income from bank owned life insurance increased by approximately $3.0 million reflecting the noted increase in the average balance of the policies less the effects of a decrease in the earnings rate on such policies attributable to the sustained effects of lower long-term market interest rates.\nThe increase in non-interest income also reflected a net increase in fees and service charges that was primarily attributable to an increase in loan prepayment charges. The increase in loan prepayment charges were augmented, to a lesser degree, by a net increase in deposit-related fees and service charges, including ATM and debit card transaction fees separately reported under electronic banking fees and charges.\nThe increase in non-interest income reflected an increase in loan sale gains attributable to a $243,000 increase in SBA loan sale gains reflecting an overall increase in related loan origination and sale activity. The increase in loan sale gains also reflected $82,000 in gains on sale of residential mortgage loans arising from the initial implementation of the Company's mortgage banking business strategy during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016.\nThe noted increases in non-interest income were partially offset by a decrease in miscellaneous income that primarily reflected the recognition of a $370,000 non-recurring adjustment to gain on bargain purchase during the year ended June 30, 2015 relating to the Company's prior acquisition of Atlas Bank.\nThe noted net increase in non-interest income was augmented by a decrease in net losses relating to write downs and sales of real estate owned between comparative periods. The decrease in losses relating to the disposal of real estate owned were partially offset by a nominal decrease in gains arising from the sale and call of securities.\nNon-Interest Expenses. Non-interest expense decreased by $5.7 million to $72.4 million for the year ended June 30, 2016 from $78.1 million for the year ended June 30, 2015. However, non-interest expense for fiscal 2015 included a non-recurring $10.0 million charitable contribution that was made by the Company to the KearnyBank Foundation in conjunction with the closing of the Company's second-step conversion and stock offering. Excluding the effect of that charitable contribution, included in miscellaneous expense during the prior fiscal year, non-interest expense increased by $4.3 million during fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015.\nThe increase in non-interest expense, as adjusted, reflected increases in salaries and employee benefits, advertising and marketing, deposit insurance and director compensation expenses that were partially offset by a decrease in other miscellaneous expense coupled with less noteworthy decreases in premises occupancy expense and equipment and systems expense that generally reflected normal operating fluctuations within those categories.\nThe increase in salaries and employee benefits expense partly reflected the limited and controlled expansion of the human resources within our various business lines and, where needed, the supporting operating and risk management departments. The incremental increase in expense associated with these new resources was partially defrayed by our efforts to improve overall operating efficiency during fiscal 2016 that resulted in a net decrease in the number of full time equivalent ( FTE\u201d) employees for the year that was achieved", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nGeneral\nThis discussion and analysis reflects Kearny Financial Corp.'s consolidated financial statements and other relevant statistical data, and is intended to enhance your understanding of our financial condition and results of operations. You should read the information in this section in conjunction with the business and financial information regarding Kearny Financial Corp. and the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOverview\nFinancial Condition. Total assets increased $262.9 million to $4.50 billion at June 30, 2016 from $4.24 billion at June 30, 2015. The increase in total assets reflected an increase in net loans receivable that was partially offset by decreases in securities and cash and cash equivalents. The increase in total assets was largely funded by increases in deposits and borrowings that were partially offset by a decrease in stockholders' equity. The decrease in stockholders' equity primarily reflected the Company's share repurchases that outpaced the accretion from earnings during the year.\nFor the year ended June 30, 2016, loans receivable, excluding loans held for sale, increased by $571.1 million to $2.67 billion, or 64.6% of earning assets, at June 30, 2016 from $2.10 billion, or 54.1% of earning assets, at June 30, 2015. The growth in loans during fiscal 2016 continued to reflect our strategic emphasis in growing our commercial loan portfolio, including multi-family loans, nonresidential mortgage loans and commercial business loans. The increase in commercial mortgage and commercial business loans during fiscal 2016 totaled $540.6 million, or 38.4%, to $1.95 billion, or 73.0% of total loans at June 30, 2016, from to $1.41 billion, or 67.0% of total loans, at June 30, 2015. For those same comparative periods, one- to four-family mortgage loans, including first mortgages and home equity loans and lines of credit, increased by $10.8 million to $694.8 million, or 26.0% of total loans, from $684.0 million, or 32.5% of total loans.\nFor those same comparative periods, total securities decreased by $175.2 million to $1.26 billion, or 30.3% of earning assets, at June 30, 2016 from $1.43 billion, or 36.8% of earning assets, at June 30, 2015. We generally maintained the overall composition and allocation of our securities portfolio during fiscal 2016. Non-mortgage-backed securities, including U.S. agency debentures, corporate bonds, single-issuer trust preferred securities, collateralized loan obligations, municipal obligations, and asset-backed securities decreased by $83.4 million to $557.1 million, or 44.5% of securities, at June 30, 2016 from $640.5 million, or 44.8% of securities, at June 30, 2015. For those same comparative periods, the balance of mortgage-backed securities, comprised primarily of U.S. government and agency pass-through securities and collateralized mortgage obligations, decreased by $96.4 million to $693.7 million, or 55.5% of securities, from $790.1 million, or 55.2% of securities.\nFor the year ended June 30, 2016, our total deposits increased by $229.2 million to $2.69 billion from $2.47 billion at June 30, 2015. The net increase in deposits reflected a $23.4 million increase in the balance of non-maturity deposits, including a $20.2 million increase in the balance of non-interest-bearing accounts, coupled with a $205.8 million increase in certificates of deposit.\nThe balance of borrowings increased by $42.9 million to $614.4 million at June 30, 2016 from $571.5 million at June 30, 2015. The increase in borrowings was primarily attributable to a $42.4 million net increase in FHLB advances representing new advances drawn to fund a portion of the loan growth reported during fiscal 2016 that were partially offset by the balance of advances repaid during the year. Interest rate derivatives were used to effectively extend duration of the new borrowings drawn for interest rate risk management purposes. The increase in borrowings also reflected a $541,000 increase in the balance of overnight borrowings in the form of depositor sweep accounts.\nStockholders' equity decreased by $19.7 million to $1.15 billion at June 30, 2016 from $1.17 billion at June 30, 2015. The decrease in stockholders' equity largely reflected the impact of the Company's share repurchases during fiscal 2016. The Company initiated a new share repurchase program in May 2016 through which it intends to repurchase a total of 9,352,809 shares, or 10%, of its outstanding shares. Through June 30, 2016, the Company repurchased 1,706,182 shares, or 18.2% of the shares to be repurchased under the current program, at a total cost of $22.3 million and at an average cost of $13.06 per share. The net decrease in stockholders' equity also reflected a decrease in accumulated other comprehensive income arising from changes in the fair value of the Company's available for sale securities and derivatives portfolios.\nThe noted decreases in stockholders' equity were partially offset by net income of $15.8 million, of which $7.2 million were distributed as cash dividends to stockholders during fiscal 2016, as well as a $1.9 million decrease in unearned ESOP reflecting the effects of shares earned by plan participants during the year.\nAt June 30, 2016, the Company had 91,821,910 shares outstanding, comprising 93,528,092 shares originally issued less 1,706,182 shares repurchased and cancelled.\nResults of Operations. Our results of operations depend primarily on our net interest income. Net interest income is the difference between the interest income we earn on our interest-earning assets and the interest we pay on our interest-bearing liabilities. It is a function of the average balances of loans and investments versus deposits and borrowed funds outstanding in any one period and the yields earned on those loans and investments and the cost of those deposits and borrowed funds. Our results of operations are also affected by our provision for loan losses, non-interest income and non-interest expense.\nNet income for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016 was $15.8 million or $0.18 per diluted share; an increase of $10.2 million from $5.6 million, or $0.06 per diluted share, for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015. Net income for fiscal 2015 reflected a $10.0 million charitable contribution made by the Company to the KearnyBank Foundation in conjunction with the closing of the Company's second-step conversion and stock offering. The contribution included $5.0 million in cash and 500,000 shares of the Company's common stock valued at $10.00 per share for a total contribution of $10.0 million. After giving effect to the income tax benefit, the contribution reduced net income for the year ended June 30, 2015 by approximately $6.1 million or $0.07 per basic and diluted share.\nOur net interest income increased $14.4 million to $95.0 million for the year ended June 30, 2016 from $80.6 million for the year ended June 30, 2015. The increase in net interest income primarily reflected a $20.9 million increase in interest income to $126.9 million from $106.0 million. The increase in interest income primarily reflected an increase in the average balance of interest-earning assets coupled with an increase in their average yield. For the year ended June 30, 2016, the average balance of interest-earning assets increased by $603.4 million to $4.05 billion compared to $3.45 billion for the year ended June 30, 2015. For those same comparative periods, the average yield on interest-earning assets increased by five basis points to 3.13% from 3.08%.\nThe increase in interest income for the year ended June 30, 2016 was partially offset by a $6.5 million increase in interest expense. The increase in interest expense between the two periods reflected an increase in the average balance of interest-bearing liabilities coupled with an increase in their average cost. For the year ended June 30, 2016 the average balance of interest-bearing liabilities increased by $78.5 million to $2.97 billion compared to $2.90 billion for the year ended June 30, 2015. For those same comparative periods, the average cost of interest-bearing liabilities increased 19 basis points to 1.07% from 0.88%.\nThe net interest rate spread decreased 14 basis points to 2.06% for fiscal 2016 from 2.20% for fiscal 2015 while the net interest margin increased one basis point to 2.35% from 2.34% for those same comparative periods. The increase in the Company's net interest margin primarily reflected the beneficial impact to net interest income arising from the increase in the average balance of interest-earning assets that was attributable to the investment of the net capital proceeds raised in conjunction with the closing of the Company's second step conversion and stock offering in May 2016.\nThe provision for loan losses increased $4.6 million to $10.7 million for fiscal 2016 from $6.1 million for fiscal 2015. The net increase in the provision primarily reflected updates to historical and environmental loss factors utilized to measure impairment on collectively evaluated loans. The increase in provision expense also reflected the greater growth in such loans during fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015. The increase in provision expense attributable to these factors was partially offset by a net decrease in specific losses recognized on loans evaluated individually for impairment that largely reflected a higher level of recoveries recognized on such loans during fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015.\nNon-interest income increased $2.8 million to $10.7 million for fiscal 2016 from $7.9 million for fiscal 2015. The increase was partly attributable to an increase in the income arising from our investment in bank-owned life insurance due largely to the growth in the average balance of the cash surrender value of the various policies held by the Company. The increase in non-interest income also reflected an increase in fees and service charges that was primarily attributable to an increase in loan prepayment charges and increases in electronic banking fees and charges. Additionally, the increase in non-interest income reflected an increase in loan sale gains attributable to an increase in SBA loans originated and sold as well as reflecting gains on sale of residential mortgage loans arising from the initial implementation of the Company's mortgage banking business strategy during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. These increases in non-interest income were augmented by a decrease in net losses relating to write downs and sales of real estate owned between comparative periods. The noted increases in non-interest income were partially offset by a decrease in miscellaneous income that primarily reflected the recognition of a non-recurring adjustment to gain on bargain purchase during the year ended June 30, 2015 relating to the prior acquisition of Atlas Bank.\nNon-interest expense decreased by $5.7 million to $72.4 million for the year ended June 30, 2016 from $78.1 million for the year ended June 30, 2015. The decrease in non-interest expense primarily reflected the non-recurring $10.0 million charitable contribution that was made by the Company to the KearnyBank Foundation in conjunction with the closing of the Company's second-step conversion and stock offering that was included in miscellaneous expense in fiscal 2015. The decrease in miscellaneous expense also reflected a non-recurring recovery of pension plan expense during fiscal 2016 resulting from the Company's amendment of its Directors Consultation and Retirement Plan (the DCRP\u201d) during the year.\nThe noted decreases in non-interest expense were partially offset by increases in other categories including salaries and employee benefits, advertising and marketing, deposit insurance and director compensation expenses. The increase in compensation-related expense partly reflected the limited and controlled expansion of the Company's human resources within the Company's various business lines and, where needed, the supporting operating and risk management departments. The incremental increase in expense associated with these new resources was partially defrayed by the Company's efforts to improve overall operating efficiency during fiscal 2016 that resulted in a net decrease in the number of full time equivalent ( FTE\u201d) employees for the year.\nThe changes in non-interest expense also reflected an increase in advertising and marketing expenses coupled with an increase in director compensation expense attributable to the addition of two independent directors during fiscal 2016. The increase in non-interest expense also included an increase in deposit insurance expense largely reflected the overall growth in Company's total assets.\nThe combined effects of these factors resulted in an increase in pre-tax net income during fiscal 2016 compared with fiscal 2015. Given the comparative effects of the Company's recurring tax-favored income sources on taxable net income between periods, including income from municipal obligations and bank-owned life insurance, coupled with the recognition of other non-recurring tax-related adjustments arising, in part, from our second step conversion and prior acquisition of Atlas Bank, the Company recognized income tax expense for fiscal 2016 compared to an income tax benefit recognized for fiscal 2015.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nOur accounting policies are integral to understanding the results reported. We describe them in detail in Note 1 to our audited consolidated financial statements included as an exhibit to this document. In preparing the audited consolidated financial statements, management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the dates of the consolidated statements of financial condition and revenues and expenses for the periods then ended. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. Material estimates that are particularly susceptible to significant changes relate to the determination of the allowance for loan losses, the evaluation of securities impairment and the impairment testing of goodwill.\nAllowance for Loan Losses. The allowance for loan losses is a valuation account that reflects our estimation of the losses in our loan portfolio to the extent they are both probable and reasonable to estimate. The balance of the allowance is generally maintained through provisions for loan losses that are charged to income in the period that estimated losses on loans are identified by our loan review system. We charge losses on loans against the allowance as such losses are actually incurred. Recoveries on loans previously charged-off are added back to the allowance.\nAs described in greater detail in the notes to audited consolidated financial statements, our allowance for loan loss calculation methodology utilizes a two-tier\u201d loss measurement process that is performed quarterly. Through the first tier of the process, we identify the loans that must be reviewed individually for impairment. Such loans generally include our larger and/or more complex loans including commercial mortgage loans, as well as our one- to four-family mortgage loans, home equity loans and home equity lines of credit. A reviewed loan is deemed to be impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. Once a loan is determined to be impaired, management measures the amount of the estimated impairment associated with that loan which is generally defined as the amount by which the carrying value of a loan exceeds its fair value. We establish valuation allowances for loan impairments in the fiscal period during which they are identified. Impairments on individually evaluated loans generally are charged off against the applicable valuation allowance when they are determined to be confirmed, expected losses.\nThe second tier of the loss measurement process involves estimating the probable and estimable losses on loans not otherwise individually reviewed for impairment. Such loans generally comprise large groups of smaller-balance homogeneous loans as well as the remaining non-impaired loans of those types noted above that are otherwise eligible for individual impairment evaluation.\nValuation allowances established through the second tier of the loss measurement process utilize historical and environmental loss factors to collectively estimate the level of probable losses within defined segments of our loan portfolio. To calculate the historical loss factors, our allowance for loan loss methodology generally utilizes a 24-month moving average of annual net charge-off rates (charge-offs net of recoveries) by loan segment, where available, to calculate the actual, historical loss experience. The outstanding principal balance of each loan segment is multiplied by the applicable historical loss factor to estimate the level of probable losses based upon our historical loss experience.\nEnvironmental loss factors are based upon specific qualitative criteria representing key sources of risk within the loan portfolio. Such risk criteria includes the level of and trends in nonperforming loans; the effects of changes in credit policy; the experience, ability and depth of the lending function's management and staff; national and local economic trends and conditions; credit risk concentrations; changes in local and regional real estate values; changes in the nature, volume and terms of loans; changes in the quality of loan review systems and resources and the effects of regulatory, legal and other external factors. The outstanding principal\nbalance of each loan segment is multiplied by the applicable environmental loss factor to estimate the level of probable losses based upon the qualitative risk criteria.\nThe sum of the probable and estimable loan losses calculated in accordance with loss measurement processes, as described above, represents the total targeted balance for our allowance for loan losses at the end of a fiscal period. A more detailed discussion of our allowance for loan loss calculation methodology is presented in Note 1 to our audited consolidated financial statements.\nImpairment Testing of Goodwill. We record goodwill, representing the excess of amounts paid over the fair value of net assets of the institutions acquired in purchase transactions, at its fair value at the date of acquisition. Goodwill is tested and deemed impaired when the carrying value of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value. Goodwill was most recently tested as of June 30, 2016, at which time no impairment was indicated. As of that date, we reported goodwill of $108.6 million. The value of the goodwill can change in the future. We expect the value of the goodwill to decrease if there is a significant decrease in the franchise value of Kearny Bank. If an impairment is determined in the future, we will reflect the loss as an expense in the period in which the impairment is determined, leading to a reduction of our net income for that period by the amount of the impairment.\nOther-than-Temporary Impairment ( OTTI\u201d) of Securities. If the fair value of a security is less than its amortized cost, the security is deemed to be impaired. Management evaluates all securities with unrealized losses quarterly to determine if such impairments are temporary\u201d or other-than-temporary\u201d in accordance with applicable accounting guidance.\nWe account for temporary impairments based upon the classification of the related security as either available for sale, held to maturity or trading. Temporary impairments on available for sale\u201d securities are recognized, on a tax-effected basis, through accumulated other comprehensive income with offsetting entries adjusting the carrying value of the security and the balance of deferred taxes. Conversely, we do not adjust the carrying value of held to maturity\u201d securities for temporary impairments, although information concerning the amount and duration of impairments on held to maturity securities is generally disclosed in periodic financial statements. The carrying value of securities held in a trading portfolio is adjusted to their fair value through earnings on a daily basis. However, we maintained no securities in trading portfolios at or during the periods presented in these financial statements.\nWe account for OTTI based upon several considerations. First, OTTI on securities that we have decided to sell as of the close of a fiscal period, or will, more likely than not, be required to sell prior to the full recovery of their fair value to a level equal to or exceeding their amortized cost, are recognized in earnings. If neither of these conditions regarding the likelihood of the security's sale is applicable, then the OTTI is bifurcated into credit-related and noncredit-related components. A credit-related impairment generally represents the amount by which the present value of the cash flows that are expected to be collected on an other-than-temporarily impaired security fall below its amortized cost. The noncredit-related component represents the remaining portion of the impairment not otherwise designated as credit-related. We recognize credit-related, OTTI in earnings. However, noncredit-related, other-than-temporary impairments on debt securities are recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income.\nComparison of Financial Condition at June 30, 2016 and June 30, 2015\nGeneral. Total assets increased $262.9 million to $4.50 billion at June 30, 2016 from $4.24 billion at June 30, 2015. The net increase in total assets reflected an increase in net loans receivable that was partially offset by decreases in securities and cash and cash equivalents. The net increase in total assets was largely funded by increases in deposits and borrowings that were partially offset by a net decrease in stockholders' equity.\nCash and Cash Equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents, which consist primarily of interest-earning and non-interest-earning deposits in other banks, decreased by $140.9 million to $199.2 million at June 30, 2016 from $340.1 million at June 30, 2015. The decrease in cash and cash equivalents reflected the deployment of the remaining proceeds raised through the Company's second-step conversion and stock offering that were not yet fully invested at June 30, 2015. Such funds were primarily reinvested into the loan portfolio during the first quarter of fiscal 2016.\nNotwithstanding the overall decrease between periods, the balance of cash and cash equivalents at June 30, 2016 reflected a temporary accumulation of short-term, liquid assets arising from an increase in loan prepayments during the quarter ended June 30, 2016. The Company intends to reinvest a significant portion of that excess liquidity back into the loan portfolio during the first quarter of fiscal 2017.\nManagement actively monitors the level of short term, liquid assets in relation to the expected need for such liquidity to fund the Company's strategic initiatives while meeting its performance and risk management objectives. Where appropriate, the Company may alter its liquidity management strategies based upon those objectives. In that regard, the Company generally expects to reduce\nthe balance of cash and cash equivalents maintained, compared to those balances held at June 30, 2016, to further reduce the opportunity cost of maintaining excess liquidity.\nDebt Securities Available for Sale. Debt securities classified as available for sale decreased by $30.8 million to $389.9 million at June 30, 2016 from $420.7 million at June 30, 2015. The decrease partly reflected principal repayments, net of premium amortization and discount accretion, totaling $20.8 million during the year ended June 30, 2016. The decrease also reflected a $10.0 million increase in the net unrealized loss of the portfolio to a net unrealized loss of $12.2 million at June 30, 2016 from a net unrealized loss of $2.2 million at June 30, 2015. The increase in the net unrealized loss reflected changes in the fair value of various sectors within the portfolio arising from movements in market interest rates coupled with a widening of pricing spreads within certain sectors in the portfolio.\nThe increase in the net unrealized loss on debt securities available for sale was primarily reflected within the applicable credit sectors\u201d of the portfolio which include asset-backed securities, collateralized loan obligations, corporate bonds and non-pooled trust preferred securities. The net unrealized loss on this subset of securities increased by $11.7 million to a net unrealized loss of $13.3 million at June 30, 2016 from a net unrealized loss of $1.6 million at June 30, 2015. The increase largely reflected a general widening of pricing spreads in the marketplace resulting in an overall decrease in the market price of such securities coupled with the adverse effect of certain credit-rating downgrades on specific corporate securities within the portfolio. The increase in the net unrealized loss on the noted securities was partially offset by a $1.7 million change to an unrealized gain of $1.0 million on government and agency securities, including U.S. agency debentures and municipal obligations, from a net unrealized loss of $623,000 on such securities for the same comparative periods.\nBased on its evaluation, management has concluded that no other-than-temporary impairment is present within this segment of the investment portfolio as of June 30, 2016. However, volatility in the financial markets may result in additional decreases in the fair value of the Company's available for sale securities. Such volatility may impact the fair value of the securities within the credit sectors\u201d of the portfolio more adversely than the Company's government and agency securities. The adverse effects of such volatility on the current and prospective financial strength of specific corporate issuers, and the resulting impact on the fair value of the related securities held by the Company, will be carefully monitored by management.\nMortgage-backed Securities Available for Sale. Mortgage-backed securities available for sale decreased by $63.0 million to $283.6 million at June 30, 2016 from $346.6 million at June 30, 2015. The net decrease reflected cash repayment of principal, net of discount accretion and premium amortization, totaling $68.4 million that was partially offset by a $5.4 million increase in the net unrealized gain on the portfolio to a net unrealized gain of $7.5 million at June 30, 2016 from a net unrealized gain of $2.1 million at June 30, 2015.\nAt June 30, 2016, the available for sale mortgage-backed securities portfolio primarily included agency pass-through securities and agency collateralized mortgage obligations. As of that date, we also held one non-agency mortgage-backed security within the available for sale portfolio whose aggregate carrying value totaled $124,000. Based on its evaluation, management has concluded that no other-than-temporary impairment is present within this segment of the investment portfolio as of that date.\nAdditional information regarding securities available for sale at June 30, 2016 is presented in the Business\u201d section of this report as well as in Note 5 and Note 7 to the audited consolidated financial statements.\nDebt Securities Held to Maturity. Debt securities classified as held to maturity decreased by $52.7 million to $167.2 million at June 30, 2016 from $219.9 million at June 30, 2015. The net decrease in the portfolio largely reflected principal repayments, net of premium amortization and discount accretion, totaling $64.9 million during the year ended June 30, 2016. The net decrease was partially offset by the purchase of $12.2 million in securities during the same period.\nAt June 30, 2016, the held to maturity debt securities portfolio included U.S. agency debentures and municipal obligations, a small portion of which represent non-rated, short term, bond anticipation notes ( BANs\u201d) issued by New Jersey municipalities. Based on its evaluation, management has concluded that no other-than-temporary impairment is present within this segment of the investment portfolio as of that date.\nMortgage-backed Securities Held to Maturity. Mortgage-backed securities held to maturity decreased by $33.4 million to $410.1 million at June 30, 2016 from $443.5 million at June 30, 2015. The decrease in the portfolio reflected cash repayment of principal, net of discount accretion and premium amortization, totaling $51.0 million during the year ended June 30, 2016. These decreases were partially offset by purchases of securities totaling $17.6 million during the same period.\nAt June 30, 2016, the held to maturity mortgage-backed securities portfolio primarily included agency pass-through securities and agency collateralized mortgage obligations. As of that date, we also held four non-agency mortgage-backed securities in the held to maturity portfolio whose aggregate carrying value and fair value totaled $33,000 and $32,000, respectively. Based on its evaluation,\nmanagement has concluded that no other-than-temporary impairment is present within this segment of the investment portfolio as of that date.\nAdditional information regarding securities available for sale at June 30, 2016 is presented in the Business\u201d section of this report as well as in Note 6 and Note 7 to the audited consolidated financial statements.\nLoans Held-for-Sale. The Company expanded its residential lending infrastructure during fiscal 2016 to support strategies focused on increasing the origination volume of residential mortgage loans for sale into the secondary market. Toward that end, the Company hired a new Director of Residential Lending during the quarter ended December 31, 2015 who evaluated and modified the Company's residential lending function to support that objective. The anticipated increase in residential mortgage loan origination and sale activity is expected to increase the Company's level of non-interest income over time through the recognition of additional sources of recurring loan sale gains while serving to help manage the Company's exposure to interest rate risk. The noted enhancements to the Company's residential mortgage lending infrastructure and business strategies were completed during the fourth quarter ended June 30, 2016 and mortgage banking sales activity commenced. During the quarter ended June 30, 2016, we sold $5.9 million of residential mortgage loans resulting in net sale gains totaling $82,000 for the period. Loans held for sale at June 30, 2016 totaled $3.3 million and are reported separately from balance of net loans receivable as of that date.\nLoans Receivable. Loans receivable, net of unamortized premiums, deferred costs and the allowance for loan losses, increased by $562.5 million or 26.9% to $2.65 billion at June 30, 2016 from $2.09 billion at June 30, 2015. The increase in net loans receivable was primarily attributable to new loan origination and purchase volume outpacing loan repayments during the year ended June 30, 2016.\nResidential mortgage loans held in portfolio, including home equity loans and lines of credit, increased by $10.8 million to $694.8 million at June 30, 2016 from $684.0 million at June 30, 2015. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase in the balance of one-to-four family first mortgage loans of $12.9 million to $605.2 million at June 30, 2016 from $592.3 million at June 30, 2015. The net increase also reflected an $87,000 increase in the balance of home equity loans to $70.3 million at June 30, 2016. These increases were partially offset by a $2.2 million decrease in the balance of home equity lines of credit to $19.2 million at June 30, 2016 from $21.4 million at June 30, 2015.\nThe growth in the portfolio during fiscal 2016 reflected the Company's intent to modestly increase the outstanding balance of residential mortgage loans held in portfolio while allowing the segment to continue to decline as a percentage of total loans and earning assets. In total, the origination and purchase volume of portfolio residential mortgage loans for the year ended June 30, 2016 were $87.2 million and $36.3 million, respectively, while aggregate originations of home equity loans and home equity lines of credit totaled $22.7 million for that same period.\nCommercial loans, in aggregate, increased by $540.6 million to $1.95 billion at June 30, 2016 from $1.41 billion at June 30, 2015. The components of the aggregate increase included an increase in commercial mortgage loans totaling $551.9 million that was partially offset by an $11.2 million decrease in commercial business loans. The ending balances of commercial mortgage loans and commercial business loans at June 30, 2016 were $1.86 billion and $88.2 million, respectively.\nCommercial loan origination volume for the year ended June 30, 2016 totaled $510.1 million, comprising $489.3 million and $20.8 million of commercial mortgage and commercial business loan originations, respectively. Commercial loan originations were augmented with the purchase of commercial mortgage loans and participations totaling $274.9 million coupled with the purchase of commercial business loans totaling $19.8 million during the year ended June 30, 2016.\nThe outstanding balance of construction loans, net of loans-in-process, decreased by $3.7 million to $2.0 million at June 30, 2016 from $5.7 million at June 30, 2015. Construction loan disbursements for the year ended June 30, 2016 totaled $1.1 million.\nOther loans, primarily comprising account loans, deposit account overdraft lines of credit and other consumer loans, increased by $21.1 million to $25.4 million at June 30, 2016 from $4.3 million at June 30, 2015. The balance of consumer loans at June 30, 2016 includes loans acquired through the Company's relationship with Lending Club, an established peer-to-peer (i.e. marketplace) lender. Through this relationship, the Company has purchased high-quality, unsecured consumer loans originated through Lending Club's online platform. The Company generally limits its purchases of Lending Club loans to those issued to qualified borrowers falling within the three highest credit tiers defined within Lending Club's proprietary credit risk model.\nAt June 30, 2016, the outstanding balance of the Company's Lending Club loans totaled $21.8 million, representing the outstanding balance of 1,252 loans with a weighted average interest rate of 9.78% and weighted average FICO scores and debt-to-income ratios of 729 and 17.9%, respectively. A total of 14 Lending Club loans with aggregate outstanding balances totaling\n$260,000, or 1.20% of total Lending Club loans, were 120 days or less past due\u201d at June 30, 2016 while three loans totaling $51,000 were charged off during the year ended June 30, 2016.\nThe Company generally intends to limit the outstanding balance of its Lending Club loan portfolio to an initial threshold of approximately $25.0 million in aggregate outstanding balances. However, the Company temporarily suspended its purchases of Lending Club loans during the quarter ended June 30, 2016 based upon recently disclosed events that resulted in the resignation of the Lending Club's founder and CEO. Subject to a satisfactory resolution of these matters, the Company generally intends to maintain the balance of its portfolio within the noted threshold for a period of time while continuing to independently monitor and validate the performance of the portfolio in relation to the Company's expectations as well as those of Lending Club's proprietary credit risk model. Additional investment in Lending Club loans may be considered by the Company after a sufficient period of time to properly gauge performance of the initial portfolio and quality of loan servicing and reporting rendered by Lending Club.\nThe Company purchased a total of $25.5 million through Lending Club during the year ended June 30, 2016 while internal originations of other consumer loans totaled approximately $1.1 million for the same period.\nNonperforming Loans. Nonperforming loans decreased by $1.8 million to $21.1 million, or 0.79% of total loans at June 30, 2016, from $22.9 million or 1.09% of total loans at June 30, 2015. Nonperforming generally include loans reported as accruing loans over 90 days past due\u201d and loans reported as nonaccrual\u201d with such balances totaling $38,000 and $21.0 million, respectively, at June 30, 2016.\nAdditional information about the Company's nonperforming loans at June 30, 2016 is presented in the Business\u201d section of this report as well as in Note 9 to the audited consolidated financial statements.\nAllowance for Loan Losses. During the year ended June 30, 2016, the balance of the allowance for loan losses increased by $8.6 million to $24.2 million or 0.90% of total loans at June 30, 2016 from $15.6 million or 0.74% of total loans at June 30, 2015. The increase resulted from provisions of $10.7 million during the year ended June 30, 2016 that were partially offset by charge-offs, net of recoveries, totaling $2.1 million.\nAdditional information about the allowance for loan losses at June 30, 2016 is presented in the Business\u201d section of this report as well as in Note 1 and Note 9 to the audited consolidated financial statements.\nOther Assets. The aggregate balance of other assets, including premises and equipment, FHLB stock, interest receivable, goodwill, bank owned life insurance, deferred income taxes and other miscellaneous assets, increased by $17.8 million to $397.0 million at June 30, 2016 from $379.2 million at June 30, 2015.\nThe increase in other assets reflected a $8.1 million increase in deferred income tax assets arising primarily from changes in the fair value of the Company's available for sale securities and derivatives portfolios coupled with an increase in the allowance for loan losses. The increase also reflected a $3.1 million increase in FHLB stock resulting from an increase in short-term advances drawn during the year ended June 30, 2016 coupled with a $5.6 million increase in the cash surrender value of the Company's bank-owned life insurance policies.\nThe noted increases in other assets included a $116,000 decrease in the balance of real estate owned ( REO\u201d) to $826,000, representing the carrying value of three properties at June 30, 2016, from $942,000, representing the carrying value of two properties at June 30, 2015.\nThe remaining increases and decreases in other assets during the year ended June 30, 2016 generally comprised normal operating fluctuations in their respective balances.\nDeposits. Total deposits increased by $229.2 million to $2.69 billion at June 30, 2016 from $2.47 billion at June 30, 2015. The increase in deposit balances reflected a $209.0 million increase in interest-bearing deposits coupled with a $20.2 million increase in non-interest-bearing checking accounts. The net increase in interest-bearing deposits comprised increases in certificates of deposit and interest-bearing checking accounts totaling $205.7 million and $8.2 million, respectively, that were partially offset by a $4.9 million decrease in the balance of savings and club accounts for the year ended June 30, 2016.\nThe increase in the balance of certificates of deposit largely reflected the effects of attractive retail pricing offered on a limited number of promotional products during specific periods in fiscal 2016 to fund a portion of the growth in loans during the period while also providing opportunities to cross-sell core deposit products to newly acquired customers. The attractive pricing on certain certificate of deposit products resulted in a limited amount of disintermediation from interest-bearing checking accounts which contributed to the limited growth or declines in those balances. The concurrent increase in non-interest-bearing deposits partly\nreflected fluctuating balances within certain large commercial deposit accounts. Notwithstanding these day-to-day fluctuations, the average balance of non-interest-bearing deposits has increased by $7.5 million to $225.4 million for the year ended June 30, 2016 compared to $217.9 million for the year ended June 30, 2015.\nThe change in deposit balances for the period reflected changes in the balances of retail deposits as well as non-retail\u201d deposits acquired through various wholesale channels. The $8.2 million increase in the balance of interest-bearing checking accounts reflected a $10.2 million increase in the balance of retail accounts that was partially offset by a $2.0 million decrease in the balance of brokered money market deposits acquired through Promontory's IND program whose balances decreased to $224.1 million, or 8.3% of total deposits at June 30, 2016, from $226.2 million, or 9.2% of total deposits at June 30, 2015. The terms of the IND program generally establish a reciprocal commitment for Promontory to deliver and for us to accept such deposits for a period of no less than five years during which time total aggregate balances shall be maintained within a range of $200.0 million to $230.0 million. Such deposits are generally sourced by Promontory from large retail and institutional brokerage firms whose individual clients seek to have a portion of their investments held in interest-bearing accounts at FDIC-insured institutions. The decrease in IND program balances was more than offset by a $10.2 million increase in retail interest-bearing checking accounts.\nWe continued to utilize a deposit listing service through which we attract non-brokered\u201d wholesale time deposits targeting institutional investors with an original investment horizon of three-to-five years. We generally prohibit the withdrawal of our listing service deposits prior to maturity. The balance of the Bank's listing service time deposits remained stable at $89.9 million representing 3.3% and 3.6% of total deposits at June 30, 2016 and June 30, 2015, respectively.\nWe also maintain a small portfolio of longer-term, brokered certificates of deposit that were originally acquired during fiscal 2014 whose balances decreased by approximately $10.0 million to $8.4 million at June 30, 2016 from $18.4 million at June 30, 2015. In combination with our Promontory IND money market deposits, our brokered deposits totaled $232.5 million, or 8.6% of deposits at June 30, 2016 compared to $244.6 million, or 9.9% of total deposits at June 30, 2015.\nGiven the decline in the balances of wholesale time deposits, the net increase in certificates of deposit was primarily attributable to an increase in retail time deposits.\nBorrowings. The balance of borrowings increased by $42.9 million to $614.4 million at June 30, 2016 from $571.5 million at June 30, 2015. The increase in borrowings primarily reflected an additional short-term advance of $50.0 million drawn during the year ended June 30, 2016 whose cost had been effectively fixed over a five-year period based on a previously executed interest rate swap transaction whose terms became effective during the period. At June 30, 2016, the wholesale funding associated with all of the Company's outstanding interest rate derivatives has been fully drawn with such swaps and caps expected to serve as effective cash flow hedges over their remaining terms to maturity.\nThe increase in borrowings also reflected a $541,000 increase in outstanding overnight sweep account\u201d balances linked to customer demand deposits.\nOther Liabilities. The balance of other liabilities, including advance payments by borrowers for taxes and other miscellaneous liabilities, increased by $10.5 million to $43.2 million at June 30, 2016 from $32.7 million at June 30, 2015. The increase primarily reflected changes in the fair value of the Company's derivatives coupled with normal operating fluctuations in the balances of other liabilities.\nStockholders' Equity. Stockholders' equity decreased by $19.7 million to $1.15 billion at June 30, 2016 from $1.17 billion at June 30, 2015. As noted above, the decrease in stockholders' equity largely reflected the impact of the Company's share repurchases during fiscal 2016. The Company initiated a new share repurchase program in May 2016 through which it intends to repurchase a total of 9,352,809 shares, or 10%, of its outstanding shares. Through June 30, 2016, the Company repurchased 1,706,182 shares, or 18.2% of the shares to be repurchased under the current program, at a total cost of $22.3 million and at an average cost of $13.06 per share. The net decrease in stockholders' equity also reflected a $9.0 million increase in accumulated other comprehensive loss due primarily to changes in the fair value of the Company's available for sale securities portfolio and outstanding derivatives. This decrease was partially offset by net income of $15.8 million, less $7.2 million in cash dividends paid to shareholders, coupled with a $1.9 million reduction of unearned ESOP shares for plan shares earned during the year ended June 30, 2016.\nComparison of Operating Results for the Years Ended June 30, 2016 and June 30, 2015\nGeneral. Net income for the year ended June 30, 2016 was $15.8 million or $0.18 per diluted share, an increase of $10.2 million compared to $5.6 million or $0.06 per diluted share for the year ended June 30, 2015. The increase in net income was partly attributable to the effect of the non-recurring $10.0 million charitable contribution that was made by the Company to the KearnyBank Foundation in conjunction with the closing of the Company's second-step conversion and stock offering in fiscal 2015. The increase\nin net income also reflected increases in net interest income and non-interest income that were partially offset by an increase in the provision for loan losses and an increase in non-interest expense, excluding the effects of charitable contribution noted earlier. In total, these factors resulted in an increase in pre-tax net income between comparative periods. The Company recorded income tax expense for the year ended June 30, 2016. However, the effects of the Company's tax-favored income sources, coupled with other reductions in income tax expense, resulted in the Company recording a net income tax benefit for the year ended June 30, 2015.\nNet Interest Income. Net interest income for the year ended June 30, 2016 was $95.0 million, an increase of $14.4 million from $80.6 million for the year ended June 30, 2015. The increase in net interest income between the comparative periods resulted from an increase in interest income that was partially offset by an increase in interest expense. As discussed in greater detail below, the increase in interest income was attributable to an increase in the average balance of interest-earning assets augmented by an increase in their average yield. The increase in interest expense resulted from an increase in the average balance of interest-bearing liabilities coupled with an increase their average cost. The average yields and average costs between comparative periods continued to reflect the effects of low interest rates that were prevalent in the marketplace throughout most of fiscal 2016.\nAs a result of these factors, our net interest rate spread decreased 14 basis points to 2.06% for the year ended June 30, 2016 from 2.20% for the year ended June 30, 2015. The decrease in the net interest rate spread reflected a 19 basis point increase in the average cost of interest-bearing liabilities to 1.07% from 0.88% while the yield on earning assets increased by five basis points to 3.13% from 3.08% between those same comparative periods. A discussion of the factors contributing to the overall change in yield on interest-earning assets and average cost of interest-bearing liabilities is presented in the separate discussion and analysis of interest income and interest expense below.\nThe factors resulting in the decrease in net interest rate spread also adversely affected our net interest margin. However, the effects of those factors were more than offset by the beneficial impact to net interest income arising from the increase in the average balance of interest-earning assets that was attributable to the investment of the net capital proceeds raised in conjunction with the closing of the Company's second step conversion and stock offering in May 2015. Consequently, the Company's net interest margin increased by one basis point to 2.35% for the year ended June 30, 2016 from 2.34% for the year ended June 30, 2015.\nInterest Income. Total interest income increased $20.8 million to $126.9 million for the year ended June 30, 2016 from $106.0 million for the year ended June 30, 2015. As noted above, the increase in interest income reflected increases in both the average balance and average yield of interest-earning assets. The average balance of interest-earning assets increased by $603.4 million to $4.05 billion for the year ended June 30, 2016 from $3.45 billion for the year ended June 30, 2015. For those same comparative periods, the average yield on interest-earning assets declined five basis points to 3.13% from 3.08%.\nInterest income from loans increased $21.3 million to $98.0 million for the year ended June 30, 2016 from $76.6 million for the year ended June 30, 2015. The increase in interest income on loans was attributable to a net increase in the average balance of loans that was partially offset by a decline in their average yield.\nThe average balance of loans increased by $662.5 million to $2.51 billion for the year ended June 30, 2016 from $1.85 billion for the year ended June 30, 2015. The reported increase in the average balance of loans primarily reflected an aggregate increase of $607.5 million in the average balance of commercial loans to $1.78 billion for the year ended June 30, 2016 from $1.18 billion for the year ended June 30, 2015. Our commercial loans generally comprise commercial mortgage loans, including multi-family and nonresidential mortgage loans, as well as secured and unsecured commercial business loans. The increase in the average balance of commercial loans include the effects of loan purchases funded with a portion of the proceeds raised in the Company's second-step conversion and stock offering that closed in May 2015.\nThe increase in the average balance of total loans also reflected a net increase in the average balance of residential mortgage loans which increased by $43.5 million to $706.3 million for the year ended June 30, 2016 from $662.9 million for the year ended June 30, 2015. Our residential mortgages generally comprise one- to four-family first mortgage loans, home equity loans and home equity lines of credit.\nFor those same comparative periods, the average balance of construction loans decreased $2.8 million to $4.2 million from $7.0 million while the average balance of consumer loans increased $10.8 million to $15.5 million from $4.7 million. The increase in the average balance of consumer loans for fiscal 2016 primarily reflected the effects of the loans acquired through the Company's relationship with Lending Club.\nThe effect on interest income attributable to the net increase in the average balance of loans was partially offset by the noted decrease in their average yield. The average yield on loans decreased by 24 basis points to 3.90% for the year ended June 30, 2016 from 4.14% for the year ended June 30, 2015. The reduction in the overall yield on our loan portfolio largely reflects the continuing effect of low market interest rates. Specifically, the average yield on the newly originated loans that have provided the incremental\ngrowth in the portfolio during fiscal 2016 reflects the generally low level of interest rates prevalent in the marketplace which reduces the overall yield of the loan portfolio.\nInterest income from mortgage-backed securities decreased by $1.3 million to $17.3 million for the year ended June 30, 2016 from $18.6 million for the year ended June 30, 2015. The decrease in interest income reflected a decrease in the average yield of mortgage-backed securities that was partially offset by an increase in their average balance.\nThe average yield on mortgage-backed securities decreased by 32 basis points to 2.33% for the year ended June 30, 2016 from 2.65% for the year ended June 30, 2015. The decrease in the overall yield of the mortgage-backed securities portfolio largely reflected the comparatively lower yields of securities purchased during fiscal 2016.\nFor those same comparative periods, the average balance of mortgage-backed securities increased by $37.6 million to $741.2 million from $703.6 million. The increase in the average balance of mortgage-backed securities largely reflects the effects of security purchases that outpaced principal repayments between comparative periods. The increase in the average balance of mortgage-backed securities include the effects of security purchases funded with a portion of the proceeds raised in the Company's second-step conversion and stock offering that closed in May 2015.\nInterest income from debt securities increased by $717,000 to $9.9 million for the year ended June 30, 2016 from $9.2 million for the year ended June 30, 2015. The increase in interest income reflected an increase in the average yield on debt securities that was partially offset by a decrease in their average balance. The average yield on debt securities increased 21 basis points to 1.65% for the year ended June 30, 2016 from 1.44 % for the year ended June 30, 2015. For those same comparative periods, the average balance of debt securities decreased $34.8 million to $602.4 million from $637.2 million.\nThe increase in the average yield on debt securities reflected a 22 basis point increase in the yield on taxable securities to 1.57% during the year ended June 30, 2016 from 1.35% during the year ended June 30, 2015. For those same comparative periods, the yield on tax-exempt securities increased four basis points to 1.99% from 1.95%.\nThe decrease in the average balance of debt securities was largely attributable to a $43.5 million decrease in the average balance of taxable securities to $492.4 million for the year ended June 30, 2016 from $535.9 million for the year ended June 30, 2015. For those same comparative periods, the average balance of tax-exempt securities increased by $8.7 million to $110.0 million from $101.3 million.\nInterest income from other interest-earning assets increased by $173,000 to $1.8 million for the year ended June 30, 2016 from $1.6 million for the year ended June 30, 2015 reflecting an increase in the average yield that was partially offset by a decline in the average balance. The average yield on other interest-earning assets increased by 29 basis points to 0.91% for the year ended June 30, 2016 from 0.62% for the year ended June 30, 2015. For those same comparative periods, the average balance of other interest-earning assets decreased by $61.7 million to $194.5 million from $256.2 million.\nThe changes in the average balance and average yield on other interest-earning assets between comparative periods largely reflects the effects of a temporary increase in low-yielding cash and cash equivalents held during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015. The increase in these short-term liquid assets during that quarter largely reflected the funds received and held during the subscription phase of our second-step conversion and stock offering as well as the excess liquidity held after the closing of the transaction pending their investment into other higher yielding assets during the first quarter of fiscal 2016.\nInterest Expense. Total interest expense increased by $6.5 million to $31.9 million for the year ended June 30, 2016 from $25.4 million for the year ended June 30, 2015. The increase in interest expense resulted from an increase in the average balance of interest-bearing liabilities as well as an increase in their average cost. The average balance of interest-bearing liabilities increased by $78.5 million to $2.97 billion for the year ended June 30, 2016 from $2.90 billion for the year ended June 30, 2015. For those same comparative periods, the average cost of interest-bearing liabilities increased 19 basis points to 1.07% from 0.88%.\nInterest expense attributed to deposits increased by $2.8 million to $18.7 million for the year ended June 30, 2016 from $15.9 million for the year ended June 30, 2015. The increase in interest expense was attributable to an increase in the average balance of interest-bearing deposits coupled with an increase in their average cost.\nThe average balance of interest-bearing deposits increased by $18.2 million to $2.36 billion for the year ended June 30, 2016 from $2.34 billion for the year ended June 30, 2015. For the comparative periods noted, the average balance of certificates of deposit increased by $91.4 million to $1.12 billion from $1.03 billion, while the average balance of savings and club accounts increased $566,000 to $516.4 million from $515.8 million. These increases were partially offset by a $73.8 million decrease in the average balance of interest-bearing checking accounts to $723.1 million from $797.0 million.\nThe cost of interest-bearing deposits increased by 11 basis points to 0.79% for the year ended June 30, 2016 from 0.68% for the year ended June 30, 2015. The net increase in the average cost was partly attributable to a 13 basis point increase in the average cost of certificates of deposit which increased to 1.22% for the year ended June 30, 2016 from 1.09% for the year ended June 30, 2015. For those same comparative periods, the average cost of interest-bearing checking accounts increased nine basis points to 0.59% from 0.50%, while the average cost of savings and club accounts remained stable at 0.16% between those same comparative periods.\nThe decrease in the average balance of interest-bearing checking accounts and the corresponding increase in their average cost largely reflected the effects of the low-cost funds held in such accounts during the subscription phase of our second step conversion and stock offering in fiscal 2015. Conversely, the increase in the average balance and average cost of certificates of deposits largely reflected the effects of attracting higher-cost, longer-term funding through our retail deposit channels for interest rate risk management purposes.\nInterest expense attributed to borrowings increased by $3.7 million to $13.2 million for the year ended June 30, 2016 from $9.5 million for the year ended June 30, 2015. The increase in interest expense on borrowings reflected increases in their average balance and average cost. The average balance of borrowings increased by $60.3 million to $617.5 million for the year ended June 30, 2016 from $557.2 million for the year ended June 30, 2015. For those same comparative periods, the average cost of borrowings increased 44 basis points to 2.14% from 1.70%.\nThe net increase in the average balance of borrowings largely reflected a $55.6 million increase in the average balance of FHLB advances which increased to $582.1 million for the year ended June 30, 2016 from $526.5 million for the year ended June 30, 2015. For those same comparative periods, the average cost of FHLB advances increased 47 basis points to 2.24% from 1.77%. As noted earlier, the increase in the average balance of FHLB advances primarily reflected an additional short-term advance of $50.0 million drawn during the year ended June 30, 2016 whose cost had been effectively fixed over a five-year period based on a previously executed interest rate swap transaction whose terms became effective during the period.\nThe net increase in the average balance of borrowings also reflected a $4.7 million increase in the average balance of other borrowings, comprised primarily of depositor sweep accounts, to $35.4 million from $30.7 million. The average cost of sweep accounts increased one basis point to 0.51% from 0.50% between comparative periods.\nProvision for Loan Losses. The provision for loan losses increased $4.6 million to $10.7 million for the year ended June 30, 2016 from $6.1 million for the year ended June 30, 2015. The net increase in the provision primarily reflected updates to historical and environmental loss factors utilized to measure impairment on collectively evaluated loans. The increase in provision expense also reflected the greater growth in such loans during fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015. The increase in provision expense attributable to these factors was partially offset by a net decrease in specific losses recognized on loans evaluated individually for impairment that largely reflected a higher level of recoveries recognized on such loans during fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015.\nAdditional information regarding the allowance for loan losses and the associated provisions recognized during the year ended June 30, 2016 is presented in the Business\u201d section of this report as well as in Note 1 and Note 9 to the audited consolidated financial statements.\nNon-Interest Income. Non-interest income, excluding gains and losses on the sale of securities and REO, increased by $2.2 million to $10.9 million for the year ended June 30, 2016 from $8.7 million for the year ended June 30, 2015. The increase was partly attributable an increase in the income arising from our investment in bank-owned life insurance due largely to the growth in the average balance of the cash surrender value of the various policies held by the Company. The Company had also recognized payouts on life insurance policies totaling $1.4 million during the prior year ended June 30, 2015 for which no such payouts were recognized during the year ended June 30, 2016. Absent the effect of these payouts, income from bank owned life insurance increased by approximately $3.0 million reflecting the noted increase in the average balance of the policies less the effects of a decrease in the earnings rate on such policies attributable to the sustained effects of lower long-term market interest rates.\nThe increase in non-interest income also reflected a net increase in fees and service charges that was primarily attributable to an increase in loan prepayment charges. The increase in loan prepayment charges were augmented, to a lesser degree, by a net increase in deposit-related fees and service charges, including ATM and debit card transaction fees separately reported under electronic banking fees and charges.\nThe increase in non-interest income reflected an increase in loan sale gains attributable to a $243,000 increase in SBA loan sale gains reflecting an overall increase in related loan origination and sale activity. The increase in loan sale gains also reflected $82,000 in gains on sale of residential mortgage loans arising from the initial implementation of the Company's mortgage banking business strategy during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016.\nThe noted increases in non-interest income were partially offset by a decrease in miscellaneous income that primarily reflected the recognition of a $370,000 non-recurring adjustment to gain on bargain purchase during the year ended June 30, 2015 relating to the Company's prior acquisition of Atlas Bank.\nThe noted net increase in non-interest income was augmented by a decrease in net losses relating to write downs and sales of real estate owned between comparative periods. The decrease in losses relating to the disposal of real estate owned were partially offset by a nominal decrease in gains arising from the sale and call of securities.\nNon-Interest Expenses. Non-interest expense decreased by $5.7 million to $72.4 million for the year ended June 30, 2016 from $78.1 million for the year ended June 30, 2015. However, non-interest expense for fiscal 2015 included a non-recurring $10.0 million charitable contribution that was made by the Company to the KearnyBank Foundation in conjunction with the closing of the Company's second-step conversion and stock offering. Excluding the effect of that charitable contribution, included in miscellaneous expense during the prior fiscal year, non-interest expense increased by $4.3 million during fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015.\nThe increase in non-interest expense, as adjusted, reflected increases in salaries and employee benefits, advertising and marketing, deposit insurance and director compensation expenses that were partially offset by a decrease in other miscellaneous expense coupled with less noteworthy decreases in premises occupancy expense and equipment and systems expense that generally reflected normal operating fluctuations within those categories.\nThe increase in salaries and employee benefits expense partly reflected the limited and controlled expansion of the human resources within our various business lines and, where needed, the supporting operating and risk management departments. The incremental increase in expense associated with these new resources was partially defrayed by our efforts to improve overall operating efficiency during fiscal 2016 that resulted in a net decrease in the number of full time equivalent ( FTE\u201d) employees for the year that was achieved"}
