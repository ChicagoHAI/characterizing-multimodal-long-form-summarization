Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In addition to historical information, the following discussion also contains forward-looking statements that include risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including those factors set forth under Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOverview\nWe were formed on November 12, 2010 as a blank check company to serve as a vehicle to acquire through a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, plan of arrangement, recapitalization, reorganization or other similar business combination, one or more operating businesses. As previously disclosed, we completed the acquisitions of JetPay, LLC and ADC, on December 28, 2012, and ACI on November 7, 2014.\nWe are a provider of payment services - debit and credit card processing, payroll and HCM services, and prepaid card services to businesses and their employees throughout the United States. We provide these services through three wholly-owned subsidiaries: JetPay, LLC, currently doing business as JetPay Payment Services, which provides debit and credit processing and ACH payment services to businesses with a focus on those processing internet transactions and recurring billings; JetPay Strategic Partners, an independent sales organization specializing in relationships with banks, credit unions and other financial institutions; and JetPay Payroll Services, which provides HCM services, including, payroll, tax filing, time and attendance, HR services, and Affordable Care Act and related services to small and medium-sized employers. We also operate JetPay Card Services, which is focused on providing low-cost money management and payment services to unbanked and under-banked employees of our business customers.\nTable 100: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>27 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur overall business strategy is to provide payment processing services to small to large-sized businesses with a high percentage of our revenues consisting of recurring revenues with strong margins and with relatively low capital requirements. Our corporate strategy is to increase our revenues through a combination of organic growth and acquisitions. Our organic growth strategy is focused on developing and increasing our current marketing and sales staff at JetPay Payment Services, JetPay Strategic Partners and JetPay Payroll Services to penetrate new customer niches and geographic markets. Our organic growth strategy also includes cross marketing initiatives to sell credit and debit card processing services to JetPay Payroll Services' payroll customers and payroll processing services to JetPay Payment Services' credit and debit card processing customers. Additionally, we will be seeking additional debt and/or equity capital to acquire additional credit and debit card processors ISOs and/or payroll processors to integrate into our JetPay Payment Services and JetPay Payroll Services operations. Our acquisition strategy is focused on identifying small to medium-sized companies that either provide services similar to ours or services that expand our product and service offerings and/or our geographic reach. Both our JetPay Payment Services and our JetPay Payroll Services operations have significant under-utilized processing capacity, which can be leveraged to create additional processing revenues without significant cost increases. We also plan to introduce new products, including through JetPay Card Services, which provides low-cost financial tools to both un-banked and under-banked consumers. Our overall strategy also includes looking for cost synergies as we continue to integrate the JetPay Payment Services, JetPay Strategic Partners and JetPay Payroll Services operations in such areas as insurance costs, banking costs, employee benefit costs, and other selling, general and administrative cost as well as operating cost areas.\nJetPay Payment Processing Segment - JetPay Payment Services and JetPay Strategic Partners\nRevenues\nJetPay Payment Services' and JetPay Strategic Partners' revenues fall into two categories: transaction processing revenues and merchant discount revenues. As such, our two primary drivers are the number of transactions and merchant dollar volume. A third measure related to merchant dollar volume, for those merchants where we charge a percentage of the sale amount, is the average size of the transaction, as costs for processing the transaction tend to be fixed, so that the higher the average ticket, the more revenue we earn for a fixed cost. JetPay's discount revenues are generally a fixed percentage of the merchant's dollar volume, with interchange and other third-party fees passed through to the merchant without markup. Our billings to merchants primarily consist of these transaction fees and discount fees, as well as pass-through fees for other miscellaneous services, such as handling chargebacks. Interchange costs are set by the card networks, and are paid directly by the sponsoring bank to the credit card associations based upon a percentage of transaction amounts and/or a fixed price per transaction. JetPay Payment Services refers to the ratio of processing revenues to the dollar amount of card transactions processed as the margin.\u201d If margin increases, processing revenues will tend to increase accordingly. Further, both the number of merchants who process transactions, and the average dollar amount of transactions processed per merchant, will impact the total transaction volume and thus the total processing revenues. As such, growth in JetPay's merchant count and/or growth in the same store transaction volume will also drive JetPay's processing revenue growth.\nExpenses\nThe most significant components of operating expenses are credit card association fees and assessments; residual payments to ISOs / VARs / ISVs and financial institutions; and salaries and other employment costs. Salaries and other employment costs are largely fixed in nature, increasing slightly with the growth in numbers of customers, but tending to grow with inflation. Credit card fees and assessments and bank sponsorship costs are generally a percentage of card volume. Bank sponsorship costs are largely based upon transaction counts and volumes. Selling, general and administrative expenses include stable costs such as occupancy and office costs, outside services, and depreciation and amortization expense, which is recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the assets. Cost of processing revenues also includes chargeback losses, which vary over the long term based upon transaction volume processed by JetPay's merchants, but can vary from period to period depending upon specific events in that period. JetPay Payment Services has and will continue to experience higher than normal professional fees due to the Direct Air matter.\nTable 101: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>28 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nMerchant Attrition\nMerchant attrition is a normal part of the merchant processing industry in the ordinary course of business. JetPay Payment Services does not experience attrition in the same form as most of its competitors. Most of JetPay Payment Services' competitors have large portfolios of small businesses and these businesses change their payments provider quickly and for many reasons. JetPay Payment Services' portfolio is made up of small to large businesses and they are more cautious in making changes to payment providers, and therefore, its portfolio does not change as often. However, because of the volume that each of these merchants produce, when one leaves it may have a significant impact on operating results. In addition, JetPay Payment Services does service several ISOs and financial institutions, such that while our volatility in the change of number of merchants remains significant, we experience far less volatility in revenues. As a result, JetPay Payment Services monitors its customer losses for both numbers of merchants as well as merchant processing revenues. For the year ended December 31, 2015, in our traditional business, JetPay Payment Services' customer attrition was approximately 25.7%, or an approximate 2,536 merchant reduction from approximately 9,850 merchants existing at December 31, 2014. This reduction in merchants included one particular ISO customer whose attrition rate is high due to the nature of its business. This reduction was offset by the addition of approximately 2,481, or approximately 25.2%, new merchants, resulting in a net merchant decline rate of approximately 0.5%. With respect to processing revenues, the lost merchants in 2015 represented a loss of approximately $3.2 million of annualized revenues, or approximately 12.6% of JetPay Payment Services' 2014 revenues of approximately $25.4 million. The new merchants that JetPay Payment Services added in 2015 contributed to a net increase in processing revenues in 2015 of approximately $3.1 million or 12.3% of 2014 revenues.\nMarkets\nJetPay Payment Services and JetPay Strategic Partners have defined four distinct markets in which they operate -Card-Not-Present / Recurring Payments; VARs, ISVs, and ISO's; financial institutions and associations; and small businesses through cross-sell. For Small Businesses and financial institutions, JetPay Payment Services is the traditional provider of merchant services to businesses, and holds the contracts. With regards to the other two markets, JetPay Payment Services operates in two forms: 1) as a processor only where JetPay Payment Services recognizes revenue from the authorization, clearing, and settlement functions and does not participate in the discount revenue or risk of the merchant; and 2) in a shared relationship, where JetPay Payment Services either owns the merchant contract outright or shares in the discount revenue of the merchant with an agent or ISO, and may assume or share risk. This market has experienced strong growth since 2013 and JetPay Payment Services expects to significantly increase this revenue area as the operations group solidifies the product offering and execution. Our expansion in 2014 and 2015 was negatively affected by management's time being diverted to dealing with the Direct Air issue described in Part I, Item 3. Legal Proceedings, as well as efforts devoted to our acquisition and integration of JetPay Payment Services and JetPay Strategic Partners. Sales and marketing began targeting new customers and customer segments in 2014 and 2015 and we anticipate such efforts will lead to continued revenue growth in 2016 and future years.\nJetPay HR and Payroll Segment - JetPay Payroll Services\nRevenues\nThe majority of revenues from JetPay Payroll Services is derived from its payroll processing operations, which includes the calculation, preparation, collection and delivery of employer payroll obligations and the production of internal accounting records and management reports, and from services provided for the preparation of federal, state, and local payroll tax returns, including the collection and remittance of clients' payroll tax obligations. JetPay Payroll Services experiences increased revenues in the fourth and first calendar quarters due to additional employer annual tax filing requirements. Payroll Tax Filing Services ( PTFS\u201d) trust account earnings represent the interest earned on the funds held for clients trust balance. Trust fund earnings can fluctuate based on the amount held in the trust account as well as fluctuations in interest rates. Over the past two years, JetPay Payroll Services has seen a significant increase in revenue from its human capital management, Affordable Care Act and time and attendance services.\nExpenses\nJetPay Payroll Services' most significant cost of processing revenues is its payroll and related expenses, costs of third party service providers, and facility overhead costs. These costs are largely fixed in nature, increasing slightly with the growth in numbers of customers and payrolls processed, but tending to grow with inflation. JetPay Payroll Services' selling, general, and administrative expenses include the costs of the administrative and sales staff, payroll delivery costs, outside services, rent, office expense, insurance, sales and marketing costs and professional services costs.\nTable 102: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>29 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nCustomer Attrition\nCustomer attrition is a normal part of the payroll processing industry in the ordinary course of business. JetPay Payroll Services' attrition generally comes in three forms - closure of a business, acquisition of a business wherein the payroll is transferred to the buyer, and competition. As a result, JetPay Payroll Services monitors its customer losses for both numbers of customers as well as customer revenues. For the year ended December 31, 2015, JetPay HR and Payroll Segment customer attrition was approximately 8.7%, or an approximate 439 customer reduction from approximately 5,075 customers existing at December 31, 2014. This reduction was offset by the addition of approximately 479 new customers, or approximately 9.4% over the 5,075 customers existing at December 31, 2014, resulting in a net customer growth rate of approximately 0.7%. With respect to payroll processing revenues, the lost customers in 2015 represented a loss of approximately $1.1 million of annualized revenues, or approximately 7.7% of JetPay Payroll Services' 2014 processing revenues of approximately $13.6 million. The new customers that JetPay added in 2015 contributed to a net increase in processing revenues in 2015 of approximately $1.0 million or 7.1% of 2014 revenues..\nResults of Operations for the Year

Overall revenues increased $9.9 million, or 29.5%, in 2015 as compared to 2014. Of the $43.3 million of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2015, $14.7 million, or 33.9%, was generated from our JetPay HR and Payroll Segment and $28.6 million, or 66.1%, from our JetPay Payment Processing Segment. Of the $33.4 million of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2014, $13.7 million, or 41.1%, was generated from our JetPay HR and Payroll Segment and $19.7 million, or 58.9%, from our JetPay Payment Processing Segment.\nJetPay Payment Processing Segment's revenues increased $8.9 million, or 45.1%, for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to 2014. This increase included incremental revenues of $6.3 million related to JetPay Strategic Partners, which we acquired on November 7, 2014. Excluding the increase in JetPay Strategic Partners' revenues, our Texas-based JetPay Payment Services operation's revenues increased $2.6 million, or 13.0%, in 2015 as compared to 2014. The most significant changes within our Texas based JetPay Payment Services' operations were an increase of $1.7 million, or 20.8%, in our Third Party business and an increase of $982,000, or 11.6%, in direct merchant services revenues, with these increases resulting from our investment in professional sales staff and marketing initiatives. These gains were partially offset by a decrease of $223,000, or 10.2%, in our processing and clearing business.\nJetPay HR and Payroll Segment's revenues increased $952,000, or 6.9%, for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to 2014. This increase was attributable to net growth in volume of payroll and related payroll taxes processed in addition to revenues generated from several new HR related services, including Affordable Care Act, time and labor management, and other HR services, introduced in late 2014. Growth in our new HR related services was approximately $594,000, or 62.4% of our JetPay HR and Payroll Segment's revenue growth in 2015.\nCost of Processing Revenues\nCost of revenues were $26.2 million, or 60.5% of revenues, and $20.0 million, or 59.8% of revenues, for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Of the $26.2 million of cost of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2015, $7.3 million, or 27.9%, related to our HR and Payroll Segment and $18.8 million, or 72.1%, related to our Payment Processing Segment. Of the $20.0 million of cost of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2014, $7.2 million, or 36.0%, related to our HR and Payroll Segment and $12.7 million, or 64.0%, related to our Payment Processing Segment.\nTable 106: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>31 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe cost of processing revenues within our Payment Processing Segment increased from $12.7 million, or 64.6% of revenues in 2014 to $18.8 million, or 65.7% of revenues in 2015, an increase of $6.1 million, or 47.6%. The increase in cost of processing revenues related to the growth in our Payment Processing Segment revenues, including an increase of $3.4 million of cost of processing revenues related to the JetPay Strategic Services acquisition on November 7, 2014. Overall gross profit margin as reported within our Payment Processing Segment decreased slightly from 35.4% in 2014 to 34.3% in 2015 largely as a result of an increase in Third Party commissions to ISOs, VARs, and ISVs of $856,000 related to the previously noted increase in Third Party revenues combined with the investments made in technology professionals since December 31, 2014.\nThe cost of processing revenues within our HR and Payroll Segment increased $120,000, a slight decrease as a percentage of revenues from 52.4% in 2014 to 49.8% in 2015 despite an increase in technology and customer service professionals as well as an investment in new product management. The effect of this decrease in cost of processing revenues as a percentage of revenues was an increase in gross profit margin within our HR and Payroll Segment from 47.6% in 2014 to 50.2% in 2015 as we leveraged the increase in revenues over the relatively fixed costs of our operating platforms.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nSelling, general and administrative ( SG&A\u201d) expenses were $13.3 million, or 30.7% of revenues, for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to $12.1 million, or 36.3% of revenues, for the same period in 2014.\nSG&A expenses within our Payment Processing Segment increased from $5.2 million or 26.6% of revenues in 2014, to $6.9 million, or 24.0% of revenues in 2015. This increase was largely the result of an increase in sales staff, an increase in marketing, tradeshows and advertising costs of $98,000, an increase in SG&A expenses related to JetPay Strategic Partners of $741,000 acquired in November 2014, and an increase in legal fees and related settlement costs of approximately $563,000 as the Company continued to work to resolve the legal matters described below in Part I, Item 3. Legal Proceedings. Additionally, the results for the year ended December 31, 2014 included a $460,000 charge related to a legal settlement and a $237,000 loss on the disposal of a fixed asset.\nSG&A expenses within our HR and Payroll Segment increased from $4.1 million in 2014 to $4.8 million in 2015, an increase of approximately $628,000, or 15.1%, largely due to an increase in payroll costs as additional sales and technology professionals were added to help develop and market new products and services, including the expansion of the HR services we provide to our customers.\nAdditionally, we incurred corporate SG&A expenses of $1.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, including the benefit of $1.43 million of management fees received from the Company's operating subsidiaries as compared to corporate SG&A expenses of $2.8 million in 2014, including $900,000 of management fees received from the operating subsidiaries. Corporate SG&A expenses include, but are not limited to, the salaries of our executive officers, outside professional fees, investor relations and other public company costs, and general corporate operating expenses. Corporate SG&A expenses for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 also included $236,000 and $503,000, respectively, of start-up expenses relating to our Card Services operations. SG&A expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015 included non-cash stock-based compensation expense of $278,000 as compared to $356,000 in 2014. The SG&A expenses of our HR and Payroll Segment include $350,000 of corporate-allocated costs for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, and the SG&A expenses of our Payment Processing Segment include $1.08 million and $550,000 of corporate-allocated costs in 2015 and 2014, respectively, with an offsetting reduction in Corporate SG&A expenses of $1.43 million and $900,000 for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nDepreciation and amortization totaled $3.6 million and $2.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The increase in depreciation and amortization expense in 2015 as compared to 2014 was primarily related to the amortization of the ACI intangible assets acquired on November 7, 2014.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 was $819,000 and $1.7 million, respectively. The reduction in interest expense in 2015 was primarily related to the pay-off of the $10.0 million convertible secured notes in December 2014, partially offset by interest expense relating to the Metro Bank term loan entered into on November 7, 2014 in connection with the ACI acquisition and the $1.0 million revolving note payable entered into with Metro Bank on May 6, 2015.\nTable 107: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>32 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company recorded income tax expense of $197,000 and $222,000 for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Income tax expense reflects the recording of state income taxes. The effective tax rates were approximately (19.7)% and (3.3)% for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The effective rate differs from the federal statutory rate for each year, primarily due to state and local income taxes and changes to the valuation allowance.\nAnalysis of Impairment\nThe Company conducts its annual goodwill impairment testing as of December 31 of each year or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist. We performed extensive valuation analyses, utilizing both income and market approaches, in our goodwill assessment process for our two identified reporting units that contained goodwill, JetPay Payment Processing and JetPay HR and Payroll reporting segments.\nIn our income approach, we utilized a discounted cash flow analysis for each of our previously identified reporting units using discount rates of 18.0% and 16.5% for our JetPay Payment Processing and JetPay HR and Payroll reporting segments, respectively, which represent the estimated weighted average cost of capital. These discount rates reflect the overall level of inherent risk involved in our reporting units and the rate of return an outside investor would expect to earn. In our discounted cash flow ( DCF\u201d) analysis, we prepared a five year forecast of our expected earnings to derive an expected stream of free cash flow through December 31, 2020. To estimate cash flows beyond the final year of our forecast, we used a terminal value approach. Under this approach, we estimated operating income before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization in the final year of our model, adjusted to estimate a normalized cash flow, applied a perpetuity growth assumption and discounted by a perpetuity discount factor to determine the terminal value. We incorporated the present value of the resulting terminal value into our estimate of fair value. In developing our forecasts of revenues and direct variable operating expenses, we utilized a variety of factors including our current and anticipated sales pipelines of prospects currently known to us, as well as those which we believe will be generated through current and future relationships with merchants, agent banks and ISOs. We also applied our knowledge of the industries, general economic conditions, and the forecast of industry experts regarding consumers' continued trending towards expanded use of electronic payment methods. Our operating expenses are either variable with revenues, or fixed and predictable; however, we increased our future costs based on expected inflation and the need to expand personnel costs as we achieve projected future revenue levels. In performing our DCF analysis, we multiplied our estimated cash flows by a marginal federal and state tax rate of 40% to derive our after-tax cash flows, and we utilized weighted average costs of capital of 18.0% and 16.5% for our JetPay Payment Processing reporting segment and JetPay HR and Payroll reporting segment analysis, respectively. In addition to the income approach, we also used several market-based approaches to corroborate the results of the income approach described above; including comparing our company's various earnings and performance indicators to those of similar publically traded companies, comparisons to prior purchase and sales transactions of similar reporting units by companies, and a comparison to recent mergers and acquisitions of guideline companies.\nWith respect to our assessment of goodwill impairment for our JetPay Payment Processing reporting segment, as of December 31, 2015, we determined that there was no impairment in that the fair value for this reporting unit was $61.0 million which exceeded the carrying value of net assets by $14.1 million, or 30.0%. With respect to our assessment of goodwill impairment for our JetPay HR and Payroll reporting segment, as of December 31, 2015, we determined that there was no impairment in that the fair value for this reporting unit was $33.6 million which exceeded the carrying value of net assets by $8.2 million, or 32.3%. Events or circumstances that could have a negative effect on estimated fair value of our reporting units in the future include, but are not limited to, a loss of customers due to competition, pressure from our customers to reduce pricing, inability to continue to employ a competent workforce at current rates of pay, changes in government regulations, and accelerating costs beyond management's control.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nCash and cash equivalents were $5.6 million at December 31, 2015, excluding $226,000 of cash deposited into restricted cash accounts. Cash and cash equivalents also excludes $4.4 million of cash reserves, or the Merrick Cash Reserve\u201d, held by Merrick, JetPay Payment Services' former sponsor bank, which is specifically related to the Direct Air matter. The Merrick Cash Reserve of $4.4 million at both December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, is recorded as non-current assets under the caption Other Assets\u201d. While we continue to defend the potential obligation related to the chargeback claims there can be no assurance as to the timing of the release of this cash reserve. See also Part I, Item 3. Legal Proceedings. The ratio of our total debt to total capitalization, which consists of total debt, convertible preferred stock, and stockholders' equity, was 23% at both December 31, 2015 and 2014. As of December 31, 2015, we had a working capital deficit, excluding funds held for clients and client funds obligations, of approximately $3.2 million.\nTable 108: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>33 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe expect to fund our cash needs, including capital required for acquisitions, with cash flow from our operating activities, equity investments and borrowings. Additionally, we will require approximately $4.2 million to cover our interest and principal payments on our existing debt for the twelve months ending December 31, 2016, and $1.2 million of deferred consideration due to the unitholders of ACI on April 10, 2016. As previously disclosed, on October 11, 2013, we were successful in selling an initial 33,333 shares of Series A Preferred to Flexpoint for an aggregate of $10 million, less certain costs, an additional 4,667 shares of Series A Preferred on April 14, 2014 for $1.4 million, 20,000 shares on November 7, 2014 for $6.0 million, and 33,333 shares on December 28, 2014 for $10.0 million. We have an agreement to potentially sell up to an additional $12.6 million of Series A Preferred to Flexpoint. Additionally, the Company sold 6,165 shares of Series A-1 Preferred to Wellington for an aggregate of $1.85 million, and it has an agreement to potentially sell an additional $850,000 of Series A-1 Preferred to Wellington. This additional $13.45 million of convertible preferred stock, if sold, will be used principally as consideration for future acquisitions. Additionally, from December 22, 2015 to January 22, 2016, the Company sold to certain accredited investors, including Bipin C. Shah, Robert B. Palmer, and Jonathan M. Lubert, an aggregate of 517,037 shares of the Company's common stock at a purchase price of $2.70 per share for aggregate consideration of $1,396,000, prior to issuance costs. If the Company is unable to raise additional capital through additional equity investments or borrowing, it may need to limit its level of capital expenditures and future growth plans.\nCapital expenditures were $1.3 million and $614,000 for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. We currently estimate capital expenditures for all of our ongoing operations, including JetPay Payment Services and JetPay Payroll Services, at approximately $2 million to $2.8 million for 2016, principally related to technology improvements. Our capital requirements include working capital for daily operations, including expenditures to maintain our technology platforms. Our operations currently generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our current operating needs and our routine debt service requirements.\nIn the past, we have been successful in obtaining financing by obtaining loans and equity investments, including the Series A Preferred investment by Flexpoint and the Series A-1 Preferred investment by Wellington. To fund and integrate future acquisitions or expand our technology platforms for new business initiatives, we will need to raise additional capital through loans, sale of Series A Preferred or Series A-1 Preferred, or additional equity investments. In addition, we continue to investigate the capital markets for sources of funding, which could take the form of additional debt or equity financing. We cannot provide any assurance that we will be successful in securing new financing or that we will secure such future financing with commercially acceptable terms. If we are unable to raise additional capital, we may need to limit our acquisition growth plans or delay certain technology improvements.\nDebt Capitalization and Other Financing Arrangements\nAt December 31, 2015, we had borrowings of approximately $16.7 million net of an unamortized valuation discount totaling $385,000 relating to the WLES Note, as defined below. We had a letter of credit outstanding at December 31, 2015 of $100,000 as collateral with respect to a front-end processing relationship with a credit card company. Additionally, on August 21, 2013 a letter of credit for $1.9 million was issued and remained outstanding at December 31, 2015 as a reserve with respect to JetPay, LLC's processing relationship with Wells Fargo Bank, N.A.\nIn order to finance a portion of the proceeds payable in the Completed Transactions, on December 28, 2012, we entered into a Note Agreement with Special Opportunities Fund, Inc., R8 Capital Partners, LLC, Bulldog Investors General Partnership, Ira Lubert, Mendota Insurance Company and American Services Insurance Company, Inc. (collectively, the Note Investors\u201d), pursuant to which we issued $10,000,000 in promissory notes secured by 50% of our ownership interest in JetPay, LLC (the Notes\u201d). In connection with the Note Agreement, we entered into separate Notes with each of the Note Investors. Amounts outstanding under the Notes accrued interest at a rate of 12% per annum. The Notes matured on December 31, 2014 and were paid with proceeds from the sale of Series A Preferred to Flexpoint on December 28, 2014.\nOn December 28, 2012, ADC and PTFS, as borrowers, entered into the Loan and Security Agreement with Metro Bank ( Metro\u201d), as the lender for a term loan with a principal amount of $9,000,000. Amounts outstanding under the loan accrue interest at a rate of 4% per annum. The loan matures on December 28, 2019 and amortizes over the course of the loan in equal monthly installments of $107,143. The principal balance of this term loan was $5.14 million at December 31, 2015. Additional principal payments may be required at the end of each fiscal year based on a free cash flow calculation at ADC as defined in the Loan and Security Agreement. The loans are guaranteed by us and are secured by all assets of ADC and PTFS, as well as a pledge by us of our ownership interest in ADC. The Loan and Security Agreement contains affirmative and negative covenants, including limitations on the incurrence of indebtedness, liens, transactions with affiliates and other customary restrictions for loans of this type and size. The borrowers are also subject to certain annual financial covenants including a debt coverage ratio and a leverage ratio during the term of the loan. We are required to provide Metro with annual financial statements within 120 days of our fiscal year end and quarterly financial statements within 60 days after the end of each fiscal quarter. We were in compliance with the covenant requirements as of December 31, 2015.\nTable 109: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>34 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn connection with the closing of the Completed Transactions, we entered into a Note and Indemnity Side Agreement with JP Merger Sub, LLC, WLES and Trent Voigt, dated as of December 28, 2012. Pursuant to the Note and Indemnity Side Agreement, we agreed to issue a promissory note in the amount of $2,331,369 in favor of WLES (the WLES Note\u201d). Interest accrues on amounts due under the WLES Note at a rate of 5% per annum. The WLES Note is due in full on December 31, 2017. The WLES Note can be prepaid in full or in part at any time without penalty. As partial consideration for offering the WLES Note, we and JP Merger Sub, LLC agreed to waive certain specified indemnity claims against WLES and Mr. Voigt to the extent the losses under such claims do not exceed $2,331,369.\nOn November 7, 2014, pursuant to a Unit Purchase Agreement by and between the Company, ACI and Michael Collester and Cathy Smith, the Company acquired all of the outstanding equity interests of JetPay Strategic Partners for an aggregate of $11.0 million in cash and the issuance of 2.0 million shares of its common stock to the unitholders of JetPay Strategic Partners with a value of approximately $3.7 million on the date of acquisition. The JetPay Strategic Partners' unitholders were entitled to receive additional cash consideration of $1.2 million which was paid on April 10, 2015 and are entitled to receive a further cash payment of $1.2 million payable on April 10, 2016, and are entitled to earn up to an additional $500,000 based on the net revenues of JetPay Strategic Partners for the twelve month periods ending October 31, 2015 and 2016. In order to finance a portion of the proceeds paid to the JetPay Strategic Partners' unitholders, JetPay Strategic Partners, as borrower, and the Company and ADC, as guarantors, entered into a Loan and Security Agreement on November 7, 2014 with Metro with a principal amount of $7.5 million. Amounts outstanding under the loan accrue interest at a rate of 5.25% per annum. The loan matures on November 6, 2021 and amortizes in equal monthly installments of $104,167 beginning in November 2015. The principal balance of this term loan was $7.29 million at December 31, 2015. Additional principal payments may be required at the end of each fiscal year based on a free cash flow calculation set forth in the Loan and Security Agreement. Additionally, in order to finance a portion of the proceeds paid to the JetPay Strategic Partners' unitholders, on November 7, 2014, the Company issued 20,000 shares of Series A Preferred to Flexpoint for an aggregate of $6.0 million.\nOn May 6, 2015, ADC and PTFS, as borrowers, along with JetPay Corporation, ACI, and JetPay, LLC, collectively as loan parties, entered into a First Amendment and Joinder Agreement to the Loan and Security Agreement dated December 28, 2012 and a Revolving Credit Note (the Revolving Note\u201d) dated May 6, 2015 with Metro, as the lender. The Note provides a $1.0 million revolving credit facility that matures on May 6, 2017 and that accrues interest at the rate of the Wall Street Journal Prime rate plus 1.00%, with a floor of 4.25%. The Note is guaranteed by the borrowers and loan parties and is secured by all assets of ADC, PTFS, and ACI, a pledge by the Company of its ownership interest in ADC and ACI, as well as a $1.0 million negative pledge on the stock of JetPay, LLC. The amended Loan and Security Agreement retains the affirmative and negative covenants included in the original December 28, 2012 loan agreement, including limitations on the incurrence of indebtedness, liens, transactions with affiliates and other customary restrictions for loans of this type and size. Certain of these affirmative and negative covenants encompass JetPay, LLC under a negative pledge obligation should the stock of JetPay, LLC be subject to a lien by a third party. On May 6, 2015, the proceeds of the $1.0 million Revolving Note, along with $650,000 of current cash and cash equivalents, were used to partially fund a $2.0 million deferred consideration liability due to the stockholders of ADC. The principal balance of this revolving note was $1.0 million at December 31, 2015.\nOn January 15, 2016, we entered into unsecured promissory notes with each of Bipin C. Shah, the Company's Chief Executive Officer, Jonathan Lubert, a Director of the Company, and Flexpoint, in the amounts of $400,000, $500,000, and $1,050,000, respectively (the Promissory Notes\u201d). Amounts outstanding under the Promissory Notes accrue interest at a rate of 12% per annum and carry a default interest rate upon the occurrence of certain events of default, including failure to make payment under the applicable Promissory Note or a sale of the Company. The notes mature on the earlier of April 14, 2016 or the occurrence of an event of a default that is not properly cured or waived. The proceeds of $1.9 million from the Promissory Notes were used as cash collateral recorded as restricted cash to replace the $1.9 million letter of credit in favor of Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. We are currently working with several financial institutions to secure a new $1.9 million letter of credit at which time the restricted cash reserves would be released to repay the Promissory Notes. There can be no assurance that a letter of credit will be obtained or obtained on reasonable terms. If a letter of credit cannot be obtained, the current Promissory Notes may need to be extended at unfavorable terms or other debt instruments may have to be pursued on unfavorable terms.\nTable 110: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>35 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur ongoing ability to comply with the debt covenants under our credit arrangements and to refinance our debt depends largely on the achievement of adequate levels of cash flow. If our future cash flows are less than expected or our debt service, including interest expense, increases more than expected, causing us to default on any of the Metro covenants in the future, we will need to obtain amendments or waivers from Metro. In the event that non-compliance with the debt covenants should occur in the future, we would pursue various alternatives in an attempt to successfully resolve the non-compliance, which might include, among other things, seeking additional debt covenant waivers or amendments or refinancing debt with other financial institutions. There can be no assurance that debt covenant waivers or amendments would be obtained, if needed, or that the debt could be refinanced with other financial institutions on favorable terms.\nAt December 28, 2012, in connection with securing certain debt financing to consummate the Completed Transactions, we incurred a total of $4,393,000 in financing costs that have been capitalized and will be amortized over the life of the related debt instruments using the effective interest method beginning in 2013. Of the total deferred financing costs, $4,370,000 related to certain of our founding stockholders agreeing to sell at cost 832,698 shares of our common stock that they acquired prior to our initial public offering to certain of the Note Investors with respect to the Notes. In accordance with SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin ( SAB\u201d) 79 amended by SAB 5T, Accounting for Expenses or Liabilities Paid by Principal Stockholder, we recorded a $4.37 million stock-based deferred financing cost with a credit to additional paid-in capital at December 28, 2012 for the fair value of the 832,698 shares transferred under this arrangement ($5.25 per share on December 28, 2012). This $4.37 million deferred financing cost was completely amortized as of December 31, 2014. Additionally, in connection with the December 2012 $9.0 million term loan, the November 2014 $7.5 million term loan, and the May 2015 Revolving Note, all payable to Metro, we incurred $23,000, $76,000, and $40,000 of deferred financing costs, respectively. Unamortized deferred financing costs were $88,000 at December 31, 2015.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nOff-balance sheet arrangements as of December 31, 2015 consisted of outstanding letters of credit issued by JetPay of $2.0 million, consisting of a $1.9 million letter of credit as a reserve with respect to JetPay, LLC's main processing bank and a $100,000 letter of credit which represents collateral with respect to a front-end processing relationship with a credit card company.\nContractual Obligations\nWe are obligated under various operating leases, primarily for office space and certain equipment related to our operations. Certain of these leases contain purchase options, renewal provisions, and contingent rentals for our proportionate share of taxes, utilities, insurance, and annual cost of living increases.\nThe following are summaries of our contractual obligations and other commercial commitments at December 31, 2015, excluding fair value and conversion option debt discounts (in thousands):\nTable 111: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Payments Due By Period </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Contractual obligations (1) </td> <td> </td> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Less than\nOne Year </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>One to Three\nYears </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Three to Five\nYears </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>More than\n5 years </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Long-term debt, notes payable and capital lease obligation (1) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>17,082 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,411 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>8,847 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,782 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,042 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Minimum operating lease payments </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>845 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>490 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>354 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>17,927 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,901 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>9,201 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,783 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,042 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 112: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Amounts Expiring Per Period </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Other Commercial Commitments </td> <td> </td> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Less than\nOne Year </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>One to Three\nYears </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Three to Five\nYears </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>More than\n5 years </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Standby letters of credit (2) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 113: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>36 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 114: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>(1) </td> <td>Related interest obligations have been excluded from this maturity schedule.

Net cash provided by operating activities totaled $3.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. Cash provided by operating activities in this period was primarily due to a net loss of $1.2 million, offset by non-cash amortization relating to intangible assets, deferred financing fees and debt discounts and conversion options, and depreciation and amortization expense totaling $3.9 million, and a decrease in restricted cash of $1.2 million. This increase in cash was partially offset by a decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses of $357,000, and an increase in accounts receivable of $489,000.\nNet cash used in operating activities totaled $4.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. Cash used in operating activities in this period was primarily due to a net loss of $6.9 million combined with a decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses of $3.6 million, and an increase in restricted cash of $1.3 million. This decrease in cash was partially offset by non-cash amortization relating to intangible assets, deferred financing fees and debt discounts and conversion options totaling $6.3 million.\nInvesting Activities. Cash used in investing activities totaled $8.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, is primarily due to an increase of $7.5 million in restricted cash and equivalents held to satisfy client obligations and the purchase of property and equipment of $875,000.\nCash used in investing activities totaled $19.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, is primarily due to the acquisition of ACI for $10.8 million, net of $250,000 of cash acquired, an increase of $8.3 million in restricted cash and equivalents held to satisfy client obligations, and the purchase of property and equipment of $416,000.\nFinancing Activities. Cash provided by financing activities totaled $5.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, which included an increase of $7.5 million in client fund obligations, proceeds from a revolving credit facility of $1.0 million, and $1.3 million from the sale of common stock, all partially offset by $1.6 million of cash used for payments on long-term debt and the payment of $2.85 million of deferred acquisition consideration.\nCash provided by financing activities totaled $24.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, which included $19.2 million from the sale of preferred stock, an increase of $8.3 million in client fund obligations, proceeds from notes payable of $7.5 million, and $975,000 from the sale of common stock, all partially offset by $11.3 million of cash used for payments on long-term debt.\nSeasonality\nJetPay Payment Services' revenues and earnings are impacted by the volume of consumer usage of credit and debit cards at the point of sale. For example, JetPay Payment Services experiences increased purchase activity during the first and second quarters due to seasonal volumes of some merchants in JetPay Payment Services' portfolio. Revenues during the first and second quarters tend to increase in comparison to the remaining two quarters of JetPay Payment Services' fiscal year on a same store basis.\nJetPay Strategic Partners' expects increased revenues during the second and third quarters due to seasonal volumes of certain travel and entertainment industry related merchants within JetPay Strategic Partners' portfolio.\nJetPay Payroll Services' revenues are recognized in the period services are rendered and earned. JetPay Payroll Services experiences increased revenues during the fourth and first quarters due to the processing of additional year-end tax filing requirements. Accordingly, revenues and earnings are greater in the fourth and first quarter in comparison to the remaining two quarters of JetPay Payroll Services' fiscal year.\nTable 116: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>37 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nEffects of Inflation\nJetPay Payroll Services' and JetPay Payment Services' monetary assets, consisting primarily of cash and receivables, are not significantly affected by inflation. Non-monetary assets, consisting primarily of property and equipment, are not affected by inflation. We believe that replacement costs of equipment, furniture and leasehold improvements will not materially affect our operations. However, the rate of inflation affects our expenses, such as those for employee compensation and other operating expenses, which may not be readily recoverable in the price of services offered by us. The rate of inflation can also affect our revenues by affecting our client's payroll processing volumes and our merchant charge volume and corresponding changes to processing revenues. While these can be positive or negative, since a portion of JetPay Payment Services' revenues are derived as a percentage of dollar volume processed, JetPay Payment Services' revenues will generally rise when inflation rises. Additionally, JetPay Payroll Services' revenues include the interest earned on the funds held for clients investment trust account balance. Trust fund earnings can fluctuate based on the amount held in the trust account as well as fluctuations in interest rates.\nSummary of Critical Accounting Policies\nCritical accounting policies are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties, and potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions. The Company's critical accounting policies are described below.\nUse of Estimates\nThe accompanying financial statements have been prepared in accordance with Accounting Principles Generally Accepted in the United States of America ( U.S. GAAP\u201d) and pursuant to the accounting and disclosure rules and regulations of the SEC. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the Company's financial statements. Such estimates include, but are not limited to, the value of purchase consideration of acquisitions; valuation of accounts receivable, reserves for chargebacks, goodwill, intangible assets, and other long-lived assets; legal contingencies; and assumptions used in the calculation of stock-based compensation and in the calculation of income taxes. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nRevenue Recognition and Deferred Revenue\nWe recognize revenue in general when the following criteria have been met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, a customer contract or purchase order exists and the fees are fixed and determinable, no significant obligations remain and collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured. Allowances for chargebacks, discounts and other allowances are estimated and recorded concurrent with the recognition of revenue and are primarily based on historic rates.\nRevenues from our credit and debit card processing operations are recognized in the period services are rendered as we process credit and debit card transactions for our merchant customers or for merchant customers of our ISO clients. The majority of our revenues within our credit and debit card processing business is comprised of transaction-based fees, which typically constitute a percentage of dollar volume processed, or a fee per transaction processed. In the case where we are only the processor of transactions, we charge transaction fees only and record these fees as revenues. In the case of merchant contracts or contracts with ISOs, VARs, ISVs and financial institutions for whom we process credit and debit card transactions for our ISOs, VARs, ISVs and financial institution merchant customers, revenues are primarily comprised of fees charged to the merchant, as well as a percentage of the processed sale transaction. Our contracts in most instances involve three parties: us, the merchant, and the sponsoring bank. Under certain of these sales arrangements, our sponsoring bank collects the gross revenue from the merchants, pays the interchange fees and assessments to the credit card associations, collects their fees and pays us a net residual payment representing our fee for the services provided. Accordingly, under these arrangements, we record the revenue net of interchange, credit card association assessments and fees and the sponsoring bank's fees. Effective June 1, 2013, a majority of our merchant contracts, ISOs, VARs, ISVs and financial institutions, and merchant customer credit and debit card transactions business was transferred to a new sponsoring bank whereby we are billed directly for certain fees by the credit card associations and the processing bank. In this instance, revenues and cost of revenues include the credit card association fees and assessments and the sponsoring bank's fees which are billed to us and for which we assume credit risk. In all instances, we recognize processing revenues net of interchange fees, which are assessed to our merchant and ISO, VAR, ISV and financial institution merchant customers on all processed transactions. Interchange rates and fees are not controlled by us. We effectively function as a clearing house collecting and remitting interchange fee settlement on behalf of issuing banks, debit networks, credit card associations and their processing customers. Additionally, our direct merchant customers have the liability for any charges properly reversed by the cardholder. In the event, however, that we are not able to collect such amount from the merchants due to merchant fraud, insolvency, bankruptcy or any other reason, we may be liable for any such reversed charges. We, in certain instances, require cash deposits, guarantees, letters of credit and other types of collateral by certain merchants to minimize any such contingent liability, and also utilize a number of systems and procedures to manage merchant risk. We have historically experienced losses due to chargebacks resulting from merchant defaults.\nTable 117: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>38 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenues from our payroll processing operation is recognized in the period services are rendered and earned under service arrangements with clients where service fees are fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured. Certain processing services are provided under annual service arrangements with revenue recognized over the service period based on when the efforts and costs are expended. Our service revenues are largely attributable to payroll-related processing services where the fees are based on a fixed amount per processing period or a fixed amount per processing period plus a fee per employee or transaction processed. The revenues earned from delivery service for the distribution of certain client payroll checks and reports is included in processing revenues, and the costs for delivery are included in SG&A expenses on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nInterest on funds held for our clients is earned primarily on funds that are collected from our clients before due dates for payroll tax administration services and for employee payment services, and invested until remittance to the applicable tax or regulatory agencies or client employee. These collections from clients are typically remitted from 1 to 30 days after receipt, with some items extending to 90 days. The interest earned on these funds is included in processing revenues on the Consolidated Statements of Operations because the collecting, holding, and remitting of these funds are critical components of providing these services.\nReserve for Chargeback Losses\nDisputes between a cardholder and a merchant periodically arise as a result of, among other things, cardholder dissatisfaction with merchandise quality or merchant services. Such disputes may not be resolved in the merchant's favor. In these cases, the transaction is charged back\u201d to the merchant, which means the purchase price is refunded to the customer through the merchant's bank and charged to the merchant. If the merchant has inadequate funds, we must bear the credit risk for the full amount of the transaction. JetPay Payment Services evaluates the risk for such transactions and estimates the potential loss for chargebacks based primarily on historical experience and records a loss reserve accordingly. We believe our reserve for chargeback losses is adequate to cover both the known probable losses and the incurred but not yet reported losses at the balance sheet dates.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nThe carrying amounts of financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, settlement processing assets and liabilities, accounts receivable, prepaid expenses and other current assets, funds held for clients, other assets, accounts payable and accrued expenses, deferred revenue, other current liabilities and client fund obligations, approximated fair value as of the balance sheet date presented, because of the relatively short maturity dates on these instruments. The carrying amounts of the financing arrangements approximate fair value as of the balance sheet date presented, because interest rates on these instruments approximate market interest rates after consideration of stated interest rates, anti-dilution protection and associated warrants.\nSettlement Processing Assets and Obligations\nFunds settlement refers to the process of transferring funds for sales and credits between card issuers and merchants. Depending on the type of transaction, either the credit card interchange system or the debit network is used to transfer the information and funds between the sponsoring bank and card issuer to complete the link between merchants and card issuers. In certain of our processing arrangements, merchant funding primarily occurs after the sponsoring bank receives the funds from the card issuer through the card networks creating a net settlement obligation on our balance sheet. In a limited number of other arrangements, the sponsoring bank funds the merchants before it receives the net settlement funds from the card networks, creating a net settlement asset on our balance sheet. Additionally, certain of our sponsoring banks collect the gross revenue from the merchants, pay the interchange fees and assessments to the credit card associations, collect their fees for processing and pay us a net residual payment representing our fees for the services. In these instances, we do not reflect the related settlement processing assets and obligations in our consolidated balance sheet.\nTiming differences in processing credit and debit card and ACH transactions, as described above, interchange expense collection, merchant reserves, sponsoring bank reserves, and exception items result in settlement processing asset and obligations. Settlement processing assets consist primarily of our receivable from merchants for the portion of the discount fee related to reimbursement of the interchange expense, our receivable from the processing bank for transactions we have funded merchants in advance of receipt of card association funding, merchant reserves held, sponsoring bank reserves and exception items, such as customer chargeback amounts receivable from merchants. Settlement processing obligations consist primarily of merchant reserves, our liability to the processing bank for transactions for which we have received funding from the members but have not funded merchants and exception items.\nTable 118: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>39 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nWe periodically review the carrying value of our long-lived assets held and used at least annually or when events and circumstances warrant such a review. If significant events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable, we perform a test of recoverability by comparing the carrying value of the asset or asset group to its undiscounted expected future cash flows. Cash flow projections are sometimes based on a group of assets, rather than a single asset. If cash flows cannot be separately and independently identified for a single asset, we determine whether impairment has occurred for the group of assets for which it can identify the projected cash flows. If the carrying values are in excess of undiscounted expected future cash flows, it measures any impairment by comparing the fair value of the asset group to its carrying value. If the fair value of an asset or asset group is determined to be less than the carrying amount of the asset or asset group, impairment in the amount of the difference is recorded. Our annual testing indicated there was no impairment as of December 31, 2015.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill represents the premium paid over the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired in our business combinations. We perform a goodwill impairment test on at least an annual basis. Application of the goodwill impairment test requires significant judgments, including estimation of future cash flows, which is dependent on internal forecasts, estimation of the long-term rate of growth for the businesses, the useful life over which cash flows will occur and determination of our weighted average cost of capital. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and/or conclusions on goodwill impairment for each reporting unit. We conduct our annual goodwill impairment test as of December 31 of each year or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist. We periodically analyze whether any such indicators of impairment exist. A significant amount of judgment is involved in determining if an indicator of impairment has occurred. Such indicators may include a sustained significant decline in our stock price and market capitalization, a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate, unanticipated competition and/or slower expected growth rates, adverse actions or assessments by a regulator, among others. We compare the fair value of our reporting unit to our respective carrying value, including related goodwill. Future changes in the industry could impact the results of future annual impairment tests. Our annual goodwill impairment testing indicated there was no impairment as of December 31, 2015. There can be no assurance that future tests of goodwill impairment will not result in impairment charges.\nIdentifiable Intangible Assets\nIdentifiable intangible assets consist primarily of customer relationships, software costs, and tradenames. Certain tradenames are considered to have indefinite lives, and as such, are not subject to amortization. These assets are tested for impairment using undiscounted cash flow methodology annually and whenever there is an impairment indicator. Estimating future cash flows requires significant judgment and projections may vary from cash flows eventually realized. Several impairment indicators are beyond our control, and determining whether or not they will occur cannot be predicted with any certainty. Customer relationships, tradenames, and software costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over their respective assigned estimated useful lives.\nConvertible Preferred Stock\nWe account for the redemption premium, beneficial conversion feature and issuance costs on our Convertible Preferred Stock using the effective interest method, accreting such amounts to our Convertible Preferred Stock from the date of issuance to the earliest date of redemption.\nShare-Based Compensation\nWe expense employee share-based payments under ASC Topic 718, Compensation - Stock Compensation ( ASC Topic 718\u201d), which requires compensation cost for the grant-date fair value of share-based payments to be recognized over the requisite service period. We estimate the grant date fair value of the share-based awards issued in the form of options using the Black-Scholes option pricing model.\nTable 119: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>40 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nDerivative Financial Instruments\nWe do not use derivative instruments to hedge exposures to cash flow, market or foreign currency risks. We review the terms of the convertible debt we issue to determine whether there are embedded derivative instruments, including embedded conversion options, which are required to be bifurcated and accounted for separately as derivative financial instruments. In circumstances where the host instrument contains more than one embedded derivative instrument, including the conversion option that is required to be bifurcated, the bifurcated derivative instruments are accounted for as a single compound derivative instrument.\nBifurcated embedded derivatives are initially recorded at fair value and are then revalued at each reporting date with changes in the fair value reported as non-operating income or expense. When the equity or convertible debt instruments contain embedded derivative instruments that are to be bifurcated and accounted for as liabilities, the total proceeds received are first allocated to the fair value of all the bifurcated derivative instruments. The remaining proceeds, if any, are then allocated to the host instruments themselves, usually resulting in those instruments being recorded at a discount from their face value. The discount from the face value of the convertible debt, together with the stated interest on the instrument, is amortized over the life of the instrument through periodic charges recorded within other expense (income), using the effective interest method.\nFair value measurements\nWe account for fair value measurements in accordance with ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, ( ASC Topic No. 820\u201d) which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements.\nASC Topic 820 establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements). The three levels of the fair value hierarchy under ASC Topic 820 are described below:\nTable 120: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>Level 1 </td> <td>Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical, unrestricted assets or liabilities. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 121: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>Level 2 </td> <td>Applies to assets or liabilities for which there are inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in markets with insufficient volume or infrequent transactions (less active markets); or model-derived valuations in which significant inputs are observable or can be derived principally from, or corroborated by, observable market data. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 122: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>Level 3 </td> <td>Prices or valuation techniques that require inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable (supported by little or no market activity). </td> </tr>\n</table>\nIncome taxes\nWe account for income taxes under ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes, ( ASC Topic 740\u201d). ASC Topic 740 requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for both the expected impact of differences between the financial statements and tax basis of assets and liabilities and for the expected future tax benefit to be derived from tax loss and tax credit carryovers. Deferred income tax expense (benefit) represents the change during the period in the deferred income tax assets and deferred income tax liabilities. In establishing the provision for income taxes and determining deferred income tax assets and liabilities, we make judgments and interpretations based on enacted laws, published tax guidance and estimates of future earnings. ASC Topic 740 additionally requires a valuation allowance to be established when, based on available evidence; it is more likely than not that some portion or the entire deferred income tax asset will not be realized.\nTable 123: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>41 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nASC Topic 740 also clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise's financial statements and prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement process for financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. For those benefits to be recognized, a tax position must be more-likely-than-not to be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities. ASC Topic 740 also provides guidance on de-recognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. We are required to file income tax returns in the United States (federal) and in various state and local jurisdictions. Based on our evaluation, it has been concluded that there are no significant uncertain tax positions requiring recognition in our financial statements. We believe that our income tax positions and deductions would be sustained upon examination and do not anticipate any adjustments that would result in material changes to our financial position.\nOur policy for recording interest and penalties associated with unrecognized tax benefits is to record such interest and penalties as interest expense and as a component of SG&A expense, respectively. There were no amounts accrued for penalties or interest as of or during the year ended December 31, 2015. Management does not expect any significant changes in our unrecognized tax benefits in the next year.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nIn May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB\u201d) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU\u201d) No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. This ASU supersedes the revenue recognition requirements in Accounting Standards Codification 605 - Revenue Recognition and most industry-specific guidance throughout the Codification. The standard requires that an entity recognizes revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. This ASU is effective on January 1, 2017 and should be applied retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented or retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying the ASU recognized at the date of initial application. The adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial position and results of operations.\nIn February 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-02 Consolidation (Topic 810): Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis that amends the current consolidation guidance. The amendments affect both the variable interest entity and voting interest entity consolidation models. The new guidance is effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2016, with early adoption permitted. This new guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.\nIn April 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-03 Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs, which requires that debt issuance costs be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of related debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. Under current accounting standards, such costs are recorded as an asset. The new guidance is effective for the Company beginning January 1, 2016, with early adoption permitted. This new guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.\nIn August 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-15, Interest-Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30): Presentation and Subsequent Measurement of Debt Issuance Costs Associated with Line-of-Credit Arrangements. ASU No. 2015-15 clarified the presentation and subsequent measurement of debt issuance costs related to line-of-credit arrangements. Such costs may be presented in the balance sheet as an asset and subsequently amortized ratably over the term of the line-of-credit arrangement, regardless of whether there are any outstanding borrowings on the line-of-credit arrangement. ASU No. 2015-15 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Earlier adoption is permitted for financial statements that have not been previously issued. This new guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.\nIn September 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-16, Business Combinations (Topic 805), Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement-Period Adjustments. The update requires that the acquirer in a business combination recognize adjustments to provisional amounts that are identified during the measurement period in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined (not retrospectively as with prior guidance). Additionally, the acquirer must record in the same period's financial statements the effect on earnings of changes in depreciation, amortization or other income effects as a result of the change to the provisional amounts, calculated as if the accounting had been completed at the time of acquisition. The acquiring entity is required to disclose, on the face of the financial statements or in the footnotes to the financial statements, the portion of the amount recorded in current period earnings, by financial statement line item, that would have been recorded in previous reporting periods if the adjustment to the provisional amounts had been recognized as of the acquisition date. The guidance in ASU No. 2015-16 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Earlier application is permitted for financial statements that have not been issued. This new guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.\nIn November 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-17, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes. The ASU simplifies the presentation of deferred income taxes under U.S. GAAP by requiring that all deferred tax assets and liabilities be classified as non-current. The guidance in ASU No. 2015-17 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Earlier application is permitted for financial statements that have not been issued. This new guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.\nTable 124: <table><tr><td> </td> <td>42 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842). The ASU requires that a lessee recognize the assets and liabilities that arise from operating leases. A lessee should recognize in the statement of financial position a liability to make lease payments (the lease liability) and a right-of-use asset representing its right to use the underlying asset for the lease term. For leases with a term of 12 months or less, a lessee is permitted to make an accounting policy election by class of underlying asset not to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities. In transition, lessees and lessors are required to recognize and measure leases at the beginning of the earliest period presented using a modified retrospective approach. JetPay has not yet determined the effect of the adoption of this standard on JetPay's consolidated financial position and results of operations.", "summary": "- For the year ended December 31, 2015,

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In addition to historical information, the following discussion also contains forward-looking statements that include risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including those factors set forth under Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOverview\nWe were formed on November 12, 2010 as a blank check company to serve as a vehicle to acquire through a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, plan of arrangement, recapitalization, reorganization or other similar business combination, one or more operating businesses. As previously disclosed, we completed the acquisitions of JetPay, LLC and ADC, on December 28, 2012, and ACI on November 7, 2014.\nWe are a provider of payment services - debit and credit card processing, payroll and HCM services, and prepaid card services to businesses and their employees throughout the United States. We provide these services through three wholly-owned subsidiaries: JetPay, LLC, currently doing business as JetPay Payment Services, which provides debit and credit processing and ACH payment services to businesses with a focus on those processing internet transactions and recurring billings; JetPay Strategic Partners, an independent sales organization specializing in relationships with banks, credit unions and other financial institutions; and JetPay Payroll Services, which provides HCM services, including, payroll, tax filing, time and attendance, HR services, and Affordable Care Act and related services to small and medium-sized employers. We also operate JetPay Card Services, which is focused on providing low-cost money management and payment services to unbanked and under-banked employees of our business customers.\n 27 \nOur overall business strategy is to provide payment processing services to small to large-sized businesses with a high percentage of our revenues consisting of recurring revenues with strong margins and with relatively low capital requirements. Our corporate strategy is to increase our revenues through a combination of organic growth and acquisitions. Our organic growth strategy is focused on developing and increasing our current marketing and sales staff at JetPay Payment Services, JetPay Strategic Partners and JetPay Payroll Services to penetrate new customer niches and geographic markets. Our organic growth strategy also includes cross marketing initiatives to sell credit and debit card processing services to JetPay Payroll Services' payroll customers and payroll processing services to JetPay Payment Services' credit and debit card processing customers. Additionally, we will be seeking additional debt and/or equity capital to acquire additional credit and debit card processors ISOs and/or payroll processors to integrate into our JetPay Payment Services and JetPay Payroll Services operations. Our acquisition strategy is focused on identifying small to medium-sized companies that either provide services similar to ours or services that expand our product and service offerings and/or our geographic reach. Both our JetPay Payment Services and our JetPay Payroll Services operations have significant under-utilized processing capacity, which can be leveraged to create additional processing revenues without significant cost increases. We also plan to introduce new products, including through JetPay Card Services, which provides low-cost financial tools to both un-banked and under-banked consumers. Our overall strategy also includes looking for cost synergies as we continue to integrate the JetPay Payment Services, JetPay Strategic Partners and JetPay Payroll Services operations in such areas as insurance costs, banking costs, employee benefit costs, and other selling, general and administrative cost as well as operating cost areas.\nJetPay Payment Processing Segment - JetPay Payment Services and JetPay Strategic Partners\nRevenues\nJetPay Payment Services' and JetPay Strategic Partners' revenues fall into two categories: transaction processing revenues and merchant discount revenues. As such, our two primary drivers are the number of transactions and merchant dollar volume. A third measure related to merchant dollar volume, for those merchants where we charge a percentage of the sale amount, is the average size of the transaction, as costs for processing the transaction tend to be fixed, so that the higher the average ticket, the more revenue we earn for a fixed cost. JetPay's discount revenues are generally a fixed percentage of the merchant's dollar volume, with interchange and other third-party fees passed through to the merchant without markup. Our billings to merchants primarily consist of these transaction fees and discount fees, as well as pass-through fees for other miscellaneous services, such as handling chargebacks. Interchange costs are set by the card networks, and are paid directly by the sponsoring bank to the credit card associations based upon a percentage of transaction amounts and/or a fixed price per transaction. JetPay Payment Services refers to the ratio of processing revenues to the dollar amount of card transactions processed as the margin.\u201d If margin increases, processing revenues will tend to increase accordingly. Further, both the number of merchants who process transactions, and the average dollar amount of transactions processed per merchant, will impact the total transaction volume and thus the total processing revenues. As such, growth in JetPay's merchant count and/or growth in the same store transaction volume will also drive JetPay's processing revenue growth.\nExpenses\nThe most significant components of operating expenses are credit card association fees and assessments; residual payments to ISOs / VARs / ISVs and financial institutions; and salaries and other employment costs. Salaries and other employment costs are largely fixed in nature, increasing slightly with the growth in numbers of customers, but tending to grow with inflation. Credit card fees and assessments and bank sponsorship costs are generally a percentage of card volume. Bank sponsorship costs are largely based upon transaction counts and volumes. Selling, general and administrative expenses include stable costs such as occupancy and office costs, outside services, and depreciation and amortization expense, which is recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the assets. Cost of processing revenues also includes chargeback losses, which vary over the long term based upon transaction volume processed by JetPay's merchants, but can vary from period to period depending upon specific events in that period. JetPay Payment Services has and will continue to experience higher than normal professional fees due to the Direct Air matter.\n 28 \nMerchant Attrition\nMerchant attrition is a normal part of the merchant processing industry in the ordinary course of business. JetPay Payment Services does not experience attrition in the same form as most of its competitors. Most of JetPay Payment Services' competitors have large portfolios of small businesses and these businesses change their payments provider quickly and for many reasons. JetPay Payment Services' portfolio is made up of small to large businesses and they are more cautious in making changes to payment providers, and therefore, its portfolio does not change as often. However, because of the volume that each of these merchants produce, when one leaves it may have a significant impact on operating results. In addition, JetPay Payment Services does service several ISOs and financial institutions, such that while our volatility in the change of number of merchants remains significant, we experience far less volatility in revenues. As a result, JetPay Payment Services monitors its customer losses for both numbers of merchants as well as merchant processing revenues. For the year ended December 31, 2015, in our traditional business, JetPay Payment Services' customer attrition was approximately 25.7%, or an approximate 2,536 merchant reduction from approximately 9,850 merchants existing at December 31, 2014. This reduction in merchants included one particular ISO customer whose attrition rate is high due to the nature of its business. This reduction was offset by the addition of approximately 2,481, or approximately 25.2%, new merchants, resulting in a net merchant decline rate of approximately 0.5%. With respect to processing revenues, the lost merchants in 2015 represented a loss of approximately $3.2 million of annualized revenues, or approximately 12.6% of JetPay Payment Services' 2014 revenues of approximately $25.4 million. The new merchants that JetPay Payment Services added in 2015 contributed to a net increase in processing revenues in 2015 of approximately $3.1 million or 12.3% of 2014 revenues.\nMarkets\nJetPay Payment Services and JetPay Strategic Partners have defined four distinct markets in which they operate -Card-Not-Present / Recurring Payments; VARs, ISVs, and ISO's; financial institutions and associations; and small businesses through cross-sell. For Small Businesses and financial institutions, JetPay Payment Services is the traditional provider of merchant services to businesses, and holds the contracts. With regards to the other two markets, JetPay Payment Services operates in two forms: 1) as a processor only where JetPay Payment Services recognizes revenue from the authorization, clearing, and settlement functions and does not participate in the discount revenue or risk of the merchant; and 2) in a shared relationship, where JetPay Payment Services either owns the merchant contract outright or shares in the discount revenue of the merchant with an agent or ISO, and may assume or share risk. This market has experienced strong growth since 2013 and JetPay Payment Services expects to significantly increase this revenue area as the operations group solidifies the product offering and execution. Our expansion in 2014 and 2015 was negatively affected by management's time being diverted to dealing with the Direct Air issue described in Part I, Item 3. Legal Proceedings, as well as efforts devoted to our acquisition and integration of JetPay Payment Services and JetPay Strategic Partners. Sales and marketing began targeting new customers and customer segments in 2014 and 2015 and we anticipate such efforts will lead to continued revenue growth in 2016 and future years.\nJetPay HR and Payroll Segment - JetPay Payroll Services\nRevenues\nThe majority of revenues from JetPay Payroll Services is derived from its payroll processing operations, which includes the calculation, preparation, collection and delivery of employer payroll obligations and the production of internal accounting records and management reports, and from services provided for the preparation of federal, state, and local payroll tax returns, including the collection and remittance of clients' payroll tax obligations. JetPay Payroll Services experiences increased revenues in the fourth and first calendar quarters due to additional employer annual tax filing requirements. Payroll Tax Filing Services ( PTFS\u201d) trust account earnings represent the interest earned on the funds held for clients trust balance. Trust fund earnings can fluctuate based on the amount held in the trust account as well as fluctuations in interest rates. Over the past two years, JetPay Payroll Services has seen a significant increase in revenue from its human capital management, Affordable Care Act and time and attendance services.\nExpenses\nJetPay Payroll Services' most significant cost of processing revenues is its payroll and related expenses, costs of third party service providers, and facility overhead costs. These costs are largely fixed in nature, increasing slightly with the growth in numbers of customers and payrolls processed, but tending to grow with inflation. JetPay Payroll Services' selling, general, and administrative expenses include the costs of the administrative and sales staff, payroll delivery costs, outside services, rent, office expense, insurance, sales and marketing costs and professional services costs.\n 29 \nCustomer Attrition\nCustomer attrition is a normal part of the payroll processing industry in the ordinary course of business. JetPay Payroll Services' attrition generally comes in three forms - closure of a business, acquisition of a business wherein the payroll is transferred to the buyer, and competition. As a result, JetPay Payroll Services monitors its customer losses for both numbers of customers as well as customer revenues. For the year ended December 31, 2015, JetPay HR and Payroll Segment customer attrition was approximately 8.7%, or an approximate 439 customer reduction from approximately 5,075 customers existing at December 31, 2014. This reduction was offset by the addition of approximately 479 new customers, or approximately 9.4% over the 5,075 customers existing at December 31, 2014, resulting in a net customer growth rate of approximately 0.7%. With respect to payroll processing revenues, the lost customers in 2015 represented a loss of approximately $1.1 million of annualized revenues, or approximately 7.7% of JetPay Payroll Services' 2014 processing revenues of approximately $13.6 million. The new customers that JetPay added in 2015 contributed to a net increase in processing revenues in 2015 of approximately $1.0 million or 7.1% of 2014 revenues..\nResults of Operations for the Year Ended December 31, 2015 and 2014\nThe following tables represent a comparison of the results of our operations for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to December 31, 2014 (in thousands):\n\n 30 \n\nRevenues\nRevenues were $43.3 million and $33.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Overall revenues increased $9.9 million, or 29.5%, in 2015 as compared to 2014. Of the $43.3 million of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2015, $14.7 million, or 33.9%, was generated from our JetPay HR and Payroll Segment and $28.6 million, or 66.1%, from our JetPay Payment Processing Segment. Of the $33.4 million of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2014, $13.7 million, or 41.1%, was generated from our JetPay HR and Payroll Segment and $19.7 million, or 58.9%, from our JetPay Payment Processing Segment.\nJetPay Payment Processing Segment's revenues increased $8.9 million, or 45.1%, for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to 2014. This increase included incremental revenues of $6.3 million related to JetPay Strategic Partners, which we acquired on November 7, 2014. Excluding the increase in JetPay Strategic Partners' revenues, our Texas-based JetPay Payment Services operation's revenues increased $2.6 million, or 13.0%, in 2015 as compared to 2014. The most significant changes within our Texas based JetPay Payment Services' operations were an increase of $1.7 million, or 20.8%, in our Third Party business and an increase of $982,000, or 11.6%, in direct merchant services revenues, with these increases resulting from our investment in professional sales staff and marketing initiatives. These gains were partially offset by a decrease of $223,000, or 10.2%, in our processing and clearing business.\nJetPay HR and Payroll Segment's revenues increased $952,000, or 6.9%, for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to 2014. This increase was attributable to net growth in volume of payroll and related payroll taxes processed in addition to revenues generated from several new HR related services, including Affordable Care Act, time and labor management, and other HR services, introduced in late 2014. Growth in our new HR related services was approximately $594,000, or 62.4% of our JetPay HR and Payroll Segment's revenue growth in 2015.\nCost of Processing Revenues\nCost of revenues were $26.2 million, or 60.5% of revenues, and $20.0 million, or 59.8% of revenues, for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Of the $26.2 million of cost of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2015, $7.3 million, or 27.9%, related to our HR and Payroll Segment and $18.8 million, or 72.1%, related to our Payment Processing Segment. Of the $20.0 million of cost of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2014, $7.2 million, or 36.0%, related to our HR and Payroll Segment and $12.7 million, or 64.0%, related to our Payment Processing Segment.\n 31 \nThe cost of processing revenues within our Payment Processing Segment increased from $12.7 million, or 64.6% of revenues in 2014 to $18.8 million, or 65.7% of revenues in 2015, an increase of $6.1 million, or 47.6%. The increase in cost of processing revenues related to the growth in our Payment Processing Segment revenues, including an increase of $3.4 million of cost of processing revenues related to the JetPay Strategic Services acquisition on November 7, 2014. Overall gross profit margin as reported within our Payment Processing Segment decreased slightly from 35.4% in 2014 to 34.3% in 2015 largely as a result of an increase in Third Party commissions to ISOs, VARs, and ISVs of $856,000 related to the previously noted increase in Third Party revenues combined with the investments made in technology professionals since December 31, 2014.\nThe cost of processing revenues within our HR and Payroll Segment increased $120,000, a slight decrease as a percentage of revenues from 52.4% in 2014 to 49.8% in 2015 despite an increase in technology and customer service professionals as well as an investment in new product management. The effect of this decrease in cost of processing revenues as a percentage of revenues was an increase in gross profit margin within our HR and Payroll Segment from 47.6% in 2014 to 50.2% in 2015 as we leveraged the increase in revenues over the relatively fixed costs of our operating platforms.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nSelling, general and administrative ( SG&A\u201d) expenses were $13.3 million, or 30.7% of revenues, for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to $12.1 million, or 36.3% of revenues, for the same period in 2014.\nSG&A expenses within our Payment Processing Segment increased from $5.2 million or 26.6% of revenues in 2014, to $6.9 million, or 24.0% of revenues in 2015. This increase was largely the result of an increase in sales staff, an increase in marketing, tradeshows and advertising costs of $98,000, an increase in SG&A expenses related to JetPay Strategic Partners of $741,000 acquired in November 2014, and an increase in legal fees and related settlement costs of approximately $563,000 as the Company continued to work to resolve the legal matters described below in Part I, Item 3. Legal Proceedings. Additionally, the results for the year ended December 31, 2014 included a $460,000 charge related to a legal settlement and a $237,000 loss on the disposal of a fixed asset.\nSG&A expenses within our HR and Payroll Segment increased from $4.1 million in 2014 to $4.8 million in 2015, an increase of approximately $628,000, or 15.1%, largely due to an increase in payroll costs as additional sales and technology professionals were added to help develop and market new products and services, including the expansion of the HR services we provide to our customers.\nAdditionally, we incurred corporate SG&A expenses of $1.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, including the benefit of $1.43 million of management fees received from the Company's operating subsidiaries as compared to corporate SG&A expenses of $2.8 million in 2014, including $900,000 of management fees received from the operating subsidiaries. Corporate SG&A expenses include, but are not limited to, the salaries of our executive officers, outside professional fees, investor relations and other public company costs, and general corporate operating expenses. Corporate SG&A expenses for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 also included $236,000 and $503,000, respectively, of start-up expenses relating to our Card Services operations. SG&A expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015 included non-cash stock-based compensation expense of $278,000 as compared to $356,000 in 2014. The SG&A expenses of our HR and Payroll Segment include $350,000 of corporate-allocated costs for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, and the SG&A expenses of our Payment Processing Segment include $1.08 million and $550,000 of corporate-allocated costs in 2015 and 2014, respectively, with an offsetting reduction in Corporate SG&A expenses of $1.43 million and $900,000 for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nDepreciation and amortization totaled $3.6 million and $2.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The increase in depreciation and amortization expense in 2015 as compared to 2014 was primarily related to the amortization of the ACI intangible assets acquired on November 7, 2014.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 was $819,000 and $1.7 million, respectively. The reduction in interest expense in 2015 was primarily related to the pay-off of the $10.0 million convertible secured notes in December 2014, partially offset by interest expense relating to the Metro Bank term loan entered into on November 7, 2014 in connection with the ACI acquisition and the $1.0 million revolving note payable entered into with Metro Bank on May 6, 2015.\n 32 \nIncome Taxes\nThe Company recorded income tax expense of $197,000 and $222,000 for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Income tax expense reflects the recording of state income taxes. The effective tax rates were approximately (19.7)% and (3.3)% for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The effective rate differs from the federal statutory rate for each year, primarily due to state and local income taxes and changes to the valuation allowance.\nAnalysis of Impairment\nThe Company conducts its annual goodwill impairment testing as of December 31 of each year or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist. We performed extensive valuation analyses, utilizing both income and market approaches, in our goodwill assessment process for our two identified reporting units that contained goodwill, JetPay Payment Processing and JetPay HR and Payroll reporting segments.\nIn our income approach, we utilized a discounted cash flow analysis for each of our previously identified reporting units using discount rates of 18.0% and 16.5% for our JetPay Payment Processing and JetPay HR and Payroll reporting segments, respectively, which represent the estimated weighted average cost of capital. These discount rates reflect the overall level of inherent risk involved in our reporting units and the rate of return an outside investor would expect to earn. In our discounted cash flow ( DCF\u201d) analysis, we prepared a five year forecast of our expected earnings to derive an expected stream of free cash flow through December 31, 2020. To estimate cash flows beyond the final year of our forecast, we used a terminal value approach. Under this approach, we estimated operating income before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization in the final year of our model, adjusted to estimate a normalized cash flow, applied a perpetuity growth assumption and discounted by a perpetuity discount factor to determine the terminal value. We incorporated the present value of the resulting terminal value into our estimate of fair value. In developing our forecasts of revenues and direct variable operating expenses, we utilized a variety of factors including our current and anticipated sales pipelines of prospects currently known to us, as well as those which we believe will be generated through current and future relationships with merchants, agent banks and ISOs. We also applied our knowledge of the industries, general economic conditions, and the forecast of industry experts regarding consumers' continued trending towards expanded use of electronic payment methods. Our operating expenses are either variable with revenues, or fixed and predictable; however, we increased our future costs based on expected inflation and the need to expand personnel costs as we achieve projected future revenue levels. In performing our DCF analysis, we multiplied our estimated cash flows by a marginal federal and state tax rate of 40% to derive our after-tax cash flows, and we utilized weighted average costs of capital of 18.0% and 16.5% for our JetPay Payment Processing reporting segment and JetPay HR and Payroll reporting segment analysis, respectively. In addition to the income approach, we also used several market-based approaches to corroborate the results of the income approach described above; including comparing our company's various earnings and performance indicators to those of similar publically traded companies, comparisons to prior purchase and sales transactions of similar reporting units by companies, and a comparison to recent mergers and acquisitions of guideline companies.\nWith respect to our assessment of goodwill impairment for our JetPay Payment Processing reporting segment, as of December 31, 2015, we determined that there was no impairment in that the fair value for this reporting unit was $61.0 million which exceeded the carrying value of net assets by $14.1 million, or 30.0%. With respect to our assessment of goodwill impairment for our JetPay HR and Payroll reporting segment, as of December 31, 2015, we determined that there was no impairment in that the fair value for this reporting unit was $33.6 million which exceeded the carrying value of net assets by $8.2 million, or 32.3%. Events or circumstances that could have a negative effect on estimated fair value of our reporting units in the future include, but are not limited to, a loss of customers due to competition, pressure from our customers to reduce pricing, inability to continue to employ a competent workforce at current rates of pay, changes in government regulations, and accelerating costs beyond management's control.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nCash and cash equivalents were $5.6 million at December 31, 2015, excluding $226,000 of cash deposited into restricted cash accounts. Cash and cash equivalents also excludes $4.4 million of cash reserves, or the Merrick Cash Reserve\u201d, held by Merrick, JetPay Payment Services' former sponsor bank, which is specifically related to the Direct Air matter. The Merrick Cash Reserve of $4.4 million at both December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, is recorded as non-current assets under the caption Other Assets\u201d. While we continue to defend the potential obligation related to the chargeback claims there can be no assurance as to the timing of the release of this cash reserve. See also Part I, Item 3. Legal Proceedings. The ratio of our total debt to total capitalization, which consists of total debt, convertible preferred stock, and stockholders' equity, was 23% at both December 31, 2015 and 2014. As of December 31, 2015, we had a working capital deficit, excluding funds held for clients and client funds obligations, of approximately $3.2 million.\n 33 \nWe expect to fund our cash needs, including capital required for acquisitions, with cash flow from our operating activities, equity investments and borrowings. Additionally, we will require approximately $4.2 million to cover our interest and principal payments on our existing debt for the twelve months ending December 31, 2016, and $1.2 million of deferred consideration due to the unitholders of ACI on April 10, 2016. As previously disclosed, on October 11, 2013, we were successful in selling an initial 33,333 shares of Series A Preferred to Flexpoint for an aggregate of $10 million, less certain costs, an additional 4,667 shares of Series A Preferred on April 14, 2014 for $1.4 million, 20,000 shares on November 7, 2014 for $6.0 million, and 33,333 shares on December 28, 2014 for $10.0 million. We have an agreement to potentially sell up to an additional $12.6 million of Series A Preferred to Flexpoint. Additionally, the Company sold 6,165 shares of Series A-1 Preferred to Wellington for an aggregate of $1.85 million, and it has an agreement to potentially sell an additional $850,000 of Series A-1 Preferred to Wellington. This additional $13.45 million of convertible preferred stock, if sold, will be used principally as consideration for future acquisitions. Additionally, from December 22, 2015 to January 22, 2016, the Company sold to certain accredited investors, including Bipin C. Shah, Robert B. Palmer, and Jonathan M. Lubert, an aggregate of 517,037 shares of the Company's common stock at a purchase price of $2.70 per share for aggregate consideration of $1,396,000, prior to issuance costs. If the Company is unable to raise additional capital through additional equity investments or borrowing, it may need to limit its level of capital expenditures and future growth plans.\nCapital expenditures were $1.3 million and $614,000 for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. We currently estimate capital expenditures for all of our ongoing operations, including JetPay Payment Services and JetPay Payroll Services, at approximately $2 million to $2.8 million for 2016, principally related to technology improvements. Our capital requirements include working capital for daily operations, including expenditures to maintain our technology platforms. Our operations currently generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our current operating needs and our routine debt service requirements.\nIn the past, we have been successful in obtaining financing by obtaining loans and equity investments, including the Series A Preferred investment by Flexpoint and the Series A-1 Preferred investment by Wellington. To fund and integrate future acquisitions or expand our technology platforms for new business initiatives, we will need to raise additional capital through loans, sale of Series A Preferred or Series A-1 Preferred, or additional equity investments. In addition, we continue to investigate the capital markets for sources of funding, which could take the form of additional debt or equity financing. We cannot provide any assurance that we will be successful in securing new financing or that we will secure such future financing with commercially acceptable terms. If we are unable to raise additional capital, we may need to limit our acquisition growth plans or delay certain technology improvements.\nDebt Capitalization and Other Financing Arrangements\nAt December 31, 2015, we had borrowings of approximately $16.7 million net of an unamortized valuation discount totaling $385,000 relating to the WLES Note, as defined below. We had a letter of credit outstanding at December 31, 2015 of $100,000 as collateral with respect to a front-end processing relationship with a credit card company. Additionally, on August 21, 2013 a letter of credit for $1.9 million was issued and remained outstanding at December 31, 2015 as a reserve with respect to JetPay, LLC's processing relationship with Wells Fargo Bank, N.A.\nIn order to finance a portion of the proceeds payable in the Completed Transactions, on December 28, 2012, we entered into a Note Agreement with Special Opportunities Fund, Inc., R8 Capital Partners, LLC, Bulldog Investors General Partnership, Ira Lubert, Mendota Insurance Company and American Services Insurance Company, Inc. (collectively, the Note Investors\u201d), pursuant to which we issued $10,000,000 in promissory notes secured by 50% of our ownership interest in JetPay, LLC (the Notes\u201d). In connection with the Note Agreement, we entered into separate Notes with each of the Note Investors. Amounts outstanding under the Notes accrued interest at a rate of 12% per annum. The Notes matured on December 31, 2014 and were paid with proceeds from the sale of Series A Preferred to Flexpoint on December 28, 2014.\nOn December 28, 2012, ADC and PTFS, as borrowers, entered into the Loan and Security Agreement with Metro Bank ( Metro\u201d), as the lender for a term loan with a principal amount of $9,000,000. Amounts outstanding under the loan accrue interest at a rate of 4% per annum. The loan matures on December 28, 2019 and amortizes over the course of the loan in equal monthly installments of $107,143. The principal balance of this term loan was $5.14 million at December 31, 2015. Additional principal payments may be required at the end of each fiscal year based on a free cash flow calculation at ADC as defined in the Loan and Security Agreement. The loans are guaranteed by us and are secured by all assets of ADC and PTFS, as well as a pledge by us of our ownership interest in ADC. The Loan and Security Agreement contains affirmative and negative covenants, including limitations on the incurrence of indebtedness, liens, transactions with affiliates and other customary restrictions for loans of this type and size. The borrowers are also subject to certain annual financial covenants including a debt coverage ratio and a leverage ratio during the term of the loan. We are required to provide Metro with annual financial statements within 120 days of our fiscal year end and quarterly financial statements within 60 days after the end of each fiscal quarter. We were in compliance with the covenant requirements as of December 31, 2015.\n 34 \nIn connection with the closing of the Completed Transactions, we entered into a Note and Indemnity Side Agreement with JP Merger Sub, LLC, WLES and Trent Voigt, dated as of December 28, 2012. Pursuant to the Note and Indemnity Side Agreement, we agreed to issue a promissory note in the amount of $2,331,369 in favor of WLES (the WLES Note\u201d). Interest accrues on amounts due under the WLES Note at a rate of 5% per annum. The WLES Note is due in full on December 31, 2017. The WLES Note can be prepaid in full or in part at any time without penalty. As partial consideration for offering the WLES Note, we and JP Merger Sub, LLC agreed to waive certain specified indemnity claims against WLES and Mr. Voigt to the extent the losses under such claims do not exceed $2,331,369.\nOn November 7, 2014, pursuant to a Unit Purchase Agreement by and between the Company, ACI and Michael Collester and Cathy Smith, the Company acquired all of the outstanding equity interests of JetPay Strategic Partners for an aggregate of $11.0 million in cash and the issuance of 2.0 million shares of its common stock to the unitholders of JetPay Strategic Partners with a value of approximately $3.7 million on the date of acquisition. The JetPay Strategic Partners' unitholders were entitled to receive additional cash consideration of $1.2 million which was paid on April 10, 2015 and are entitled to receive a further cash payment of $1.2 million payable on April 10, 2016, and are entitled to earn up to an additional $500,000 based on the net revenues of JetPay Strategic Partners for the twelve month periods ending October 31, 2015 and 2016. In order to finance a portion of the proceeds paid to the JetPay Strategic Partners' unitholders, JetPay Strategic Partners, as borrower, and the Company and ADC, as guarantors, entered into a Loan and Security Agreement on November 7, 2014 with Metro with a principal amount of $7.5 million. Amounts outstanding under the loan accrue interest at a rate of 5.25% per annum. The loan matures on November 6, 2021 and amortizes in equal monthly installments of $104,167 beginning in November 2015. The principal balance of this term loan was $7.29 million at December 31, 2015. Additional principal payments may be required at the end of each fiscal year based on a free cash flow calculation set forth in the Loan and Security Agreement. Additionally, in order to finance a portion of the proceeds paid to the JetPay Strategic Partners' unitholders, on November 7, 2014, the Company issued 20,000 shares of Series A Preferred to Flexpoint for an aggregate of $6.0 million.\nOn May 6, 2015, ADC and PTFS, as borrowers, along with JetPay Corporation, ACI, and JetPay, LLC, collectively as loan parties, entered into a First Amendment and Joinder Agreement to the Loan and Security Agreement dated December 28, 2012 and a Revolving Credit Note (the Revolving Note\u201d) dated May 6, 2015 with Metro, as the lender. The Note provides a $1.0 million revolving credit facility that matures on May 6, 2017 and that accrues interest at the rate of the Wall Street Journal Prime rate plus 1.00%, with a floor of 4.25%. The Note is guaranteed by the borrowers and loan parties and is secured by all assets of ADC, PTFS, and ACI, a pledge by the Company of its ownership interest in ADC and ACI, as well as a $1.0 million negative pledge on the stock of JetPay, LLC. The amended Loan and Security Agreement retains the affirmative and negative covenants included in the original December 28, 2012 loan agreement, including limitations on the incurrence of indebtedness, liens, transactions with affiliates and other customary restrictions for loans of this type and size. Certain of these affirmative and negative covenants encompass JetPay, LLC under a negative pledge obligation should the stock of JetPay, LLC be subject to a lien by a third party. On May 6, 2015, the proceeds of the $1.0 million Revolving Note, along with $650,000 of current cash and cash equivalents, were used to partially fund a $2.0 million deferred consideration liability due to the stockholders of ADC. The principal balance of this revolving note was $1.0 million at December 31, 2015.\nOn January 15, 2016, we entered into unsecured promissory notes with each of Bipin C. Shah, the Company's Chief Executive Officer, Jonathan Lubert, a Director of the Company, and Flexpoint, in the amounts of $400,000, $500,000, and $1,050,000, respectively (the Promissory Notes\u201d). Amounts outstanding under the Promissory Notes accrue interest at a rate of 12% per annum and carry a default interest rate upon the occurrence of certain events of default, including failure to make payment under the applicable Promissory Note or a sale of the Company. The notes mature on the earlier of April 14, 2016 or the occurrence of an event of a default that is not properly cured or waived. The proceeds of $1.9 million from the Promissory Notes were used as cash collateral recorded as restricted cash to replace the $1.9 million letter of credit in favor of Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. We are currently working with several financial institutions to secure a new $1.9 million letter of credit at which time the restricted cash reserves would be released to repay the Promissory Notes. There can be no assurance that a letter of credit will be obtained or obtained on reasonable terms. If a letter of credit cannot be obtained, the current Promissory Notes may need to be extended at unfavorable terms or other debt instruments may have to be pursued on unfavorable terms.\n 35 \nOur ongoing ability to comply with the debt covenants under our credit arrangements and to refinance our debt depends largely on the achievement of adequate levels of cash flow. If our future cash flows are less than expected or our debt service, including interest expense, increases more than expected, causing us to default on any of the Metro covenants in the future, we will need to obtain amendments or waivers from Metro. In the event that non-compliance with the debt covenants should occur in the future, we would pursue various alternatives in an attempt to successfully resolve the non-compliance, which might include, among other things, seeking additional debt covenant waivers or amendments or refinancing debt with other financial institutions. There can be no assurance that debt covenant waivers or amendments would be obtained, if needed, or that the debt could be refinanced with other financial institutions on favorable terms.\nAt December 28, 2012, in connection with securing certain debt financing to consummate the Completed Transactions, we incurred a total of $4,393,000 in financing costs that have been capitalized and will be amortized over the life of the related debt instruments using the effective interest method beginning in 2013. Of the total deferred financing costs, $4,370,000 related to certain of our founding stockholders agreeing to sell at cost 832,698 shares of our common stock that they acquired prior to our initial public offering to certain of the Note Investors with respect to the Notes. In accordance with SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin ( SAB\u201d) 79 amended by SAB 5T, Accounting for Expenses or Liabilities Paid by Principal Stockholder, we recorded a $4.37 million stock-based deferred financing cost with a credit to additional paid-in capital at December 28, 2012 for the fair value of the 832,698 shares transferred under this arrangement ($5.25 per share on December 28, 2012). This $4.37 million deferred financing cost was completely amortized as of December 31, 2014. Additionally, in connection with the December 2012 $9.0 million term loan, the November 2014 $7.5 million term loan, and the May 2015 Revolving Note, all payable to Metro, we incurred $23,000, $76,000, and $40,000 of deferred financing costs, respectively. Unamortized deferred financing costs were $88,000 at December 31, 2015.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nOff-balance sheet arrangements as of December 31, 2015 consisted of outstanding letters of credit issued by JetPay of $2.0 million, consisting of a $1.9 million letter of credit as a reserve with respect to JetPay, LLC's main processing bank and a $100,000 letter of credit which represents collateral with respect to a front-end processing relationship with a credit card company.\nContractual Obligations\nWe are obligated under various operating leases, primarily for office space and certain equipment related to our operations. Certain of these leases contain purchase options, renewal provisions, and contingent rentals for our proportionate share of taxes, utilities, insurance, and annual cost of living increases.\nThe following are summaries of our contractual obligations and other commercial commitments at December 31, 2015, excluding fair value and conversion option debt discounts (in thousands):\n\n\n 36 \n (1) Related interest obligations have been excluded from this maturity schedule. Our interest payments for the next twelve month period, based on current market rates, are expected to be approximately $797,000. \n (2) Outstanding letters of credit of $2.0 million represents a $1.9 million letter of credit as a reserve with respect to JetPay, LLC's main processing bank and a $100,000 letter of credit which represents collateral with respect to a front-end processing relationship with a credit card company. \nCash Flows\nOperating Activities. Net cash provided by operating activities totaled $3.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. Cash provided by operating activities in this period was primarily due to a net loss of $1.2 million, offset by non-cash amortization relating to intangible assets, deferred financing fees and debt discounts and conversion options, and depreciation and amortization expense totaling $3.9 million, and a decrease in restricted cash of $1.2 million. This increase in cash was partially offset by a decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses of $357,000, and an increase in accounts receivable of $489,000.\nNet cash used in operating activities totaled $4.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. Cash used in operating activities in this period was primarily due to a net loss of $6.9 million combined with a decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses of $3.6 million, and an increase in restricted cash of $1.3 million. This decrease in cash was partially offset by non-cash amortization relating to intangible assets, deferred financing fees and debt discounts and conversion options totaling $6.3 million.\nInvesting Activities. Cash used in investing activities totaled $8.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, is primarily due to an increase of $7.5 million in restricted cash and equivalents held to satisfy client obligations and the purchase of property and equipment of $875,000.\nCash used in investing activities totaled $19.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, is primarily due to the acquisition of ACI for $10.8 million, net of $250,000 of cash acquired, an increase of $8.3 million in restricted cash and equivalents held to satisfy client obligations, and the purchase of property and equipment of $416,000.\nFinancing Activities. Cash provided by financing activities totaled $5.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, which included an increase of $7.5 million in client fund obligations, proceeds from a revolving credit facility of $1.0 million, and $1.3 million from the sale of common stock, all partially offset by $1.6 million of cash used for payments on long-term debt and the payment of $2.85 million of deferred acquisition consideration.\nCash provided by financing activities totaled $24.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, which included $19.2 million from the sale of preferred stock, an increase of $8.3 million in client fund obligations, proceeds from notes payable of $7.5 million, and $975,000 from the sale of common stock, all partially offset by $11.3 million of cash used for payments on long-term debt.\nSeasonality\nJetPay Payment Services' revenues and earnings are impacted by the volume of consumer usage of credit and debit cards at the point of sale. For example, JetPay Payment Services experiences increased purchase activity during the first and second quarters due to seasonal volumes of some merchants in JetPay Payment Services' portfolio. Revenues during the first and second quarters tend to increase in comparison to the remaining two quarters of JetPay Payment Services' fiscal year on a same store basis.\nJetPay Strategic Partners' expects increased revenues during the second and third quarters due to seasonal volumes of certain travel and entertainment industry related merchants within JetPay Strategic Partners' portfolio.\nJetPay Payroll Services' revenues are recognized in the period services are rendered and earned. JetPay Payroll Services experiences increased revenues during the fourth and first quarters due to the processing of additional year-end tax filing requirements. Accordingly, revenues and earnings are greater in the fourth and first quarter in comparison to the remaining two quarters of JetPay Payroll Services' fiscal year.\n 37 \nEffects of Inflation\nJetPay Payroll Services' and JetPay Payment Services' monetary assets, consisting primarily of cash and receivables, are not significantly affected by inflation. Non-monetary assets, consisting primarily of property and equipment, are not affected by inflation. We believe that replacement costs of equipment, furniture and leasehold improvements will not materially affect our operations. However, the rate of inflation affects our expenses, such as those for employee compensation and other operating expenses, which may not be readily recoverable in the price of services offered by us. The rate of inflation can also affect our revenues by affecting our client's payroll processing volumes and our merchant charge volume and corresponding changes to processing revenues. While these can be positive or negative, since a portion of JetPay Payment Services' revenues are derived as a percentage of dollar volume processed, JetPay Payment Services' revenues will generally rise when inflation rises. Additionally, JetPay Payroll Services' revenues include the interest earned on the funds held for clients investment trust account balance. Trust fund earnings can fluctuate based on the amount held in the trust account as well as fluctuations in interest rates.\nSummary of Critical Accounting Policies\nCritical accounting policies are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties, and potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions. The Company's critical accounting policies are described below.\nUse of Estimates\nThe accompanying financial statements have been prepared in accordance with Accounting Principles Generally Accepted in the United States of America ( U.S. GAAP\u201d) and pursuant to the accounting and disclosure rules and regulations of the SEC. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the Company's financial statements. Such estimates include, but are not limited to, the value of purchase consideration of acquisitions; valuation of accounts receivable, reserves for chargebacks, goodwill, intangible assets, and other long-lived assets; legal contingencies; and assumptions used in the calculation of stock-based compensation and in the calculation of income taxes. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nRevenue Recognition and Deferred Revenue\nWe recognize revenue in general when the following criteria have been met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, a customer contract or purchase order exists and the fees are fixed and determinable, no significant obligations remain and collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured. Allowances for chargebacks, discounts and other allowances are estimated and recorded concurrent with the recognition of revenue and are primarily based on historic rates.\nRevenues from our credit and debit card processing operations are recognized in the period services are rendered as we process credit and debit card transactions for our merchant customers or for merchant customers of our ISO clients. The majority of our revenues within our credit and debit card processing business is comprised of transaction-based fees, which typically constitute a percentage of dollar volume processed, or a fee per transaction processed. In the case where we are only the processor of transactions, we charge transaction fees only and record these fees as revenues. In the case of merchant contracts or contracts with ISOs, VARs, ISVs and financial institutions for whom we process credit and debit card transactions for our ISOs, VARs, ISVs and financial institution merchant customers, revenues are primarily comprised of fees charged to the merchant, as well as a percentage of the processed sale transaction. Our contracts in most instances involve three parties: us, the merchant, and the sponsoring bank. Under certain of these sales arrangements, our sponsoring bank collects the gross revenue from the merchants, pays the interchange fees and assessments to the credit card associations, collects their fees and pays us a net residual payment representing our fee for the services provided. Accordingly, under these arrangements, we record the revenue net of interchange, credit card association assessments and fees and the sponsoring bank's fees. Effective June 1, 2013, a majority of our merchant contracts, ISOs, VARs, ISVs and financial institutions, and merchant customer credit and debit card transactions business was transferred to a new sponsoring bank whereby we are billed directly for certain fees by the credit card associations and the processing bank. In this instance, revenues and cost of revenues include the credit card association fees and assessments and the sponsoring bank's fees which are billed to us and for which we assume credit risk. In all instances, we recognize processing revenues net of interchange fees, which are assessed to our merchant and ISO, VAR, ISV and financial institution merchant customers on all processed transactions. Interchange rates and fees are not controlled by us. We effectively function as a clearing house collecting and remitting interchange fee settlement on behalf of issuing banks, debit networks, credit card associations and their processing customers. Additionally, our direct merchant customers have the liability for any charges properly reversed by the cardholder. In the event, however, that we are not able to collect such amount from the merchants due to merchant fraud, insolvency, bankruptcy or any other reason, we may be liable for any such reversed charges. We, in certain instances, require cash deposits, guarantees, letters of credit and other types of collateral by certain merchants to minimize any such contingent liability, and also utilize a number of systems and procedures to manage merchant risk. We have historically experienced losses due to chargebacks resulting from merchant defaults.\n 38 \nRevenues from our payroll processing operation is recognized in the period services are rendered and earned under service arrangements with clients where service fees are fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured. Certain processing services are provided under annual", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In addition to historical information, the following discussion also contains forward-looking statements that include risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including those factors set forth under Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOverview\nWe were formed on November 12, 2010 as a blank check company to serve as a vehicle to acquire through a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, plan of arrangement, recapitalization, reorganization or other similar business combination, one or more operating businesses. As previously disclosed, we completed the acquisitions of JetPay, LLC and ADC, on December 28, 2012, and ACI on November 7, 2014.\nWe are a provider of payment services - debit and credit card processing, payroll and HCM services, and prepaid card services to businesses and their employees throughout the United States. We provide these services through three wholly-owned subsidiaries: JetPay, LLC, currently doing business as JetPay Payment Services, which provides debit and credit processing and ACH payment services to businesses with a focus on those processing internet transactions and recurring billings; JetPay Strategic Partners, an independent sales organization specializing in relationships with banks, credit unions and other financial institutions; and JetPay Payroll Services, which provides HCM services, including, payroll, tax filing, time and attendance, HR services, and Affordable Care Act and related services to small and medium-sized employers. We also operate JetPay Card Services, which is focused on providing low-cost money management and payment services to unbanked and under-banked employees of our business customers.\n 27 \nOur overall business strategy is to provide payment processing services to small to large-sized businesses with a high percentage of our revenues consisting of recurring revenues with strong margins and with relatively low capital requirements. Our corporate strategy is to increase our revenues through a combination of organic growth and acquisitions. Our organic growth strategy is focused on developing and increasing our current marketing and sales staff at JetPay Payment Services, JetPay Strategic Partners and JetPay Payroll Services to penetrate new customer niches and geographic markets. Our organic growth strategy also includes cross marketing initiatives to sell credit and debit card processing services to JetPay Payroll Services' payroll customers and payroll processing services to JetPay Payment Services' credit and debit card processing customers. Additionally, we will be seeking additional debt and/or equity capital to acquire additional credit and debit card processors ISOs and/or payroll processors to integrate into our JetPay Payment Services and JetPay Payroll Services operations. Our acquisition strategy is focused on identifying small to medium-sized companies that either provide services similar to ours or services that expand our product and service offerings and/or our geographic reach. Both our JetPay Payment Services and our JetPay Payroll Services operations have significant under-utilized processing capacity, which can be leveraged to create additional processing revenues without significant cost increases. We also plan to introduce new products, including through JetPay Card Services, which provides low-cost financial tools to both un-banked and under-banked consumers. Our overall strategy also includes looking for cost synergies as we continue to integrate the JetPay Payment Services, JetPay Strategic Partners and JetPay Payroll Services operations in such areas as insurance costs, banking costs, employee benefit costs, and other selling, general and administrative cost as well as operating cost areas.\nJetPay Payment Processing Segment - JetPay Payment Services and JetPay Strategic Partners\nRevenues\nJetPay Payment Services' and JetPay Strategic Partners' revenues fall into two categories: transaction processing revenues and merchant discount revenues. As such, our two primary drivers are the number of transactions and merchant dollar volume. A third measure related to merchant dollar volume, for those merchants where we charge a percentage of the sale amount, is the average size of the transaction, as costs for processing the transaction tend to be fixed, so that the higher the average ticket, the more revenue we earn for a fixed cost. JetPay's discount revenues are generally a fixed percentage of the merchant's dollar volume, with interchange and other third-party fees passed through to the merchant without markup. Our billings to merchants primarily consist of these transaction fees and discount fees, as well as pass-through fees for other miscellaneous services, such as handling chargebacks. Interchange costs are set by the card networks, and are paid directly by the sponsoring bank to the credit card associations based upon a percentage of transaction amounts and/or a fixed price per transaction. JetPay Payment Services refers to the ratio of processing revenues to the dollar amount of card transactions processed as the margin.\u201d If margin increases, processing revenues will tend to increase accordingly. Further, both the number of merchants who process transactions, and the average dollar amount of transactions processed per merchant, will impact the total transaction volume and thus the total processing revenues. As such, growth in JetPay's merchant count and/or growth in the same store transaction volume will also drive JetPay's processing revenue growth.\nExpenses\nThe most significant components of operating expenses are credit card association fees and assessments; residual payments to ISOs / VARs / ISVs and financial institutions; and salaries and other employment costs. Salaries and other employment costs are largely fixed in nature, increasing slightly with the growth in numbers of customers, but tending to grow with inflation. Credit card fees and assessments and bank sponsorship costs are generally a percentage of card volume. Bank sponsorship costs are largely based upon transaction counts and volumes. Selling, general and administrative expenses include stable costs such as occupancy and office costs, outside services, and depreciation and amortization expense, which is recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the assets. Cost of processing revenues also includes chargeback losses, which vary over the long term based upon transaction volume processed by JetPay's merchants, but can vary from period to period depending upon specific events in that period. JetPay Payment Services has and will continue to experience higher than normal professional fees due to the Direct Air matter.\n 28 \nMerchant Attrition\nMerchant attrition is a normal part of the merchant processing industry in the ordinary course of business. JetPay Payment Services does not experience attrition in the same form as most of its competitors. Most of JetPay Payment Services' competitors have large portfolios of small businesses and these businesses change their payments provider quickly and for many reasons. JetPay Payment Services' portfolio is made up of small to large businesses and they are more cautious in making changes to payment providers, and therefore, its portfolio does not change as often. However, because of the volume that each of these merchants produce, when one leaves it may have a significant impact on operating results. In addition, JetPay Payment Services does service several ISOs and financial institutions, such that while our volatility in the change of number of merchants remains significant, we experience far less volatility in revenues. As a result, JetPay Payment Services monitors its customer losses for both numbers of merchants as well as merchant processing revenues. For the year ended December 31, 2015, in our traditional business, JetPay Payment Services' customer attrition was approximately 25.7%, or an approximate 2,536 merchant reduction from approximately 9,850 merchants existing at December 31, 2014. This reduction in merchants included one particular ISO customer whose attrition rate is high due to the nature of its business. This reduction was offset by the addition of approximately 2,481, or approximately 25.2%, new merchants, resulting in a net merchant decline rate of approximately 0.5%. With respect to processing revenues, the lost merchants in 2015 represented a loss of approximately $3.2 million of annualized revenues, or approximately 12.6% of JetPay Payment Services' 2014 revenues of approximately $25.4 million. The new merchants that JetPay Payment Services added in 2015 contributed to a net increase in processing revenues in 2015 of approximately $3.1 million or 12.3% of 2014 revenues.\nMarkets\nJetPay Payment Services and JetPay Strategic Partners have defined four distinct markets in which they operate -Card-Not-Present / Recurring Payments; VARs, ISVs, and ISO's; financial institutions and associations; and small businesses through cross-sell. For Small Businesses and financial institutions, JetPay Payment Services is the traditional provider of merchant services to businesses, and holds the contracts. With regards to the other two markets, JetPay Payment Services operates in two forms: 1) as a processor only where JetPay Payment Services recognizes revenue from the authorization, clearing, and settlement functions and does not participate in the discount revenue or risk of the merchant; and 2) in a shared relationship, where JetPay Payment Services either owns the merchant contract outright or shares in the discount revenue of the merchant with an agent or ISO, and may assume or share risk. This market has experienced strong growth since 2013 and JetPay Payment Services expects to significantly increase this revenue area as the operations group solidifies the product offering and execution. Our expansion in 2014 and 2015 was negatively affected by management's time being diverted to dealing with the Direct Air issue described in Part I, Item 3. Legal Proceedings, as well as efforts devoted to our acquisition and integration of JetPay Payment Services and JetPay Strategic Partners. Sales and marketing began targeting new customers and customer segments in 2014 and 2015 and we anticipate such efforts will lead to continued revenue growth in 2016 and future years.\nJetPay HR and Payroll Segment - JetPay Payroll Services\nRevenues\nThe majority of revenues from JetPay Payroll Services is derived from its payroll processing operations, which includes the calculation, preparation, collection and delivery of employer payroll obligations and the production of internal accounting records and management reports, and from services provided for the preparation of federal, state, and local payroll tax returns, including the collection and remittance of clients' payroll tax obligations. JetPay Payroll Services experiences increased revenues in the fourth and first calendar quarters due to additional employer annual tax filing requirements. Payroll Tax Filing Services ( PTFS\u201d) trust account earnings represent the interest earned on the funds held for clients trust balance. Trust fund earnings can fluctuate based on the amount held in the trust account as well as fluctuations in interest rates. Over the past two years, JetPay Payroll Services has seen a significant increase in revenue from its human capital management, Affordable Care Act and time and attendance services.\nExpenses\nJetPay Payroll Services' most significant cost of processing revenues is its payroll and related expenses, costs of third party service providers, and facility overhead costs. These costs are largely fixed in nature, increasing slightly with the growth in numbers of customers and payrolls processed, but tending to grow with inflation. JetPay Payroll Services' selling, general, and administrative expenses include the costs of the administrative and sales staff, payroll delivery costs, outside services, rent, office expense, insurance, sales and marketing costs and professional services costs.\n 29 \nCustomer Attrition\nCustomer attrition is a normal part of the payroll processing industry in the ordinary course of business. JetPay Payroll Services' attrition generally comes in three forms - closure of a business, acquisition of a business wherein the payroll is transferred to the buyer, and competition. As a result, JetPay Payroll Services monitors its customer losses for both numbers of customers as well as customer revenues. For the year ended December 31, 2015, JetPay HR and Payroll Segment customer attrition was approximately 8.7%, or an approximate 439 customer reduction from approximately 5,075 customers existing at December 31, 2014. This reduction was offset by the addition of approximately 479 new customers, or approximately 9.4% over the 5,075 customers existing at December 31, 2014, resulting in a net customer growth rate of approximately 0.7%. With respect to payroll processing revenues, the lost customers in 2015 represented a loss of approximately $1.1 million of annualized revenues, or approximately 7.7% of JetPay Payroll Services' 2014 processing revenues of approximately $13.6 million. The new customers that JetPay added in 2015 contributed to a net increase in processing revenues in 2015 of approximately $1.0 million or 7.1% of 2014 revenues..\nResults of Operations for the Year

December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Overall revenues increased $9.9 million, or 29.5%, in 2015 as compared to 2014. Of the $43.3 million of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2015, $14.7 million, or 33.9%, was generated from our JetPay HR and Payroll Segment and $28.6 million, or 66.1%, from our JetPay Payment Processing Segment. Of the $33.4 million of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2014, $13.7 million, or 41.1%, was generated from our JetPay HR and Payroll Segment and $19.7 million, or 58.9%, from our JetPay Payment Processing Segment.\nJetPay Payment Processing Segment's revenues increased $8.9 million, or 45.1%, for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to 2014. This increase included incremental revenues of $6.3 million related to JetPay Strategic Partners, which we acquired on November 7, 2014. Excluding the increase in JetPay Strategic Partners' revenues, our Texas-based JetPay Payment Services operation's revenues increased $2.6 million, or 13.0%, in 2015 as compared to 2014. The most significant changes within our Texas based JetPay Payment Services' operations were an increase of $1.7 million, or 20.8%, in our Third Party business and an increase of $982,000, or 11.6%, in direct merchant services revenues, with these increases resulting from our investment in professional sales staff and marketing initiatives. These gains were partially offset by a decrease of $223,000, or 10.2%, in our processing and clearing business.\nJetPay HR and Payroll Segment's revenues increased $952,000, or 6.9%, for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to 2014. This increase was attributable to net growth in volume of payroll and related payroll taxes processed in addition to revenues generated from several new HR related services, including Affordable Care Act, time and labor management, and other HR services, introduced in late 2014. Growth in our new HR related services was approximately $594,000, or 62.4% of our JetPay HR and Payroll Segment's revenue growth in 2015.\nCost of Processing Revenues\nCost of revenues were $26.2 million, or 60.5% of revenues, and $20.0 million, or 59.8% of revenues, for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Of the $26.2 million of cost of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2015, $7.3 million, or 27.9%, related to our HR and Payroll Segment and $18.8 million, or 72.1%, related to our Payment Processing Segment. Of the $20.0 million of cost of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2014, $7.2 million, or 36.0%, related to our HR and Payroll Segment and $12.7 million, or 64.0%, related to our Payment Processing Segment.\n 31 \nThe cost of processing revenues within our Payment Processing Segment increased from $12.7 million, or 64.6% of revenues in 2014 to $18.8 million, or 65.7% of revenues in 2015, an increase of $6.1 million, or 47.6%. The increase in cost of processing revenues related to the growth in our Payment Processing Segment revenues, including an increase of $3.4 million of cost of processing revenues related to the JetPay Strategic Services acquisition on November 7, 2014. Overall gross profit margin as reported within our Payment Processing Segment decreased slightly from 35.4% in 2014 to 34.3% in 2015 largely as a result of an increase in Third Party commissions to ISOs, VARs, and ISVs of $856,000 related to the previously noted increase in Third Party revenues combined with the investments made in technology professionals since December 31, 2014.\nThe cost of processing revenues within our HR and Payroll Segment increased $120,000, a slight decrease as a percentage of revenues from 52.4% in 2014 to 49.8% in 2015 despite an increase in technology and customer service professionals as well as an investment in new product management. The effect of this decrease in cost of processing revenues as a percentage of revenues was an increase in gross profit margin within our HR and Payroll Segment from 47.6% in 2014 to 50.2% in 2015 as we leveraged the increase in revenues over the relatively fixed costs of our operating platforms.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nSelling, general and administrative ( SG&A\u201d) expenses were $13.3 million, or 30.7% of revenues, for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to $12.1 million, or 36.3% of revenues, for the same period in 2014.\nSG&A expenses within our Payment Processing Segment increased from $5.2 million or 26.6% of revenues in 2014, to $6.9 million, or 24.0% of revenues in 2015. This increase was largely the result of an increase in sales staff, an increase in marketing, tradeshows and advertising costs of $98,000, an increase in SG&A expenses related to JetPay Strategic Partners of $741,000 acquired in November 2014, and an increase in legal fees and related settlement costs of approximately $563,000 as the Company continued to work to resolve the legal matters described below in Part I, Item 3. Legal Proceedings. Additionally, the results for the year ended December 31, 2014 included a $460,000 charge related to a legal settlement and a $237,000 loss on the disposal of a fixed asset.\nSG&A expenses within our HR and Payroll Segment increased from $4.1 million in 2014 to $4.8 million in 2015, an increase of approximately $628,000, or 15.1%, largely due to an increase in payroll costs as additional sales and technology professionals were added to help develop and market new products and services, including the expansion of the HR services we provide to our customers.\nAdditionally, we incurred corporate SG&A expenses of $1.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, including the benefit of $1.43 million of management fees received from the Company's operating subsidiaries as compared to corporate SG&A expenses of $2.8 million in 2014, including $900,000 of management fees received from the operating subsidiaries. Corporate SG&A expenses include, but are not limited to, the salaries of our executive officers, outside professional fees, investor relations and other public company costs, and general corporate operating expenses. Corporate SG&A expenses for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 also included $236,000 and $503,000, respectively, of start-up expenses relating to our Card Services operations. SG&A expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015 included non-cash stock-based compensation expense of $278,000 as compared to $356,000 in 2014. The SG&A expenses of our HR and Payroll Segment include $350,000 of corporate-allocated costs for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, and the SG&A expenses of our Payment Processing Segment include $1.08 million and $550,000 of corporate-allocated costs in 2015 and 2014, respectively, with an offsetting reduction in Corporate SG&A expenses of $1.43 million and $900,000 for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nDepreciation and amortization totaled $3.6 million and $2.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The increase in depreciation and amortization expense in 2015 as compared to 2014 was primarily related to the amortization of the ACI intangible assets acquired on November 7, 2014.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 was $819,000 and $1.7 million, respectively. The reduction in interest expense in 2015 was primarily related to the pay-off of the $10.0 million convertible secured notes in December 2014, partially offset by interest expense relating to the Metro Bank term loan entered into on November 7, 2014 in connection with the ACI acquisition and the $1.0 million revolving note payable entered into with Metro Bank on May 6, 2015.\n 32 \nIncome Taxes\nThe Company recorded income tax expense of $197,000 and $222,000 for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Income tax expense reflects the recording of state income taxes. The effective tax rates were approximately (19.7)% and (3.3)% for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The effective rate differs from the federal statutory rate for each year, primarily due to state and local income taxes and changes to the valuation allowance.\nAnalysis of Impairment\nThe Company conducts its annual goodwill impairment testing as of December 31 of each year or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist. We performed extensive valuation analyses, utilizing both income and market approaches, in our goodwill assessment process for our two identified reporting units that contained goodwill, JetPay Payment Processing and JetPay HR and Payroll reporting segments.\nIn our income approach, we utilized a discounted cash flow analysis for each of our previously identified reporting units using discount rates of 18.0% and 16.5% for our JetPay Payment Processing and JetPay HR and Payroll reporting segments, respectively, which represent the estimated weighted average cost of capital. These discount rates reflect the overall level of inherent risk involved in our reporting units and the rate of return an outside investor would expect to earn. In our discounted cash flow ( DCF\u201d) analysis, we prepared a five year forecast of our expected earnings to derive an expected stream of free cash flow through December 31, 2020. To estimate cash flows beyond the final year of our forecast, we used a terminal value approach. Under this approach, we estimated operating income before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization in the final year of our model, adjusted to estimate a normalized cash flow, applied a perpetuity growth assumption and discounted by a perpetuity discount factor to determine the terminal value. We incorporated the present value of the resulting terminal value into our estimate of fair value. In developing our forecasts of revenues and direct variable operating expenses, we utilized a variety of factors including our current and anticipated sales pipelines of prospects currently known to us, as well as those which we believe will be generated through current and future relationships with merchants, agent banks and ISOs. We also applied our knowledge of the industries, general economic conditions, and the forecast of industry experts regarding consumers' continued trending towards expanded use of electronic payment methods. Our operating expenses are either variable with revenues, or fixed and predictable; however, we increased our future costs based on expected inflation and the need to expand personnel costs as we achieve projected future revenue levels. In performing our DCF analysis, we multiplied our estimated cash flows by a marginal federal and state tax rate of 40% to derive our after-tax cash flows, and we utilized weighted average costs of capital of 18.0% and 16.5% for our JetPay Payment Processing reporting segment and JetPay HR and Payroll reporting segment analysis, respectively. In addition to the income approach, we also used several market-based approaches to corroborate the results of the income approach described above; including comparing our company's various earnings and performance indicators to those of similar publically traded companies, comparisons to prior purchase and sales transactions of similar reporting units by companies, and a comparison to recent mergers and acquisitions of guideline companies.\nWith respect to our assessment of goodwill impairment for our JetPay Payment Processing reporting segment, as of December 31, 2015, we determined that there was no impairment in that the fair value for this reporting unit was $61.0 million which exceeded the carrying value of net assets by $14.1 million, or 30.0%. With respect to our assessment of goodwill impairment for our JetPay HR and Payroll reporting segment, as of December 31, 2015, we determined that there was no impairment in that the fair value for this reporting unit was $33.6 million which exceeded the carrying value of net assets by $8.2 million, or 32.3%. Events or circumstances that could have a negative effect on estimated fair value of our reporting units in the future include, but are not limited to, a loss of customers due to competition, pressure from our customers to reduce pricing, inability to continue to employ a competent workforce at current rates of pay, changes in government regulations, and accelerating costs beyond management's control.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nCash and cash equivalents were $5.6 million at December 31, 2015, excluding $226,000 of cash deposited into restricted cash accounts. Cash and cash equivalents also excludes $4.4 million of cash reserves, or the Merrick Cash Reserve\u201d, held by Merrick, JetPay Payment Services' former sponsor bank, which is specifically related to the Direct Air matter. The Merrick Cash Reserve of $4.4 million at both December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, is recorded as non-current assets under the caption Other Assets\u201d. While we continue to defend the potential obligation related to the chargeback claims there can be no assurance as to the timing of the release of this cash reserve. See also Part I, Item 3. Legal Proceedings. The ratio of our total debt to total capitalization, which consists of total debt, convertible preferred stock, and stockholders' equity, was 23% at both December 31, 2015 and 2014. As of December 31, 2015, we had a working capital deficit, excluding funds held for clients and client funds obligations, of approximately $3.2 million.\n 33 \nWe expect to fund our cash needs, including capital required for acquisitions, with cash flow from our operating activities, equity investments and borrowings. Additionally, we will require approximately $4.2 million to cover our interest and principal payments on our existing debt for the twelve months ending December 31, 2016, and $1.2 million of deferred consideration due to the unitholders of ACI on April 10, 2016. As previously disclosed, on October 11, 2013, we were successful in selling an initial 33,333 shares of Series A Preferred to Flexpoint for an aggregate of $10 million, less certain costs, an additional 4,667 shares of Series A Preferred on April 14, 2014 for $1.4 million, 20,000 shares on November 7, 2014 for $6.0 million, and 33,333 shares on December 28, 2014 for $10.0 million. We have an agreement to potentially sell up to an additional $12.6 million of Series A Preferred to Flexpoint. Additionally, the Company sold 6,165 shares of Series A-1 Preferred to Wellington for an aggregate of $1.85 million, and it has an agreement to potentially sell an additional $850,000 of Series A-1 Preferred to Wellington. This additional $13.45 million of convertible preferred stock, if sold, will be used principally as consideration for future acquisitions. Additionally, from December 22, 2015 to January 22, 2016, the Company sold to certain accredited investors, including Bipin C. Shah, Robert B. Palmer, and Jonathan M. Lubert, an aggregate of 517,037 shares of the Company's common stock at a purchase price of $2.70 per share for aggregate consideration of $1,396,000, prior to issuance costs. If the Company is unable to raise additional capital through additional equity investments or borrowing, it may need to limit its level of capital expenditures and future growth plans.\nCapital expenditures were $1.3 million and $614,000 for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. We currently estimate capital expenditures for all of our ongoing operations, including JetPay Payment Services and JetPay Payroll Services, at approximately $2 million to $2.8 million for 2016, principally related to technology improvements. Our capital requirements include working capital for daily operations, including expenditures to maintain our technology platforms. Our operations currently generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our current operating needs and our routine debt service requirements.\nIn the past, we have been successful in obtaining financing by obtaining loans and equity investments, including the Series A Preferred investment by Flexpoint and the Series A-1 Preferred investment by Wellington. To fund and integrate future acquisitions or expand our technology platforms for new business initiatives, we will need to raise additional capital through loans, sale of Series A Preferred or Series A-1 Preferred, or additional equity investments. In addition, we continue to investigate the capital markets for sources of funding, which could take the form of additional debt or equity financing. We cannot provide any assurance that we will be successful in securing new financing or that we will secure such future financing with commercially acceptable terms. If we are unable to raise additional capital, we may need to limit our acquisition growth plans or delay certain technology improvements.\nDebt Capitalization and Other Financing Arrangements\nAt December 31, 2015, we had borrowings of approximately $16.7 million net of an unamortized valuation discount totaling $385,000 relating to the WLES Note, as defined below. We had a letter of credit outstanding at December 31, 2015 of $100,000 as collateral with respect to a front-end processing relationship with a credit card company. Additionally, on August 21, 2013 a letter of credit for $1.9 million was issued and remained outstanding at December 31, 2015 as a reserve with respect to JetPay, LLC's processing relationship with Wells Fargo Bank, N.A.\nIn order to finance a portion of the proceeds payable in the Completed Transactions, on December 28, 2012, we entered into a Note Agreement with Special Opportunities Fund, Inc., R8 Capital Partners, LLC, Bulldog Investors General Partnership, Ira Lubert, Mendota Insurance Company and American Services Insurance Company, Inc. (collectively, the Note Investors\u201d), pursuant to which we issued $10,000,000 in promissory notes secured by 50% of our ownership interest in JetPay, LLC (the Notes\u201d). In connection with the Note Agreement, we entered into separate Notes with each of the Note Investors. Amounts outstanding under the Notes accrued interest at a rate of 12% per annum. The Notes matured on December 31, 2014 and were paid with proceeds from the sale of Series A Preferred to Flexpoint on December 28, 2014.\nOn December 28, 2012, ADC and PTFS, as borrowers, entered into the Loan and Security Agreement with Metro Bank ( Metro\u201d), as the lender for a term loan with a principal amount of $9,000,000. Amounts outstanding under the loan accrue interest at a rate of 4% per annum. The loan matures on December 28, 2019 and amortizes over the course of the loan in equal monthly installments of $107,143. The principal balance of this term loan was $5.14 million at December 31, 2015. Additional principal payments may be required at the end of each fiscal year based on a free cash flow calculation at ADC as defined in the Loan and Security Agreement. The loans are guaranteed by us and are secured by all assets of ADC and PTFS, as well as a pledge by us of our ownership interest in ADC. The Loan and Security Agreement contains affirmative and negative covenants, including limitations on the incurrence of indebtedness, liens, transactions with affiliates and other customary restrictions for loans of this type and size. The borrowers are also subject to certain annual financial covenants including a debt coverage ratio and a leverage ratio during the term of the loan. We are required to provide Metro with annual financial statements within 120 days of our fiscal year end and quarterly financial statements within 60 days after the end of each fiscal quarter. We were in compliance with the covenant requirements as of December 31, 2015.\n 34 \nIn connection with the closing of the Completed Transactions, we entered into a Note and Indemnity Side Agreement with JP Merger Sub, LLC, WLES and Trent Voigt, dated as of December 28, 2012. Pursuant to the Note and Indemnity Side Agreement, we agreed to issue a promissory note in the amount of $2,331,369 in favor of WLES (the WLES Note\u201d). Interest accrues on amounts due under the WLES Note at a rate of 5% per annum. The WLES Note is due in full on December 31, 2017. The WLES Note can be prepaid in full or in part at any time without penalty. As partial consideration for offering the WLES Note, we and JP Merger Sub, LLC agreed to waive certain specified indemnity claims against WLES and Mr. Voigt to the extent the losses under such claims do not exceed $2,331,369.\nOn November 7, 2014, pursuant to a Unit Purchase Agreement by and between the Company, ACI and Michael Collester and Cathy Smith, the Company acquired all of the outstanding equity interests of JetPay Strategic Partners for an aggregate of $11.0 million in cash and the issuance of 2.0 million shares of its common stock to the unitholders of JetPay Strategic Partners with a value of approximately $3.7 million on the date of acquisition. The JetPay Strategic Partners' unitholders were entitled to receive additional cash consideration of $1.2 million which was paid on April 10, 2015 and are entitled to receive a further cash payment of $1.2 million payable on April 10, 2016, and are entitled to earn up to an additional $500,000 based on the net revenues of JetPay Strategic Partners for the twelve month periods ending October 31, 2015 and 2016. In order to finance a portion of the proceeds paid to the JetPay Strategic Partners' unitholders, JetPay Strategic Partners, as borrower, and the Company and ADC, as guarantors, entered into a Loan and Security Agreement on November 7, 2014 with Metro with a principal amount of $7.5 million. Amounts outstanding under the loan accrue interest at a rate of 5.25% per annum. The loan matures on November 6, 2021 and amortizes in equal monthly installments of $104,167 beginning in November 2015. The principal balance of this term loan was $7.29 million at December 31, 2015. Additional principal payments may be required at the end of each fiscal year based on a free cash flow calculation set forth in the Loan and Security Agreement. Additionally, in order to finance a portion of the proceeds paid to the JetPay Strategic Partners' unitholders, on November 7, 2014, the Company issued 20,000 shares of Series A Preferred to Flexpoint for an aggregate of $6.0 million.\nOn May 6, 2015, ADC and PTFS, as borrowers, along with JetPay Corporation, ACI, and JetPay, LLC, collectively as loan parties, entered into a First Amendment and Joinder Agreement to the Loan and Security Agreement dated December 28, 2012 and a Revolving Credit Note (the Revolving Note\u201d) dated May 6, 2015 with Metro, as the lender. The Note provides a $1.0 million revolving credit facility that matures on May 6, 2017 and that accrues interest at the rate of the Wall Street Journal Prime rate plus 1.00%, with a floor of 4.25%. The Note is guaranteed by the borrowers and loan parties and is secured by all assets of ADC, PTFS, and ACI, a pledge by the Company of its ownership interest in ADC and ACI, as well as a $1.0 million negative pledge on the stock of JetPay, LLC. The amended Loan and Security Agreement retains the affirmative and negative covenants included in the original December 28, 2012 loan agreement, including limitations on the incurrence of indebtedness, liens, transactions with affiliates and other customary restrictions for loans of this type and size. Certain of these affirmative and negative covenants encompass JetPay, LLC under a negative pledge obligation should the stock of JetPay, LLC be subject to a lien by a third party. On May 6, 2015, the proceeds of the $1.0 million Revolving Note, along with $650,000 of current cash and cash equivalents, were used to partially fund a $2.0 million deferred consideration liability due to the stockholders of ADC. The principal balance of this revolving note was $1.0 million at December 31, 2015.\nOn January 15, 2016, we entered into unsecured promissory notes with each of Bipin C. Shah, the Company's Chief Executive Officer, Jonathan Lubert, a Director of the Company, and Flexpoint, in the amounts of $400,000, $500,000, and $1,050,000, respectively (the Promissory Notes\u201d). Amounts outstanding under the Promissory Notes accrue interest at a rate of 12% per annum and carry a default interest rate upon the occurrence of certain events of default, including failure to make payment under the applicable Promissory Note or a sale of the Company. The notes mature on the earlier of April 14, 2016 or the occurrence of an event of a default that is not properly cured or waived. The proceeds of $1.9 million from the Promissory Notes were used as cash collateral recorded as restricted cash to replace the $1.9 million letter of credit in favor of Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. We are currently working with several financial institutions to secure a new $1.9 million letter of credit at which time the restricted cash reserves would be released to repay the Promissory Notes. There can be no assurance that a letter of credit will be obtained or obtained on reasonable terms. If a letter of credit cannot be obtained, the current Promissory Notes may need to be extended at unfavorable terms or other debt instruments may have to be pursued on unfavorable terms.\n 35 \nOur ongoing ability to comply with the debt covenants under our credit arrangements and to refinance our debt depends largely on the achievement of adequate levels of cash flow. If our future cash flows are less than expected or our debt service, including interest expense, increases more than expected, causing us to default on any of the Metro covenants in the future, we will need to obtain amendments or waivers from Metro. In the event that non-compliance with the debt covenants should occur in the future, we would pursue various alternatives in an attempt to successfully resolve the non-compliance, which might include, among other things, seeking additional debt covenant waivers or amendments or refinancing debt with other financial institutions. There can be no assurance that debt covenant waivers or amendments would be obtained, if needed, or that the debt could be refinanced with other financial institutions on favorable terms.\nAt December 28, 2012, in connection with securing certain debt financing to consummate the Completed Transactions, we incurred a total of $4,393,000 in financing costs that have been capitalized and will be amortized over the life of the related debt instruments using the effective interest method beginning in 2013. Of the total deferred financing costs, $4,370,000 related to certain of our founding stockholders agreeing to sell at cost 832,698 shares of our common stock that they acquired prior to our initial public offering to certain of the Note Investors with respect to the Notes. In accordance with SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin ( SAB\u201d) 79 amended by SAB 5T, Accounting for Expenses or Liabilities Paid by Principal Stockholder, we recorded a $4.37 million stock-based deferred financing cost with a credit to additional paid-in capital at December 28, 2012 for the fair value of the 832,698 shares transferred under this arrangement ($5.25 per share on December 28, 2012). This $4.37 million deferred financing cost was completely amortized as of December 31, 2014. Additionally, in connection with the December 2012 $9.0 million term loan, the November 2014 $7.5 million term loan, and the May 2015 Revolving Note, all payable to Metro, we incurred $23,000, $76,000, and $40,000 of deferred financing costs, respectively. Unamortized deferred financing costs were $88,000 at December 31, 2015.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nOff-balance sheet arrangements as of December 31, 2015 consisted of outstanding letters of credit issued by JetPay of $2.0 million, consisting of a $1.9 million letter of credit as a reserve with respect to JetPay, LLC's main processing bank and a $100,000 letter of credit which represents collateral with respect to a front-end processing relationship with a credit card company.\nContractual Obligations\nWe are obligated under various operating leases, primarily for office space and certain equipment related to our operations. Certain of these leases contain purchase options, renewal provisions, and contingent rentals for our proportionate share of taxes, utilities, insurance, and annual cost of living increases.\nThe following are summaries of our contractual obligations and other commercial commitments at December 31, 2015, excluding fair value and conversion option debt discounts (in thousands):\nTable 111: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Payments Due By Period </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Contractual obligations (1) </td> <td> </td> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Less than\nOne Year </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>One to Three\nYears </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Three to Five\nYears </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>More than\n5 years </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Long-term debt, notes payable and capital lease obligation (1) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>17,082 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,411 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>8,847 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,782 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,042 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Minimum operating lease payments </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>845 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>490 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>354 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>17,927 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,901 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>9,201 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,783 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,042 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 112: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Amounts Expiring Per Period </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Other Commercial Commitments </td> <td> </td> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Less than\nOne Year </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>One to Three\nYears </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Three to Five\nYears </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>More than\n5 years </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Standby letters of credit (2) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n 36 \n (1) Related interest obligations have been excluded from this maturity schedule. Our interest payments for the next twelve month period, based on current market rates, are expected to be approximately $797,000. \n (2) Outstanding letters of credit of $2.0 million represents a $1.9 million letter of credit as a reserve with respect to JetPay, LLC's main processing bank and a $100,000 letter of credit which represents collateral with respect to a front-end processing relationship with a credit card company. \nCash Flows\nOperating Activities. Net cash provided by operating activities totaled $3.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. Cash provided by operating activities in this period was primarily due to a net loss of $1.2 million, offset by non-cash amortization relating to intangible assets, deferred financing fees and debt discounts and conversion options, and depreciation and amortization expense totaling $3.9 million, and a decrease in restricted cash of $1.2 million. This increase in cash was partially offset by a decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses of $357,000, and an increase in accounts receivable of $489,000.\nNet cash used in operating activities totaled $4.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. Cash used in operating activities in this period was primarily due to a net loss of $6.9 million combined with a decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses of $3.6 million, and an increase in restricted cash of $1.3 million. This decrease in cash was partially offset by non-cash amortization relating to intangible assets, deferred financing fees and debt discounts and conversion options totaling $6.3 million.\nInvesting Activities. Cash used in investing activities totaled $8.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, is primarily due to an increase of $7.5 million in restricted cash and equivalents held to satisfy client obligations and the purchase of property and equipment of $875,000.\nCash used in investing activities totaled $19.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, is primarily due to the acquisition of ACI for $10.8 million, net of $250,000 of cash acquired, an increase of $8.3 million in restricted cash and equivalents held to satisfy client obligations, and the purchase of property and equipment of $416,000.\nFinancing Activities. Cash provided by financing activities totaled $5.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, which included an increase of $7.5 million in client fund obligations, proceeds from a revolving credit facility of $1.0 million, and $1.3 million from the sale of common stock, all partially offset by $1.6 million of cash used for payments on long-term debt and the payment of $2.85 million of deferred acquisition consideration.\nCash provided by financing activities totaled $24.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, which included $19.2 million from the sale of preferred stock, an increase of $8.3 million in client fund obligations, proceeds from notes payable of $7.5 million, and $975,000 from the sale of common stock, all partially offset by $11.3 million of cash used for payments on long-term debt.\nSeasonality\nJetPay Payment Services' revenues and earnings are impacted by the volume of consumer usage of credit and debit cards at the point of sale. For example, JetPay Payment Services experiences increased purchase activity during the first and second quarters due to seasonal volumes of some merchants in JetPay Payment Services' portfolio. Revenues during the first and second quarters tend to increase in comparison to the remaining two quarters of JetPay Payment Services' fiscal year on a same store basis.\nJetPay Strategic Partners' expects increased revenues during the second and third quarters due to seasonal volumes of certain travel and entertainment industry related merchants within JetPay Strategic Partners' portfolio.\nJetPay Payroll Services' revenues are recognized in the period services are rendered and earned. JetPay Payroll Services experiences increased revenues during the fourth and first quarters due to the processing of additional year-end tax filing requirements. Accordingly, revenues and earnings are greater in the fourth and first quarter in comparison to the remaining two quarters of JetPay Payroll Services' fiscal year.\n 37 \nEffects of Inflation\nJetPay Payroll Services' and JetPay Payment Services' monetary assets, consisting primarily of cash and receivables, are not significantly affected by inflation. Non-monetary assets, consisting primarily of property and equipment, are not affected by inflation. We believe that replacement costs of equipment, furniture and leasehold improvements will not materially affect our operations. However, the rate of inflation affects our expenses, such as those for employee compensation and other operating expenses, which may not be readily recoverable in the price of services offered by us. The rate of inflation can also affect our revenues by affecting our client's payroll processing volumes and our merchant charge volume and corresponding changes to processing revenues. While these can be positive or negative, since a portion of JetPay Payment Services' revenues are derived as a percentage of dollar volume processed, JetPay Payment Services' revenues will generally rise when inflation rises. Additionally, JetPay Payroll Services' revenues include the interest earned on the funds held for clients investment trust account balance. Trust fund earnings can fluctuate based on the amount held in the trust account as well as fluctuations in interest rates.\nSummary of Critical Accounting Policies\nCritical accounting policies are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties, and potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions. The Company's critical accounting policies are described below.\nUse of Estimates\nThe accompanying financial statements have been prepared in accordance with Accounting Principles Generally Accepted in the United States of America ( U.S. GAAP\u201d) and pursuant to the accounting and disclosure rules and regulations of the SEC. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the Company's financial statements. Such estimates include, but are not limited to, the value of purchase consideration of acquisitions; valuation of accounts receivable, reserves for chargebacks, goodwill, intangible assets, and other long-lived assets; legal contingencies; and assumptions used in the calculation of stock-based compensation and in the calculation of income taxes. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nRevenue Recognition and Deferred Revenue\nWe recognize revenue in general when the following criteria have been met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, a customer contract or purchase order exists and the fees are fixed and determinable, no significant obligations remain and collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured. Allowances for chargebacks, discounts and other allowances are estimated and recorded concurrent with the recognition of revenue and are primarily based on historic rates.\nRevenues from our credit and debit card processing operations are recognized in the period services are rendered as we process credit and debit card transactions for our merchant customers or for merchant customers of our ISO clients. The majority of our revenues within our credit and debit card processing business is comprised of transaction-based fees, which typically constitute a percentage of dollar volume processed, or a fee per transaction processed. In the case where we are only the processor of transactions, we charge transaction fees only and record these fees as revenues. In the case of merchant contracts or contracts with ISOs, VARs, ISVs and financial institutions for whom we process credit and debit card transactions for our ISOs, VARs, ISVs and financial institution merchant customers, revenues are primarily comprised of fees charged to the merchant, as well as a percentage of the processed sale transaction. Our contracts in most instances involve three parties: us, the merchant, and the sponsoring bank. Under certain of these sales arrangements, our sponsoring bank collects the gross revenue from the merchants, pays the interchange fees and assessments to the credit card associations, collects their fees and pays us a net residual payment representing our fee for the services provided. Accordingly, under these arrangements, we record the revenue net of interchange, credit card association assessments and fees and the sponsoring bank's fees. Effective June 1, 2013, a majority of our merchant contracts, ISOs, VARs, ISVs and financial institutions, and merchant customer credit and debit card transactions business was transferred to a new sponsoring bank whereby we are billed directly for certain fees by the credit card associations and the processing bank. In this instance, revenues and cost of revenues include the credit card association fees and assessments and the sponsoring bank's fees which are billed to us and for which we assume credit risk. In all instances, we recognize processing revenues net of interchange fees, which are assessed to our merchant and ISO, VAR, ISV and financial institution merchant customers on all processed transactions. Interchange rates and fees are not controlled by us. We effectively function as a clearing house collecting and remitting interchange fee settlement on behalf of issuing banks, debit networks, credit card associations and their processing customers. Additionally, our direct merchant customers have the liability for any charges properly reversed by the cardholder. In the event, however, that we are not able to collect such amount from the merchants due to merchant fraud, insolvency, bankruptcy or any other reason, we may be liable for any such reversed charges. We, in certain instances, require cash deposits, guarantees, letters of credit and other types of collateral by certain merchants to minimize any such contingent liability, and also utilize a number of systems and procedures to manage merchant risk. We have historically experienced losses due to chargebacks resulting from merchant defaults.\n 38 \nRevenues from our payroll processing operation is recognized in the period services are rendered and earned under service arrangements with clients where service fees are fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured. Certain processing services are provided under annual"}
