    "item_7": "ITEM 7.MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\nFORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\nManagement's discussion and analysis addresses the financial condition and results of operations for Park National Corporation and our subsidiaries (unless the context otherwise requires, collectively, \"Park\" or the \"Corporation\"). This discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes and the five-year summary of selected financial data included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Management's discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that are provided to assist in the understanding of anticipated future financial performance. Forward-looking statements provide current expectations or forecasts of future events and are not guarantees of future performance. The forward-looking statements are based on management's expectations and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. Although management believes that the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are reasonable, actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in such statements. Risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially include, without limitation: Park's ability to execute our business plan successfully and within the expected timeframe as well as Park's ability to manage strategic initiatives; general economic and financial market conditions, specifically in the real estate markets and the credit markets, either nationally or in the states in which Park and our subsidiaries do business, may experience a slowing or reversal of the current economic expansion in addition to continuing residual effects of prior recessionary conditions and an uneven spread of positive impacts of recovery on the economy and our counterparties, resulting in adverse impacts on the demand for loan, deposit and other financial services, delinquencies, defaults and counterparties' inability to meet credit and other obligations and the possible impairment of collectability of loans; changes in interest rates and prices as well as disruption in the liquidity and functioning of U.S. financial markets may adversely impact prepayment penalty income, mortgage banking income, income from fiduciary activities, the value of securities, loans, deposits and other financial instruments and the interest rate sensitivity of our consolidated balance sheet as well as reduce interest margins and impact loan demand; changes in consumer spending, borrowing and saving habits, whether due to changes in retail distribution strategies, consumer preferences and behavior, changes in business and economic\nconditions, legislative and regulatory initiatives, or other factors may be different than anticipated; changes in unemployment may be different than anticipated; changes in customers', suppliers', and other counterparties' performance and creditworthiness may be different than anticipated; the adequacy of our internal controls and risk management program in the event of changes in the market, economic, operational, asset/liability repricing, legal, compliance, strategic, cybersecurity, liquidity, credit and interest rate risks associated with Park's business; our liquidity requirements could be adversely affected by changes to regulations governing bank and bank holding company capital and liquidity standards as well as by changes in our assets and liabilities; competitive pressures among financial services organizations could increase significantly, including product and pricing pressures (which could in turn impact our credit spreads), customer acquisition and retention, changes to third-party relationships and revenues, changes in the manner of providing services, customer acquisition and retention pressures, and our ability to attract, develop and retain qualified banking professionals; customers could pursue alternatives to bank deposits, causing us to lose a relatively inexpensive source of funding; uncertainty regarding the nature, timing, cost and effect of changes in banking regulations or other regulatory or legislative requirements affecting the respective businesses of Park and our subsidiaries, including major reform of the regulatory oversight structure of the financial services industry and changes in laws and regulations concerning taxes, FDIC insurance premium levels, pensions, bankruptcy, consumer protection, rent regulation and housing, financial accounting and reporting, environmental protection, insurance, bank products and services, bank capital and liquidity standards, fiduciary standards, securities and other aspects of the financial services industry, specifically the reforms provided for in the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the Dodd-Frank Act\u201d) and the Basel III regulatory capital reforms, as well as regulations already adopted and which may be adopted in the future by the relevant regulatory agencies, including the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and the Federal Reserve Board, to implement the Dodd-Frank Act's provisions, and the Basel III regulatory capital reforms; the effects of easing restrictions on participants in the financial services industry; the effect of changes in accounting policies and practices, as may be adopted by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the \"FASB\"), the SEC, the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board and other regulatory agencies, including the extent to which the new current expected credit loss accounting standard issued by the FASB in June 2016 and effective for Park as of January 1, 2020, which will require banks to record, at the time of origination, credit losses expected throughout the life of the asset portfolio on loans and held-to-maturity securities, as opposed to the current practice of recording losses when it is probable that a loss event has occurred, may adversely affect Park's reported financial condition or results of operations; Park's assumptions and estimates used in applying critical accounting policies and modeling, which may prove unreliable, inaccurate or not predictive of actual results; significant changes in the tax laws, which may adversely affect the fair values of net deferred tax assets and obligations of state and political subdivisions held in Park's investment securities portfolio; the impact of our ability to anticipate and respond to technological changes and our ability to respond to customer needs and meet competitive demands; operational issues stemming from and/or capital spending necessitated by the potential need to adapt to industry changes in information technology systems on which Park and our subsidiaries are highly dependent; the ability to secure confidential information and deliver products and services through the use of computer systems and telecommunications networks; a failure in or breach of our operational or security systems or infrastructure, or those of our third-party vendors and other service providers, resulting in failures or disruptions in customer account management, general ledger, deposit, loan, or other systems, including as a result of cyber attacks; the existence or exacerbation of general geopolitical instability and uncertainty; the effect of trade policies (including the impact of potential or imposed tariffs, a U.S. withdrawal from or significant renegotiation of trade agreements, trade wars and other changes in trade regulations and changes in the relationship of the U.S. and its global trading partners), monetary and other fiscal policies (including the impact of money supply and interest rate policies to the Federal Reserve Board) and other governmental policies of the U.S. federal government; the impact on financial markets and the economy of any changes in the credit ratings of the U.S. Treasury obligations and other U.S. government-backed debt, as well as issues surrounding the levels of U.S., European and Asian government debt and concerns regarding the creditworthiness of certain sovereign governments, supranationals and financial institutions in Europe and Asia; the uncertainty surrounding the impact of the United Kingdom's exit from the European Union; our litigation and regulatory compliance exposure, including the costs and effects of any adverse developments in legal proceedings or other claims and the costs and effects of unfavorable resolution of regulatory and other governmental examinations or other inquiries; continued availability of earnings and excess capital sufficient for the lawful and prudent declaration of dividends; the impact on Park's business, personnel, facilities or systems of losses related to acts of fraud, scams and schemes of third parties; the impact of widespread natural and other disasters, pandemics, dislocations, civil unrest, terrorist activities or international hostilities on the economy and financial markets generally and on us or our counterparties specifically; the effect of healthcare laws in the U.S. and potential changes for such laws which may increase our healthcare and other costs and negatively impact our operations and financial results; Park's ability to integrate recent acquisitions as well as to identify, make or integrate any future suitable strategic acquisitions, which may be unsuccessful, or may be more difficult, time-consuming or costly than expected; risk and uncertainties associated with Park's entry into new geographic markets with its recent acquisitions, including expected revenue synergies and cost savings from recent acquisitions not being fully realized or realized within the expected time frame; difficulty of retaining and hiring employees in new markets; Park issued equity securities in the acquisitions of NewDominion Bank and Carolina Alliance and may issue equity securities in connection with future acquisitions, which could cause ownership and economic dilution to Park's current shareholders; the transition away from the London Inter-Bank Offered\nRate (LIBOR) as a reference rate for financial instruments, which may result in increased expenses and litigation, and adversely impact the value of various financial instruments; and other risk factors relating to the banking industry as detailed from time to time in Park's reports filed with the SEC including those described in \"Item 1A. RISK FACTORS\" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Park does not undertake, and specifically disclaims any obligation, to publicly release the results of any revisions that may be made to update any forward-looking statement to reflect the events or circumstances after the date on which the forward-looking statement was made, or reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events, except to the extent required by law.\nNON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\nManagement's discussion and analysis contains non-U.S. GAAP financial measures where management believes it to be helpful in understanding Park's results of operations or financial position. Where non-U.S. GAAP financial measures are used, the comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure, as well as the reconciliation to the comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure, can be found herein.\nItems Impacting Comparability of Period Results\nFrom time to time, revenue, expenses, and/or taxes are impacted by items judged by management of Park to be outside of ordinary banking activities and/or by items that, while they may be associated with ordinary banking activities, are so unusually large that their outsized impact is believed by management of Park at that time to be infrequent or short-term in nature. Most often, these items impacting comparability of period results are due to merger and acquisition activities and revenue and expenses related to former Vision Bank loan relationships. In other cases, they may result from management's decisions associated with significant corporate actions outside of the ordinary course of business.\nEven though certain revenue and expense items are naturally subject to more volatility than others due to changes in market and economic environment conditions, as a general rule volatility alone does not result in the inclusion of an item as one impacting comparability of period results. For example, changes in the provision for credit losses (aside from former Vision Bank loan relationships), gains (losses) on equity securities, and asset valuation writedowns, reflect ordinary banking activities and are, therefore, typically excluded from consideration as items impacting comparability of period results.\nManagement believes the disclosure of items impacting comparability of period results provides a better understanding of our performance and trends and allows management to ascertain which of such items, if any, to include or exclude from an analysis of our performance; i.e., within the context of determining how that performance differed from expectations, as well as how, if at all, to adjust estimates of future performance taking such items into account.\nItems impacting comparability of the results of particular periods are not intended to be a complete list of items that may materially impact current or future period performance.\nNon-GAAP Ratios\nPark's management uses certain non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate Park's performance. Specifically, management reviews the ratio of tangible equity to tangible assets.\nManagement has included in MD&A information relating to the ratio of tangible equity to tangible assets. For the purpose of calculating the ratio of tangible equity to tangible assets, a non-GAAP financial measure, tangible equity is divided by tangible assets. Tangible equity equals total shareholders' equity less goodwill and other intangible assets, in each case at period end. Tangible assets equals total assets less goodwill and other intangible assets, in each case at period end.\nManagement believes that the disclosure of the ratio of tangible equity to tangible assets presents additional information to the reader of the consolidated financial statements, which, when read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP, assists in analyzing Park's operating performance, ensures comparability of operating performance from period to period, and facilitates comparisons with the performance of Park's peer financial holding companies and bank holding companies, while eliminating certain non-operational effects of acquisitions. Within the \"CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS - Capital\" section of this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Park has provided detail of the reconciliation of tangible equity to total shareholders' equity and of tangible assets to total assets solely for the purpose of complying with SEC Regulation G and not as an indication that the ratio of tangible equity to tangible assets is a substitute for the ratio of total shareholders' equity to total assets as determined in accordance with GAAP.\nFTE (fully taxable equivalent) Ratios\nInterest income, yields, and ratios on a FTE basis are considered non-U.S. GAAP financial measures. Management believes net interest income on a FTE basis provides an insightful picture of the interest margin for comparison purposes. The FTE basis also allows management to assess the comparability of revenue arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources. The FTE basis assumes a federal statutory tax rate of 21% for 2018 and 2019 and 35% for 2017 and prior years. In the tables included within the \"ANALYSIS OF EARNINGS - Net Interest Income\" section of this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Park has provided detail of FTE interest income solely for the purpose of complying with SEC Regulation G and not as an indication that FTE interest income, yields and ratios are substitutes for interest income, yields and ratios, as determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\nOVERVIEW\nFinancial Results by segment\nThe table below reflects the net income (loss) by segment for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017. Park's segments include The Park National Bank (\"PNB\"), Guardian Financial Services Company (\"GFSC\") and \"All Other\" which primarily consists of Park as the \"Parent Company\" and SE Property Holdings, LLC (\"SEPH\"). SEPH is a non-bank subsidiary of Park, holding former Vision Bank OREO property and non-performing loans.\nTable 16: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Table 1 - Net Income (Loss) by Segment </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>PNB </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>113,600 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>109,472 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>87,315 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>GFSC </td> <td> </td> <td>762 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>521 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>260 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>All Other </td> <td> </td> <td>(11,662) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>394 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(3,333) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Park </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>102,700 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>110,387 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>84,242 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet income for the year ended December 31, 2019 of $102.7 million represented a $7.7 million, or 7.0%, decrease compared to $110.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Net income for both the year ended December 31, 2019 and the year ended December 31, 2018 included several items of income and expense that impact the comparability of period results. These items are detailed in the \"Items Impacting Comparability\" section below.\nThe following discussion provides additional information regarding Park's two operating segments, followed by additional information regarding All Other, which consists of the Parent Company and SEPH.\nThe Park National Bank (PNB)\nThe table below reflects PNB's net income for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017.\nTable 17: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Table 2 - PNB Summary Income Statement </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In thousands) </td> <td>2019 </td> <td>2018 </td> <td>2017 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net interest income </td> <td>$ </td> <td>293,130 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>258,547 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>235,243 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Provision for loan losses </td> <td>8,356 </td> <td> </td> <td>7,569 </td> <td> </td> <td>9,898 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other income </td> <td>92,392 </td> <td> </td> <td>88,981 </td> <td> </td> <td>82,742 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other expense </td> <td>237,433 </td> <td> </td> <td>206,843 </td> <td> </td> <td>185,891 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income before income taxes </td> <td>$ </td> <td>139,733 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>133,116 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>122,196 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Income tax expense </td> <td>26,133 </td> <td> </td> <td>23,644 </td> <td> </td> <td>34,881 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income </td> <td>$ </td> <td>113,600 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>109,472 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>87,315 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet interest income of $293.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 represented a $34.6 million, or 13.4%, increase compared to $258.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase was a result of a $52.1 million increase in interest income, offset by a $17.5 million increase in interest expense.\nThe $52.1 million increase in interest income was primarily due to a $52.6 million increase in interest income on loans. The increase in interest income on loans was partially the result of a $746.2 million increase in average loans from $5.44 billion for the year ended December 31, 2018, to $6.19 billion for the year ended December 31, 2019. Additionally, the yield on loans increased 27 basis points to 5.12% for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to 4.85% for the year ended December 31, 2018. Interest income was impacted by the acquisition of NewDominion Bank (\"NewDominion\") on July 1, 2018 and the acquisition of CAB Financial Corporation, the parent of Carolina Alliance Bank (\"Carolina Alliance\") on April 1, 2019. The NewDominion Bank Division and the Carolina Alliance Bank Division contributed an aggregate of $41.3 million to interest income at PNB during the year ended December 31, 2019. The NewDominion Bank Division contributed $8.1 million to interest income at PNB during the year ended December 31, 2018.\nThe $17.5 million increase in interest expense was primarily due to a $18.7 million increase in interest expense on deposits, partially offset by a $1.2 million decrease in interest expense on borrowings. The increase in interest expense on deposits was partially the result of a $555.8 million increase in average interest-bearing deposits from $4.47 billion for the year ended December 31, 2018, to $5.03 billion for the year ended December 31, 2019. Additionally, the cost of interest bearing deposits increased by 29 basis points from 0.72% for the year ended December 31, 2018 to 1.01% for the year ended December 31, 2019. Interest expense was impacted by the acquisitions of NewDominion and Carolina Alliance. The NewDominion Bank Division and the Carolina Alliance Bank Division contributed an aggregate of $5.3 million to interest expense at PNB during the year ended December 31, 2019. The NewDominion Bank Division contributed $674,000 to interest expense at PNB during the year ended December 31, 2018.\nThe provision for loan losses of $8.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 represented an increase of $787,000, compared to $7.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Refer to the CREDIT EXPERIENCE - Provision for Loan Losses\" section for additional details regarding the level of the provision for loan losses recognized in each period presented above.\nOther income of $92.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 represented an increase of $3.4 million, or 3.8%, compared to $89.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The $3.4 million increase was primarily related to a $2.9 million increase in debit card fee income, a $2.4 million increase in other service income, a $1.5 million increase in income from fiduciary activities, a $1.3 million increase in operating lease income, which is included in miscellaneous income, and a decrease of $1.8 million in net losses on the sale of investment securities, offset by a $2.0 million decrease in other components of net periodic benefit income, a $1.6 million decrease in net gains on the sale of OREO, a $814,000 decrease in net gains on the sale of non-performing loans, a $735,000 decrease in bank owned life insurance income, primarily related to income from death benefits paid on policies during 2018, and a $626,000 decrease in service charges on deposit accounts. Other income was impacted by the acquisitions of NewDominion and Carolina Alliance. The NewDominion Bank Division and the Carolina Alliance Bank Division contributed an aggregate of $4.6 million to other income at PNB during the year ended December 31, 2019. The NewDominion Bank Division contributed $429,000 to other income at PNB during the year ended December 31, 2018.\nThe table below reflects PNB's other expense for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018.\nTable 18: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Table 3 - PNB Other Expense Information </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In thousands) </td> <td>December 31, 2019 </td> <td>December 31, 2018 </td> <td>$ change </td> <td>% change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other expense: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Salaries </td> <td>$ </td> <td>109,362 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>97,155 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>12,207 </td> <td> </td> <td>12.6 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Employee benefits </td> <td>36,017 </td> <td> </td> <td>29,341 </td> <td> </td> <td>6,676 </td> <td> </td> <td>22.8 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Occupancy expense </td> <td>12,555 </td> <td> </td> <td>11,007 </td> <td> </td> <td>1,548 </td> <td> </td> <td>14.1 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Furniture and equipment expense </td> <td>16,999 </td> <td> </td> <td>16,082 </td> <td> </td> <td>917 </td> <td> </td> <td>5.7 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Data processing fees </td> <td>10,589 </td> <td> </td> <td>8,337 </td> <td> </td> <td>2,252 </td> <td> </td> <td>27.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Professional fees and services </td> <td>22,056 </td> <td> </td> <td>19,382 </td> <td> </td> <td>2,674 </td> <td> </td> <td>13.8 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Marketing </td> <td>5,704 </td> <td> </td> <td>5,091 </td> <td> </td> <td>613 </td> <td> </td> <td>12.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Insurance </td> <td>2,489 </td> <td> </td> <td>4,749 </td> <td> </td> <td>(2,260) </td> <td> </td> <td>(47.6) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Communication </td> <td>5,193 </td> <td> </td> <td>4,792 </td> <td> </td> <td>401 </td> <td> </td> <td>8.4 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>State tax expense </td> <td>3,016 </td> <td> </td> <td>3,027 </td> <td> </td> <td>(11) </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.4) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of intangible assets </td> <td>2,355 </td> <td> </td> <td>578 </td> <td> </td> <td>1,777 </td> <td> </td> <td>307.4 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Miscellaneous </td> <td>11,098 </td> <td> </td> <td>7,302 </td> <td> </td> <td>3,796 </td> <td> </td> <td>52.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total other expense </td> <td>$ </td> <td>237,433 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>206,843 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>30,590 </td> <td> </td> <td>14.8 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOther expense of $237.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 represented an increase of $30.6 million, or 14.8%, compared to $206.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase in employee benefits expense was primarily related to increased group insurance costs, payroll taxes and an increase in the company match in Park's defined contribution plan. Included in the increase in miscellaneous expense was a $1.3 million increase in operating lease depreciation, a $1.3 million expense related to the write-down of a trade name intangible, a $611,000 expense related to prepayment penalties on FHLB borrowings and a $471,000 increase in training and travel expenses. The decrease in insurance was primarily related to an assessment credit utilized with respect to the FDIC insurance expense.\nOther expense was impacted by the acquisitions of NewDominion and Carolina Alliance. Of the $237.4 million of total other expense for the year ended December 31, 2019, the NewDominion Bank Division and the Carolina Alliance Bank Division's total other expense was $10.7 million and $16.5 million, respectively. The NewDominion Bank Division's total other expense was $5.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018.

The quarterly cash dividend on Park's common shares was $1.21 per share for the first quarter of 2019, and $1.01 per share for the second, third, and fourth quarter of 2019. The first quarter of 2019 included a one-time special cash dividend of $0.20 per share. The quarterly cash dividend on Park's common shares was $0.94 per share for the first quarter of 2018, $1.21 per share for the second quarter of 2018, and $0.96 per share for the third and fourth quarter of 2018. The second quarter of 2018 included a one-time special cash dividend of $0.25 per share. The quarterly cash dividend on Park's common shares was $0.94 per share for each quarter of 2017. Please see the discussion of limitations on Park's ability to pay dividends in the section captioned \"Supervision and Regulation of Park and its Subsidiaries - Limits on Dividends and Other Payments\" in \"ITEM 1. BUSINESS\" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nThe significant accounting policies used in the development and presentation of Park's consolidated financial statements are listed in \"Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\" of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in \"ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA.\" The accounting and reporting policies of Park conform with U.S. GAAP and general practices within the financial services industry. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and the accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nALLL - The determination of the ALLL involves a higher degree of judgment and complexity than Park's other significant accounting policies. The ALLL is calculated with the objective of maintaining a reserve level believed by management to be sufficient to absorb probable, incurred credit losses in the loan portfolio. Management's determination of the adequacy of the ALLL is based on periodic evaluations of the loan portfolio and of current economic conditions. However, this evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires material estimates, including expected default probabilities, the loss given default, the amounts and timing of expected future cash flows on impaired loans, and estimated losses based on historical loss experience and current economic conditions. All of these factors may be susceptible to significant change. To the extent that actual results differ from management estimates, additional loan loss provisions may be required that would adversely impact earnings for future periods.\nOREO - OREO, property acquired through foreclosure, is recorded at estimated fair value less anticipated selling costs (net realizable value). If the net realizable value is below the carrying value of the loan on the date of transfer of the OREO, the difference is charged off against the ALLL. Subsequent declines in value (OREO devaluations) are reported as adjustments to the carrying amount of OREO and are expensed within other income. Gains or losses not previously recognized, resulting from the sale of OREO, are recognized within other income on the date of sale. At December 31, 2019, OREO totaled $4.0 million, a decrease of 6.4%, compared to $4.3 million at December 31, 2018.\nFair Value - In accordance with GAAP, management utilizes the fair value hierarchy, which has the objective of maximizing the use of observable market inputs. The accounting guidance also requires disclosures regarding the inputs used to calculate fair value. These inputs are classified as Level 1, Level 2, and Level 3. Level 3 inputs are those with significant\nunobservable inputs that reflect a company's own assumptions about the market for a particular instrument. Some of the inputs could be based on internal models and/or cash flow analyses. The large majority of Park's financial assets valued using Level 2 inputs consist of AFS debt securities. The fair value of these AFS debt securities is obtained largely by the use of matrix pricing, which is a mathematical technique widely used in the financial services industry to value debt securities without relying exclusively on quoted market prices for the specific securities but rather by relying on the securities' relationship to other benchmark quoted securities.\nGoodwill and other intangible assets - The accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets also involves a higher degree of judgment than most other significant accounting policies. GAAP establishes standards for the impairment assessment of goodwill and other intangible assets. Goodwill and other intangible assets represents the excess of the purchase price over net identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired in a purchase business combination. Park's goodwill relates to the value inherent in the banking industry and that value is dependent upon the ability of PNB, Park's national bank subsidiary, to provide quality, cost-effective banking services in a competitive marketplace. The goodwill value is supported by revenue that is in part driven by the volume of business transacted. A decrease in earnings resulting from a decline in the customer base, the inability to deliver cost-effective services over sustained periods or significant credit problems can lead to impairment of goodwill that could adversely impact earnings in future periods.\nGoodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized to expense, but are subject to impairment tests annually, or more frequently, if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired, by assessing qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If after assessing these events or circumstances, it is concluded that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then performing additional analysis is unnecessary. If the carrying amount of the goodwill exceeds the fair value, an impairment charge must be recorded in an amount equal to the excess, not to exceed the total goodwill allocated to the reporting unit. At December 31, 2019, on a consolidated basis, Park had $159.6 million of goodwill and $11.5 million of other intangibles, all of which is recorded at PNB.\nPension Plan - The determination of pension plan obligations and related expenses requires the use of assumptions to estimate the amount of benefits that employees will earn while working, as well as the present value of those benefits. Annual pension expense is principally based on four components: (1) the value of benefits earned by employees for working during the year (service cost), (2) the increase in the liability due to the passage of time (interest cost), and (3) other gains and losses, reduced by (4) the expected return on plan assets for our pension plan.\nSignificant assumptions used to measure our annual pension expense include:\n\u2022the interest rate used to determine the present value of liabilities (discount rate);\n\u2022certain employee-related factors, such as turnover, retirement age and mortality;\n\u2022the expected return on assets in our funded plan; and\n\u2022the rate of salary increases where benefits are based on earnings.\nOur assumptions reflect our historical experience and management's best judgment regarding future expectations. Due to the significant management judgment involved, our assumptions could have a material impact on the measurement of our pension plan expense and obligation.\nABOUT OUR BUSINESS\nThrough our national bank subsidiary, PNB, Park is engaged in a general commercial banking and trust business, primarily in Ohio, Kentucky, North Carolina and South Carolina, with the exception of nationwide aircraft loans and nationwide asset-based lending to consumer finance companies. Management believes there are a significant number of consumers and businesses that seek long-term relationships with community-based financial institutions of quality and strength. While not engaging in activities such as foreign lending, nationally syndicated loans or investment banking, Park attempts to meet the needs of our customers for commercial, real estate and consumer loans, and investment, fiduciary and deposit services.\nPark's subsidiaries compete for deposits and loans with other banks, savings associations, credit unions and other types of financial institutions. At December 31, 2019, Park operated 125 financial service offices (including those of PNB, Scope Leasing, Inc. (\"Scope Aircraft Finance\"), and GFSC) and a network of 138 automated teller machines in 29 Ohio counties, one Kentucky county, four North Carolina counties and four South Carolina counties. SEPH also operated one office, located in Newark, Ohio.\nSOURCE OF FUNDS\nDeposits: Park's major source of funds is deposits from individuals, businesses and local government entities. These deposits consist of non-interest bearing and interest bearing deposits.\nAverage total deposits were $6,905 million in 2019, compared to $6,135 million in 2018 and $5,893 million in 2017. Table 12 provides a summary of deposit balances as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, along with the change over the past year.\nTable 27: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Table 12 - Year-End Deposits </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>December 31 (In thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-interest bearing checking </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,959,935 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,804,881 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>155,054 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest bearing transaction accounts </td> <td> </td> <td>1,628,740 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,364,743 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>263,997 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Savings </td> <td> </td> <td>2,323,533 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,046,792 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>276,741 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>All other time deposits </td> <td> </td> <td>1,139,131 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,043,177 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>95,954 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other </td> <td> </td> <td>1,273 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,267 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>7,052,612 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>6,260,860 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>791,752 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe average interest rate paid on interest bearing deposits was 1.01% in 2019, compared to 0.72% in 2018, and 0.44% in 2017.

These funds are used to manage the Corporation's liquidity needs and interest rate sensitivity risk. The average rate paid on short-term borrowings generally moves closely with changes in market interest rates for short-term investments. The average rate paid on short-term borrowings was 1.15% in 2019, compared to 0.74% in 2018, and 0.43% in 2017. The year-end balance for short-term borrowings was $231 million at December 31, 2019, compared to $222 million at December 31, 2018, and $391 million at December 31, 2017.\nLong-Term Debt: Long-term debt primarily consists of borrowings from the Federal Home Loan Bank and a term note with another financial institution. The average balance of long-term debt and the average cost of long-term debt include the subordinated notes discussed in the following section. In 2019, average long-term debt was $341 million, compared to $424 million in 2018, and $788 million in 2017. The average interest rate paid on long-term debt was 2.77% in 2019, compared to 2.38% for 2018, and 2.86% for 2017. Average total debt (long-term and short-term) was $557 million in 2019, compared to $642 million in 2018, and $1,018 million in 2017. Average total debt decreased by $85 million, or 13.2%, in 2019 compared to 2018, and decreased by $376 million, or 37.0%, in 2018 compared to 2017. Average long-term debt was 61% of average total debt in 2019, compared to 66% of average total debt in 2018, and 77% of average total debt in 2017.\nSubordinated Notes: Park assumed, with the 2007 acquisition of Vision's parent holding company, $15.5 million of floating rate junior subordinated notes. The $15.5 million of junior subordinated notes were purchased by Vision Bancshares Trust I (\"Trust I\") following the issuance of Trust I's $15.0 million of floating rate preferred securities. The interest rate on these junior subordinated notes adjusts every quarter at 148 basis points above the three-month LIBOR interest rate. The\nmaturity date for the junior subordinated notes is December 30, 2035 and the junior subordinated notes may be prepaid, without penalty, after December 30, 2010. These junior subordinated notes qualify as Tier 1 capital under current Federal Reserve Board guidelines.\nSee \"Note 17 - Subordinated Notes\" of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in \"ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA\" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information about the subordinated notes.\nShareholders' Equity: The ratio of total shareholders' equity to total assets was 11.32% at December 31, 2019, compared to 10.67% at December 31, 2018, and 10.03% at December 31, 2017. The ratio of tangible shareholders' equity [shareholders' equity ($969.0 million) less goodwill ($159.6 million) and other intangible assets ($11.5 million)] to tangible assets [total assets ($8,558 million) less goodwill ($159.6 million) and other intangible assets ($11.5 million)] was 9.51% at December 31, 2019, compared to 9.28% at December 31, 2018, and 9.16% at December 31, 2017.\nIn accordance with GAAP, Park reflects any unrealized holding gain or loss on AFS debt securities, any unrealized net holding gain or loss on cash flow hedging derivatives or any change in the funded status of Park's pension plan, net of income taxes, as accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) which is part of Park's shareholders' equity.\nThe unrealized net holding gain, net of income taxes, on AFS debt securities was $17.5 million at year-end 2019, compared to the unrealized net holding loss, net of income taxes, of $20.1 million at year-end 2018, and the unrealized net holding loss, net of income taxes, of $2.9 million at year-end 2017.\nThe unrealized net holding loss, net of income taxes, on cash flow hedging derivatives was $454,000 at year-end 2019. There were no cash flow hedging derivatives at either year-end 2018 or 2017.\nIn accordance with GAAP, Park adjusts accumulated other comprehensive loss to recognize the net actuarial gain or loss reflected in the funding status of Park's pension plan. See \"Note 20 - Benefit Plans\" of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in \"ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA\" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for information on the accounting for Park's pension plan. Pertaining to the funding status of the pension plan, Park recognized a net comprehensive gain of $3.0 million in 2019, a net comprehensive loss of $3.0 million in 2018, and a net comprehensive loss of $8.8 million in 2017. The net comprehensive gain in 2019 was due to changes in actuarial assumptions being more than offset by increased investment returns on pension plan assets. The net comprehensive loss in 2018 was due to changes in actuarial assumptions being more than offset by lower than projected returns on pension plan assets during 2018. The net comprehensive loss in 2017 was due to changes in actuarial assumptions which were partially offset by increased investment returns on pension plan assets.\nAt year-end 2019, the balance in accumulated other comprehensive loss pertaining to the pension plan was $26.7 million, compared to $29.7 million at December 31, 2018, and $23.5 million at December 31, 2017.\nINVESTMENT OF FUNDS\nLoans: Average loans were $6,208 million in 2019, compared to $5,461 million in 2018, and $5,328 million in 2017. The actual yield on average loan balances was 5.19% in 2019, compared to 4.98% in 2018, and 4.69% in 2017. Approximately 48% of Park's loan balances mature or reprice within one year (see Table 34). The actual yield on average loan balances for each quarter of 2019 was 5.11% for the fourth quarter, 5.25% for the third quarter, 5.23% for the second quarter and 5.14% for the first quarter.\nLoan interest income for 2019, 2018, and 2017 included $256,000, $3.4 million, and $2.3 million, respectively, related to payments received on certain SEPH impaired loan relationships, some of which are participated with PNB. In addition, for 2019 and 2018, loan interest income included $5.2 million and $1.1 million, respectively, of the accretion of loan purchase accounting adjustments related to the acquisitions of NewDominion and Carolina Alliance. Excluding this income, the yield on loans was 5.09%, 4.89%, and 4.66%, for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017. Excluding this income, the yield on loans was 4.97% for the fourth quarter of 2019, 5.13% for the third quarter of 2019, 5.14% for the second quarter of 2019, and 5.12% for the first quarter of 2019.\nAt December 31, 2019, loan balances were $6,501 million, compared to $5,692 million at year-end 2018, an increase of $809 million, or 14.2%. Excluding $560.2 million of loans at the Carolina Alliance Bank Division at December 31, 2019, loans outstanding at December 31, 2019 were $5,941 million, compared to $5,692 million at December 31, 2018, an increase of $249 million, or 4.4%.\nTable 14 reports year-end loan balances by type of loan for the past five years.\nTable 29: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Table 14 - Loans by Type </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial, financial and agricultural </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,185,110 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,072,786 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,053,453 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>994,619 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>955,727 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Construction real estate </td> <td> </td> <td>331,699 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>248,274 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>181,470 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>188,945 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>173,345 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Residential real estate </td> <td> </td> <td>1,892,726 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,793,618 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,725,224 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,808,497 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,855,443 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial real estate </td> <td> </td> <td>1,609,413 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,283,045 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,167,607 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,155,703 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,113,603 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Consumer </td> <td> </td> <td>1,452,375 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,292,136 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,241,736 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,120,850 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>967,111 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Leases </td> <td> </td> <td>30,081 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,273 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,993 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,243 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,856 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total loans </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>6,501,404 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,692,132 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,372,483 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,271,857 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,068,085 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOn a combined basis, year-end commercial, financial and agricultural loans, construction real estate loans and commercial real estate loans increased by $522 million, or 20%, in 2019 and increased by $202 million, or 8.4%, in 2018. The increase in 2019 was due to an increase in commercial real estate loans of $326.4 million, an increase in commercial, financial and agricultural loans of $112.3 million and an increase in construction real estate loans of $83.4 million. The increase in 2018 was due to an increase in commercial real estate loans of $115.4 million, an increase in construction real estate loans of $66.8 million and an increase in commercial, financial and agricultural loans of $19.3 million.\nConsumer loans increased by $160.2 million, or 12.4%, in 2019 and increased $50 million, or 4.1%, in 2018. The increase in consumer loans in each of 2019 and 2018 was primarily due to an increase in automobile lending in Ohio.\nResidential real estate loans increased by $99.1 million, or 5.5%, in 2019 and increased $68 million, or 4.0%, in 2018. The increase in 2019 was due to an increase in commercial loans secured by residential real estate of $49.4 million, an increase in mortgage loans secured by residential real estate of $42.0 million, an increase in home equity loans secured by residential real estate of $9.5 million and a decrease in installment loans secured by residential real estate of $1.8 million.\nLeases increased by $27.8 million in 2019 to $30.1 million at December 31, 2019 compared to $2.3 million as of December 31, 2018 and $3.0 million as of December 31, 2017.

As conditions change over time, Park's overall interest rate risk, liquidity needs and potential return on the investment portfolio will change. Management regularly evaluates the securities in the investment portfolio as circumstances evolve. Circumstances that could result in the sale of a security include: to better manage interest rate risk; to meet liquidity needs; or to improve the overall yield in the investment portfolio.\nAFS debt securities are carried on the books at their estimated fair value with the unrealized holding gain or loss, net of income taxes, accounted for as accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). The debt securities that are classified as AFS are free to be sold in future periods in carrying out Park's investment strategies.\nPrior to September 1, 2019, Park classified certain types of U.S. Government sponsored entity collateralized mortgage obligations ( CMOs\u201d) and tax-exempt municipal securities that it purchased as Held-To-Maturity (\"HTM\"). These debt securities have been classified as HTM because they are generally not as liquid as the investment securities that Park classifies as AFS. A classification of HTM means that Park has the positive intent and the ability to hold these securities until maturity.\nOn September 1, 2019, Park adopted the portion of ASU 2019-04 which allowed for a one-time reclassification of securities from HTM to AFS. On this date, Park transferred HTM securities with a fair value of $373.9 million to the AFS classification. The transfer occurred at fair value and had a related unrealized gain, net of taxes, of $19.1 million recorded in other comprehensive income. At year-end 2018, Park's HTM securities portfolio was $352 million, compared to $357 million at year-end 2017. All of the CMOs, mortgage-backed securities, and callable notes in Park's investment portfolio were issued by U.S. Government sponsored entities.\nAverage taxable debt investment securities were $1,052 million in 2019, compared to $1,192 million in 2018, and $1,310 million in 2017. The average yield on taxable debt investment securities was 2.49% in 2019, compared to 2.47% in 2018, and 2.10% in 2017. Average tax-exempt debt investment securities were $309 million in 2019, compared to $302 million in 2018, and $247 million in 2017. The average tax-equivalent yield on tax-exempt debt investment securities was 3.67% in both 2019 and 2018, compared to 4.48% in 2017.\nTotal debt securities (at amortized cost) were $1,187 million at December 31, 2019, compared to $1,381 million at December 31, 2018, and $1,455 million at December 31, 2017. Management purchased debt securities totaling $380 million in 2018, and $143 million in 2017. There were no purchases of debt securities in 2019.

The $26.3 million in 2018 was an increase of $2.6 million, or 10.8%, compared to $23.7 million in 2017. The increases in fiduciary fee income in 2019 and 2018 were primarily due to improvements in the equity markets and also due to an increase in the total account balances serviced by PNB's Trust Department. PNB charges fiduciary fees largely based on the market value of the trust assets. The average market value of the trust assets managed by PNB was $5.85 billion in 2019, compared to $5.49 billion in 2018, and $5.05 billion in 2017.\nService charges on deposit accounts decreased by $626,000, or 5.5%, to $10.8 million in 2019, compared to $11.5 million in 2018. The $11.5 million in 2018 was a decrease of $1.2 million, or 9.4%, compared to $12.7 million in 2017. The declines in 2019 and 2018 were related to declines in service charges on deposits, largely as a result of a decline in other non-sufficient funds (NSF) fee income and service charges on demand deposit accounts.\nOther service income increased $1.2 million, or 8.6%, to $15.5 million in 2019, compared to $14.3 million in 2018. The $14.3 million in 2018 was a $1.1 million, or 8.4%, increase compared to $13.2 million in 2017. The increase in 2019 compared to 2018 was primarily related to increases in other service income due to the acquisitions of NewDominion and Carolina Alliance which increased sold mortgage loan originations. The increase for 2018 compared to 2017 was primarily the result of recovery of fees from certain SEPH impaired loan relationships.\nDebit card fee income, which is generated from debit card transactions, increased $2.9 million, or 16.9%, to $20.3 million, compared to $17.3 million in 2018. The $17.3 million in 2018 was an increase of $1.5 million, or 9.6%, compared to $15.8 million in 2017. The increases in 2019 and 2018 were attributable to continued increases in the volume of debit card transactions, which increased 7.4% in 2019 from 2018 and 7.6% in 2018 from 2017. In addition, the increase in 2019 was attributable to changes in our point of sale network. Park continues to focus on deposit offerings that incent our customers to use their debit card.\nBank owned life insurance income decreased by $2.3 million, or 33.1%, to $4.6 million in 2019, compared to $6.8 million in 2018. Bank owned life insurance income increased by $2.0 million, or 40.3%, to $6.8 million in 2018, compared to $4.9 million in 2017. The decrease in 2019 from 2018 of $2.3 million and the increase of $2.0 million from 2017 to 2018 were\nprimarily related to income from death benefits paid on policies. Park recorded $223,000 of income from death benefits paid on policies in 2019, compared to $2.7 million of income from death benefits paid on policies during 2018, and $478,000 of income from death benefits paid on policies during 2017.\n(Loss) gain on the sale of OREO, net, reflected a loss of $222,000 in 2019, a decrease of $4.5 million, compared to a gain of $4.2 million in 2018. The $4.2 million in 2018, was an increase of $4.0 million, compared to $251,000 in 2017. The increase in 2018 was primarily due to a $4.1 million gain on the sale of one OREO property, which was partially participated to PNB from SEPH.\nDuring 2019, Park sold certain AFS debt securities with a book value of $62.4 million at a gross loss of $692,000, and sold certain AFS debt securities with a book value of $29.1 million at a gross gain of $271,000.

These HTM debt securities had been paid down by 96.3% of the principal outstanding at acquisition. During 2017, Park sold certain equity securities with a book value of $444,000 at a gross gain of $1.8 million.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, $345,000 and $(287,000), respectively, of unrealized gains (losses) on equity investments carried at fair value were recorded within \"Gain on equity securities, net\" on Park's Consolidated Statements of Income. An additional $3.5 million gain recorded within \"Gain on equity securities, net\" on Park's Consolidated Statements of Income for the year ended December 31, 2018 related to Park's 8.55% investment in NewDominion which was held at December 31, 2017. During 2017, equity securities had unrealized gains of $1.3 million recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, $4.8 million and $1.4 million, respectively, of unrealized gains on equity investments carried at NAV were recorded within \"Gain on equity securities, net\" on Park's Consolidated Statements of Income.\nOther components of net periodic pension benefit income decreased by $2.1 million, or 30.6%, to $4.7 million in 2019, compared to $6.8 million in 2018, and increased by $1.0 million, or 17.7%, to $6.8 million in 2018, compared to $5.8 million in 2017. The decrease in 2019 was largely due to a decrease in the expected return on plan assets based on a decrease in plan assets and increased interest costs. The increase in 2018 was largely due to an increase in the expected return on plan assets based on an increase in plan assets.\nGain on the sale of non-performing loans was $2.8 million for 2018. This was related to certain non-performing loans, which had a book balance of $174,000, that were sold in the fourth quarter of 2018. No non-performing loans were sold in 2019 or 2017.\nOther miscellaneous income increased by $237,000, or 3.3%, to $7.5 million in 2019, compared to $7.2 million in 2018, and increased $1.9 million, or 35.2%, to $7.2 million in 2018, compared to $5.4 million in 2017. The increase in 2018, compared to 2017, was primarily related to an $833,000 increase in income from repossessed assets and a $437,000 increase in the net gain on the sale of assets.\nOther Expense: Other expense was $264.0 million in 2019, compared to $228.8 million in 2018, and $203.2 million in 2017.

The increase in professional fees and services expense in 2018 was largely related to increases in management and consulting expense as well as increases in other fees related to the acquisition of NewDominion.\nInsurance expense decreased by $2.2 million, or 40.8%, to $3.1 million in 2019, compared to $5.3 million in 2018, and decreased $1.1 million, or 16.8%, to $5.3 million in 2018, compared to $6.4 million in 2017. The decrease in 2019 was primarily due to the utilization of a $2.2 million assessment credit to reduce the FDIC insurance expense during the third and fourth quarters of 2019. The decrease in insurance expense in 2018 was primarily due to declines in FDIC insurance expense.\nAmortization of intangible assets increased $1.8 million, to $2.4 million in 2019, compared to $578,000 in 2018. The amortization of intangible assets was due to the core deposit intangibles from the acquisitions of both NewDominion and Carolina Alliance.\nThe subcategory \"Miscellaneous\" other expense includes expenses for supplies, travel, charitable contributions, and other miscellaneous expense. The subcategory miscellaneous other expense increased by $3.2 million, or 31.5%, to $13.3 million in 2019, compared to $10.1 million in 2018, and increased by $842,000, or 9.1%, to $10.1 million in 2018, compared to $9.3 million in 2017. The $3.2 million increase in 2019 was primarily due to a $1.3 million expense related to the write-down of the NewDominion trade name intangible, a $1.3 million increase in operating lease depreciation, a $611,000 increase related to prepayment penalties on FHLB borrowings, a $475,000 increase in training and travel related expenses, a $421,000 increase in miscellaneous merger-related expenses, and a $319,000 increase in supplemental executive retirement plan expense, partially offset by a $1.5 million decrease in contribution expense. The $842,000 increase in 2018 was primarily due to a $936,000 increase in fraud losses, and a $497,000 increase in contribution expense, offset by a $610,000 decrease in supplemental executive retirement plan expense.\nItems Impacting Comparability:\nFrom time to time, revenue, expenses, and/or taxes are impacted by items judged by management of Park to be outside of ordinary banking activities and/or by items that, while they may be associated with ordinary banking activities, are so unusually large that their outsized impact is believed by management of Park at that time to be infrequent or short-term in nature. Most often, these items impacting comparability of period results result from merger and acquisition activities and revenue and expenses related to former Vision Bank relationships. In other cases, they may result from management's decisions associated with significant corporate actions outside of the ordinary course of business.\nThe following table details those items which management believes impacts the comparability of current and prior period amounts.\nTable 41: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Table 26- Items impacting comparability </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands, except share and per share data) </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td>2018 </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td>Affected Line Item </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net interest income </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>297,737 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>266,898 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>243,759 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>less purchase accounting accretion related to NewDominion and Carolina Alliance acquisitions </td> <td> </td> <td>5,193 </td> <td> </td> <td>1,096 </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Interest and fees on loans </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>less purchase accounting accretion related to NewDominion and Carolina Alliance acquisitions </td> <td> </td> <td>593 </td> <td> </td> <td>287 </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Interest on deposits </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>less interest income on former Vision Bank relationships </td> <td> </td> <td>256 </td> <td> </td> <td>3,429 </td> <td> </td> <td>2,323 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Interest and fees on loans </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net interest income -

Income tax expense as a percentage of income before taxes was 17.7% in 2019, 15.9% in 2018, and 28.9% in 2017. The difference between the statutory federal corporate income tax rate of 21% for 2019 and Park's effective tax rate reflects permanent tax differences, primarily consisting of tax-exempt interest income from municipal investments and loans, qualified affordable housing and historical tax credits, bank owned life insurance income, and dividends paid on common\nshares held within Park's salary deferral plan. Park's permanent federal tax differences for 2019 were approximately $5.3 million, compared to $7.1 million for 2018. The effective tax rate in 2019 was greater than 2018 due to increased state tax expense as well as the fact that 2018 had a permanent difference related to the gain of $3.5 million as a result of the remeasuring to fair value of Park's 8.55% equity interest in NewDominion held before the business combination. Park expects permanent federal tax differences for 2020 will be approximately $6.1 million.\nAs stated earlier, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act permanently lowered the federal corporate income tax rate to 21% from the then existing maximum rate of 35%, effective January 1, 2018. As a result of the reduction of the federal corporate income tax rate to 21%, GAAP required companies to re-value certain tax-related assets and liabilities as of the date of enactment, with the resulting tax effects accounted for in the reporting period of enactment. This re-valuation impacted Park's net deferred tax liabilities and qualified affordable housing tax credit investments. The effect of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was an increase to federal income tax expense at Park of $1.2 million for 2017.\nCREDIT EXPERIENCE\nProvision for Loan Losses: The provision for loan losses is the amount added to the allowance for loan losses to ensure the allowance is sufficient to absorb probable, incurred credit losses. The amount of the provision for loan losses is determined by management after reviewing the risk characteristics of the loan portfolio, historic and current loan loss experience and current economic conditions.\nThe table below provides additional information on the provision for loan losses and the ALLL for 2019, 2018 and 2017.\nTable 42: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Table 27 - ALLL Information </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In thousands) </td> <td>2019 </td> <td>2018 </td> <td>2017 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>ALLL, beginning balance </td> <td>$ </td> <td>51,512 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>49,988 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>50,624 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Charge-offs </td> <td>11,177 </td> <td> </td> <td>13,552 </td> <td> </td> <td>19,403 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Recoveries </td> <td>(10,173) </td> <td> </td> <td>(7,131) </td> <td> </td> <td>(10,210) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net charge-offs </td> <td>1,004 </td> <td> </td> <td>6,421 </td> <td> </td> <td>9,193 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Provision for loan losses: </td> <td>6,171 </td> <td> </td> <td>7,945 </td> <td> </td> <td>8,557 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> ALLL, ending balance </td> <td>$ </td> <td>56,679 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>51,512 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>49,988 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Average loans </td> <td>$ </td> <td>6,208,496 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,460,664 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,327,507 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net charge-offs as a percentage of average loans </td> <td>0.02 </td> <td>% </td> <td>0.12 </td> <td>% </td> <td>0.17 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, gross income of $5.5 million would have been recognized on loans that were nonaccrual as of December 31, 2019 had these loans been current in accordance with their original terms. Interest income on nonaccrual loans may be recorded on a cash basis and be included in earnings only when Park expects to receive the entire recorded investment of the loan. Of the $5.5 million that would have been recognized, approximately $3.7 million was included in interest income for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nCharge-offs for 2019 include the charge-off of $236,000 in specific reserves for which provision expense had been recognized in a prior year, compared to $20,000 for 2018 and $163,000 for 2017. Net charge-offs adjusted for changes in specific reserves as a percentage of average loans for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 were 0.06%, 0.15%, and 0.18%, respectively.\nLoans acquired as part of the acquisitions of NewDominion and Carolina Alliance were recorded at fair value on the date of acquisition. An allowance is only established on these loans as a result of credit deterioration post acquisition. As of December 31, 2019, there was no allowance related to acquired loans which were not designated as Purchased Credit Impaired (\"PCI\") and an allowance of $268,000 related to those acquired PCI loans.\nSEPH, as a non-bank subsidiary of Park, does not carry an ALLL balance, but recognizes a provision for loan losses when a charge-off is taken and recognizes a recovery of loan losses when a recovery is received.\nAt year-end 2019, the allowance for loan losses was $56.7 million, or 0.87%, of total loans outstanding, compared to $51.5 million, or 0.90%, of total loans outstanding at year-end 2018, and $50.0 million, or 0.93% of total loans outstanding at year-end 2017. The table below provides additional information related to specific reserves on impaired commercial loans, additional reserves on PCI loans and general reserves for all other loans in Park's portfolio at December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017.\nTable 43: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Table 28 - General Reserve Trends\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Allowance for loan losses, end of period </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>56,679 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>51,512 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>49,988 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Allowance on PCI loans </td> <td> </td> <td>268 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Specific reserves </td> <td> </td> <td>5,230 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,273 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>684 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> General reserves </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>51,181 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>49,239 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>49,304 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total loans </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>6,501,404 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,692,132 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,372,483 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>PCI loans (1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td>14,331 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,943 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impaired commercial loans </td> <td> </td> <td>77,459 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>48,135 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>56,545 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Non-impaired loans </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>6,409,614 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,640,054 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,315,938 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Allowance for loan losses as a percentage of year-end loans </td> <td> </td> <td>0.87 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>0.90 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>0.93 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General reserves as a percentage of non-impaired loans </td> <td> </td> <td>0.80 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>0.87 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>0.93 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>General reserves as a percentage of non-impaired loans (excluding performing acquired loans) </td> <td> </td> <td>0.88 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>0.91 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>N/A </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1) Excludes PCI loans which are individually evaluated for impairment due to additional credit deterioration post acquisition. These loans had a balance of $5,000 and $475,000 as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nSpecific reserves increased $3.0 million to $5.2 million at December 31, 2019, compared to $2.3 million at December 31, 2018. General reserves increased $2.0 million, or 3.9%, to $51.2 million at December 31, 2019, compared to $49.2 million at December 31, 2018. As of December 31, 2019, no allowance had been established for performing acquired loans. Excluding performing acquired loans, the general reserve as a percentage of total loans less impaired commercial loans was 0.88%.\nManagement believes that the allowance for loan losses at year-end 2019 is adequate to absorb probable, incurred credit losses in the loan portfolio.

industries nor did Park have any loans to foreign governments.\nNonperforming Assets: Nonperforming loans include: 1) loans whose interest is accounted for on a nonaccrual basis; 2) troubled debt restructurings (TDRs) on accrual status; and 3) loans which are contractually past due 90 days or more as to principal or interest payments, where interest continues to accrue. Park's management continues to evaluate TDRs to determine those that may be appropriate to return to accrual status. Specifically, if the restructured note has been current for a period of at least six months and management expects the borrower will remain current throughout the renegotiated contract, the loan may be returned to accrual status. Nonperforming assets include 1) nonperforming loans; 2) OREO which results from taking possession of property that served as collateral for a defaulted loan; and 3) other nonperforming assets. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, other nonperforming assets consisted of aircraft acquired as part of a loan workout. As of December 31, 2017, other nonperforming assets consisted of lease receivables acquired as part of a loan workout.\nGenerally, management obtains updated appraisal information for nonperforming loans and OREO annually. As new appraisal information is received, management performs an evaluation of the appraisal and applies a discount for anticipated disposition costs to determine the net realizable value of the collateral, which is compared to the outstanding principal balance to determine if additional write-downs are necessary.\nThe following is a summary of Park's nonaccrual loans, accruing TDRs, loans past due 90 days or more and still accruing, OREO, and other nonperforming assets at the end of each of the last five years:\nTable 46: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Table 31 - Nonperforming Assets </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td>2016 </td> <td> </td> <td>2015 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Nonaccrual loans </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>90,080 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>67,954 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>72,056 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>87,822 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>95,887 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Accruing TDRs </td> <td> </td> <td>21,215 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15,173 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>20,111 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18,175 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>24,979 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Loans past due 90 days or more and accruing </td> <td> </td> <td>2,658 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,243 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,792 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,086 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,921 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Total nonperforming loans </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>113,953 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>85,370 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>93,959 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>108,083 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>122,787 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>OREO </td> <td> </td> <td>4,029 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,303 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14,190 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13,926 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18,651 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other nonperforming assets </td> <td> </td> <td>3,599 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,464 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,849 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Total nonperforming assets </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>121,581 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>93,137 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>112,998 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>122,009 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>141,438 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Percentage of nonperforming loans to total loans </td> <td> </td> <td>1.75 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>1.50 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>1.75 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>2.05 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>2.42 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Percentage of nonperforming assets to total loans </td> <td> </td> <td>1.87 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>1.64 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>2.10 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>2.31 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>2.79 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Percentage of nonperforming assets to total assets </td> <td> </td> <td>1.42 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>1.19 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>1.50 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>1.63 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>1.93 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nCredit Quality Indicators: When determining the quarterly and annual loan loss provision, Park reviews the grades of commercial loans. These loans are graded from 1 to 8. A grade of 1 indicates little or no credit risk and a grade of 8 is considered a loss. Commercial loans that are pass-rated (1 through 4) are considered to be of acceptable credit risk. Commercial loans graded a 5 (special mention) are considered to be watch list credits and a higher loan loss reserve percentage is allocated to these loans. Commercial loans graded a 6 (substandard), also considered watch list credits, are considered to represent higher credit risk and, as a result, a higher loan loss reserve percentage is allocated to these loans. Generally, commercial loans that are graded a 6 are considered for partial charge-off or have been charged down to the net realizable value of the underlying collateral. Commercial loans graded a 7 (doubtful) are shown as nonperforming and Park charges these loans down to their fair value by taking a partial charge-off or recording a specific reserve. Any commercial loan graded an 8 (loss) is completely charged off.\nThe following table highlights the credit trends within the commercial loan portfolio.\nTable 47: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Table 32 - Commercial Credit Trends </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial loans * (In thousands) </td> <td>December 31, 2019 </td> <td>December 31, 2018 </td> <td>December 31, 2017 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Pass rated </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,418,159 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,894,548 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,662,327 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Special Mention </td> <td>27,367 </td> <td> </td> <td>16,027 </td> <td> </td> <td>23,059 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Substandard </td> <td>973 </td> <td> </td> <td>481 </td> <td> </td> <td>605 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impaired </td> <td>77,459 </td> <td> </td> <td>48,135 </td> <td> </td> <td>56,545 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Accruing PCI </td> <td>13,364 </td> <td> </td> <td>3,943 </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Total </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,537,322 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,963,134 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,742,536 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n* Commercial loans include: (1) Commercial, financial and agricultural loans, (2) Commercial real estate loans, (3) Commercial related loans in the construction real estate portfolio, (4) Commercial related loans in the residential real estate portfolio and (5) Leases.\nPark had $41.7 million of non-impaired commercial loans included on the watch list, including $13.4 million of PCI loans, at December 31, 2019, compared to $20.5 million of non-impaired commercial loans included on the watch list, including $3.9 million of PCI loans, at December 31, 2018, and $23.7 million of non-impaired commercial loans included on the watch list at December 31, 2017. Commercial loans include: (1) commercial, financial and agricultural loans; (2) commercial real estate loans; (3) certain real estate construction loans; (4) certain residential real estate loans; and (5) leases. Park's watch list includes all criticized and classified commercial loans, defined by Park as loans rated special mention or worse, less those commercial loans currently considered to be impaired. As a percentage of year-end total commercial loans, Park's watch list of potential problem commercial loans was 1.2% in 2019, 0.7% in 2018, and 0.9% in 2017. The existing conditions of these loans do not warrant classification as nonaccrual. However, these loans have shown some weakness and management performs additional analyses regarding each borrower's ability to comply with payment terms.\nDelinquencies have remained low over the past 36 months. Delinquent and accruing loans were $23.8 million, or 0.37% of total loans at December 31, 2019, compared to $31.4 million, or 0.55% of total loans at December 31, 2018, and $26.5 million, or 0.49% of total loans at December 31, 2017.\nImpaired Loans: Park's allowance for loan losses includes an allocation for loans specifically identified as impaired under GAAP. At December 31, 2019, loans considered to be impaired consisted substantially of commercial loans graded as \"substandard\" or doubtful\u201d and placed on non-accrual status. Specific reserves on impaired commercial loans are typically based on management's best estimate of the fair value of collateral securing these loans. The amount ultimately charged off for these loans may be different from the specific reserve as the ultimate liquidation of the collateral may be for amounts different from management's estimates.\nImpaired commercial loans were $77.5 million at December 31, 2019, an increase of $29.4 million, compared to $48.1 million at December 31, 2018. The $77.5 million of impaired commercial loans at December 31, 2019 included $8.4 million of loans modified in a troubled debt restructuring which are currently on accrual status and performing in accordance with the restructured terms, up from $3.2 million at December 31, 2018. Impaired commercial loans are individually evaluated for impairment and specific reserves are established to cover any probable, incurred losses for those loans that have not been charged down to the net realizable value of the underlying collateral or to the net present value of expected cash flows.\nAs of December 31, 2019, management had taken partial charge-offs of approximately $719,000 related to the $77.5 million of commercial loans considered to be impaired, compared to charge-offs of approximately $11.2 million related to the $48.1 million of impaired commercial loans at December 31, 2018.

In conjunction with the Carolina Alliance acquisition, Park acquired loans with deteriorated credit quality with a book value of $19.9 million which were recorded at the initial fair value of $18.4 million. The carrying amount of loans acquired with deteriorated credit quality at December 31, 2019 was $14.3 million, of which $5,000 were considered impaired due to additional credit deterioration post acquisition. The remaining $14.3 million were not included in impaired loan totals. The carrying amount of loans acquired with deteriorated credit quality at December 31, 2018 was $4.4 million, of which $475,000 were considered impaired due to additional credit deterioration post acquisition. The remaining $3.9 million were not included in impaired loan totals.\nAllowance for loan losses: Loss factors are reviewed quarterly and updated at least annually to reflect recent loan loss history and incorporate current risk and trends which may not be recognized in historical data.\nA significant portion of Park's allowance for loan losses is allocated to commercial loans. Special mention\u201d loans are loans that have potential weaknesses that may result in loss exposure to Park. Substandard\u201d loans are those that exhibit a well-defined weakness, jeopardizing repayment of the loans, resulting in a higher probability that Park will suffer a loss on the loans unless the weakness is corrected. Excluding acquired loans, the allowance for loan losses related to performing commercial loans was $34.5 million or 1.15% of the outstanding principal balance of other accruing commercial loans at December 31, 2019. Excluding acquired loans, at December 31, 2019, the coverage level within the commercial loan portfolio was approximately 3.40 years compared to 3.39 years at December 31, 2018. Historical loss experience, defined as charge-offs plus changes in specific reserves, over the past 120 months for the commercial loan portfolio was 0.34% for 2019. Historical loss experience over the past 108 months for the commercial portfolio was 0.35% for 2018. This 120-month loss experience includes only the performance of the PNB loan portfolio and excludes the impact of PNB participations in Vision Bank loans.\nExcluding acquired loans, the overall reserve of 1.15% for other accruing commercial loans breaks down as follows: pass-rated commercial loans are reserved at 1.12%; special mention commercial loans are reserved at 5.02%; and substandard commercial loans are reserved at 2.22%. The reserve levels for pass-rated, special mention and substandard commercial loans in excess of the annualized 120-month loss experience of 0.34% are due to the following factors which management reviews on a quarterly or annual basis:\n\u2022Historical Loss Factor: Management updated the historical loss calculation during the fourth quarter of 2019, incorporating annualized net charge-offs plus changes in specific reserves through December 31, 2019. With the addition of 2019 historical losses, management extended the historical loss period to 120 months from 108 months. The 120 month historical loss period captures all annual periods subsequent to June 2009, the end of the most recent recession, thus encompassing the full economic cycle to date.\n\u2022Loss Emergence Period Factor: At least annually, management calculates the loss emergence period for each commercial loan segment. This loss emergence period is calculated based upon the average period of time it takes from the probable occurrence of a loss event to the credit being moved to nonaccrual. If the loss emergence period for any commercial loan segment is greater than one year, management applies additional general reserves to all performing loans within that segment of the commercial loan portfolio. The loss emergence period was last updated in the fourth quarter of 2019.\n\u2022Loss Migration Factor: Park's commercial loans are individually risk graded. If loan downgrades occur, the probability of default increases, and accordingly, management allocates a higher percentage reserve to those accruing commercial loans graded special mention and substandard. Annually, management calculates a loss migration factor for each commercial loan segment for special mention and substandard credits based on a review of losses over the period of time a loan takes to migrate from pass-rated to impaired. The loss migration factor was last updated in the fourth quarter of 2019.\n\u2022Environmental Loss Factor: Management has identified certain macroeconomic factors that trend in accordance with losses in Park's commercial loan portfolio. Certain environmental loss factors were determined to correlate with higher charge-offs while other adjustments are based on a subjective evaluation of other environmental loss factors. Environmental factors applicable to the commercial loan portfolio include: the Ohio unemployment rate, the 10-year Treasury index, the consumer confidence index, the prevalence of fixed rate loans in the portfolio and other environmental factors. In evaluating the ongoing relevance and amount of the other environmental factors, management considers: changes in lending policies and procedures, including changes in underwriting standards and collection, charge-off and recovery practices, changes in national and local economic and business conditions, and developments that affect the collectability of the portfolio, and the effect of other external factors such as competition and legal and regulatory requirements on the level of estimated losses in Park's existing portfolio. All of these factors are evaluated in relation to the historical look back period. At December 31, 2019, such subjective environmental loss factor inputs accounted for approximately one half of the allowance for loan losses driven by environmental loss factors.\nThese macroeconomic factors are reviewed quarterly and the adjustments made to the environmental loss factor impacting each segment in the performing commercial loan portfolio correlate to changes in the macroeconomic environment. No changes were deemed necessary to the environmental factors in the fourth quarter of 2019.\nGenerally, consumer loans are not individually graded. Consumer loans include: (1) mortgage and installment loans included in the construction real estate segment of the loan portfolio; (2) mortgage, home equity lines of credit (HELOC), and installment loans included in the residential real estate segment of the loan portfolio; and (3) all loans included in the consumer segment of the loan portfolio. The amount of loan loss reserve assigned to these loans is based on historical loss experience over the past 120 months, through December 31, 2019. Management generally considers a one-year coverage period (the Historical Loss Factor\u201d) appropriate because the probable loss on any given loan in the consumer loan pool should ordinarily become apparent in that time frame. However, management may incorporate adjustments to the Historical Loss Factor as circumstances warrant additional reserves (e.g., increased loan delinquencies, borrower bankruptcy status, improving or deteriorating economic conditions, changes in lending management and underwriting standards, etc.). Excluding acquired loans, at December 31, 2019, the coverage level within the consumer loan portfolio was approximately 1.90 years compared to 1.87 years at December 31, 2018. Historical loss experience over the past 120 months for the consumer loan portfolio was 0.31% for 2019. This compares to historical loss experience over a 108-month period for the consumer loan portfolio of 0.33% for 2018.\nThe judgmental increases discussed above incorporate management's evaluation of the impact of environmental qualitative factors which pose additional risks and assignment of a component of the allowance for loan losses in consideration of these factors. Such environmental factors include: national and local economic trends and conditions; experience, ability and depth of lending management and staff; effects of any changes in lending policies and procedures; and levels of, and trends in, consumer bankruptcies, delinquencies, impaired loans, and charge-offs and recoveries. The determination of this component of the allowance for loan losses requires considerable management judgment. Management is working to address weaknesses in those loans that may result in future loss. Actual loss experience may be more or less than the amount allocated.\nLoans acquired as part of the acquisitions of NewDominion and Carolina Alliance were recorded at fair value on the date of acquisition. An allowance is only established on these loans as a result of credit deterioration post acquisition. As of December 31, 2019, there was no allowance related to performing acquired loans. As of December 31, 2019, a reserve of $268,000 had been established related to PCI loans.\nCurrent Expected Credit Losses: In June 2016, FASB issued ASU 2016-13 - Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments. The new accounting guidance in this ASU replaces the incurred loss model with an expected loss model, which is referred to as the current expected credit loss (\"CECL\") model. The CECL model is applicable to the measurement of credit losses on financial assets measured at amortized cost, including loan receivables, HTM debt securities, and reinsurance receivables. It also applies to off-balance sheet credit exposures not accounted for as insurance (loan commitments, standby letters of credit, financial guarantees, and other similar instruments) and net investments in leases recognized by a lessor. The CECL model requires an entity to estimate credit losses over the life of an asset or off-balance sheet exposure. The new accounting guidance is effective for annual reporting periods and interim reporting periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2019.\nManagement is currently evaluating the impact of adoption of this new accounting guidance on Park's consolidated financial statements. Adoption will be applied through a one-time cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the first reporting period in which the guidance is effective. Management adopted the guidance on January 1, 2020 and implemented changes to relevant systems as necessary. Management has developed a credit model and has begun the process of validation, which will be completed during the first quarter of 2020. Management is still finalizing the analysis of qualitative factors, to capture inherent risks, which are not included within the quantitative model. Management, along with Park's CECL Committee, is in the process of implementing the accounting, processes, controls and governance required to comply with the new accounting guidance.\nBased on a preliminary analysis performed in the third quarter of 2019 and forecasts of macroeconomic conditions and exposures as of December 31, 2019, the transition adjustment on January 1, 2020 is not expected to generate an allowance to loans ratio more than 120% of the current recorded allowance at December 31, 2019. The Company currently intends to use a blend of multiple economic forecasts to estimate expected credit losses over a one year reasonable and supportable forecast period and then revert, over a one year period, to longer term historical loss experience to arrive at lifetime expected credit losses. The estimated increase in the allowance is primarily due to required increases for residential mortgage, home equity, and installment loans to include the requirement to estimate lifetime expected credit losses and the remaining length of time to maturity for these loans as well as an increase in reserves on acquired non-impaired loans which had low reserve levels under the previous accounting guidance. Offsetting declines in the allowance are expected for commercial and commercial real estate loans due to their short-term nature. Additionally, management expects an increase in the allowance for credit losses for unfunded commitments.\nWhile adoption of this ASU is expected to increase the allowance for credit losses, it does not change the overall credit risk in the Company's loan, lease and securities portfolios or the ultimate losses therein. The transition adjustment to increase the allowance will primarily result in a decrease to shareholders' equity, net of income taxes, on January 1, 2020. The ultimate impact of the adoption of this ASU will depend on the composition of the loan, lease and securities portfolios, finalization of credit loss models, and macroeconomic conditions and forecasts that existed at the adoption date.\nCAPITAL RESOURCES\nLiquidity and Interest Rate Sensitivity Management: Park's objective in managing its liquidity is to maintain the ability to continuously meet the cash flow needs of customers, such as borrowings or deposit withdrawals, while at the same time seeking higher yields from longer-term lending and investing activities.\nCash and cash equivalents decreased by $7.3 million during 2019 to $160.0 million at year end. Cash provided by operating activities was $111.0 million in 2019, $131.8 million in 2018 and $86.7 million in 2017. Net income was the primary source of cash provided by operating activities during each year.\nCash provided by investing activities was $60.1 million in 2019 and $45.4 million in 2018, and cash used in investing activities was $60.7 million in 2017. Investment securities transactions and loan originations/repayments are the major uses or sources of cash in investing activities. Proceeds from the sale, repayment or maturity of investment securities provide cash and purchases of investment securities use cash. Net investment securities transactions provided cash of $302.2 million in 2019, $77.8 million in 2018, and $68.7 million in 2017. Cash used by the net increase in the loan portfolio was $216.4 million in 2019, $57.3 million in 2018, and $119.3 million in 2017.\nCash used in financing activities was $178.4 million in 2019, $179.1 million in 2018, and $3.4 million in 2017. A major source of cash provided by or used in financing activities is the net change in deposits. Deposits increased and provided $159.7 million of cash in 2019, $159.6 million of cash in 2018, and $295.4 million of cash in 2017. Other major sources of cash from financing activities are short-term borrowings and long-term debt. In 2019, net short-term borrowings decreased and used $20.1 million in cash and net long-term debt decreased and used $207.5 million in cash. In 2018, net short-term borrowings decreased and used $169.3 million in cash and net long-term debt decreased and used $100.0 million in cash. In 2017, net short-term borrowings decreased and used $3.5 million in cash and net long-term debt decreased and used $230.0 million in cash. Cash used in the repurchase of common shares was $40.5 million in 2019, $5.8 million in 2018 and $7.4 million in 2017. Finally, cash declined by $69.1 million in 2019, $63.0 million in 2018, and $57.5 million in 2017, from the payment of cash dividends.\nFunds are available from a number of sources, including the capital markets, the investment securities portfolio, the core deposit base, FHLB borrowings, the capability to securitize or package loans for sale, and a $15.0 million revolving line of credit with another financial institution, which did not have an outstanding balance as of December 31, 2019. In the opinion of Park's management, the present funding sources provide more than adequate liquidity for Park to meet our cash flow needs.\nThe following table shows interest rate sensitivity data

subject to prepayment are shown in the table by the earlier of their re-pricing date or their expected repayment date and not by their contractual maturity date. Nonaccrual loans of $90.1 million are included within the three-month to twelve-month maturity category.\n(2)Management considers interest bearing transaction accounts and savings accounts to be core deposits and, therefore, not as rate sensitive as other deposit accounts and borrowed money. Accordingly, only 50% of interest bearing transaction accounts and 49% of savings accounts are considered to re-price within one year. If all of the interest bearing transaction accounts and savings accounts were considered to re-price within one year, the one-year cumulative gap would change from a positive 3.89% to a negative 21.60%.\nThe interest rate sensitivity gap analysis provides an overall picture of Park's static interest rate risk position. At December 31, 2019, the cumulative interest earning assets maturing or repricing within twelve months were $3,359 million compared to the cumulative interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within twelve months of $3,057 million. For the twelve-month cumulative interest rate sensitivity gap position, rate sensitive assets exceeded rate sensitive liabilities by $303 million or 3.89% of interest earning assets.\nA positive twelve-month cumulative rate sensitivity gap (assets exceed liabilities) would suggest that Park's net interest margin would increase if interest rates were to increase. Conversely, a negative twelve-month cumulative rate sensitivity gap would suggest that Park's net interest margin would decrease if interest rates were to increase. However, the usefulness of the interest rate sensitivity gap analysis as a forecasting tool in projecting net interest income is limited. The gap analysis does not consider the magnitude, timing or frequency by which assets or liabilities will reprice during a period and also contains assumptions as to the repricing of transaction and savings accounts that may not prove to be correct.\nThe cumulative twelve-month interest rate sensitivity gap position at year-end 2018 was a positive $308 million or 4.31% of total interest earning assets. The percentage of interest earning assets maturing or repricing within one year was 43.2% at year-end 2019, compared to 41.3% at year-end 2018. The percentage of interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within one year was 55.3% at year-end 2019, compared to 52.0% at year-end 2018.\nManagement supplements the interest rate sensitivity gap analysis with periodic simulations of balance sheet sensitivity under various interest rate and what-if scenarios to better forecast and manage the net interest margin. Park's\nmanagement uses an earnings simulation model to analyze net interest income sensitivity to movements in interest rates. This model is based on actual cash flows and repricing characteristics for balance sheet instruments and incorporates market-based assumptions regarding the impact of changing interest rates on the prepayment rate of certain assets and liabilities. This model also includes management's projections for activity levels of various balance sheet instruments and non-interest fee income and operating expense. Assumptions based on the historical behavior of deposit rates and balances in relation to changes in interest rates are also incorporated into this earnings simulation model. These assumptions are inherently uncertain and, as a result, the model cannot precisely measure net interest income and net income. Actual results will differ from simulated results due to the timing, magnitude and frequency of interest rate changes as well as changes in market conditions and management strategies.\nManagement uses a 50 basis point change in market interest rates per quarter for a total of 200 basis points per year in evaluating the impact of changing interest rates on net interest income and net income over a twelve-month horizon. At December 31, 2019, the earnings simulation model projected that net income would decrease by 1.9% using a rising interest rate scenario and increase by 0.5% using a declining interest rate scenario over the next year. At December 31, 2018, the earnings simulation model projected that net income would decrease by 0.4% using a rising interest rate scenario and decrease by 3.1% using a declining interest rate scenario over the next year. At December 31, 2017, the earnings simulation model projected that net income would decrease by 1.8% using a rising interest rate scenario and decrease by 5.2% using a declining interest rate scenario over the next year. Consistently, over the past several years, Park's earnings simulation model has projected that changes in interest rates would have only a small impact on net income and the net interest margin.

Commitments are funded when capital calls are made by the general partner. Park expects that the current commitments will be funded between 2020 and 2029.\nAs of December 31, 2019, Park had $8.5 million in unfunded commitments related to certain equity investments which are not included in \"Table 35 - Contractual Obligations\" above. Commitments are funded when capital calls are made by the general partner.\nThe Corporation's operating lease obligations represent short-term and long-term lease and rental payments for facilities and equipment. Purchase obligations represent obligations under agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding on the Corporation.\nCommitments, Contingent Liabilities, and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements: In order to meet the financing needs of our customers, the Corporation issues loan commitments and standby letters of credit. At December 31, 2019, the Corporation had $1,309.9 million of loan commitments for commercial, commercial real estate, and residential real estate loans and had $17.2 million of standby letters of credit. At December 31, 2018, the Corporation had $1,012.8 million of loan commitments for commercial, commercial real estate, and residential real estate loans and had $13.3 million of standby letters of credit.\nCommitments to extend credit under loan commitments and standby letters of credit do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. These commitments often expire without being drawn upon. However, all of the loan commitments and standby letters of credit were permitted to be drawn upon in 2019. See \"Note 25 - Financial Instruments with Off-Balance Sheet Risk and Financial Instruments with Concentration of Credit Risk\" of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in \"ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA\" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, for additional information on loan commitments and standby letters of credit.\nThe Corporation did not have any unrecorded significant contingent liabilities at December 31, 2019.\nCapital: Park's primary means of maintaining capital adequacy is through retained earnings. At December 31, 2019, the Corporation's total shareholders' equity was $969.0 million, compared to $832.5 million at December 31, 2018. Total shareholders' equity at December 31, 2019 was 11.32% of total assets, compared to 10.67% of total assets at December 31, 2018.\nTangible shareholders' equity was $797.9 million [total shareholders' equity ($969.0 million) less goodwill ($159.6 million) and other intangible assets ($11.5 million)] at December 31, 2019 and was $712.8 million [total shareholders' equity ($832.5 million) less goodwill ($112.7 million) and other intangible assets ($7.0 million)] at December 31, 2018. At December 31, 2019, tangible shareholders' equity was 9.51% of total tangible assets [total assets ($8,558 million) less goodwill ($159.6 million) and other intangible assets ($11.5 million)], compared to tangible shareholders' equity was 9.28% of total tangible assets [total assets ($7,804 million) less goodwill ($112.7 million) and other intangible assets ($7.0 million)].\nNet income was $102.7 million in 2019, $110.4 million in 2018 and $84.2 million in 2017.\nCash dividends declared for Park's common shares were $69.5 million in 2019, $63.6 million in 2018 and $57.9 million in 2017. On a per share basis, the cash dividends declared were $4.24 per share in 2019, $4.07 per share in 2018 and $3.76 per share in 2017.\nThe table below shows the repurchases and issuances of common shares and treasury shares for 2017 through 2019.\nTable 51: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Table 36 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In thousands, except share data) </td> <td>Treasury Shares </td> <td>Number of Common Shares </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Balance at January 1, 2017 </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(81,472) </td> <td> </td> <td>15,340,718 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash payment for fractional shares in dividend reinvestment plan </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td>(55) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Treasury shares repurchased </td> <td>(7,378) </td> <td> </td> <td>(70,000) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Treasury shares reissued for share-based compensation awards </td> <td>645 </td> <td> </td> <td>6,381 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Treasury shares reissued for director grants </td> <td>1,126 </td> <td> </td> <td>11,150 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Balance at December 31, 2017 </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(87,079) </td> <td> </td> <td>15,288,194 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash payment for fractional shares in dividend reinvestment plan </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td>(44) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Common shares issued for the acquisition of NewDominion Bank </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td>435,457 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Treasury shares repurchased </td> <td>(5,784) </td> <td> </td> <td>(50,000) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Treasury shares reissued for share-based compensation awards </td> <td>1,304 </td> <td> </td> <td>12,921 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Treasury shares reissued for director grants </td> <td>1,186 </td> <td> </td> <td>11,650 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Balance at December 31, 2018 </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(90,373) </td> <td> </td> <td>15,698,178 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash payment for fractional shares in dividend reinvestment plan </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td>(171) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Common shares issued for the acquisition of CAB Financial Corporation </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td>1,037,205 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Treasury shares repurchased </td> <td>(40,535) </td> <td> </td> <td>(421,253) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Treasury shares reissued for share-based compensation awards </td> <td>1,926 </td> <td> </td> <td>18,983 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Treasury shares reissued for director grants </td> <td>1,349 </td> <td> </td> <td>13,500 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Balance at December 31, 2019 </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(127,633) </td> <td> </td> <td>16,346,442 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nPark issued 1,037,205 and 435,457 new common shares, which had not already been held as treasury shares, during 2019 and 2018 in the acquisitions of CABF and NewDominion, respectively, but did not issue any new common shares, which had not already been held as treasury shares, in 2017. Common shares had a balance of $459.4 million, $358.6 million, and $307.7 million at December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively.\nAccumulated other comprehensive loss (net) was $9.6 million at December 31, 2019, compared to $49.8 million at December 31, 2018, and $26.5 million at December 31, 2017. During the 2019 year, the change in net unrealized holding gain (loss) on AFS debt securities, net of income tax, was a gain of $37.7 million. During the 2018 year, the change in net unrealized holding gain (loss) on AFS debt securities, net of income tax, was a loss of $15.6 million. During the 2017 year, the change in net unrealized holding gain (loss) on AFS debt securities, net of income tax, was a gain of $77,000. Additionally, Park recognized an other comprehensive gain of $3.0 million, net of income tax, related to the change in pension plan assets and benefit obligations in 2019, compared to an other comprehensive loss of $3.0 million, net of income tax, related to the change in pension plan assets and benefit obligations in 2018, and an other comprehensive loss of $8.8 million, net of income tax, related to the change in pension plan assets and benefit obligations in 2017. Finally, during the 2019 year, Park recognized an other comprehensive loss of $454,000, net of income tax, related to an unrealized net holding loss on cash flow hedging derivatives. Beginning accumulated other comprehensive loss (net) as of January 1, 2018, included a $995,000 adjustment related to the adoption of ASU 2016-01- Financial Instruments - Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities.\nFinancial institution regulators have established guidelines for minimum capital ratios for banks, thrifts and bank holding companies. Park has elected not to include the net unrealized gain or loss on AFS debt securities in computing regulatory capital. During the first quarter of 2015, Park adopted the Basel III regulatory capital framework as approved by the federal banking agencies. The adoption of this framework modified the calculation of the various capital ratios, added an additional ratio, common equity tier 1, and revised the adequately and well-capitalized thresholds under the prompt corrective action regulations applicable to PNB. Additionally, under this framework, in order to avoid limitations on capital distributions, including dividend payments and stock repurchases, Park must hold a capital conservation buffer above the adequately capitalized risk-based capital ratios. The capital conservation buffer began to phase in starting on January 1, 2016 at .625% and, effective January 1, 2019, was fully phased in at 2.50%. The capital conservation buffer was 2.50% for 2019, and 1.875% for 2018. The amounts shown below as the adequately capitalized ratio plus capital conservation buffer includes the fully phased-in 2.50% buffer. The Federal Reserve Board also adopted requirements Park must maintain to be deemed \"well-capitalized\" and to remain a financial holding company.\nPark and PNB met each of the well-capitalized ratio guidelines applicable to them at December 31, 2019. The following table indicates the capital ratios for PNB and Park at December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018.\nTable 52: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Table 37 - PNB and Park Capital Ratios </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>As of December 31, 2019 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Leverage </td> <td> </td> <td>Tier 1\nRisk-Based </td> <td> </td> <td>Common Equity Tier 1 </td> <td> </td> <td>Total\nRisk-Based </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>PNB </td> <td>8.62 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>11.05 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>11.05 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>12.25 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Park </td> <td>9.64 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>12.33 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>12.11 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>13.19 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adequately capitalized ratio </td> <td>4.00 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>6.00 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>4.50 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>8.00 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adequately capitalized ratio plus capital conservation buffer </td> <td>4.00 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>8.50 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>7.00 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>10.50 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Well-capitalized ratio - PNB </td> <td>5.00 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>8.00 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>6.50 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>10.00 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Well-capitalized ratio - Park </td> <td>N/A </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6.00 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>N/A </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10.00 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 53: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>As of December 31, 2018 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Leverage </td> <td> </td> <td>Tier 1\nRisk-Based </td> <td> </td> <td>Common Equity Tier 1 </td> <td> </td> <td>Total\nRisk-Based </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>PNB </td> <td>8.29 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>11.01 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>11.01 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>12.30 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Park </td> <td>10.04 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>13.30 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>13.04 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>14.19 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adequately capitalized ratio </td> <td>4.00 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>6.00 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>4.50 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>8.00 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adequately capitalized ratio plus capital conservation buffer </td> <td>4.00 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>8.50 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>7.00 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>10.50 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Well-capitalized ratio - PNB </td> <td>5.00 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>8.00 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>6.50 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>10.00 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Well-capitalized ratio - Park </td> <td>N/A </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6.00 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>N/A </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10.00 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nEffects of Inflation: Balance sheets of financial institutions typically contain assets and liabilities that are monetary in nature and, therefore, differ greatly from most commercial and industrial companies which have significant investments in premises, equipment and inventory. During periods of inflation, financial institutions that are in a net positive monetary position will experience a decline in purchasing power, which does have an impact on growth. Another significant effect on internal equity growth is other expenses, which tend to rise during periods of inflation.\nManagement believes the most significant impact on financial results is the Corporation's ability to align our asset/liability management program to react to changes in interest rates.",

    "item_7_text": "ITEM 7.MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\nFORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\nManagement's discussion and analysis addresses the financial condition and results of operations for Park National Corporation and our subsidiaries (unless the context otherwise requires, collectively, \"Park\" or the \"Corporation\"). This discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes and the five-year summary of selected financial data included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Management's discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that are provided to assist in the understanding of anticipated future financial performance. Forward-looking statements provide current expectations or forecasts of future events and are not guarantees of future performance. The forward-looking statements are based on management's expectations and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. Although management believes that the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are reasonable, actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in such statements. Risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially include, without limitation: Park's ability to execute our business plan successfully and within the expected timeframe as well as Park's ability to manage strategic initiatives; general economic and financial market conditions, specifically in the real estate markets and the credit markets, either nationally or in the states in which Park and our subsidiaries do business, may experience a slowing or reversal of the current economic expansion in addition to continuing residual effects of prior recessionary conditions and an uneven spread of positive impacts of recovery on the economy and our counterparties, resulting in adverse impacts on the demand for loan, deposit and other financial services, delinquencies, defaults and counterparties' inability to meet credit and other obligations and the possible impairment of collectability of loans; changes in interest rates and prices as well as disruption in the liquidity and functioning of U.S. financial markets may adversely impact prepayment penalty income, mortgage banking income, income from fiduciary activities, the value of securities, loans, deposits and other financial instruments and the interest rate sensitivity of our consolidated balance sheet as well as reduce interest margins and impact loan demand; changes in consumer spending, borrowing and saving habits, whether due to changes in retail distribution strategies, consumer preferences and behavior, changes in business and economic\nconditions, legislative and regulatory initiatives, or other factors may be different than anticipated; changes in unemployment may be different than anticipated; changes in customers', suppliers', and other counterparties' performance and creditworthiness may be different than anticipated; the adequacy of our internal controls and risk management program in the event of changes in the market, economic, operational, asset/liability repricing, legal, compliance, strategic, cybersecurity, liquidity, credit and interest rate risks associated with Park's business; our liquidity requirements could be adversely affected by changes to regulations governing bank and bank holding company capital and liquidity standards as well as by changes in our assets and liabilities; competitive pressures among financial services organizations could increase significantly, including product and pricing pressures (which could in turn impact our credit spreads), customer acquisition and retention, changes to third-party relationships and revenues, changes in the manner of providing services, customer acquisition and retention pressures, and our ability to attract, develop and retain qualified banking professionals; customers could pursue alternatives to bank deposits, causing us to lose a relatively inexpensive source of funding; uncertainty regarding the nature, timing, cost and effect of changes in banking regulations or other regulatory or legislative requirements affecting the respective businesses of Park and our subsidiaries, including major reform of the regulatory oversight structure of the financial services industry and changes in laws and regulations concerning taxes, FDIC insurance premium levels, pensions, bankruptcy, consumer protection, rent regulation and housing, financial accounting and reporting, environmental protection, insurance, bank products and services, bank capital and liquidity standards, fiduciary standards, securities and other aspects of the financial services industry, specifically the reforms provided for in the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the Dodd-Frank Act\u201d) and the Basel III regulatory capital reforms, as well as regulations already adopted and which may be adopted in the future by the relevant regulatory agencies, including the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and the Federal Reserve Board, to implement the Dodd-Frank Act's provisions, and the Basel III regulatory capital reforms; the effects of easing restrictions on participants in the financial services industry; the effect of changes in accounting policies and practices, as may be adopted by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the \"FASB\"), the SEC, the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board and other regulatory agencies, including the extent to which the new current expected credit loss accounting standard issued by the FASB in June 2016 and effective for Park as of January 1, 2020, which will require banks to record, at the time of origination, credit losses expected throughout the life of the asset portfolio on loans and held-to-maturity securities, as opposed to the current practice of recording losses when it is probable that a loss event has occurred, may adversely affect Park's reported financial condition or results of operations; Park's assumptions and estimates used in applying critical accounting policies and modeling, which may prove unreliable, inaccurate or not predictive of actual results; significant changes in the tax laws, which may adversely affect the fair values of net deferred tax assets and obligations of state and political subdivisions held in Park's investment securities portfolio; the impact of our ability to anticipate and respond to technological changes and our ability to respond to customer needs and meet competitive demands; operational issues stemming from and/or capital spending necessitated by the potential need to adapt to industry changes in information technology systems on which Park and our subsidiaries are highly dependent; the ability to secure confidential information and deliver products and services through the use of computer systems and telecommunications networks; a failure in or breach of our operational or security systems or infrastructure, or those of our third-party vendors and other service providers, resulting in failures or disruptions in customer account management, general ledger, deposit, loan, or other systems, including as a result of cyber attacks; the existence or exacerbation of general geopolitical instability and uncertainty; the effect of trade policies (including the impact of potential or imposed tariffs, a U.S. withdrawal from or significant renegotiation of trade agreements, trade wars and other changes in trade regulations and changes in the relationship of the U.S. and its global trading partners), monetary and other fiscal policies (including the impact of money supply and interest rate policies to the Federal Reserve Board) and other governmental policies of the U.S. federal government; the impact on financial markets and the economy of any changes in the credit ratings of the U.S. Treasury obligations and other U.S. government-backed debt, as well as issues surrounding the levels of U.S., European and Asian government debt and concerns regarding the creditworthiness of certain sovereign governments, supranationals and financial institutions in Europe and Asia; the uncertainty surrounding the impact of the United Kingdom's exit from the European Union; our litigation and regulatory compliance exposure, including the costs and effects of any adverse developments in legal proceedings or other claims and the costs and effects of unfavorable resolution of regulatory and other governmental examinations or other inquiries; continued availability of earnings and excess capital sufficient for the lawful and prudent declaration of dividends; the impact on Park's business, personnel, facilities or systems of losses related to acts of fraud, scams and schemes of third parties; the impact of widespread natural and other disasters, pandemics, dislocations, civil unrest, terrorist activities or international hostilities on the economy and financial markets generally and on us or our counterparties specifically; the effect of healthcare laws in the U.S. and potential changes for such laws which may increase our healthcare and other costs and negatively impact our operations and financial results; Park's ability to integrate recent acquisitions as well as to identify, make or integrate any future suitable strategic acquisitions, which may be unsuccessful, or may be more difficult, time-consuming or costly than expected; risk and uncertainties associated with Park's entry into new geographic markets with its recent acquisitions, including expected revenue synergies and cost savings from recent acquisitions not being fully realized or realized within the expected time frame; difficulty of retaining and hiring employees in new markets; Park issued equity securities in the acquisitions of NewDominion Bank and Carolina Alliance and may issue equity securities in connection with future acquisitions, which could cause ownership and economic dilution to Park's current shareholders; the transition away from the London Inter-Bank Offered\nRate (LIBOR) as a reference rate for financial instruments, which may result in increased expenses and litigation, and adversely impact the value of various financial instruments; and other risk factors relating to the banking industry as detailed from time to time in Park's reports filed with the SEC including those described in \"Item 1A. RISK FACTORS\" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Park does not undertake, and specifically disclaims any obligation, to publicly release the results of any revisions that may be made to update any forward-looking statement to reflect the events or circumstances after the date on which the forward-looking statement was made, or reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events, except to the extent required by law.\nNON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\nManagement's discussion and analysis contains non-U.S. GAAP financial measures where management believes it to be helpful in understanding Park's results of operations or financial position. Where non-U.S. GAAP financial measures are used, the comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure, as well as the reconciliation to the comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure, can be found herein.\nItems Impacting Comparability of Period Results\nFrom time to time, revenue, expenses, and/or taxes are impacted by items judged by management of Park to be outside of ordinary banking activities and/or by items that, while they may be associated with ordinary banking activities, are so unusually large that their outsized impact is believed by management of Park at that time to be infrequent or short-term in nature. Most often, these items impacting comparability of period results are due to merger and acquisition activities and revenue and expenses related to former Vision Bank loan relationships. In other cases, they may result from management's decisions associated with significant corporate actions outside of the ordinary course of business.\nEven though certain revenue and expense items are naturally subject to more volatility than others due to changes in market and economic environment conditions, as a general rule volatility alone does not result in the inclusion of an item as one impacting comparability of period results. For example, changes in the provision for credit losses (aside from former Vision Bank loan relationships), gains (losses) on equity securities, and asset valuation writedowns, reflect ordinary banking activities and are, therefore, typically excluded from consideration as items impacting comparability of period results.\nManagement believes the disclosure of items impacting comparability of period results provides a better understanding of our performance and trends and allows management to ascertain which of such items, if any, to include or exclude from an analysis of our performance; i.e., within the context of determining how that performance differed from expectations, as well as how, if at all, to adjust estimates of future performance taking such items into account.\nItems impacting comparability of the results of particular periods are not intended to be a complete list of items that may materially impact current or future period performance.\nNon-GAAP Ratios\nPark's management uses certain non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate Park's performance. Specifically, management reviews the ratio of tangible equity to tangible assets.\nManagement has included in MD&A information relating to the ratio of tangible equity to tangible assets. For the purpose of calculating the ratio of tangible equity to tangible assets, a non-GAAP financial measure, tangible equity is divided by tangible assets. Tangible equity equals total shareholders' equity less goodwill and other intangible assets, in each case at period end. Tangible assets equals total assets less goodwill and other intangible assets, in each case at period end.\nManagement believes that the disclosure of the ratio of tangible equity to tangible assets presents additional information to the reader of the consolidated financial statements, which, when read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP, assists in analyzing Park's operating performance, ensures comparability of operating performance from period to period, and facilitates comparisons with the performance of Park's peer financial holding companies and bank holding companies, while eliminating certain non-operational effects of acquisitions. Within the \"CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS - Capital\" section of this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Park has provided detail of the reconciliation of tangible equity to total shareholders' equity and of tangible assets to total assets solely for the purpose of complying with SEC Regulation G and not as an indication that the ratio of tangible equity to tangible assets is a substitute for the ratio of total shareholders' equity to total assets as determined in accordance with GAAP.\nFTE (fully taxable equivalent) Ratios\nInterest income, yields, and ratios on a FTE basis are considered non-U.S. GAAP financial measures. Management believes net interest income on a FTE basis provides an insightful picture of the interest margin for comparison purposes. The FTE basis also allows management to assess the comparability of revenue arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources. The FTE basis assumes a federal statutory tax rate of 21% for 2018 and 2019 and 35% for 2017 and prior years. In the tables included within the \"ANALYSIS OF EARNINGS - Net Interest Income\" section of this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Park has provided detail of FTE interest income solely for the purpose of complying with SEC Regulation G and not as an indication that FTE interest income, yields and ratios are substitutes for interest income, yields and ratios, as determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\nOVERVIEW\nFinancial Results by segment\nThe table below reflects the net income (loss) by segment for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017. Park's segments include The Park National Bank (\"PNB\"), Guardian Financial Services Company (\"GFSC\") and \"All Other\" which primarily consists of Park as the \"Parent Company\" and SE Property Holdings, LLC (\"SEPH\"). SEPH is a non-bank subsidiary of Park, holding former Vision Bank OREO property and non-performing loans.\n\nNet income for the year ended December 31, 2019 of $102.7 million represented a $7.7 million, or 7.0%, decrease compared to $110.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Net income for both the year ended December 31, 2019 and the year ended December 31, 2018 included several items of income and expense that impact the comparability of period results. These items are detailed in the \"Items Impacting Comparability\" section below.\nThe following discussion provides additional information regarding Park's two operating segments, followed by additional information regarding All Other, which consists of the Parent Company and SEPH.\nThe Park National Bank (PNB)\nThe table below reflects PNB's net income for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017.\n\nNet interest income of $293.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 represented a $34.6 million, or 13.4%, increase compared to $258.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase was a result of a $52.1 million increase in interest income, offset by a $17.5 million increase in interest expense.\nThe $52.1 million increase in interest income was primarily due to a $52.6 million increase in interest income on loans. The increase in interest income on loans was partially the result of a $746.2 million increase in average loans from $5.44 billion for the year ended December 31, 2018, to $6.19 billion for the year ended December 31, 2019. Additionally, the yield on loans increased 27 basis points to 5.12% for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to 4.85% for the year ended December 31, 2018. Interest income was impacted by the acquisition of NewDominion Bank (\"NewDominion\") on July 1, 2018 and the acquisition of CAB Financial Corporation, the parent of Carolina Alliance Bank (\"Carolina Alliance\") on April 1, 2019. The NewDominion Bank Division and the Carolina Alliance Bank Division contributed an aggregate of $41.3 million to interest income at PNB during the year ended December 31, 2019. The NewDominion Bank Division contributed $8.1 million to interest income at PNB during the year ended December 31, 2018.\nThe $17.5 million increase in interest expense was primarily due to a $18.7 million increase in interest expense on deposits, partially offset by a $1.2 million decrease in interest expense on borrowings. The increase in interest expense on deposits was partially the result of a $555.8 million increase in average interest-bearing deposits from $4.47 billion for the year ended December 31, 2018, to $5.03 billion for the year ended December 31, 2019. Additionally, the cost of interest bearing deposits increased by 29 basis points from 0.72% for the year ended December 31, 2018 to 1.01% for the year ended December 31, 2019. Interest expense was impacted by the acquisitions of NewDominion and Carolina Alliance. The NewDominion Bank Division and the Carolina Alliance Bank Division contributed an aggregate of $5.3 million to interest expense at PNB during the year ended December 31, 2019. The NewDominion Bank Division contributed $674,000 to interest expense at PNB during the year ended December 31, 2018.\nThe provision for loan losses of $8.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 represented an increase of $787,000, compared to $7.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Refer to the CREDIT EXPERIENCE - Provision for Loan Losses\" section for additional details regarding the level of the provision for loan losses recognized in each period presented above.\nOther income of $92.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 represented an increase of $3.4 million, or 3.8%, compared to $89.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The $3.4 million increase was primarily related to a $2.9 million increase in debit card fee income, a $2.4 million increase in other service income, a $1.5 million increase in income from fiduciary activities, a $1.3 million increase in operating lease income, which is included in miscellaneous income, and a decrease of $1.8 million in net losses on the sale of investment securities, offset by a $2.0 million decrease in other components of net periodic benefit income, a $1.6 million decrease in net gains on the sale of OREO, a $814,000 decrease in net gains on the sale of non-performing loans, a $735,000 decrease in bank owned life insurance income, primarily related to income from death benefits paid on policies during 2018, and a $626,000 decrease in service charges on deposit accounts. Other income was impacted by the acquisitions of NewDominion and Carolina Alliance. The NewDominion Bank Division and the Carolina Alliance Bank Division contributed an aggregate of $4.6 million to other income at PNB during the year ended December 31, 2019. The NewDominion Bank Division contributed $429,000 to other income at PNB during the year ended December 31, 2018.\nThe table below reflects PNB's other expense for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018.\n\nOther expense of $237.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 represented an increase of $30.6 million, or 14.8%, compared to $206.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase in employee benefits expense was primarily related to increased group insurance costs, payroll taxes and an increase in the company match in Park's defined contribution plan. Included in the increase in miscellaneous expense was a $1.3 million increase in operating lease depreciation, a $1.3 million expense related to the write-down of a trade name intangible, a $611,000 expense related to prepayment penalties on FHLB borrowings and a $471,000 increase in training and travel expenses. The decrease in insurance was primarily related to an assessment credit utilized with respect to the FDIC insurance expense.\nOther expense was impacted by the acquisitions of NewDominion and Carolina Alliance. Of the $237.4 million of total other expense for the year ended December 31, 2019, the NewDominion Bank Division and the Carolina Alliance Bank Division's total other expense was $10.7 million and $16.5 million, respectively. The NewDominion Bank Division's total other expense was $5.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Cost savings related to the Carolina Alliance acquisition were not realized until the fourth quarter of 2019, following the conversion of Carolina Alliance's core banking system.\nThe table below reflects PNB's other expense less the impact of NewDominion Bank Division and the Carolina Alliance Bank Division for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018.\n\nExcluding the impact of the NewDominion Bank Division and the Carolina Alliance Bank Division, other expense of $210.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 represented an increase of $9.2 million, or 4.6%, compared to $201.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase in employee benefits expense was primarily related to increased group insurance costs, payroll taxes and an increase in the company match in Park's defined contribution plan. Included in the increase in miscellaneous expense is a $611,000 expense related to prepayment penalties on FHLB borrowings. The decrease in insurance was primarily related to an assessment credit utilized with respect to the FDIC insurance expense.\nThe table below provides certain balance sheet information and financial ratios for PNB as of or for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018.\n\n(1) Calculated utilizing fully taxable equivalent net interest income which includes the effects of taxable equivalent adjustments using a 21% federal corporate income tax rate. The taxable equivalent adjustments were $3.0 million and $2.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018.\nLoans outstanding at December 31, 2019 were $6.48 billion, compared to $5.67 billion at December 31, 2018, an increase of $810.5 million, or 14.3%. Excluding $560.2 million of loans at the Carolina Alliance Bank Division at December 31, 2019, loans outstanding at December 31, 2019 were $5.92 billion, compared to $5.67 billion at December 31, 2018, an\nincrease of $250.2 million, or 4.4%. The table below breaks out the change in loans outstanding, excluding those at the Carolina Alliance Bank Division, by loan type.\n\nPNB's allowance for loan losses increased by $5.6 million, or 11.5%, to $54.7 million at December 31, 2019, compared to $49.1 million at December 31, 2018. Net charge-offs were $2.7 million, or 0.04% of total average loans, for the year ended December 31, 2019 and were $6.1 million, or 0.11% of total average loans, for the year ended December 31, 2018. Refer to the CREDIT EXPERIENCE - Provision for Loan Losses\" section for additional information regarding PNB's loan portfolio and the level of provision for loan losses recognized in each period presented.\nTotal deposits at December 31, 2019 were $7.13 billion, compared to $6.33 billion at December 31, 2018, an increase of $790.3 million, or 12.5%. Excluding $639.8 million of total deposits at the Carolina Alliance Bank Division at December 31, 2019, total deposits at December 31, 2019 were $6.49 billion, compared to $6.33 billion at December 31, 2018, an increase of $150.5 million, or 2.4%. The table below breaks out the change in deposit balances, excluding those at the Carolina Alliance Bank Division, by deposit type.\n\nGuardian Financial Services Company (\"GFSC\")\nThe table below summarizes GFSC's net income for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017.\n\nThe table below provides certain balance sheet information and financial ratios for GFSC as of or for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018.\n\nAll Other\nThe table below summarizes the All Other net (loss) income for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017.\n\nThe net interest (expense) income for All Other included, for all periods presented, interest income on subordinated debt investments in PNB, which were eliminated in the consolidated Park National Corporation totals, as well as interest income on SEPH impaired loan relationships.\nNet interest (expense) income decreased to net expense of $406,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019 from net income of $3.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The decrease was the result of a decrease in interest payments received from SEPH impaired loan relationships.\nSEPH had net recoveries of $2.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to net recoveries of $952,000 for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nOther income of $4.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 represented a decrease of $7.3 million, compared to $11.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The $7.3 million decrease was largely due to a $2.9 million decrease in gain on the sale of OREO, net, a $2.2 million decrease in net gains on the sale of non-performing loans, a $1.5 million decrease in bank owned life insurance income, primarily related to income from death benefits paid on policies in 2018, and a $1.0 million decrease in loan fee income as a result of a reduction in payments received from SEPH impaired loan relationships.\nOther expense of $23.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 represented an increase of $4.4 million, or 23.6%, compared to $18.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The $4.4 million increase was primarily related to an increase of $2.1 million in salary expense, a $1.6 million increase in professional fees and services and a $777,000 increase in miscellaneous expense (all increases primarily due to merger-related expenses). Merger-related expenses were $8.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $5.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nPark National Corporation\nThe table below summarizes Park's net income for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017.\n\nDIVIDENDS ON COMMON SHARES\nCash dividends declared on Park's common shares were $4.24 in 2019, $4.07 in 2018 and $3.76 in 2017. The quarterly cash dividend on Park's common shares was $1.21 per share for the first quarter of 2019, and $1.01 per share for the second, third, and fourth quarter of 2019. The first quarter of 2019 included a one-time special cash dividend of $0.20 per share. The quarterly cash dividend on Park's common shares was $0.94 per share for the first quarter of 2018, $1.21 per share for the second quarter of 2018, and $0.96 per share for the third and fourth quarter of 2018. The second quarter of 2018 included a one-time special cash dividend of $0.25 per share. The quarterly cash dividend on Park's common shares was $0.94 per share for each quarter of 2017. Please see the discussion of limitations on Park's ability to pay dividends in the section captioned \"Supervision and Regulation of Park and its Subsidiaries - Limits on Dividends and Other Payments\" in \"ITEM 1. BUSINESS\" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nThe significant accounting policies used in the development and presentation of Park's consolidated financial statements are listed in \"Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\" of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in \"ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA.\" The accounting and reporting policies of Park conform with U.S. GAAP and general practices within the financial services industry. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and the accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nALLL - The determination of the ALLL involves a higher degree of judgment and complexity than Park's other significant accounting policies. The ALLL is calculated with the objective of maintaining a reserve level believed by management to be sufficient to absorb probable, incurred credit losses in the loan portfolio. Management's determination of the adequacy of the ALLL is based on periodic evaluations of the loan portfolio and of current economic conditions. However, this evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires material estimates, including expected default probabilities, the loss given default, the amounts and timing of expected future cash flows on impaired loans, and estimated losses based on historical loss experience and current economic conditions. All of these factors may be susceptible to significant change. To the extent that actual results differ from management estimates, additional loan loss provisions may be required that would adversely impact earnings for future periods.\nOREO - OREO, property acquired through foreclosure, is recorded at estimated fair value less anticipated selling costs (net realizable value). If the net realizable value is below the carrying value of the loan on the date of transfer of the OREO, the difference is charged off against the ALLL. Subsequent declines in value (OREO devaluations) are reported as adjustments to the carrying amount of OREO and are expensed within other income. Gains or losses not previously recognized, resulting from the sale of OREO, are recognized within other income on the date of sale. At December 31, 2019, OREO totaled $4.0 million, a decrease of 6.4%, compared to $4.3 million at December 31, 2018.\nFair Value - In accordance with GAAP, management utilizes the fair value hierarchy, which has the objective of maximizing the use of observable market inputs. The accounting guidance also requires disclosures regarding the inputs used to calculate fair value. These inputs are classified as Level 1, Level 2, and Level 3. Level 3 inputs are those with significant\nunobservable inputs that reflect a company's own assumptions about the market for a particular instrument. Some of the inputs could be based on internal models and/or cash flow analyses. The large majority of Park's financial assets valued using Level 2 inputs consist of AFS debt securities. The fair value of these AFS debt securities is obtained largely by the use of matrix pricing, which is a mathematical technique widely used in the financial services industry to value debt securities without relying exclusively on quoted market prices for the specific securities but rather by relying on the securities' relationship to other benchmark quoted securities.\nGoodwill and other intangible assets - The accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets also involves a higher degree of judgment than most other significant accounting policies. GAAP establishes standards for the impairment assessment of goodwill and other intangible assets. Goodwill and other intangible assets represents the excess of the purchase price over net identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired in a purchase business combination. Park's goodwill relates to the value inherent in the banking industry and that value is dependent upon the ability of PNB, Park's national bank subsidiary, to provide quality, cost-effective banking services in a competitive marketplace. The goodwill value is supported by revenue that is in part driven by the volume of business transacted. A decrease in earnings resulting from a decline in the customer base, the inability to deliver cost-effective services over sustained periods or significant credit problems can lead to impairment of goodwill that could adversely impact earnings in future periods.\nGoodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized to expense, but are subject to impairment tests annually, or more frequently, if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired, by assessing qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If after assessing these events or circumstances, it is concluded that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then performing additional analysis is unnecessary. If the carrying amount of the goodwill exceeds the fair value, an impairment charge must be recorded in an amount equal to the excess, not to exceed the total goodwill allocated to the reporting unit. At December 31, 2019, on a consolidated basis, Park had $159.6 million of goodwill and $11.5 million of other intangibles, all of which is recorded at PNB.\nPension Plan - The determination of pension plan obligations and related expenses requires the use of assumptions to estimate the amount of benefits that employees will earn while working, as well as the present value of those benefits. Annual pension expense is principally based on four components: (1) the value of benefits earned by employees for working during the year (service cost), (2) the increase in the liability due to the passage of time (interest cost), and (3) other gains and losses, reduced by (4) the expected return on plan assets for our pension plan.\nSignificant assumptions used to measure our annual pension expense include:\n\u2022the interest rate used to determine the present value of liabilities (discount rate);\n\u2022certain employee-related factors, such as turnover, retirement age and mortality;\n\u2022the expected return on assets in our funded plan; and\n\u2022the rate of salary increases where benefits are based on earnings.\nOur assumptions reflect our historical experience and management's best judgment regarding future expectations. Due to the significant management judgment involved, our assumptions could have a material impact on the measurement of our pension plan expense and obligation.\nABOUT OUR BUSINESS\nThrough our national bank subsidiary, PNB, Park is engaged in a general commercial banking and trust business, primarily in Ohio, Kentucky, North Carolina and South Carolina, with the exception of nationwide aircraft loans and nationwide asset-based lending to consumer finance companies. Management believes there are a significant number of consumers and businesses that seek long-term relationships with community-based financial institutions of quality and strength. While not engaging in activities such as foreign lending, nationally syndicated loans or investment banking, Park attempts to meet the needs of our customers for commercial, real estate and consumer loans, and investment, fiduciary and deposit services.\nPark's subsidiaries compete for deposits and loans with other banks, savings associations, credit unions and other types of financial institutions. At December 31, 2019, Park operated 125 financial service offices (including those of PNB, Scope Leasing, Inc. (\"Scope Aircraft Finance\"), and GFSC) and a network of 138 automated teller machines in 29 Ohio counties, one Kentucky county, four North Carolina counties and four South Carolina counties. SEPH also operated one office, located in Newark, Ohio.\nSOURCE OF FUNDS\nDeposits: Park's major source of funds is deposits from individuals, businesses and local government entities. These deposits consist of non-interest bearing and interest bearing deposits.\nAverage total deposits were $6,905 million in 2019, compared to $6,135 million in 2018 and $5,893 million in 2017. Table 12 provides a summary of deposit balances as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, along with the change over the past year.\n\nThe average interest rate paid on interest bearing deposits was 1.01% in 2019, compared to 0.72% in 2018, and 0.44% in 2017. The average cost of interest bearing deposits for each quarter of 2019 was 0.95% for the fourth quarter, 1.08% for the third quarter, 1.04% for the second quarter and 0.97% for the first quarter.\nThe deposit growth for 2019 included deposits from the acquisition of Carolina Alliance, which totaled $639.8 million at December 31, 2019.\nMaturities of time deposits in amounts of $100,000 or more as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 were:\n\nShort-Term Borrowings: Short-term borrowings consist of securities sold under agreements to repurchase, Federal Home Loan Bank advances, Federal Funds purchased and other borrowings. These funds are used to manage the Corporation's liquidity needs and interest rate sensitivity risk. The average rate paid on short-term borrowings generally moves closely with changes in market interest rates for short-term investments. The average rate paid on short-term borrowings was 1.15% in 2019, compared to 0.74% in 2018, and 0.43% in 2017. The year-end balance for short-term borrowings was $231 million at December 31, 2019, compared to $222 million at December 31, 2018, and $391 million at December 31, 2017.\nLong-Term Debt: Long-term debt primarily consists of borrowings from the Federal Home Loan Bank and a term note with another financial institution. The average balance of long-term debt and the average cost of long-term debt include the subordinated notes discussed in the following section. In 2019, average long-term debt was $341 million, compared to $424 million in 2018, and $788 million in 2017. The average interest rate paid on long-term debt was 2.77% in 2019, compared to 2.38% for 2018, and 2.86% for 2017. Average total debt (long-term and short-term) was $557 million in 2019, compared to $642 million in 2018, and $1,018 million in 2017. Average total debt decreased by $85 million, or 13.2%, in 2019 compared to 2018, and decreased by $376 million, or 37.0%, in 2018 compared to 2017. Average long-term debt was 61% of average total debt in 2019, compared to 66% of average total debt in 2018, and 77% of average total debt in 2017.\nSubordinated Notes: Park assumed, with the 2007 acquisition of Vision's parent holding company, $15.5 million of floating rate junior subordinated notes. The $15.5 million of junior subordinated notes were purchased by Vision Bancshares Trust I (\"Trust I\") following the issuance of Trust I's $15.0 million of floating rate preferred securities. The interest rate on these junior subordinated notes adjusts every quarter at 148 basis points above the three-month LIBOR interest rate. The\nmaturity date for the junior subordinated notes is December 30, 2035 and the junior subordinated notes may be prepaid, without penalty, after December 30, 2010. These junior subordinated notes qualify as Tier 1 capital under current Federal Reserve Board guidelines.\nSee \"Note 17 - Subordinated Notes\" of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in \"ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA\" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information about the subordinated notes.\nShareholders' Equity: The ratio of total shareholders' equity to total assets was 11.32% at December 31, 2019, compared to 10.67% at December 31, 2018, and 10.03% at December 31, 2017. The ratio of tangible shareholders' equity [shareholders' equity ($969.0 million) less goodwill ($159.6 million) and other intangible assets ($11.5 million)] to tangible assets [total assets ($8,558 million) less goodwill ($159.6 million) and other intangible assets ($11.5 million)] was 9.51% at December 31, 2019, compared to 9.28% at December 31, 2018, and 9.16% at December 31, 2017.\nIn accordance with GAAP, Park reflects any unrealized holding gain or loss on AFS debt securities, any unrealized net holding gain or loss on cash flow hedging derivatives or any change in the funded status of Park's pension plan, net of income taxes, as accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) which is part of Park's shareholders' equity.\nThe unrealized net holding gain, net of income taxes, on AFS debt securities was $17.5 million at year-end 2019, compared to the unrealized net holding loss, net of income taxes, of $20.1 million at year-end 2018, and the unrealized net holding loss, net of income taxes, of $2.9 million at year-end 2017.\nThe unrealized net holding loss, net of income taxes, on cash flow hedging derivatives was $454,000 at year-end 2019. There were no cash flow hedging derivatives at either year-end 2018 or 2017.\nIn accordance with GAAP, Park adjusts accumulated other comprehensive loss to recognize the net actuarial gain or loss reflected in the funding status of Park's pension plan. See \"Note 20 - Benefit Plans\" of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in \"ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA\" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for information on the accounting for Park's pension plan. Pertaining to the funding status of the pension plan, Park recognized a net comprehensive gain of $3.0 million in 2019, a net comprehensive loss of $3.0 million in 2018, and a net comprehensive loss of $8.8 million in 2017. The net comprehensive gain in 2019 was due to changes in actuarial assumptions being more than offset by increased investment returns on pension plan assets. The net comprehensive loss in 2018 was due to changes in actuarial assumptions being more than offset by lower than projected returns on pension plan assets during 2018. The net comprehensive loss in 2017 was due to changes in actuarial assumptions which were partially offset by increased investment returns on pension plan assets.\nAt year-end 2019, the balance in accumulated other comprehensive loss pertaining to the pension plan was $26.7 million, compared to $29.7 million at December 31, 2018, and $23.5 million at December 31, 2017.\nINVESTMENT OF FUNDS\nLoans: Average loans were $6,208 million in 2019, compared to $5,461 million in 2018, and $5,328 million in 2017. The actual yield on average loan balances was 5.19% in 2019, compared to 4.98% in 2018, and 4.69% in 2017. Approximately 48% of Park's loan balances mature or reprice within one year (see Table 34). The actual yield on average loan balances for each quarter of 2019 was 5.11% for the fourth quarter, 5.25% for the third quarter, 5.23% for the second quarter and 5.14% for the first quarter.\nLoan interest income for 2019, 2018, and 2017 included $256,000, $3.4 million, and $2.3 million, respectively, related to payments received on certain SEPH impaired loan relationships, some of which are participated with PNB. In addition, for 2019 and 2018, loan interest income included $5.2 million and $1.1 million, respectively, of the accretion of loan purchase accounting adjustments related to the acquisitions of NewDominion and Carolina Alliance. Excluding this income, the yield on loans was 5.09%, 4.89%, and 4.66%, for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017. Excluding this income, the yield on loans was 4.97% for the fourth quarter of 2019, 5.13% for the third quarter of 2019, 5.14% for the second quarter of 2019, and 5.12% for the first quarter of 2019.\nAt December 31, 2019, loan balances were $6,501 million, compared to $5,692 million at year-end 2018, an increase of $809 million, or 14.2%. Excluding $560.2 million of loans at the Carolina Alliance Bank Division at December 31, 2019, loans outstanding at December 31, 2019 were $5,941 million, compared to $5,692 million at December 31, 2018, an increase of $249 million, or 4.4%.\nTable 14 reports year-end loan balances by type of loan for the past five years.\n",
    "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7.MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\nFORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\nManagement's discussion and analysis addresses the financial condition and results of operations for Park National Corporation and our subsidiaries (unless the context otherwise requires, collectively, \"Park\" or the \"Corporation\"). This discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes and the five-year summary of selected financial data included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Management's discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements that are provided to assist in the understanding of anticipated future financial performance. Forward-looking statements provide current expectations or forecasts of future events and are not guarantees of future performance. The forward-looking statements are based on management's expectations and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. Although management believes that the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are reasonable, actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in such statements. Risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially include, without limitation: Park's ability to execute our business plan successfully and within the expected timeframe as well as Park's ability to manage strategic initiatives; general economic and financial market conditions, specifically in the real estate markets and the credit markets, either nationally or in the states in which Park and our subsidiaries do business, may experience a slowing or reversal of the current economic expansion in addition to continuing residual effects of prior recessionary conditions and an uneven spread of positive impacts of recovery on the economy and our counterparties, resulting in adverse impacts on the demand for loan, deposit and other financial services, delinquencies, defaults and counterparties' inability to meet credit and other obligations and the possible impairment of collectability of loans; changes in interest rates and prices as well as disruption in the liquidity and functioning of U.S. financial markets may adversely impact prepayment penalty income, mortgage banking income, income from fiduciary activities, the value of securities, loans, deposits and other financial instruments and the interest rate sensitivity of our consolidated balance sheet as well as reduce interest margins and impact loan demand; changes in consumer spending, borrowing and saving habits, whether due to changes in retail distribution strategies, consumer preferences and behavior, changes in business and economic\nconditions, legislative and regulatory initiatives, or other factors may be different than anticipated; changes in unemployment may be different than anticipated; changes in customers', suppliers', and other counterparties' performance and creditworthiness may be different than anticipated; the adequacy of our internal controls and risk management program in the event of changes in the market, economic, operational, asset/liability repricing, legal, compliance, strategic, cybersecurity, liquidity, credit and interest rate risks associated with Park's business; our liquidity requirements could be adversely affected by changes to regulations governing bank and bank holding company capital and liquidity standards as well as by changes in our assets and liabilities; competitive pressures among financial services organizations could increase significantly, including product and pricing pressures (which could in turn impact our credit spreads), customer acquisition and retention, changes to third-party relationships and revenues, changes in the manner of providing services, customer acquisition and retention pressures, and our ability to attract, develop and retain qualified banking professionals; customers could pursue alternatives to bank deposits, causing us to lose a relatively inexpensive source of funding; uncertainty regarding the nature, timing, cost and effect of changes in banking regulations or other regulatory or legislative requirements affecting the respective businesses of Park and our subsidiaries, including major reform of the regulatory oversight structure of the financial services industry and changes in laws and regulations concerning taxes, FDIC insurance premium levels, pensions, bankruptcy, consumer protection, rent regulation and housing, financial accounting and reporting, environmental protection, insurance, bank products and services, bank capital and liquidity standards, fiduciary standards, securities and other aspects of the financial services industry, specifically the reforms provided for in the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the Dodd-Frank Act\u201d) and the Basel III regulatory capital reforms, as well as regulations already adopted and which may be adopted in the future by the relevant regulatory agencies, including the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and the Federal Reserve Board, to implement the Dodd-Frank Act's provisions, and the Basel III regulatory capital reforms; the effects of easing restrictions on participants in the financial services industry; the effect of changes in accounting policies and practices, as may be adopted by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the \"FASB\"), the SEC, the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board and other regulatory agencies, including the extent to which the new current expected credit loss accounting standard issued by the FASB in June 2016 and effective for Park as of January 1, 2020, which will require banks to record, at the time of origination, credit losses expected throughout the life of the asset portfolio on loans and held-to-maturity securities, as opposed to the current practice of recording losses when it is probable that a loss event has occurred, may adversely affect Park's reported financial condition or results of operations; Park's assumptions and estimates used in applying critical accounting policies and modeling, which may prove unreliable, inaccurate or not predictive of actual results; significant changes in the tax laws, which may adversely affect the fair values of net deferred tax assets and obligations of state and political subdivisions held in Park's investment securities portfolio; the impact of our ability to anticipate and respond to technological changes and our ability to respond to customer needs and meet competitive demands; operational issues stemming from and/or capital spending necessitated by the potential need to adapt to industry changes in information technology systems on which Park and our subsidiaries are highly dependent; the ability to secure confidential information and deliver products and services through the use of computer systems and telecommunications networks; a failure in or breach of our operational or security systems or infrastructure, or those of our third-party vendors and other service providers, resulting in failures or disruptions in customer account management, general ledger, deposit, loan, or other systems, including as a result of cyber attacks; the existence or exacerbation of general geopolitical instability and uncertainty; the effect of trade policies (including the impact of potential or imposed tariffs, a U.S. withdrawal from or significant renegotiation of trade agreements, trade wars and other changes in trade regulations and changes in the relationship of the U.S. and its global trading partners), monetary and other fiscal policies (including the impact of money supply and interest rate policies to the Federal Reserve Board) and other governmental policies of the U.S. federal government; the impact on financial markets and the economy of any changes in the credit ratings of the U.S. Treasury obligations and other U.S. government-backed debt, as well as issues surrounding the levels of U.S., European and Asian government debt and concerns regarding the creditworthiness of certain sovereign governments, supranationals and financial institutions in Europe and Asia; the uncertainty surrounding the impact of the United Kingdom's exit from the European Union; our litigation and regulatory compliance exposure, including the costs and effects of any adverse developments in legal proceedings or other claims and the costs and effects of unfavorable resolution of regulatory and other governmental examinations or other inquiries; continued availability of earnings and excess capital sufficient for the lawful and prudent declaration of dividends; the impact on Park's business, personnel, facilities or systems of losses related to acts of fraud, scams and schemes of third parties; the impact of widespread natural and other disasters, pandemics, dislocations, civil unrest, terrorist activities or international hostilities on the economy and financial markets generally and on us or our counterparties specifically; the effect of healthcare laws in the U.S. and potential changes for such laws which may increase our healthcare and other costs and negatively impact our operations and financial results; Park's ability to integrate recent acquisitions as well as to identify, make or integrate any future suitable strategic acquisitions, which may be unsuccessful, or may be more difficult, time-consuming or costly than expected; risk and uncertainties associated with Park's entry into new geographic markets with its recent acquisitions, including expected revenue synergies and cost savings from recent acquisitions not being fully realized or realized within the expected time frame; difficulty of retaining and hiring employees in new markets; Park issued equity securities in the acquisitions of NewDominion Bank and Carolina Alliance and may issue equity securities in connection with future acquisitions, which could cause ownership and economic dilution to Park's current shareholders; the transition away from the London Inter-Bank Offered\nRate (LIBOR) as a reference rate for financial instruments, which may result in increased expenses and litigation, and adversely impact the value of various financial instruments; and other risk factors relating to the banking industry as detailed from time to time in Park's reports filed with the SEC including those described in \"Item 1A. RISK FACTORS\" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Park does not undertake, and specifically disclaims any obligation, to publicly release the results of any revisions that may be made to update any forward-looking statement to reflect the events or circumstances after the date on which the forward-looking statement was made, or reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events, except to the extent required by law.\nNON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\nManagement's discussion and analysis contains non-U.S. GAAP financial measures where management believes it to be helpful in understanding Park's results of operations or financial position. Where non-U.S. GAAP financial measures are used, the comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure, as well as the reconciliation to the comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure, can be found herein.\nItems Impacting Comparability of Period Results\nFrom time to time, revenue, expenses, and/or taxes are impacted by items judged by management of Park to be outside of ordinary banking activities and/or by items that, while they may be associated with ordinary banking activities, are so unusually large that their outsized impact is believed by management of Park at that time to be infrequent or short-term in nature. Most often, these items impacting comparability of period results are due to merger and acquisition activities and revenue and expenses related to former Vision Bank loan relationships. In other cases, they may result from management's decisions associated with significant corporate actions outside of the ordinary course of business.\nEven though certain revenue and expense items are naturally subject to more volatility than others due to changes in market and economic environment conditions, as a general rule volatility alone does not result in the inclusion of an item as one impacting comparability of period results. For example, changes in the provision for credit losses (aside from former Vision Bank loan relationships), gains (losses) on equity securities, and asset valuation writedowns, reflect ordinary banking activities and are, therefore, typically excluded from consideration as items impacting comparability of period results.\nManagement believes the disclosure of items impacting comparability of period results provides a better understanding of our performance and trends and allows management to ascertain which of such items, if any, to include or exclude from an analysis of our performance; i.e., within the context of determining how that performance differed from expectations, as well as how, if at all, to adjust estimates of future performance taking such items into account.\nItems impacting comparability of the results of particular periods are not intended to be a complete list of items that may materially impact current or future period performance.\nNon-GAAP Ratios\nPark's management uses certain non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate Park's performance. Specifically, management reviews the ratio of tangible equity to tangible assets.\nManagement has included in MD&A information relating to the ratio of tangible equity to tangible assets. For the purpose of calculating the ratio of tangible equity to tangible assets, a non-GAAP financial measure, tangible equity is divided by tangible assets. Tangible equity equals total shareholders' equity less goodwill and other intangible assets, in each case at period end. Tangible assets equals total assets less goodwill and other intangible assets, in each case at period end.\nManagement believes that the disclosure of the ratio of tangible equity to tangible assets presents additional information to the reader of the consolidated financial statements, which, when read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP, assists in analyzing Park's operating performance, ensures comparability of operating performance from period to period, and facilitates comparisons with the performance of Park's peer financial holding companies and bank holding companies, while eliminating certain non-operational effects of acquisitions. Within the \"CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS - Capital\" section of this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Park has provided detail of the reconciliation of tangible equity to total shareholders' equity and of tangible assets to total assets solely for the purpose of complying with SEC Regulation G and not as an indication that the ratio of tangible equity to tangible assets is a substitute for the ratio of total shareholders' equity to total assets as determined in accordance with GAAP.\nFTE (fully taxable equivalent) Ratios\nInterest income, yields, and ratios on a FTE basis are considered non-U.S. GAAP financial measures. Management believes net interest income on a FTE basis provides an insightful picture of the interest margin for comparison purposes. The FTE basis also allows management to assess the comparability of revenue arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources. The FTE basis assumes a federal statutory tax rate of 21% for 2018 and 2019 and 35% for 2017 and prior years. In the tables included within the \"ANALYSIS OF EARNINGS - Net Interest Income\" section of this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Park has provided detail of FTE interest income solely for the purpose of complying with SEC Regulation G and not as an indication that FTE interest income, yields and ratios are substitutes for interest income, yields and ratios, as determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\nOVERVIEW\nFinancial Results by segment\nThe table below reflects the net income (loss) by segment for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017. Park's segments include The Park National Bank (\"PNB\"), Guardian Financial Services Company (\"GFSC\") and \"All Other\" which primarily consists of Park as the \"Parent Company\" and SE Property Holdings, LLC (\"SEPH\"). SEPH is a non-bank subsidiary of Park, holding former Vision Bank OREO property and non-performing loans.\nTable 16: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Table 1 - Net Income (Loss) by Segment </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>PNB </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>113,600 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>109,472 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>87,315 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>GFSC </td> <td> </td> <td>762 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>521 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>260 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>All Other </td> <td> </td> <td>(11,662) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>394 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(3,333) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Park </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>102,700 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>110,387 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>84,242 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet income for the year ended December 31, 2019 of $102.7 million represented a $7.7 million, or 7.0%, decrease compared to $110.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2018.

The increase was a result of a $52.1 million increase in interest income, offset by a $17.5 million increase in interest expense.\nThe $52.1 million increase in interest income was primarily due to a $52.6 million increase in interest income on loans. The increase in interest income on loans was partially the result of a $746.2 million increase in average loans from $5.44 billion for the year ended December 31, 2018, to $6.19 billion for the year ended December 31, 2019. Additionally, the yield on loans increased 27 basis points to 5.12% for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to 4.85% for the year ended December 31, 2018. Interest income was impacted by the acquisition of NewDominion Bank (\"NewDominion\") on July 1, 2018 and the acquisition of CAB Financial Corporation, the parent of Carolina Alliance Bank (\"Carolina Alliance\") on April 1, 2019. The NewDominion Bank Division and the Carolina Alliance Bank Division contributed an aggregate of $41.3 million to interest income at PNB during the year ended December 31, 2019. The NewDominion Bank Division contributed $8.1 million to interest income at PNB during the year ended December 31, 2018.\nThe $17.5 million increase in interest expense was primarily due to a $18.7 million increase in interest expense on deposits, partially offset by a $1.2 million decrease in interest expense on borrowings. The increase in interest expense on deposits was partially the result of a $555.8 million increase in average interest-bearing deposits from $4.47 billion for the year ended December 31, 2018, to $5.03 billion for the year ended December 31, 2019. Additionally, the cost of interest bearing deposits increased by 29 basis points from 0.72% for the year ended December 31, 2018 to 1.01% for the year ended December 31, 2019. Interest expense was impacted by the acquisitions of NewDominion and Carolina Alliance. The NewDominion Bank Division and the Carolina Alliance Bank Division contributed an aggregate of $5.3 million to interest expense at PNB during the year ended December 31, 2019. The NewDominion Bank Division contributed $674,000 to interest expense at PNB during the year ended December 31, 2018.\nThe provision for loan losses of $8.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 represented an increase of $787,000, compared to $7.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Refer to the CREDIT EXPERIENCE - Provision for Loan Losses\" section for additional details regarding the level of the provision for loan losses recognized in each period presented above.\nOther income of $92.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 represented an increase of $3.4 million, or 3.8%, compared to $89.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The $3.4 million increase was primarily related to a $2.9 million increase in debit card fee income, a $2.4 million increase in other service income, a $1.5 million increase in income from fiduciary activities, a $1.3 million increase in operating lease income, which is included in miscellaneous income, and a decrease of $1.8 million in net losses on the sale of investment securities, offset by a $2.0 million decrease in other components of net periodic benefit income, a $1.6 million decrease in net gains on the sale of OREO, a $814,000 decrease in net gains on the sale of non-performing loans, a $735,000 decrease in bank owned life insurance income, primarily related to income from death benefits paid on policies during 2018, and a $626,000 decrease in service charges on deposit accounts. Other income was impacted by the acquisitions of NewDominion and Carolina Alliance. The NewDominion Bank Division and the Carolina Alliance Bank Division contributed an aggregate of $4.6 million to other income at PNB during the year ended December 31, 2019. The NewDominion Bank Division contributed $429,000 to other income at PNB during the year ended December 31, 2018.\nThe table below reflects PNB's other expense for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018.\nTable 18: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Table 3 - PNB Other Expense Information </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In thousands) </td> <td>December 31, 2019 </td> <td>December 31, 2018 </td> <td>$ change </td> <td>% change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other expense: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Salaries </td> <td>$ </td> <td>109,362 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>97,155 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>12,207 </td> <td> </td> <td>12.6 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Employee benefits </td> <td>36,017 </td> <td> </td> <td>29,341 </td> <td> </td> <td>6,676 </td> <td> </td> <td>22.8 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Occupancy expense </td> <td>12,555 </td> <td> </td> <td>11,007 </td> <td> </td> <td>1,548 </td> <td> </td> <td>14.1 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Furniture and equipment expense </td> <td>16,999 </td> <td> </td> <td>16,082 </td> <td> </td> <td>917 </td> <td> </td> <td>5.7 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Data processing fees </td> <td>10,589 </td> <td> </td> <td>8,337 </td> <td> </td> <td>2,252 </td> <td> </td> <td>27.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Professional fees and services </td> <td>22,056 </td> <td> </td> <td>19,382 </td> <td> </td> <td>2,674 </td> <td> </td> <td>13.8 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Marketing </td> <td>5,704 </td> <td> </td> <td>5,091 </td> <td> </td> <td>613 </td> <td> </td> <td>12.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Insurance </td> <td>2,489 </td> <td> </td> <td>4,749 </td> <td> </td> <td>(2,260) </td> <td> </td> <td>(47.6) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Communication </td> <td>5,193 </td> <td> </td> <td>4,792 </td> <td> </td> <td>401 </td> <td> </td> <td>8.4 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>State tax expense </td> <td>3,016 </td> <td> </td> <td>3,027 </td> <td> </td> <td>(11) </td> <td> </td> <td>(0.4) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Amortization of intangible assets </td> <td>2,355 </td> <td> </td> <td>578 </td> <td> </td> <td>1,777 </td> <td> </td> <td>307.4 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Miscellaneous </td> <td>11,098 </td> <td> </td> <td>7,302 </td> <td> </td> <td>3,796 </td> <td> </td> <td>52.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total other expense </td> <td>$ </td> <td>237,433 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>206,843 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>30,590 </td> <td> </td> <td>14.8 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOther expense of $237.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 represented an increase of $30.6 million, or 14.8%, compared to $206.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The increase in employee benefits expense was primarily related to increased group insurance costs, payroll taxes and an increase in the company match in Park's defined contribution plan. Included in the increase in miscellaneous expense was a $1.3 million increase in operating lease depreciation, a $1.3 million expense related to the write-down of a trade name intangible, a $611,000 expense related to prepayment penalties on FHLB borrowings and a $471,000 increase in training and travel expenses.

The decrease was the result of a decrease in interest payments received from SEPH impaired loan relationships.\nSEPH had net recoveries of $2.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to net recoveries of $952,000 for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nOther income of $4.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 represented a decrease of $7.3 million, compared to $11.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The $7.3 million decrease was largely due to a $2.9 million decrease in gain on the sale of OREO, net, a $2.2 million decrease in net gains on the sale of non-performing loans, a $1.5 million decrease in bank owned life insurance income, primarily related to income from death benefits paid on policies in 2018, and a $1.0 million decrease in loan fee income as a result of a reduction in payments received from SEPH impaired loan relationships.\nOther expense of $23.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 represented an increase of $4.4 million, or 23.6%, compared to $18.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The $4.4 million increase was primarily related to an increase of $2.1 million in salary expense, a $1.6 million increase in professional fees and services and a $777,000 increase in miscellaneous expense (all increases primarily due to merger-related expenses). Merger-related expenses were $8.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to $5.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018.\nPark National Corporation\nThe table below summarizes Park's net income for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017.\nTable 26: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Table 11 - Park Summary Income Statement </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(In thousands) </td> <td>2019 </td> <td>2018 </td> <td>2017 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net interest income </td> <td>$ </td> <td>297,737 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>266,898 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>243,759 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Provision for loan losses </td> <td>6,171 </td> <td> </td> <td>7,945 </td> <td> </td> <td>8,557 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other income </td> <td>97,193 </td> <td> </td> <td>101,101 </td> <td> </td> <td>86,429 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other expense </td> <td>263,988 </td> <td> </td> <td>228,755 </td> <td> </td> <td>203,162 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income before income taxes </td> <td>$ </td> <td>124,771 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>131,299 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>118,469 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> Income tax expense </td> <td>22,071 </td> <td> </td> <td>20,912 </td> <td> </td> <td>34,227 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income </td> <td>$ </td> <td>102,700 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>110,387 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>84,242 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nDIVIDENDS ON COMMON SHARES\nCash dividends declared on Park's common shares were $4.24 in 2019, $4.07 in 2018 and $3.76 in 2017. The quarterly cash dividend on Park's common shares was $1.21 per share for the first quarter of 2019, and $1.01 per share for the second, third, and fourth quarter of 2019. The first quarter of 2019 included a one-time special cash dividend of $0.20 per share. The quarterly cash dividend on Park's common shares was $0.94 per share for the first quarter of 2018, $1.21 per share for the second quarter of 2018, and $0.96 per share for the third and fourth quarter of 2018. The second quarter of 2018 included a one-time special cash dividend of $0.25 per share. The quarterly cash dividend on Park's common shares was $0.94 per share for each quarter of 2017. Please see the discussion of limitations on Park's ability to pay dividends in the section captioned \"Supervision and Regulation of Park and its Subsidiaries - Limits on Dividends and Other Payments\" in \"ITEM 1. BUSINESS\" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nThe significant accounting policies used in the development and presentation of Park's consolidated financial statements are listed in \"Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\" of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in \"ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA.\" The accounting and reporting policies of Park conform with U.S. GAAP and general practices within the financial services industry. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and the accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nALLL - The determination of the ALLL involves a higher degree of judgment and complexity than Park's other significant accounting policies. The ALLL is calculated with the objective of maintaining a reserve level believed by management to be sufficient to absorb probable, incurred credit losses in the loan portfolio. Management's determination of the adequacy of the ALLL is based on periodic evaluations of the loan portfolio and of current economic conditions. However, this evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires material estimates, including expected default probabilities, the loss given default, the amounts and timing of expected future cash flows on impaired loans, and estimated losses based on historical loss experience and current economic conditions. All of these factors may be susceptible to significant change. To the extent that actual results differ from management estimates, additional loan loss provisions may be required that would adversely impact earnings for future periods.\nOREO - OREO, property acquired through foreclosure, is recorded at estimated fair value less anticipated selling costs (net realizable value). If the net realizable value is below the carrying value of the loan on the date of transfer of the OREO, the difference is charged off against the ALLL. Subsequent declines in value (OREO devaluations) are reported as adjustments to the carrying amount of OREO and are expensed within other income. Gains or losses not previously recognized, resulting from the sale of OREO, are recognized within other income on the date of sale. At December 31, 2019, OREO totaled $4.0 million, a decrease of 6.4%, compared to $4.3 million at December 31, 2018.\nFair Value - In accordance with GAAP, management utilizes the fair value hierarchy, which has the objective of maximizing the use of observable market inputs. The accounting guidance also requires disclosures regarding the inputs used to calculate fair value. These inputs are classified as Level 1, Level 2, and Level 3. Level 3 inputs are those with significant\nunobservable inputs that reflect a company's own assumptions about the market for a particular instrument. Some of the inputs could be based on internal models and/or cash flow analyses. The large majority of Park's financial assets valued using Level 2 inputs consist of AFS debt securities. The fair value of these AFS debt securities is obtained largely by the use of matrix pricing, which is a mathematical technique widely used in the financial services industry to value debt securities without relying exclusively on quoted market prices for the specific securities but rather by relying on the securities' relationship to other benchmark quoted securities.\nGoodwill and other intangible assets - The accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets also involves a higher degree of judgment than most other significant accounting policies. GAAP establishes standards for the impairment assessment of goodwill and other intangible assets. Goodwill and other intangible assets represents the excess of the purchase price over net identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired in a purchase business combination. Park's goodwill relates to the value inherent in the banking industry and that value is dependent upon the ability of PNB, Park's national bank subsidiary, to provide quality, cost-effective banking services in a competitive marketplace. The goodwill value is supported by revenue that is in part driven by the volume of business transacted. A decrease in earnings resulting from a decline in the customer base, the inability to deliver cost-effective services over sustained periods or significant credit problems can lead to impairment of goodwill that could adversely impact earnings in future periods.\nGoodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized to expense, but are subject to impairment tests annually, or more frequently, if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired, by assessing qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If after assessing these events or circumstances, it is concluded that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, then performing additional analysis is unnecessary. If the carrying amount of the goodwill exceeds the fair value, an impairment charge must be recorded in an amount equal to the excess, not to exceed the total goodwill allocated to the reporting unit. At December 31, 2019, on a consolidated basis, Park had $159.6 million of goodwill and $11.5 million of other intangibles, all of which is recorded at PNB.\nPension Plan - The determination of pension plan obligations and related expenses requires the use of assumptions to estimate the amount of benefits that employees will earn while working, as well as the present value of those benefits. Annual pension expense is principally based on four components: (1) the value of benefits earned by employees for working during the year (service cost), (2) the increase in the liability due to the passage of time (interest cost), and (3) other gains and losses, reduced by (4) the expected return on plan assets for our pension plan.\nSignificant assumptions used to measure our annual pension expense include:\n\u2022the interest rate used to determine the present value of liabilities (discount rate);\n\u2022certain employee-related factors, such as turnover, retirement age and mortality;\n\u2022the expected return on assets in our funded plan; and\n\u2022the rate of salary increases where benefits are based on earnings.\nOur assumptions reflect our historical experience and management's best judgment regarding future expectations. Due to the significant management judgment involved, our assumptions could have a material impact on the measurement of our pension plan expense and obligation.\nABOUT OUR BUSINESS\nThrough our national bank subsidiary, PNB, Park is engaged in a general commercial banking and trust business, primarily in Ohio, Kentucky, North Carolina and South Carolina, with the exception of nationwide aircraft loans and nationwide asset-based lending to consumer finance companies. Management believes there are a significant number of consumers and businesses that seek long-term relationships with community-based financial institutions of quality and strength. While not engaging in activities such as foreign lending, nationally syndicated loans or investment banking, Park attempts to meet the needs of our customers for commercial, real estate and consumer loans, and investment, fiduciary and deposit services.\nPark's subsidiaries compete for deposits and loans with other banks, savings associations, credit unions and other types of financial institutions. At December 31, 2019, Park operated 125 financial service offices (including those of PNB, Scope Leasing, Inc. (\"Scope Aircraft Finance\"), and GFSC) and a network of 138 automated teller machines in 29 Ohio counties, one Kentucky county, four North Carolina counties and four South Carolina counties. SEPH also operated one office, located in Newark, Ohio.\nSOURCE OF FUNDS\nDeposits: Park's major source of funds is deposits from individuals, businesses and local government entities. These deposits consist of non-interest bearing and interest bearing deposits.\nAverage total deposits were $6,905 million in 2019, compared to $6,135 million in 2018 and $5,893 million in 2017. Table 12 provides a summary of deposit balances as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, along with the change over the past year.\nTable 27: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Table 12 - Year-End Deposits </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>December 31 (In thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td>Change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Non-interest bearing checking </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,959,935 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,804,881 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>155,054 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest bearing transaction accounts </td> <td> </td> <td>1,628,740 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,364,743 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>263,997 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Savings </td> <td> </td> <td>2,323,533 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,046,792 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>276,741 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>All other time deposits </td> <td> </td> <td>1,139,131 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,043,177 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>95,954 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other </td> <td> </td> <td>1,273 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,267 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>7,052,612 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>6,260,860 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>791,752 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe average interest rate paid on interest bearing deposits was 1.01% in 2019, compared to 0.72% in 2018, and 0.44% in 2017.

These funds are used to manage the Corporation's liquidity needs and interest rate sensitivity risk. The average rate paid on short-term borrowings generally moves closely with changes in market interest rates for short-term investments. The average rate paid on short-term borrowings was 1.15% in 2019, compared to 0.74% in 2018, and 0.43% in 2017. The year-end balance for short-term borrowings was $231 million at December 31, 2019, compared to $222 million at December 31, 2018, and $391 million at December 31, 2017.\nLong-Term Debt: Long-term debt primarily consists of borrowings from the Federal Home Loan Bank and a term note with another financial institution. The average balance of long-term debt and the average cost of long-term debt include the subordinated notes discussed in the following section. In 2019, average long-term debt was $341 million, compared to $424 million in 2018, and $788 million in 2017. The average interest rate paid on long-term debt was 2.77% in 2019, compared to 2.38% for 2018, and 2.86% for 2017. Average total debt (long-term and short-term) was $557 million in 2019, compared to $642 million in 2018, and $1,018 million in 2017. Average total debt decreased by $85 million, or 13.2%, in 2019 compared to 2018, and decreased by $376 million, or 37.0%, in 2018 compared to 2017. Average long-term debt was 61% of average total debt in 2019, compared to 66% of average total debt in 2018, and 77% of average total debt in 2017.\nSubordinated Notes: Park assumed, with the 2007 acquisition of Vision's parent holding company, $15.5 million of floating rate junior subordinated notes. The $15.5 million of junior subordinated notes were purchased by Vision Bancshares Trust I (\"Trust I\") following the issuance of Trust I's $15.0 million of floating rate preferred securities. The interest rate on these junior subordinated notes adjusts every quarter at 148 basis points above the three-month LIBOR interest rate. The\nmaturity date for the junior subordinated notes is December 30, 2035 and the junior subordinated notes may be prepaid, without penalty, after December 30, 2010. These junior subordinated notes qualify as Tier 1 capital under current Federal Reserve Board guidelines.\nSee \"Note 17 - Subordinated Notes\" of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in \"ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA\" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information about the subordinated notes.\nShareholders' Equity: The ratio of total shareholders' equity to total assets was 11.32% at December 31, 2019, compared to 10.67% at December 31, 2018, and 10.03% at December 31, 2017.

See \"Note 20 - Benefit Plans\" of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in \"ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA\" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for information on the accounting for Park's pension plan.

The net comprehensive gain in 2019 was due to changes in actuarial assumptions being more than offset by increased investment returns on pension plan assets.
