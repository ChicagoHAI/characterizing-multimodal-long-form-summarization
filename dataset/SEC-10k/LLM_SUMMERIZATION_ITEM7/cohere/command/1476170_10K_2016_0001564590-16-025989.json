This discussion and analysis includes certain forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. You should review the Risk Factors\u201d section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by such forward-looking statements. See Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Information\u201d at the beginning of this report. References to our fiscal year refer to the fiscal year ending June 30.\nOverview\nWe are a designer, manufacturer, and supplier of innovative injectable drug delivery systems that can enhance and differentiate the injectable products of our pharmaceutical and biotechnology customers. We believe our products are differentiated from conventional products, with innovative features and functionality designed to optimize the safe, simple, and convenient administration of injectable therapies. The majority of our products are designed for sale directly to pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies who are expected to supply them as drug-device combination products, pre-filled and ready for administration by end-users, such as patients or health-care providers. We customize products within each of our platforms to address specific customer, therapy, patient and/or commercial requirements.\nAlthough we have a broad portfolio of proprietary product platforms, we have focused our business on our wearable injector products. We expect that by focusing primarily on active and new customer programs in our portfolio of wearable injector systems, we will improve our operating efficiencies and better position the Company to take advantage of commercial opportunities within the fast-growing market for wearable injectors. Our wearable injector customers include Amgen Inc., MedImmune LLC ( MedImmune\u201d), and Sanofi S.A. ( Sanofi\u201d).\nCommon Stock Reverse Stock Split\nOn May 13, 2016, pursuant to prior stockholder authorization, the Company effected a reverse split of the Company's common stock, pursuant to which every ten (10) shares of common stock outstanding before the reverse split were converted into one (1) share of common stock after the reverse split. All share and per share amounts, and exercise and conversion prices for all periods presented herein have been adjusted to reflect the reverse split as if it had occurred at the beginning of the first period presented.\nInvestigation and Amendments to Financial Statements\nOn May 8, 2016, the Company announced an investigation into violations of the Company's policies and procedures and possible violations of law and regulation by the Company's former Chief Executive Officer, Alan Shortall, whose employment with the Company ceased on March 11, 2016, and its former Chairman, Jim Bosnjak, who resigned from the Company's Board of Directors (the Board\u201d) on August 24, 2015 (the Investigation\u201d).\nThe Investigation identified certain related party and other transactions which the Company had not previously publicly disclosed or recorded in its financial statements. Also, as the result of Investigation, the Company was not able to timely file its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2016 (the March 2016 10-Q\u201d) or this Annual Report on Form 10-K (the 2016 10-K\u201d). As a result, the Company is filing this 2016 10-K and is concurrently filing the March 2016 10-Q along with (i) an amendment to the Company's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2015 (the September 2015 10-Q Amendment\u201d); (ii) an amendment to the Company's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2015 (the December 2015 10-Q Amendment\u201d); and (iii) an amendment to the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015 (the 2015 10-K Amendment\u201d). These amendments are being made to correct immaterial errors in the previously reported financial statements and to disclose certain material weaknesses in the Company's internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures. See Explanatory Note\u201d above for a summary of the results of the Investigation and of the specific amendments reflected in the September 2015 10-Q Amendment, the December 2015 10-Q Amendment and the 2015 10-K Amendment.\nManagement and Board Changes\nThe Company no longer has any business relationship with Mr. Shortall or Mr. Bosnjak. As of March 11, 2016, (i) Mr. Shortall's employment as Chief Executive Officer of the Company ceased and Mr. Shortall resigned from his position as Chairman of the Board, (ii) the Board appointed Mary Kate Wold to serve as its new Chair, and (iii) the employment of Ramin Mojdeh, Ph.D. as the Company's President and Chief Operating Officer ceased.\nEffective March 14, 2016, the Board appointed John Ryan as the Company's Interim President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company. The Board subsequently appointed Mr. Ryan as the Company's President and Chief Executive Officer and also appointed Mr. Ryan to serve as a member of the Board, in each case, effective July 28, 2016.\nOn July 25, 2016, the Company's employment of Mark Iampietro as the Company's Vice President of Quality and Regulatory Affairs and Chief Compliance Officer was ended by the Company without cause.\nOn July 28, 2016:\nTable 102: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the Board appointed Michael E. Kamarck to serve as a member of the Board;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 103: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> the Board appointed Ian Hanson as the Company's Chief Operating Officer in addition to his roles as the Company's Senior Vice President;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 104: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> due to results of the Investigation, Dennis P.

The SEC or other external parties could request further documents and information from the Company. The Company and certain of its current and former directors and officers have also been named as defendants in a number of lawsuits filed in connection with the matters set forth in this Explanatory Note. For information concerning the SEC's ongoing investigation and such lawsuits, see Part I, Item 3. Legal Proceedings\u201d of this 2016 10-K.\nMatters Relating to NASDAQ and Our Common Stock and ASX and our CDIs\nThe filing of this 2016 10-K and the March 2016 10-Q were delayed as a result of the Investigation. As a result of such delay, on May 17, 2016, the Company received a notice from the Listing Qualifications department of NASDAQ stating that, because the Company had not yet filed the March 2016 10-Q, the Company was no longer in compliance with NASDAQ Listing Rule 5250(c)(1), which requires listed companies to timely file all required periodic financial reports with the SEC. The notice received from NASDAQ stated that the Company had 60 calendar days from the date of the notice to submit a plan to regain compliance with NASDAQ's continued listing requirements.\nOn July 18, 2016, the Company timely submitted a plan to NASDAQ as to how it planned to regain compliance with NASDAQ's continued listing requirements. The staff at NASDAQ subsequently granted the Company an exception to file the March 2016 10-Q and any other delinquent SEC filings on or before November 7, 2016 in order to enable the Company to regain compliance with the listing rules.\nOn September 19, 2016, the Company received a notice from the Listing Qualifications department of NASDAQ stating that, because the Company had not yet filed this 2016 10-K, the Company is not in compliance with NASDAQ Listing Rule 5250(c)(1). The Company timely submitted to NASDAQ an updated compliance plan on October 4, 2016.\nAs noted above, the Company is concurrently filing with the SEC the March 2016 10-Q and the 2016 10-K with the 2015 10-K Amendment, the September 2015 10-Q Amendment and the December 2015 10-Q Amendment. Consequently, the Company currently believes that it has adequately remedied its non-compliance with NASDAQ Listing Rule 5250(c)(1) within NASDAQ's terms of exception. However, there can be no assurance that NASDAQ will concur that we have remedied such non-compliance.\nOn October 17, 2016, the Company received a notice from the Listing Qualifications department of NASDAQ stating that, because the Company did not maintain a minimum Market Value of Listed Securities ( MVLS\u201d) of $50,000,000 for the last 30 consecutive business days, the Company was no longer in compliance with NASDAQ Listing Rule 5450(b)(2)(A).\nThe Company has been provided a period of 180 calendar days, or until April 17, 2017, to regain compliance with the minimum MVLS listing requirement. If at any time on or before April 17, 2017, the MVLS of the Company's common stock closes at $50,000,000 or more for a minimum of 10 consecutive business days, NASDAQ will provide the Company with written confirmation that the Company has achieved compliance with the minimum MVLS listing requirement and the matter will be closed.\nIn the event that the Company does not regain compliance with the minimum MVLS listing requirement on or before April 17, 2017, NASDAQ will provide the Company with written notification that its securities are subject to delisting. At that time, the Company would be permitted to appeal the delisting determination to a NASDAQ Hearings Panel or apply to transfer its common stock to The NASDAQ Capital Market (provided that it satisfied the requirement for continued listing on that market). (See Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors of this 2016 10-K - We are not in compliance with the requirements of NASDAQ for continued listing, and if NASDAQ does not concur that we have adequately remedied our non-compliance with NASDAQ Listing Rule 5250(c)(1) or we do not adequately remedy our non-compliance with NASDAQ Listing Rule 5450(b)(2)(A), our common stock may be delisted from trading on NASDAQ, which could have a material adverse effect on us and our stockholders\u201d below).\nThe Company was also required to file audited financial statements with the Australian Securities Exchange (the ASX\u201d) no later than September 30, 2016 (the ASX Deadline\u201d). The Company was not able to file such audited financial statements by the ASX Deadline. As a result, pursuant to ASX rules, trading in the Company's CDIs on the ASX was to be suspended prior to the opening of trading on the ASX on October 3, 2016, however, the ASX accepted the Company's request for an immediate voluntary suspension of trading and as such, ASX halted trading of the Company's CDIs on the ASX prior to the opening of trading on September 30, 2016 in Australia. Such trading in Australia will not resume until after the Company files the audited financial statements included in this 2016 10-K with the ASX, which the Company is doing concurrently with filing this 2016 10-K with the SEC.\nKey Factors Affecting Performance and Financial Condition\nWe are party to several agreements with our customers, including customers with whom we have entered into customization, development and/or supply agreements. The customization, industrialization and development fees and other payments received from customers in connection with these agreements and development programs accounted for the majority of our revenue during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016.\nLonger customer development timelines and increases in capital expenses and headcount have impacted us from a liquidity standpoint. Historically, we have funded our operations primarily from a combination of term loans, equity issuances, borrowings under our bank mortgages, and payments from various customers. See Liquidity and Capital Resources Discussion\u201d below.\nRevenue\nOur revenue is currently generated from customization, industrialization and development fees (many of which are recognized on the milestone basis of accounting). Customization, industrialization and development fees accounted for substantially all of our consolidated revenue for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016. We expect that the Company's revenue will continue to fluctuate on a quarter to quarter basis. A significant portion of our business is generated by a small number of major customers. Our top three customers generated approximately 91% of our total revenue in fiscal 2016. As our industry, market demand and our customer base changes, our major customers may also change. However, we expect that a significant portion of our future annual revenue will be concentrated among a few customers.\nOperating Expenses\nOur operating expenses had been increasing primarily as a result of increased research and development efforts in response to increasing demand from our customers for our products and services and anticipated market demand. The increase in research and development costs also related to the costs of products and components supplied to existing and prospective customers to support evaluation processes and user studies that are typically undertaken prior to the anticipated signing of customer agreements. However, during fiscal year 2016 we implemented several cost reduction and business realignment initiatives that were previously disclosed, pursuant to which we reduced our headcount by approximately 90 employees. Such headcount reductions are expected to reduce annual operating costs by approximately $7.9 million. We expect to further reduce our annual operating costs by not backfilling certain open positions. We do not believe that these cost reduction initiatives will negatively impact our ability to serve our customers.\nAlso as a result of these initiatives, our research and development expense decreased from approximately $17.0 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2015 to approximately $7.4 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016, or approximately 56%. Selling, general and administrative expense decreased from approximately $9.4 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2015, to approximately $7.6 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016, or approximately 20%.\nSignificant Developments in the Industry\nWe believe that our existing wearable injector contracts could provide significant revenue growth in relation to prior periods. Known trends in the industry that we believe will have a material favorable impact on our revenue include a shift in the focus of large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies' product development activities to biologic therapies, an emphasis within health-care providers to patient self-administration and a growing demand for passive safety for injectable drug delivery. There has been a marked shift in the product development activities of large customers toward biologic therapies, and the majority of therapies in the pipeline of large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies are complex biologic therapies. The characteristics of many of these therapies (including, for example, large dose volumes and increased viscosity) necessitates administration by injection using innovative injectable drug delivery systems such as our products. We believe that we are well-positioned to meet what we expect to be a growing demand for innovative injectable drug delivery systems in light of the focus on biologic therapies. Concurrently with the shift toward biologic therapies is an emphasis towards patient self-administration. Patient self-administration is viewed as a growing trend in order to reduce demand pressure on the health-care system as well as reducing costs, especially for treatment of chronic illnesses. Devices suitable for self-administration of injectable therapies need to be safe and intuitive to use. We believe that our products are well suited for safe and intuitive patient self-administration of injectable therapies.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nWe prepare our audited consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S., or U.S. GAAP. This requires management to make certain estimates, judgments and assumptions that could affect the amounts reported in the audited consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. We believe there are several accounting policies that are critical to understanding our historical and future performance, as these policies affect the reported amounts of revenue and other significant areas that involve management's judgments, estimates and assumptions. These critical accounting policies and estimates have been discussed with our audit committee.\nThe preparation of our audited consolidated financial statements requires us to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate these judgments, estimates and assumptions. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable at such time, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other independent sources. Actual results may ultimately differ from these estimates.\nWhile there are a number of accounting policies, methods and estimates affecting our consolidated financial statements as addressed in Note 4 to our audited consolidated financial statements, areas that are particularly significant and critical include:\nRevenue Recognition\nWe recognize revenue from industrialization and development fees, licensing fees and product sales. We recognize revenue from sales of products at the time of shipment when title passes to the customer. We recognize up front, non-refundable fees ratably over the expected life of the related agreement. Revenue from industrialization and development fees is recognized as services are rendered, under the completed contract method, under the proportional performance method or upon achievement of the at risk\u201d substantive milestone events, which represent the culmination of the earnings process related to such events. Substantive milestones can include specific deliverables such as product design, prototype availability, user tests, manufacturing proof of principle and the various steps to complete the industrialization of the product. The terms of these contracts provide for customer payments to be made as services are rendered or substantive milestones are achieved. We consider whether a milestone is substantive at the inception of the agreement. The consideration earned from the achievement of a milestone must meet all of the following criteria to be considered substantive:\nTable 108: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> It is commensurate with either our performance to achieve the milestone, or the enhancement of the value of the delivered item(s) as a result of a specific outcome resulting from our performance to achieve the milestone;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 109: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> It relates solely to past performance; and\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 110: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> It is reasonable relative to all of the deliverables and payment terms (including other potential milestone consideration) within the arrangement.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nPayment terms are considered to be standard commercial terms. Revenue is recognized when each substantive milestone has been achieved and we have no future performance obligations related to the substantive milestone. Fees for completed substantive milestones which are dependent upon customer acceptance for non-refundable payment or, if paid, are refundable pending customer acceptance are recognized upon customer acceptance and the termination of refund rights.\nWe recognized $14.8 million, $13.2 million and $14.7 million of revenue during fiscal years 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, as follows:\nDuring the fiscal year 2016, we recognized $4.5 million in revenue related to substantive milestones that were completed during the year pursuant to customer agreements to provide customization and development services, clinical support services, collaborative research activities and testing support services. Milestones completed during the year included various customization activities, device design, devices developed for use in customer evaluation testing, compatibility testing, user studies, and verification activities.\nDuring fiscal year 2016, we recognized $5.3 million in revenue related to services rendered on a time and materials basis, proportional performance method and/or straight-line basis over the requisite service period pursuant to customer agreements to provide various customization and development services. During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016, we recognized $5.0 million in revenue related to an agreement with a customer to provide exclusivity for a defined period of time to evaluate certain drug delivery alternatives as the requisite exclusivity period expired during the fiscal year.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill is the excess of purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired in business acquisitions. Goodwill is subject to, at a minimum, an annual impairment assessment of its carrying value at the reporting unit level. Additional impairment assessments would be performed if events and circumstances warranted such additional assessments during the year. The Company has one reporting unit which includes its product lines, the base technology which it obtained as part of its November 2002 acquisition of Unitract Syringe Pty Limited, and the manufacturing capability which it obtained in its January 2007 acquisition of Integrated BioSciences, Inc.\nAs required under generally accepted accounting principles, the Company is required to evaluate goodwill for impairment at least annually and more frequently if certain trigger events occur. The Company determined that the culmination of the Strategic Process and the decision to focus primarily on the wearable injector business constituted trigger events that occurred in the quarter ended March 31, 2016 requiring an evaluation of the carrying value of the Company's goodwill. Potential impairment of goodwill is identified by comparing the fair value with its carrying value.\nThe Company performed a goodwill valuation as of March 31, 2016 using a combination of the market approach and a discounted cash flow method under the income approach. The Company determined an overall business enterprise value (determined by the fair of equity plus the fair value of debt) by taking a weighted average form the results of the discounted cash flow under the income approach (40%) and the market approach based on the Company's market capitalization (60%). Under the income approach, the Company calculates the fair value of its reporting unit based on the present value of estimated future cash flows. Considerable management judgment is necessary to evaluate the impact of operating and external market changes and to estimate the future cash flows used to measure fair value. The Company's estimate of cash flows consider past performance, current and anticipated market conditions, and internal projections and operating plans which incorporate estimates for sales growth, profitability and capital spending. Additional assumptions include forecasted growth rates and estimated discount rates which are risk adjusted for current market conditions. The Company believes such assumptions reflect current and anticipated market conditions and are consistent with those that would be used by other marketplace participants for similar purposes but are subject to change due to changing conditions. The weighting of the results of each method to assess the overall business enterprise value was considered reasonable as greater weight was given to the market capitalization based on the quoted stock price as this is considered more reliable information as it is publicly available and not subject to management judgment or estimate, whereas, discounted cash flow under the income approach is subject to management estimates and judgments.\nAlthough based on the results of the business enterprise value calculation there was no indication of impairment of goodwill, the Company determined as a result of the continuing losses incurred by the Company and its negative equity, and other indicators of impairment including, the significant long-lived asset impairment recorded as of March 31, 2016 and the drop in the Company's stock price, that an additional step 2 analysis was warranted under generally accepted accounting principles.\nThe Company performed a Step 2 valuation of goodwill by valuing certain intangible assets (primarily patents, trademarks and tradenames). The Company considered the impact of all assets and liabilities in allocating the fair value of the Company to determine the implied fair value of goodwill and whether any impairment is indicated. The Company believes these intangible assets would generate the most significant difference between fair value and book value as part of completing a Step 2 purchase price allocation for the purpose of determining the value of goodwill for impairment. The valuation of intangible assets was performed using the relief from royalty method under the income approach. This method utilizes the Company's revenue projections and assigns values based on determination of appropriate royalty rates considering relevant industry information. The Company then utilized the fair value of its intangible assets along with the implied fair value of its other assets and liabilities to determine the residual fair value compared to the\ncarrying value of goodwill. The residual fair value based on the results of the Step 2 valuation indicated there was no impairment of goodwill.\nThe Company considered that the results of the valuation of goodwill indicated there was no impairment of goodwill and also indicated significant cushion between the implied fair value of goodwill and its carrying value and, therefore, the Company has concluded that no goodwill impairment existed as of March 31, 2016.\nThe Company completed its annual goodwill valuation as of June 30, 2016. The Company performed a goodwill valuation as of June 30, 2016 using a combination of the market approach and a discounted cash flow method under the income approach to determine the overall business enterprise value and then performed a Step 2 valuation of the fair value of its assets and liabilities to determine the residual fair value of goodwill. The Step 2 valuation also valued the Company's intangible assets using the relief from royalty method under the income approach. Based on the results of the goodwill valuation as of June 30, 2016, there was no impairment of goodwill. The Company considered that the results of the valuation of goodwill also indicated significant cushion between the implied fair value of goodwill and its carrying value and, therefore, the Company has concluded that no goodwill impairment existed as of June 30, 2016.\nThe Company did not record any goodwill impairments during fiscal years 2016, 2015 or 2014.\nDefinite-lived intangible assets include patents which are amortized on a straight-line method over their estimated useful lives of 15 years and are included in other assets. The Company reviews intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. When factors indicate a possible impairment, if the sum of the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of an asset is less than the carrying amount of the asset, an impairment may be recognized. Measurement of an impairment loss is based on the excess of the carrying value of the asset over its fair value. Definite-lived intangible assets were less than $0.1 million as of June 30, 2016 and 2015 and are recorded in other assets on the consolidated balance sheet. There were no impairments recorded on intangible assets during the years ended June 30, 2016, 2015 or 2014.\nResearch and Development Expense\nResearch and development expense consist primarily of payroll and related personnel expenses (including share-based compensation expense), fees paid to external service providers, costs of materials, components and supplies, costs for facilities, tooling and equipment and costs related to customization and development service arrangements and developing prototype products and samples used for various evaluation, testing and related activities for existing and potential customers.\nShare-Based Compensation\nWe grant equity awards to our employees, directors, consultants and service providers. Certain employee and director awards vest over stated vesting periods and others also require achievement of specific performance or market conditions. We expense the grant-date fair value of awards to employees and directors over their respective vesting periods. To the extent that employee and director awards vest only upon the achievement of a specific performance condition, expense is recognized over the period from the date management determines that the performance condition is probable of achievement through the date they are expected to be met. Awards granted to consultants and service providers are sometimes granted for past services, in which case their fair value is expensed on their grant date, while other awards require future service, or the achievement of performance or market conditions. Timing of expense recognition for consultant awards is similar to that of employee and director awards; however, aggregate expense is re-measured each quarter-end based on the then fair value of the award through the vesting date of the award. We estimate the fair value of stock options using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, with the exception of market-based grants, which are valued based on the Monte Carlo option pricing model. Option pricing methods require the input of highly subjective assumptions, including the expected stock price volatility.\nProperty, plant and equipment\nWe evaluate the recoverability of the recorded value of long-lived assets periodically to determine if facts and circumstances exist that would indicate that the assets might be impaired or that the useful lives should be modified. As part of this valuation, we develop projections of undiscounted future cash flows of the asset or the asset group. Our projections of undiscounted cash flows include a combination of revenue from customization and development activities, capital expenses that may be necessary to support projected product sales and commercial product sales. As customization and development activities are completed, commercial product sales are expected to scale-up. Expectations of future commercial product sales included in the projections used for our impairment analysis are based on customer-specific information as well as market estimates relating to the anticipated therapies being targeted for use with our products. These projections also include assumptions of future sales growth and profitability based on\ncontracts entered into with customers as well as future contracts to be entered into based on the current discussions and negotiations with existing and prospective customers.\nSales projections are based on assumptions including a transition in the market toward patient self-administration of injectable therapies as well as transitions in the market toward biologic therapies in the pharmaceutical industry development pipeline. Our future sales could also be impacted by factors such as our ability to obtain new and retain existing customers, the timing and extent of the customers' product development activities as well as the regulatory approval process, drug efficacy and industry acceptance of injectable therapies. If our future sales or projections of future sales are impacted by any one or more of the preceding factors, we will reassess the recorded value of the long-lived assets. If impairment is indicated, an adjustment will be made to reduce the carrying amount of these assets to their fair value.\nUnder ASC 360 Property, Plant, and Equipment, the Company is required to evaluate the recoverability of the carrying amount of its long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. In February 2016, the Company completed its review of strategic alternatives and announced the formation of a strategic collaboration centered upon the use of the Company's portfolio of prefilled, customizable wearable injectors. In connection with this focus, the Company has been evaluating the prospects of its non-wearable injector customer and supplier programs. The Company's evaluation of those programs and potential disposition of certain assets, the Company determined that certain of its long lived-assets are impaired. The Company recorded a $26.6 million non-cash asset impairment charge in the third quarter of fiscal 2016 to machinery and equipment and construction in progress. The impairment was based on the future expected use of certain equipment in the production of its product. The equipment is customized for the production of medical devices and as a result of the decision not to continue to produce certain products the related equipment was written-off as any value was determined to be nominal, if any.\nFair value measurements\nIn accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC\u201d) 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, we measure fair value based on a hierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that observable inputs be used when available. The fair value hierarchy is broken down into three levels based on the source of inputs.\nThe carrying value of financial instruments such as accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses are reasonable estimates of their fair value because of the short maturity of these items. We believe that the current carrying amount of our long-term debt approximates fair value based on the adjustment of carrying value of our term loan to its fair value as of June 30, 2016. With respect to the consideration provided to ROS (as defined below) in the form of warrants and the terms of the Eighth Amendment to the Credit Agreement and the Sixth Amendment to the Royalty Agreement, the Company evaluated whether the debt was modified or extinguished pursuant to ASC 470-50, Debt - Modifications and Extinguishments. The Company determined that the previous debt was extinguished and recorded the modified debt at fair value ($51.3 million). The Company recorded a gain on debt extinguishment during fiscal 2016 of $2.9 million which consisted of the remeasurement of the debt at fair value offset by the value of the warrants as of the Counterparty Effective Date and the deferred financing costs previously associated with the term loan\nWe have elected to measure our royalty liability at fair value in accordance with ASC 825, Financial Instruments. The fair value of the royalty liability is based on significant inputs not observable in the market, which require it to be reported as a Level 3 liability within the fair value hierarchy. The valuation uses a methodology and assumptions that we believe would be made by a market participant. In particular, the valuation analysis uses a discounted cash flow methodology under the income approach based on the present value sum of payments to be made in the future. The fair value of the royalty liability is estimated by applying a risk adjusted discount rate to the adjusted royalty revenue stream. These fair value estimates are most sensitive to changes in the payment stream.\nWe have elected to measure our derivative financial instruments in accordance with ASC 815-40, Derivative and Hedging - Contracts in Entity's Own Equity. Instruments which do not have fixed settlement provisions are deemed to be derivative instruments.\nThe fair value of the warrant liability is based on a Black-Scholes valuation. The fair value estimates are most sensitive to changes in our share price.\nThe fair value of the derivative liability is based on the average of a Monte Carlo model and a lattice model. The fair value estimates are most sensitive to changes in our share price.\nInterest expense\nWe recognize interest expense in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss for all debt instruments using the effective interest method. The effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortized cost of a financial liability and of allocating the interest expense over the relevant period. The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts the estimated\nfuture cash payments through the expected life of the financial instrument to the net carrying amount of the financial liability. The application of the method has the effect of recognizing expense payable on the instrument evenly in proportion to the amount outstanding over the period to maturity or repayment. In calculating the effective interest rate, we estimate cash flows considering all contractual terms of the financial instrument, including fees for early redemption and all other premiums and discounts.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nSee note 4 Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\u201d to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nBasis of Presentation\nRevenue\nWe derive revenue primarily from industrialization and development programs with our customers and licensing agreements. The agreements with our customers generally provide for fees to be paid to us for providing specific products or services. Certain of these agreements provide for fees to be paid upon completion of certain agreed-upon milestones. In instances where these milestones are substantive, we recognize revenue when these agreed-upon substantive milestones have been completed and there is no further performance obligation related to the substantive milestone. Certain of our agreements provide for fees to be paid for specific services to be rendered or the provision of certain deliverables, and we recognize revenue upon completion of the related service or deliverable. Certain of our agreements provide for fees to be paid on an ongoing basis over the life of the agreement for agreed-upon services, and we recognize revenue ratably over the requisite service period. We also recognize revenue on certain agreements under the proportional performance method.\nOperating expenses\nOperating expenses primarily include costs related to research and development, selling, general and administrative expenses, as well as depreciation and amortization expense.\nResearch and development costs\nResearch and development costs consist primarily of payroll and related personnel expenses (including share-based compensation expense), fees paid to external service providers, costs of materials, components and supplies, costs for facilities, tooling and equipment and costs related to customization and development service arrangements and developing prototype products and samples used for various evaluation, testing and related activities for existing and potential customers.\nSelling, general and administrative costs\nSelling, general and administrative costs include corporate payroll and related benefit costs (including share-based compensation expense), marketing and commercial development costs, quality assurance and regulatory costs, accounting and financial related costs, information and technology costs, legal and professional fees, and corporate facility costs.\nDepreciation\nDepreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the related assets, which range from 40 years for our York, Pennsylvania facility to 2 to 15 years for machinery, equipment, furniture and software and the lesser of the lease term or estimated useful life for leasehold improvements. Intangible assets are being amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives of 15 years.\nInterest expense\nInterest expense includes the cash and non-cash interest cost for all debt instruments. Interest expense is recognized under the effective interest method such that non-cash interest includes the additional expense recognized over and above the cash interest paid during a period as a result of the application of the effective interest method.\nChange in fair value of financial instruments\nChange in fair value of financial instruments includes the change in the Amended Royalty Agreement (defined below) liability, the Warrant liability, the Derivative liability, and the Preferred stock conversion liability, which are marked to fair value on a quarterly basis.\nNet loss\nNet loss includes the results from revenue recognized during the period after deducting all operating and non-operating expenses.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table summarizes our results of operations for fiscal years 2016, 2015 and 2014:\nTable 111: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal Years Ended June 30,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (in thousands, except per share data)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 14,841\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 13,158\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 14,689\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Research and development\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 43,191\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 52,487\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 34,111\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Selling, general and administrative\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 43,196\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 36,176\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 27,894\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Asset impairment charge\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 26,580\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,491\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,923\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,079\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total operating expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 118,458\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 93,586\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 66,084\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating loss\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (103,617\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (80,428\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (51,395\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10,187\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6,368\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,332\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Change in fair value of financial instruments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (9,899\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,279\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (600\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gain on debt extinguishment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2,881\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other (income) expense, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (241\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (226\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (228\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net loss\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (100,783\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (90,849\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (57,899\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net loss per share:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Basic and diluted net loss per share\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (7.04\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (8.10\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (5.90\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFiscal Year 2016 Compared to Fiscal Year 2015\nRevenue. Revenue increased by $1.7 million, or 12.8%, during fiscal year 2016 compared to fiscal year 2015 due to more revenue being recognized related to development activities for various customers. During fiscal year 2016, we recognized $4.5 million in revenue related to substantive milestones that were completed during the year pursuant to customer agreements to provide customization and development services, clinical support services, collaborative research activities and testing support services. During fiscal year 2016, we recognized $5.3 million in revenue related to services rendered on a time and materials basis, proportional performance method, completed contract method, and/or straight-line basis over the requisite service period pursuant to customer agreements to provide various customization and development services. During fiscal 2016, we recognized $5.0 million in revenue related to an agreement with a customer to provide exclusivity for a defined period of time to evaluate certain drug delivery alternatives as the requisite exclusivity period expired during the fiscal year. During fiscal year 2015, we recognized $5.1 million in revenue related to substantive milestones that were completed during the year pursuant to customer agreements to provide customization and development services, clinical support services, collaborative research activities and testing support services. During fiscal year 2015, we recognized $8.1 million in revenue related to services rendered on a time and materials basis pursuant to customer agreements to provide various customization and development services.\nResearch and development expenses. Research and development expenses decreased in fiscal year 2016 by $9.3 million, or 17.7%, compared to fiscal year 2015 primarily due to decreased tooling, prototype, and material costs of $5.8 million, decreased third-party contracting costs of $1.2 million, decreased payroll and related costs of $1.0 million, decreased travel costs of $1.0 million and decrease in other costs of $1.2 million offset by increased share-based compensation expense of $0.9 million.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased in fiscal year 2016 by $7.0 million, or 19.4%, compared to fiscal year 2015, primarily due to increased transaction costs of $5.0 million in connection with the Strategic Process and increased legal fees of $1.2 million offset by decreased travel costs of $0.9 million and decreased other costs of $0.2 million. Share-based compensation increased by $1.2 million and payroll and related costs increased by $0.7 million primarily in connection with the departure of our former CEO and COO in March 2016 which were partially offset by cost reductions as a result of business realignment initiatives.\nAsset impairment charge. The Company incurred $26.6 million of non-cash asset impairments during the year ended June 30, 2016 related to non-wearable injector machinery and equipment.\nDepreciation and amortization expense. Depreciation and amortization expense increased in fiscal year 2016 by $0.6 million, or 11.5%, compared to fiscal year 2015, primarily as a result of additional equipment previously placed in service.\nInterest expense. Interest expense increased in fiscal year 2016 by $3.8 million, or 60.0%, compared to fiscal year 2015, primarily attributable to interest on the OrbiMed Financing ($3.2 million) and the 2016 Convertible Note ($0.7 million) offset by a decrease in capitalized interest ($0.1 million).\nChange in fair value of financial instruments. Change in fair value of financial instruments decreased by $14.2 million in fiscal year 2016 compared to fiscal year 2015. A decrease of $7.9 million is related to the change in the fair value of the Royalty liability in connection with the OrbiMed Financing which is revalued each quarter. A decrease of $9.2 million is due to revaluation of the warrant liability due to a decrease in the Company's share price. A decrease of $1.3 million is due to revaluation of the derivative liability due to a decrease in the Company's share price. An increase of $4.2 million is related to the revaluation of the Preferred Stock Conversion liability.\nNet loss and net loss per share. Net loss during fiscal years 2016 and 2015 was $100.8 million and $90.8 million, respectively. Basic and diluted net loss per share was $7.04 and $8.10 during fiscal years 2016 and 2015, respectively, on weighted average shares outstanding of 14,467,510 and 11,219,490 during fiscal years 2016 and 2015, respectively. The increase in the weighted average shares outstanding was primarily due to the New Sales Agreement and Purchase Agreement (each as defined below) as well as conversions of preferred shares under the Preferred Stock Purchase Agreement.\nFiscal Year 2015 Compared to Fiscal Year 2014\nRevenue. Revenue decreased by $1.5 million, or 10.4%, during fiscal year 2015 compared to fiscal year 2014 due to less revenue being recognized related to development activities for various customers. During fiscal year 2015, we recognized $5.1 million in revenue related to substantive milestones that were completed during the year pursuant to customer agreements to provide customization and development services, clinical support services, collaborative research activities and testing support services. During fiscal year 2015, we recognized $8.1 million in revenue related to services rendered on a time and materials basis, proportional performance method and/or straight-line basis over the requisite service period pursuant to customer agreements to provide various customization and development services. During fiscal year 2014, we recognized $8.1 million in revenue related to substantive milestones that were completed during the year pursuant to customer agreements to provide customization and development services, clinical support services, collaborative research activities and testing support services. During fiscal year 2014, we recognized $4.3 million in revenue related to services rendered on a time and materials basis pursuant to customer agreements to provide various customization and development services. Also, during fiscal year 2014, we recognized $2.3 million of revenue related to our development agreement with Sanofi which was superseded by a supply agreement with Sanofi.\nResearch and development expenses. Research and development expenses increased in fiscal year 2015 by $18.4 million, or 53.9%, compared to fiscal year 2014 primarily due to increased payroll and related costs of $7.5 million and increased share-based compensation expense of $0.7 million related to increased headcount to support ongoing and future customer programs, as well as increased material and tooling costs of $8.5 million, and increased other costs of $1.7 million related to customer programs. The increased investment in research and development during fiscal year 2015 related to the supply of products and components to existing customers including for customization, industrialization and development programs and prospective customers to support evaluation processes and user studies that are typically undertaken prior to the anticipated signing of contracts.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased in fiscal year 2015 by $8.3 million, or 29.7%, compared to fiscal year 2014, primarily due to increased share-based compensation expense of $2.8 million, increased legal and professional fees of $2.3 million, increased payroll and related costs of $2.2 million and increased other administrative costs of $1.0 million.\nDepreciation and amortization expense. Depreciation and amortization expense increased in fiscal year 2015 by $0.8 million, or 20.7%, compared to fiscal year 2014, primarily as a result of machinery and equipment placed in service during the fiscal year 2015.\nInterest expense. Interest expense decreased in fiscal year 2015 by $1.0 million, or 13.1%, compared to fiscal year 2014, as a result of lower interest expense of $4.7 million due to debt that was refinanced with a term loan with the Lender in the prior year and interest of $2.2 million that was capitalized as part of construction in progress during the year partially offset by higher interest during the year of $5.9 million related to the term loan with the Lender.\nChange in fair value of financial instruments. Change in fair value of financial instruments increased by $4.9 million in fiscal year 2015 compared to fiscal year 2014, primarily due to higher royalty rates as a result of the Amendment to the Royalty Agreement we entered into with the Lender on September 30, 2014.\nNet loss and net loss per share. Net loss during fiscal years 2015 and 2014 was $90.8 million and $57.9 million, respectively. Basic and diluted net loss per share was $8.10 and $5.90 during fiscal years 2015 and 2014, respectively, on weighted average shares outstanding of 11,219,490 and 9,806,266 during fiscal years 2015 and 2014, respectively. The increase in the weighted average shares outstanding was primarily due to the issuance of common stock in connection with our February 2015 equity financing as well as shares issued under the Sales Agreement during fiscal year 2015.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAs of September 30, 2016, the Company's unaudited cash balance was approximately $8.1 million, including $2.1 million of restricted cash. Under the Company's debt facilities, the Company was required to have a cash and restricted cash balance of $5.1 million at September 30, 2016 and $5.0 million at October 31, 2016. As of June 30, 2016, cash and cash equivalents were $18.7 million, restricted cash was $2.4 million and the book value of our long-term debt was $105.1 million.\nThe Company incurred recurring losses from operations as well as negative cash flows from operating activities during fiscal years 2016, 2015, and 2014, and anticipates incurring additional losses and negative cash flows until such time that it can generate sufficient revenue from the sale, customization, or exclusive use and licensing of its wearable injectors to pharmaceutical and biotechnology customers. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. The Company has taken or intends to take the steps delineated below to address its cash requirements, the success of which is largely beyond the Company's control.\nAmgen Inc.\nOn December 31, 2015, the Company entered into an exclusivity agreement (the Exclusivity Agreement\u201d) with Amgen Inc. (the Counterparty\u201d). The Exclusivity Agreement was entered into in connection with the previously announced review of strategic alternatives to maximize shareholder value (the Strategic Process\u201d). Pursuant to the Exclusivity Agreement, the Company agreed to negotiate a potential transaction exclusively with the Counterparty and the Counterparty paid to the Company a non-refundable $15.0 million deposit as consideration for non-exclusive and exclusive rights and licenses provided for in the Exclusivity Agreement.\nOn February 22, 2016 (the Counterparty Closing Date\u201d), the Company and the Counterparty announced the formation of a strategic collaboration for the Counterparty's use of the Company's injectable drug delivery systems with the Counterparty's product portfolio. In connection with the strategic collaboration, the Company entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement (the Counterparty SPA\u201d) with the Counterparty, pursuant to which the Counterparty agreed to purchase from the Company a new series of 6% Senior Secured Convertible Notes Due 2023 in the aggregate original principal amount of up to $55.0 million (each, a Note\u201d and, collectively, the Notes\u201d). The Notes are convertible into Common Stock, and mature on February 22, 2023 (the Counterparty Maturity Date\u201d) in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Notes, as more fully described in note 10 - Long-term Debt\u201d to the consolidated financial statements.\nPursuant to the Counterparty SPA, the Notes may be issued in up to three separate closings. The Company issued to the Counterparty the first Note in the aggregate original principal amount of $30.0 million on the Counterparty Closing Date (the 2016 Convertible Note\u201d) and the Counterparty paid to the Company $30.0 million in exchange therefor. The 2016 Convertible Note is secured by certain inventory and intellectual property assets related to a specific device licensed to the Counterparty (the Collateral\u201d).\nIn connection with the transactions contemplated by the Counterparty SPA, the Company granted the Counterparty exclusive rights to the Company's wearable injectors within select drug classes for use with certain Counterparty assets, while preserving rights the Company previously granted to other customers. The Company has also granted the Counterparty non-exclusive rights to all of the Company's proprietary delivery systems within the therapeutic areas of oncology, inflammation, bone health, nephrology, cardiovascular and neuroscience. On the Counterparty Closing Date, the Counterparty paid to the Company a non-refundable $20.0 million fee (the License Fee\u201d) in consideration for such licenses.\nOrbiMed\nOn February 22, 2016, in connection with the formation of the strategic collaboration with the Counterparty, Unilife Medical Solutions, Inc., a subsidiary of the Company (the Borrower\u201d), entered into an Eighth Amendment (the Eighth Amendment to the Credit Agreement\u201d) to the Credit Agreement, dated March 12, 2014, by and between ROS Acquisition Offshore LP (the Lender\u201d), an affiliate of OrbiMed Advisors ( OrbiMed\u201d), and the Borrower (the Credit Agreement,\u201d and, as amended the Amended Credit Agreement\u201d or the OrbiMed Financing\u201d). Pursuant to and subject to the terms of the Eighth Amendment to the Credit Agreement, the Lender agreed to: (i) defer all obligations of the Borrower to pay interest to the Lender for the period from January 1, 2016 through February 22, 2018 at the rate specified in the Amended Credit Agreement, which interest will be added to the outstanding principal amount of the loan on the last day of each interest period; (ii) enable the Counterparty to take a security interest in certain inventory and intellectual property assets related to a specific device licensed to the Counterparty; and (iii) remove the minimum cash receipts\ncovenant for all future periods. In addition, on February 22, 2016, the Borrower entered into the Sixth Amendment to the Royalty Agreement (the Royalty Agreement,\u201d) with Royalty Opportunities S.A.R.L. ( ROS\u201d). Pursuant to and subject to the terms of the Sixth Amendment to the Royalty Agreement, ROS agreed to waive any rights to royalty payments otherwise payable as a result of the License Fee and the proceeds of the Notes with the Counterparty, and to defer royalty payments payable on revenues received by the Company from the Counterparty until after the end of the first fiscal quarter in which the Company sells a commercial quantity of devices developed for the Counterparty. In connection with entering into the Eighth Amendment to the Credit Agreement and the Sixth Amendment to the Royalty Agreement, the Company issued to ROS a warrant to purchase, at any time until February 22, 2026, 1,673,981 shares of Common Stock, at an exercise price of $12.50 per share, subject to adjustment for certain events. See note 10 Long Term Debt\u201d for accounting considerations relating to such warrant.\nCost Reduction Initiatives\nAs previously disclosed, during fiscal 2016 we implemented several cost reduction and business realignment initiatives pursuant to which we reduced our headcount by approximately 90 employees which initiatives are expected to reduce annual operating costs by approximately $7.9 million. Subsequent to that, the Company eliminated 10 additional positions in July 2016. In part, as a result of these headcount reductions, the Company's workforce was reduced to approximately 140 employees as of July 28, 2016, a reduction of more than 40% since January 2016 and a reduction of approximately 50% since July 1, 2015. A portion of this reduction is due to the Company's determination not to backfill certain open positions. The Company has recorded a charge from severance and related costs from these cost reduction initiatives of approximately $0.7 million in the aggregate. The Company does not believe that these cost reduction initiatives will negatively impact its ability to serve its customers.\nIn addition, the Company, on June 20, 2016, subleased a portion (the Subleased Portion\u201d) of its King of Prussia, Pennsylvania facility (the Facility\u201d). During the term of the sublease, which commenced on October 1, 2016 and will end on March 31, 2019, the Company will be entitled to receive an aggregate of approximately $1.3 million in rent with respect to the Subleased Portion. During the same time period, the Company will be obligated under the Company's lease agreement relating to the Facility to pay an aggregate of approximately $1.9 million in rent with respect to the Subleased Portion. Assuming the sublessor exercises its renewal option, the Company will be entitled to receive approximately an additional $1.9 million over the renewal term of April 1, 2019 through June 30, 2022 and the Company will be obligated under the Company's lease agreement relating to the Facility to pay an aggregate of approximately $2.5 million over the same time period. The Company ceased using the Subleased Portion as of July 20, 2016. The Company will record a non-cash charge, the amount of which the Company has not yet determined as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, which amount will be based on the discounted fair value of the difference between the amounts received from the sublessor and the amounts paid to the landlord.\nCash Receipts\nThe Company expects to generate cash receipts from wearable injector customers during fiscal 2017 and the Company continues to have business development discussions with current and prospective wearable injector customers. The Company is, however, unable to predict the amount, if any, or the timing of such receipts or any proceeds from these business development discussions.\nFundraising Efforts\nThe Company's ability to raise capital will be limited and there can be no assurance that financing will be available when needed. The Company will not be able to obtain financing through offerings of its securities registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, for the near future and until the Company can prepare, file with the SEC, and cause to become effective a registration statement on Form S-1. We are not currently eligible to register the offer and sale of our securities using a registration statement on Form S-3, cannot use our existing Form S-3 and will not become eligible to use Form S-3 until we have timely filed certain periodic reports required under the Exchange Act for 12 consecutive calendar months. As a result, the Company will not be able to obtain financing under the Controlled Equity Offering Sales Agreement that the Company entered into with Cantor Fitzgerald & Co.on July 29, 2015 (the New Sales Agreement\u201d) or the equity purchase agreement that the Company entered into with Lincoln Park Capital Fund, LLC ( LPC\u201d) on July 29, 2015 (the LPC Purchase Agreement\u201d) at least until the Company is eligible to register the offer and sale of our securities using a registration statement on Form S-3.\nPursuant to the Counterparty SPA, the Counterparty may purchase up to an additional $15.0 million in Notes in January 2017 (the 2017 Convertible Note\u201d), and up to an additional $10.0 million in Notes in January 2018 (the 2018 Convertible Note\u201d). See note 10 Long-Term Debt - Senior Secured Convertible Note\u201d for more information regarding the Notes. There can be no assurance as to when or if the Counterparty will purchase all or any part of the 2017 Convertible Note or the 2018 Convertible Note. The Counterparty's willingness to purchase the 2017 Convertible Note or the 2018 Convertible Note may be impacted by any financing the Company receives prior to January 2017 or January 2018, respectively.\nThe Company is engaged in advanced discussions to secure up to $10 million of funding (the Potential Transaction\u201d) contingent upon the completion of due diligence, the execution of a definitive agreement with respect to the Potential Transaction and the filing of (i) this 2016 10-K; (ii) the March 2016 10-Q; (iii) the December 2015 10-Q Amendment; (iv) the September 2015 10-Q Amendment; and (v) the 2015 10-K Amendment. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to enter into a definitive agreement with respect to the Potential Transaction and complete the closing of the Potential Transaction. Consummation of the Potential Transaction would require the consent of the Lender, which cannot be assured.\nThe Company has also engaged a financial advisory firm to further assist with fundraising efforts. There is no assurance that the financial advisory firm will be successful in these efforts.\nThe Company believes that potential proceeds from business development discussions, the 2017 Convertible Note, the Potential Transaction and fundraising efforts along with potential customer cash receipts, will provide the Company with enough liquidity to fund its operations for the next twelve months. However, there can be no assurance that any cash from such business development discussions, issuance of the 2017 Convertible Note, the Potential Transaction, fundraising efforts, or customer receipts will be available when needed, as such sources of liquidity largely are beyond the Company's control. If we are unable to obtain financing when needed, we may be in default under one or more of our debt obligations unless we are able to obtain waivers from our lenders. A breach of any of the covenants related to our debt instruments could result in a higher rate of interest to be paid or the lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under the applicable agreements to be immediately due and payable. If the lenders were to make such a demand for repayment, we would be unable to pay the obligations as we do not have existing facilities or sufficient cash on hand to satisfy these obligations. Under the circumstances, we also would be unable to pay our other obligations as they come due, which could prompt our creditors to pursue other remedies. These factors continue to raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the ordinary course of business. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows during the fiscal years 2016, 2015 and 2014:\nTable 112: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Year Ended June 30,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (in thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net cash (used in) provided by:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (28,432\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (55,201\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (36,601\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Investing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (17,322\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (16,633\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (12,149\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Financing activities\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 52,179\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 75,750\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 51,287\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFiscal Year 2016 Compared to Fiscal Year 2015\nNet Cash Used in Operating Activities\nNet cash used in operating activities during fiscal year 2016 was $28.4 million compared to $55.2 million during fiscal year 2015. The decrease in net cash used in operating activities was primarily due to increased cash receipts from customers recorded as deferred revenue and a decrease in research and development expense offset by an increase in selling, general, and administrative expense.\nNet Cash Used in Investing Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities during fiscal year 2016 and fiscal year 2015 was $17.3 million and $16.6 million, respectively. This increase was primarily as a result of costs incurred in connection with the purchase of machinery and related equipment, facility expansion and cleanroom reconfiguration.\nNet Cash Provided by Financing Activities\nNet cash provided by financing activities during fiscal year 2016 was $52.2 million compared to $75.8 million during fiscal year 2015. During fiscal year 2016, we received $30.0 million in net proceeds from issuance of our convertible note in February 2016, $10.0 million in aggregate proceeds from the additional tranche under the Amended Credit Agreement with the Lender, $9.4 million of proceeds in connection with our public offering of common stock under the New Sales Agreement and the LPC Purchase Agreement and $7.2 million in net proceeds from the issuance of preferred stock which was partially offset by $0.6 million in principal debt repayments, $1.2 million in royalty liability payments, $1.6 million in shares forfeited in lieu of payroll taxes, $0.6\nmillion in financing costs and $0.3 million in preferred stock dividends. During fiscal year 2015, we received $44.7 million in net proceeds from our public offering of common stock in February 2015, $20.0 million in aggregate proceeds from the two additional tranches under the Amended Credit Agreement with the Lender and $12.4 million of proceeds in connection with our public offering of common stock under the old sales agreement which was partially offset by $0.6 million in principal debt repayments and $0.7 million in royalty liability payments.\nFiscal Year 2015 Compared to Fiscal Year 2014\nNet Cash Used in Operating Activities\nNet cash used in operating activities during fiscal year 2015 was $55.2 million compared to $36.6 million during fiscal year 2014. The increase in net cash used in operating activities was primarily due to increased research and development costs of $17.7 million (exclusive of noncash expenses), and net other items $0.9 million.\nNet Cash Used in Investing Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities during fiscal year 2015 and fiscal year 2014 was $16.6 million and $12.1 million, respectively. This increase was primarily as a result of costs incurred in connection with the purchase of machinery and related equipment, facility expansion and cleanroom reconfiguration.\nNet Cash Provided by Financing Activities\nNet cash provided by financing activities during fiscal year 2015 was $75.8 million compared to $51.3 million during fiscal year 2014. During fiscal year 2015, we received $44.7 million in net proceeds from our public offering of common stock in February 2015, $20.0 million in aggregate proceeds from the two additional tranches under the Amended Credit Agreement with the Lender and $12.4 million of proceeds in connection with our public offering of common stock under the old sales agreement which was partially offset by $0.6 million in principal debt repayments and $0.7 million in royalty liability payments. During fiscal year 2014, we received $40.0 million from our March 2014 term loan, $16.9 million in connection with our public offering of common stock under the old sales agreement and $2.5 million upon the exercise of stock options. These amounts were partially offset by principal debt payments and financing costs of $8.1 million.\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nThe following table provides information regarding our contractual obligations as of June 30, 2016:\nTable 113: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Payments Due by Period\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Less Than\n1 Year\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1-3 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 3-5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> More Than\n5 Years\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (In thousands)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Long-term debt and related interest\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 184,644\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 1,495\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 15,349\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 106,318\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 61,482\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating leases\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6,374\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,561\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 2,592\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,330\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Purchase obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total contractual obligations\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 191,458\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 2,826\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 16,910\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 108,910\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 62,812\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements as such term is defined in the SEC rules.\nTable 114: <table> <tr> <td>", "summary": "- American Science and Engineering, Inc.

See Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Information\u201d at the beginning of this report. References to our fiscal year refer to the fiscal year ending June 30.\nOverview\nWe are a designer, manufacturer, and supplier of innovative injectable drug delivery systems that can enhance and differentiate the injectable products of our pharmaceutical and biotechnology customers. We believe our products are differentiated from conventional products, with innovative features and functionality designed to optimize the safe, simple, and convenient administration of injectable therapies. The majority of our products are designed for sale directly to pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies who are expected to supply them as drug-device combination products, pre-filled and ready for administration by end-users, such as patients or health-care providers. We customize products within each of our platforms to address specific customer, therapy, patient and/or commercial requirements.\nAlthough we have a broad portfolio of proprietary product platforms, we have focused our business on our wearable injector products. We expect that by focusing primarily on active and new customer programs in our portfolio of wearable injector systems, we will improve our operating efficiencies and better position the Company to take advantage of commercial opportunities within the fast-growing market for wearable injectors. Our wearable injector customers include Amgen Inc., MedImmune LLC ( MedImmune\u201d), and Sanofi S.A. ( Sanofi\u201d).\nCommon Stock Reverse Stock Split\nOn May 13, 2016, pursuant to prior stockholder authorization, the Company effected a reverse split of the Company's common stock, pursuant to which every ten (10) shares of common stock outstanding before the reverse split were converted into one (1) share of common stock after the reverse split. All share and per share amounts, and exercise and conversion prices for all periods presented herein have been adjusted to reflect the reverse split as if it had occurred at the beginning of the first period presented.\nInvestigation and Amendments to Financial Statements\nOn May 8, 2016, the Company announced an investigation into violations of the Company's policies and procedures and possible violations of law and regulation by the Company's former Chief Executive Officer, Alan Shortall, whose employment with the Company ceased on March 11, 2016, and its former Chairman, Jim Bosnjak, who resigned from the Company's Board of Directors (the Board\u201d) on August 24, 2015 (the Investigation\u201d).\nThe Investigation identified certain related party and other transactions which the Company had not previously publicly disclosed or recorded in its financial statements. Also, as the result of Investigation, the Company was not able to timely file its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2016 (the March 2016 10-Q\u201d) or this Annual Report on Form 10-K (the 2016 10-K\u201d). As a result, the Company is filing this 2016 10-K and is concurrently filing the March 2016 10-Q along with (i) an amendment to the Company's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2015 (the September 2015 10-Q Amendment\u201d); (ii) an amendment to the Company's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2015 (the December 2015 10-Q Amendment\u201d); and (iii) an amendment to the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015 (the 2015 10-K Amendment\u201d). These amendments are being made to correct immaterial errors in the previously reported financial statements and to disclose certain material weaknesses in the Company's internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures. See Explanatory Note\u201d above for a summary of the results of the Investigation and of the specific amendments reflected in the September 2015 10-Q Amendment, the December 2015 10-Q Amendment and the 2015 10-K Amendment.\nManagement and Board Changes\nThe Company no longer has any business relationship with Mr. Shortall or Mr. Bosnjak. As of March 11, 2016, (i) Mr. Shortall's employment as Chief Executive Officer of the Company ceased and Mr. Shortall resigned from his position as Chairman of the Board, (ii) the Board appointed Mary Kate Wold to serve as its new Chair, and (iii) the employment of Ramin Mojdeh, Ph.D. as the Company's President and Chief Operating Officer ceased.\nEffective March 14, 2016, the Board appointed John Ryan as the Company's Interim President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company. The Board subsequently appointed Mr. Ryan as the Company's President and Chief Executive Officer and also appointed Mr. Ryan to serve as a member of the Board, in each case, effective July 28, 2016.\nOn July 25, 2016, the Company's employment of Mark Iampietro as the Company's Vice President of Quality and Regulatory Affairs and Chief Compliance Officer was ended by the Company without cause.\nOn July 28, 2016:\n \u2022 the Board appointed Michael E. Kamarck to serve as a member of the Board; \n \u2022 the Board appointed Ian Hanson as the Company's Chief Operating Officer in addition to his roles as the Company's Senior Vice President; \n \u2022 due to results of the Investigation, Dennis P. Pyers was removed from his position as the Company's Senior Vice President, Controller, Treasurer and Chief Accounting Officer and was appointed as the Company's Senior Advisor, Special Projects; \n \u2022 the Board appointed David Hastings as the Company's Chief Accounting Officer and Treasurer in addition to his roles as the Company's Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; \n \u2022 the Board appointed Stephanie Walters as Senior Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary; and \n \u2022 the Board appointed Molly Weaver, Ph.D., as Vice President of Quality and Regulatory Affairs and Chief Compliance Officer. \nInvestigation and Litigation Related to this Matter\nThe Company has reported the final results of the Investigation to the SEC and to The NASDAQ Stock Market LLC ( NASDAQ\u201d), and the Company continues to cooperate fully with the SEC with respect to the SEC's ongoing investigation. The SEC or other external parties could request further documents and information from the Company. The Company and certain of its current and former directors and officers have also been named as defendants in a number of lawsuits filed in connection with the matters set forth in this Explanatory Note. For information concerning the SEC's ongoing investigation and such lawsuits, see Part I, Item 3. Legal Proceedings\u201d of this 2016 10-K.\nMatters Relating to NASDAQ and Our Common Stock and ASX and our CDIs\nThe filing of this 2016 10-K and the March 2016 10-Q were delayed as a result of the Investigation. As a result of such delay, on May 17, 2016, the Company received a notice from the Listing Qualifications department of NASDAQ stating that, because the Company had not yet filed the March 2016 10-Q, the Company was no longer in compliance with NASDAQ Listing Rule 5250(c)(1), which requires listed companies to timely file all required periodic financial reports with the SEC. The notice received from NASDAQ stated that the Company had 60 calendar days from the date of the notice to submit a plan to regain compliance with NASDAQ's continued listing requirements.\nOn July 18, 2016, the Company timely submitted a plan to NASDAQ as to how it planned to regain compliance with NASDAQ's continued listing requirements. The staff at NASDAQ subsequently granted the Company an exception to file the March 2016 10-Q and any other delinquent SEC filings on or before November 7, 2016 in order to enable the Company to regain compliance with the listing rules.\nOn September 19, 2016, the Company received a notice from the Listing Qualifications department of NASDAQ stating that, because the Company had not yet filed this 2016 10-K, the Company is not in compliance with NASDAQ Listing Rule 5250(c)(1). The Company timely submitted to NASDAQ an updated compliance plan on October 4, 2016.\nAs noted above, the Company is concurrently filing with the SEC the March 2016 10-Q and the 2016 10-K with the 2015 10-K Amendment, the September 2015 10-Q Amendment and the December 2015 10-Q Amendment. Consequently, the Company currently believes that it has adequately remedied its non-compliance with NASDAQ Listing Rule 5250(c)(1) within NASDAQ's terms of exception. However, there can be no assurance that NASDAQ will concur that we have remedied such non-compliance.\nOn October 17, 2016, the Company received a notice from the Listing Qualifications department of NASDAQ stating that, because the Company did not maintain a minimum Market Value of Listed Securities ( MVLS\u201d) of $50,000,000 for the last 30 consecutive business days, the Company was no longer in compliance with NASDAQ Listing Rule 5450(b)(2)(A).\nThe Company has been provided a period of 180 calendar days, or until April 17, 2017, to regain compliance with the minimum MVLS listing requirement. If at any time on or before April 17, 2017, the MVLS of the Company's common stock closes at $50,000,000 or more for a minimum of 10 consecutive business days, NASDAQ will provide the Company with written confirmation that the Company has achieved compliance with the minimum MVLS listing requirement and the matter will be closed.\nIn the event that the Company does not regain compliance with the minimum MVLS listing requirement on or before April 17, 2017, NASDAQ will provide the Company with written notification that its securities are subject to delisting. At that time, the Company would be permitted to appeal the delisting determination to a NASDAQ Hearings Panel or apply to transfer its common stock to The NASDAQ Capital Market (provided that it satisfied the requirement for continued listing on that market). (See Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors of this 2016 10-K - We are not in compliance with the requirements of NASDAQ for continued listing, and if NASDAQ does not concur that we have adequately remedied our non-compliance with NASDAQ Listing Rule 5250(c)(1) or we do not adequately remedy our non-compliance with NASDAQ Listing Rule 5450(b)(2)(A), our common stock may be delisted from trading on NASDAQ, which could have a material adverse effect on us and our stockholders\u201d below).\nThe Company was also required to file audited financial statements with the Australian Securities Exchange (the ASX\u201d) no later than September 30, 2016 (the ASX Deadline\u201d). The Company was not able to file such audited financial statements by the ASX Deadline. As a result, pursuant to ASX rules, trading in the Company's CDIs on the ASX was to be suspended prior to the opening of trading on the ASX on October 3, 2016, however, the ASX accepted the Company's request for an immediate voluntary suspension of trading and as such, ASX halted trading of the Company's CDIs on the ASX prior to the opening of trading on September 30, 2016 in Australia. Such trading in Australia will not resume until after the Company files the audited financial statements included in this 2016 10-K with the ASX, which the Company is doing concurrently with filing this 2016 10-K with the SEC.\nKey Factors Affecting Performance and Financial Condition\nWe are party to several agreements with our customers, including customers with whom we have entered into customization, development and/or supply agreements. The customization, industrialization and development fees and other payments received from customers in connection with these agreements and development programs accounted for the majority of our revenue during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016.\nLonger customer development timelines and increases in capital expenses and headcount have impacted us from a liquidity standpoint. Historically, we have funded our operations primarily from a combination of term loans, equity issuances, borrowings under our bank mortgages, and payments from various customers. See Liquidity and Capital Resources Discussion\u201d below.\nRevenue\nOur revenue is currently generated from customization, industrialization and development fees (many of which are recognized on the milestone basis of accounting). Customization, industrialization and development fees accounted for substantially all of our consolidated revenue for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016. We expect that the Company's revenue will continue to fluctuate on a quarter to quarter basis. A significant portion of our business is generated by a small number of major customers. Our top three customers generated approximately 91% of our total revenue in fiscal 2016. As our industry, market demand and our customer base changes, our major customers may also change. However, we expect that a significant portion of our future annual revenue will be concentrated among a few customers.\nOperating Expenses\nOur operating expenses had been increasing primarily as a result of increased research and development efforts in response to increasing demand from our customers for our products and services and anticipated market demand. The increase in research and development costs also related to the costs of products and components supplied to existing and prospective customers to support evaluation processes and user studies that are typically undertaken prior to the anticipated signing of customer agreements. However, during fiscal year 2016 we implemented several cost reduction and business realignment initiatives that were previously disclosed, pursuant to which we reduced our headcount by approximately 90 employees. Such headcount reductions are expected to reduce annual operating costs by approximately $7.9 million. We expect to further reduce our annual operating costs by not backfilling certain open positions. We do not believe that these cost reduction initiatives will negatively impact our ability to serve our customers.\nAlso as a result of these initiatives, our research and development expense decreased from approximately $17.0 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2015 to approximately $7.4 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016, or approximately 56%. Selling, general and administrative expense decreased from approximately $9.4 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2015, to approximately $7.6 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016, or approximately 20%.\nSignificant Developments in the Industry\nWe believe that our existing wearable injector contracts could provide significant revenue growth in relation to prior periods. Known trends in the industry that we believe will have a material favorable impact on our revenue include a shift in the focus of large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies' product development activities to biologic therapies, an emphasis within health-care providers to patient self-administration and a growing demand for passive safety for injectable drug delivery. There has been a marked shift in the product development activities of large customers toward biologic therapies, and the majority of therapies in the pipeline of large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies are complex biologic therapies. The characteristics of many of these therapies (including, for example, large dose volumes and increased viscosity) necessitates administration by injection using innovative injectable drug delivery systems such as our products. We believe that we are well-positioned to meet what we expect to be a growing demand for innovative injectable drug delivery systems in light of the focus on biologic therapies. Concurrently with the shift toward biologic therapies is an emphasis towards patient self-administration. Patient self-administration is viewed as a growing trend in order to reduce demand pressure on the health-care system as well as reducing costs, especially for treatment of chronic illnesses. Devices suitable for self-administration of injectable therapies need to be safe and intuitive to use. We believe that our products are well suited for safe and intuitive patient self-administration of injectable therapies.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nWe prepare our audited consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S., or U.S. GAAP. This requires management to make certain estimates, judgments and assumptions that could affect the amounts reported in the audited consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. We believe there are several accounting policies that are critical to understanding our historical and future performance, as these policies affect the reported amounts of revenue and other significant areas that involve management's judgments, estimates and assumptions. These critical accounting policies and estimates have been discussed with our audit committee.\nThe preparation of our audited consolidated financial statements requires us to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate these judgments, estimates and assumptions. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable at such time, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other independent sources. Actual results may ultimately differ from these estimates.\nWhile there are a number of accounting policies, methods and estimates affecting our consolidated financial statements as addressed in Note 4 to our audited consolidated financial statements, areas that are particularly significant and critical include:\nRevenue Recognition\nWe recognize revenue from industrialization and development fees, licensing fees and product sales. We recognize revenue from sales of products at the time of shipment when title passes to the customer. We recognize up front, non-refundable fees ratably over the expected life of the related agreement. Revenue from industrialization and development fees is recognized as services are rendered, under the completed contract method, under the proportional performance method or upon achievement of the at risk\u201d substantive milestone events, which represent the culmination of the earnings process related to such events. Substantive milestones can include specific deliverables such as product design, prototype availability, user tests, manufacturing proof of principle and the various steps to complete the industrialization of the product. The terms of these contracts provide for customer payments to be made as services are rendered or substantive milestones are achieved. We consider whether a milestone is substantive at the inception of the agreement. The consideration earned from the achievement of a milestone must meet all of the following criteria to be considered substantive:\n \u2022 It is commensurate with either our performance to achieve the milestone, or the enhancement of the value of the delivered item(s) as a result of a specific outcome resulting from our performance to achieve the milestone; \n \u2022 It relates solely to past performance; and \n \u2022 It is reasonable relative to all of the deliverables and payment terms (including other potential milestone consideration) within the arrangement. \nPayment terms are considered to be standard commercial terms. Revenue is recognized when each substantive milestone has been achieved and we have no future performance obligations related to the substantive milestone. Fees for completed substantive milestones which are dependent upon customer acceptance for non-refundable payment or, if paid, are refundable pending customer acceptance are recognized upon customer acceptance and the termination of refund rights.\nWe recognized $14.8 million, $13.2 million and $14.7 million of revenue during fiscal years 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, as follows:\nDuring the fiscal year 2016, we recognized $4.5 million in revenue related to substantive milestones that were completed during the year pursuant to customer agreements to provide customization and development services, clinical support services, collaborative research activities and testing support services. Milestones completed during the year included various customization activities, device design, devices developed for use in customer evaluation testing, compatibility testing, user studies, and verification activities.\nDuring fiscal year 2016, we recognized $5.3 million in revenue related to services rendered on a time and materials basis, proportional performance method and/or straight-line basis over the requisite service period pursuant to customer agreements to provide various customization and development services. During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016, we recognized $5.0 million in revenue related to an agreement with a customer to provide exclusivity for a defined period of time to evaluate certain drug delivery alternatives as the requisite exclusivity period expired during the fiscal year.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill is the excess of purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired in business acquisitions. Goodwill is subject to, at a minimum, an annual impairment assessment of its carrying value at the reporting unit level. Additional impairment assessments would be performed if events and circumstances warranted such additional assessments during the year. The Company has one reporting unit which includes its product lines, the base technology which it obtained as part of its November 2002 acquisition of Unitract Syringe Pty Limited, and the manufacturing capability which it obtained in its January 2007 acquisition of Integrated BioSciences, Inc.\nAs required under generally accepted accounting principles, the Company is required to evaluate goodwill for impairment at least annually and more frequently if certain trigger events occur. The Company determined that the culmination of the Strategic Process and the decision to focus primarily on the wearable injector business constituted trigger events that occurred in the quarter ended March 31, 2016 requiring an evaluation of the carrying value of the Company's goodwill. Potential impairment of goodwill is identified by comparing the fair value with its carrying value.\nThe Company performed a goodwill valuation as of March 31, 2016 using a combination of the market approach and a discounted cash flow method under the income approach. The Company determined an overall business enterprise value (determined by the fair of equity plus the fair value of debt) by taking a weighted average form the results of the discounted cash flow under the income approach (40%) and the market approach based on the Company's market capitalization (60%). Under the income approach, the Company calculates the fair value of its reporting unit based on the present value of estimated future cash flows. Considerable management judgment is necessary to evaluate the impact of operating and external market changes and to estimate the future cash flows used to measure fair value. The Company's estimate of cash flows consider past performance, current and anticipated market conditions, and internal projections and operating plans which incorporate estimates for sales growth, profitability and capital spending. Additional assumptions include forecasted growth rates and estimated discount rates which are risk adjusted for current market conditions. The Company believes such assumptions reflect current and anticipated market conditions and are consistent with those that would be used by other marketplace participants for similar purposes but are subject to change due to changing conditions. The weighting of the results of each method to assess the overall business enterprise value was considered reasonable as greater weight was given to the market capitalization based on the quoted stock price as this is considered more reliable information as it is publicly available and not subject to management judgment or estimate, whereas, discounted cash flow under the income approach is subject to management estimates and judgments.\nAlthough based on the results of the business enterprise value calculation there was no indication of impairment of goodwill, the Company determined as a result of the continuing losses incurred by the Company and its negative equity, and other indicators of impairment including, the significant long-lived asset impairment recorded as of March 31, 2016 and the drop in the Company's stock price, that an additional step 2 analysis was warranted under generally accepted accounting principles.\nThe Company performed a Step 2 valuation of goodwill by valuing certain intangible assets (primarily patents, trademarks and tradenames). The Company considered the impact of all assets and liabilities in allocating the fair value of the Company to determine the implied fair value of goodwill and whether any impairment is indicated. The Company believes these intangible assets would generate the most significant difference between fair value and book value as part of completing a Step 2 purchase price allocation for the purpose of determining the value of goodwill for impairment. The valuation of intangible assets was performed using the relief from royalty method under the income approach. This method utilizes the Company's revenue projections and assigns values based on determination of appropriate royalty rates considering relevant industry information. The Company then utilized the fair value of its intangible assets along with the implied fair value of its other assets and liabilities to determine the residual fair value compared to the\ncarrying value of goodwill. The residual fair value based on the results of the Step 2 valuation indicated there was no impairment of goodwill.\nThe Company considered that the results of the valuation of goodwill indicated there was no impairment of goodwill and also indicated significant cushion between the implied fair value of goodwill and its carrying value and, therefore, the Company has concluded that no goodwill impairment existed as of March 31, 2016.\nThe Company completed its annual goodwill valuation as of June 30, 2016. The Company performed a goodwill valuation as of June 30, 2016 using a combination of the market approach and a discounted cash flow method under the income approach to determine the overall business enterprise value and then performed a Step 2 valuation of the fair value of its assets and liabilities to determine the residual fair value of goodwill. The Step 2 valuation also valued the Company's intangible assets using the relief from royalty method under the income approach. Based on the results of the goodwill valuation as of June 30, 2016, there was no impairment of goodwill. The Company considered that the results of the valuation of goodwill also indicated significant cushion between the implied fair value of goodwill and its carrying value and, therefore, the Company has concluded that no goodwill impairment existed as of June 30, 2016.\nThe Company did not record any goodwill impairments during fiscal years 2016, 2015 or 2014.\nDefinite-lived intangible assets include patents which are amortized on a straight-line method over their estimated useful lives of 15 years and are included in other assets. The Company reviews intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. When factors indicate a possible impairment, if the sum of the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of an asset is less than the carrying amount of the asset, an impairment may be recognized. Measurement of an impairment loss is based on the excess of the carrying value of the asset over its fair value. Definite-lived intangible assets were less than $0.1 million as of June 30, 2016 and 2015 and are recorded in other assets on the consolidated balance sheet. There were no impairments recorded on intangible assets during the years ended June 30, 2016, 2015 or 2014.\nResearch and Development Expense\nResearch and development expense consist primarily of payroll and related personnel expenses (including share-based compensation expense), fees paid to external service providers, costs of materials, components and supplies, costs for facilities, tooling and equipment and costs related to customization and development service arrangements and developing prototype products and samples used for various evaluation, testing and related activities for existing and potential customers.\nShare-Based Compensation\nWe grant equity awards to our employees, directors, consultants and service providers. Certain employee and director awards vest over stated vesting periods and others also require achievement of specific performance or market conditions. We expense the grant-date fair value of awards to employees and directors over their respective vesting periods. To the extent that employee and director awards vest only upon the achievement of a specific performance condition, expense is recognized over the period from the date management determines that the performance condition is probable of achievement through the date they are expected to be met. Awards granted to consultants and service providers are sometimes granted for past services, in which case their fair value is expensed on their grant date, while other awards require future service, or the achievement of performance or market conditions. Timing of expense recognition for consultant awards is similar to that of employee and director awards; however, aggregate expense is re-measured each quarter-end based on the then fair value of the award through the vesting date of the award. We estimate the fair value of stock options using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, with the exception of market-based grants, which are valued based on the Monte Carlo option pricing model. Option pricing methods require the input of highly subjective assumptions, including the expected stock price volatility.\nProperty, plant and equipment\nWe evaluate the recoverability of the recorded value of long-lived assets periodically to determine if facts and circumstances exist that would indicate that the assets might be impaired or that the useful lives should be modified. As part of this valuation, we develop projections of undiscounted future cash flows of the asset or the asset group. Our projections of undiscounted cash flows include a combination of revenue from customization and development activities, capital expenses that may be necessary to support projected product sales and commercial product sales. As customization and development activities are completed, commercial product sales are expected to scale-up. Expectations of future commercial product sales included in the projections used for our impairment analysis are based on customer-specific information as well as market estimates relating to the anticipated therapies being targeted for use with our products. These projections also include assumptions of future sales growth and profitability based on\ncontracts entered into with customers as well as future contracts to be entered into based on the current discussions and negotiations with existing and prospective customers.\nSales projections are based on assumptions including a transition in the market toward patient self-administration of injectable therapies as well as transitions in the market toward biologic therapies in the pharmaceutical industry development pipeline. Our future sales could also be impacted by factors such as our ability to obtain new and retain existing customers, the timing and extent of the customers' product development activities as well as the regulatory approval process, drug efficacy and industry acceptance of injectable therapies. If our future sales or projections of future sales are impacted by any one or more of the preceding factors, we will reassess the recorded value of the long-lived assets. If impairment is indicated, an adjustment will be made to reduce the carrying amount of these assets to their fair value.\nUnder ASC 360 Property, Plant, and Equipment, the Company is required to evaluate the recoverability of the carrying amount of its long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. In February 2016, the Company completed its review of strategic alternatives and announced the formation of a strategic collaboration centered upon the use of the Company's portfolio of prefilled, customizable wearable injectors. In connection with this focus, the Company has been evaluating the prospects of its non-wearable injector customer and supplier programs. The Company's evaluation of those programs and potential disposition of certain assets, the Company determined that certain of its long lived-assets are impaired. The Company recorded a $26.6 million non-cash asset impairment charge in the third quarter of fiscal 2016 to machinery and equipment and construction in progress. The impairment was based on the future expected use of certain equipment in the production of its product. The equipment is customized for the production of medical devices and as a result of the decision not to continue to produce certain products the related equipment was written-off as any value was determined to be nominal, if any.\nFair value measurements\nIn accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC\u201d) 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, we measure fair value based on a hierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that observable inputs be used when available. The fair value hierarchy is broken down into three levels based on the source of inputs.\nThe carrying value of financial instruments such as accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses are reasonable estimates of their fair value because of the short maturity of these items. We believe that the current carrying amount of our long-term debt approximates fair value based on the adjustment of carrying value of our term loan to its fair value as of June 30, 2016. With respect to the consideration provided to ROS (as defined below) in the form of warrants and the terms of the Eighth Amendment to the Credit Agreement and the Sixth Amendment to the Royalty Agreement, the Company evaluated whether the debt was modified or extinguished pursuant to ASC 470-50, Debt - Modifications and Extinguishments. The Company determined that the previous debt was extinguished and recorded the modified debt at fair value ($51.3 million). The Company recorded a gain on debt extinguishment during fiscal 2016 of $2.9 million which consisted of the remeasurement of the debt at fair value offset by the value of the warrants as of the Counterparty Effective Date and the deferred financing costs previously associated with the term loan\nWe have elected to measure our royalty liability at fair value in accordance with ASC 825, Financial Instruments. The fair value of the royalty liability is based on significant inputs not observable in the market, which require it to be reported as a Level 3 liability within the fair value hierarchy. The valuation uses a methodology and assumptions that we believe would be made by a market participant. In particular, the valuation analysis uses a discounted cash flow methodology under the income approach based on the present value sum of payments to be made in the future. The fair value of the royalty liability is estimated by applying a risk adjusted discount rate to the adjusted royalty revenue stream. These fair value estimates are most sensitive to changes in the payment stream.\nWe have elected to measure our derivative financial instruments in accordance with ASC 815-40, Derivative and Hedging - Contracts in Entity's Own Equity. Instruments which do not have fixed settlement provisions are deemed to be derivative instruments.\nThe fair value of the warrant liability is based on a Black-Scholes valuation. The fair value estimates are most sensitive to changes in our share price.\nThe fair value of the derivative liability is based on the average of a Monte Carlo model and a lattice model. The fair value estimates are most sensitive to changes in our share price.\nInterest expense\nWe recognize interest expense in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss for all debt instruments using the effective interest method. The effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortized cost of a financial liability and of allocating the interest expense over the relevant period. The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts the estimated\nfuture cash payments through the expected life of the financial instrument to the net carrying amount of the financial liability. The application of the method has the effect of recognizing expense payable on the instrument evenly in proportion to the amount outstanding over the period to maturity or repayment. In calculating the effective interest rate, we estimate cash flows considering all contractual terms of the financial instrument, including fees for early redemption and all other premiums and discounts.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nSee note 4 Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\u201d to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nBasis of Presentation\nRevenue\nWe derive revenue primarily from industrialization and development programs with our customers and licensing agreements. The agreements with our customers generally provide for fees to be paid to us for providing specific products or services. Certain of these agreements provide for fees to be paid upon completion of certain agreed-upon milestones. In instances where these milestones are substantive, we recognize revenue when these agreed-upon substantive milestones have been completed and there is no further performance obligation related to the substantive milestone. Certain of our agreements provide for fees to be paid for specific services to be rendered or the provision of certain deliverables, and we recognize revenue upon completion of the related service or deliverable. Certain of our agreements provide for fees to be paid on an ongoing basis over the life of the agreement for agreed-upon services, and we recognize revenue ratably over the requisite service period. We also recognize revenue on certain agreements under the proportional performance method.\nOperating expenses\nOperating expenses primarily include costs related to research and development, selling, general and administrative expenses, as well as depreciation and amortization expense.\nResearch and development costs\nResearch and development costs consist primarily of payroll and related personnel expenses (including share-based compensation expense), fees paid to external service providers, costs of materials, components and supplies, costs for facilities, tooling and equipment and costs related to customization and development service arrangements and developing prototype products and samples used for various evaluation, testing and related activities for existing and potential customers.\nSelling, general and administrative costs\nSelling, general and administrative costs include corporate payroll and related benefit costs (including share-based compensation expense), marketing and commercial development costs, quality assurance and regulatory costs, accounting and financial related costs, information and technology costs, legal and professional fees, and corporate facility costs.\nDepreciation\nDepreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the related assets, which range from 40 years for our York, Pennsylvania facility to 2 to 15 years for machinery, equipment, furniture and software and the lesser of the lease term or estimated useful life for leasehold improvements. Intangible assets are being amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives of 15 years.\nInterest expense\nInterest expense includes the cash and non-cash interest cost for all debt instruments. Interest expense is recognized under the effective interest method such that non-cash interest includes the additional expense recognized over and above the cash interest paid during a period as a result of the application of the effective interest method.\nChange in fair value of financial instruments\nChange in fair value of financial instruments includes the change in the Amended Royalty Agreement (defined below) liability, the Warrant liability, the Derivative liability, and the Preferred stock conversion liability, which are marked to fair value on a quarterly basis.\nNet loss\nNet loss includes the results from revenue recognized during the period after deducting all operating and non-operating expenses.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table summarizes our results of operations for fiscal years 2016, 2015 and 2014:\n\nFiscal Year 2016 Compared to Fiscal Year 2015\nRevenue. Revenue increased by $1.7 million, or 12.8%, during fiscal year 2016 compared to fiscal year 2015 due to more revenue being recognized related to development activities for various customers. During fiscal year 2016, we recognized $4.5 million in revenue related to substantive milestones that were completed during the year pursuant to customer agreements to provide customization and development services, clinical support services, collaborative research activities and testing support services. During fiscal year 2016, we recognized $5.3 million in revenue related to services rendered on a time and materials basis, proportional performance method, completed contract method, and/or straight-line basis over the requisite service period pursuant to customer agreements to provide various customization and development services. During fiscal 2016, we recognized $5.0 million in revenue related to an agreement with a customer to provide exclusivity for a defined period of time to evaluate certain drug delivery alternatives as the requisite exclusivity period expired during the fiscal year. During fiscal year 2015, we recognized $5.1 million in revenue related to substantive milestones that were completed during the year pursuant to customer agreements to provide customization and development services, clinical support services, collaborative research activities and testing support services. During fiscal year 2015, we recognized $8.1 million in revenue related to services rendered on a time and materials basis pursuant to customer agreements to provide various customization and development services.\nResearch and development expenses. Research and development expenses decreased in fiscal year 2016 by $9.3 million, or 17.7%, compared to fiscal year 2015 primarily due to decreased tooling, prototype, and material costs of $5.8 million, decreased third-party contracting costs of $1.2 million, decreased payroll and related costs of $1.0 million, decreased travel costs of $1.0 million and decrease in other costs of $1.2 million offset by increased share-based compensation expense of $0.9 million.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased in fiscal year 2016 by $7.0 million, or 19.4%, compared to fiscal year 2015, primarily due to increased transaction costs of $5.0 million in connection with the Strategic Process and increased legal fees of $1.2 million offset by decreased travel costs of $0.9 million and decreased other costs of $0.2 million. Share-based compensation increased by $1.2 million and payroll and related costs increased by $0.7 million primarily in connection with the departure of our former CEO and COO in March 2016 which were partially offset by cost reductions as a result of business realignment initiatives.\nAsset impairment charge. The Company incurred $26.6 million of non-cash asset impairments during the year ended June 30, 2016 related to non-wearable injector machinery and equipment.\nDepreciation and amortization expense. Depreciation and amortization expense increased in fiscal year 2016 by $0.6 million, or 11.5%, compared to fiscal year 2015, primarily as a result of additional equipment previously placed in service.\nInterest expense. Interest expense increased in fiscal year 2016 by $3.8 million, or 60.0%, compared to fiscal year 2015, primarily attributable to interest on the OrbiMed Financing ($3.2 million) and the 2016 Convertible Note ($0.7 million) offset by a decrease in capitalized interest ($0.1 million).\nChange in fair value of financial instruments. Change in fair value of financial instruments decreased by $14.2 million in fiscal year 2016 compared to fiscal year 2015. A decrease of $7.9 million is related to the change in the fair value of the Royalty liability in connection with the OrbiMed Financing which is revalued each quarter. A decrease of $9.2 million is due to revaluation of the warrant liability due to a decrease in the Company's share price. A decrease of $1.3 million is due to revaluation of the derivative liability due to a decrease in the Company's share price. An increase of $4.2 million is related to the revaluation of the Preferred Stock Conversion liability.\nNet loss and net loss per share. Net loss during fiscal years 2016 and 2015 was $100.8 million and $90.8 million, respectively. Basic and diluted net loss per share was $7.04 and $8.10 during fiscal years 2016 and 2015, respectively, on weighted average shares outstanding of 14,467,510 and 11,219,490 during fiscal years 2016 and 2015, respectively. The increase in the weighted average shares outstanding was primarily due to the New Sales Agreement and Purchase Agreement (each as defined below) as well as conversions of preferred shares under the Preferred Stock Purchase Agreement.\nFiscal Year 2015 Compared to Fiscal Year 2014\nRevenue. Revenue decreased by $1.5 million, or 10.4%, during fiscal year 2015 compared to fiscal year 2014 due to less revenue being recognized related to development activities for various customers. During fiscal year 2015, we recognized $5.1 million in revenue related to substantive milestones that were completed during the year pursuant to customer agreements to provide customization and development services, clinical support services, collaborative research activities and testing support services. During fiscal year 2015, we recognized $8.1 million in revenue related to services rendered on a time and materials basis, proportional performance method and/or straight-line basis over the requisite service period pursuant to customer agreements to provide various customization and development services. During fiscal year 2014, we recognized $8.1 million in revenue related to substantive milestones that were completed during the year pursuant to customer agreements to provide customization and development services, clinical support services, collaborative research activities and testing support services. During fiscal year 2014, we recognized $4.3 million in revenue related to services rendered on a time and materials basis pursuant to customer agreements to provide various customization and development services. Also, during fiscal year 2014, we recognized $2.3 million of revenue related to our development agreement with Sanofi which was superseded by a supply agreement with Sanofi.\nResearch and development expenses. Research and development expenses increased in fiscal year 2015 by $18.4 million, or 53.9%, compared to fiscal year 2014 primarily due to increased payroll and related costs of $7.5 million and increased share-based compensation expense of $0.7 million related to increased headcount to support ongoing and future customer programs, as well as increased material and tooling costs of $8.5 million, and increased other costs of $1.7 million related to customer programs. The increased investment in research and development during fiscal year 2015 related to the supply of products and components to existing customers including for customization, industrialization and development programs and prospective customers to support evaluation processes and user studies that are typically undertaken prior to the anticipated signing of contracts.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased in fiscal year 2015 by $8.3 million, or 29.7%, compared to fiscal year 2014, primarily due to increased share-based compensation expense of $2.8 million, increased legal and professional fees of $2.3 million, increased payroll and related costs of $2.2 million and increased other administrative costs of $1.0 million.\nDepreciation and amortization expense. Depreciation and amortization expense increased in fiscal year 2015 by $0.8 million, or 20.7%, compared to fiscal year 2014, primarily as a result of machinery and equipment placed in service during the fiscal year 2015.\nInterest expense. Interest expense decreased in fiscal year 2015 by $1.0 million, or 13.1%, compared to fiscal year 2014, as a result of lower interest expense of $4.7 million due to debt that was refinanced with a term loan with the Lender in the prior year and interest of $2.2 million that was capitalized as part of construction in progress during the year partially offset by higher interest during the year of $5.9 million related to the term loan with the Lender.\nChange in fair value of financial instruments. Change in fair value of financial instruments increased by $4.9 million in fiscal year 2015 compared to fiscal year 2014, primarily due to higher royalty rates as a result of the Amendment to the Royalty Agreement we entered into with the Lender on September 30, 2014.\nNet loss and net loss per share. Net loss during fiscal years 2015 and 2014 was $90.8 million and $57.9 million, respectively. Basic and diluted net loss per share was $8.10 and $5.90 during fiscal years 2015 and 2014, respectively, on weighted average shares outstanding of 11,219,490 and 9,806,266 during fiscal years 2015 and 2014, respectively. The increase in the weighted average shares outstanding was primarily due to the issuance of common stock in connection with our February 2015 equity financing as well as shares issued under the Sales Agreement during fiscal year 2015.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAs of September 30, 2016, the Company's unaudited cash balance was approximately $8.1 million, including $2.1 million of restricted cash. Under the Company's debt facilities, the Company was required to have a cash and restricted cash balance of $5.1 million at September 30, 2016 and $5.0 million at October 31, 2016. As of June 30, 2016, cash and cash equivalents were $18.7 million, restricted cash was $2.4 million and the book value of our long-term debt was $105.1 million.\nThe Company incurred recurring losses from operations as well as negative cash flows from operating activities during fiscal years 2016, 2015, and 2014, and anticipates incurring additional losses and negative cash flows until such time that it can generate sufficient revenue from the sale, customization, or exclusive use and licensing of its wearable injectors to pharmaceutical and biotechnology customers. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. The Company has taken or intends to take the steps delineated below to address its cash requirements, the success of which is largely beyond the Company's control.\nAmgen Inc.\nOn December 31, 2015, the Company entered into an exclusivity agreement (the Exclusivity Agreement\u201d) with Amgen Inc. (the Counterparty\u201d). The Exclusivity Agreement was entered into in connection with the previously announced review of strategic alternatives to maximize shareholder value (the Strategic Process\u201d). Pursuant to the Exclusivity Agreement, the Company agreed to negotiate a potential transaction exclusively with the Counterparty and the Counterparty paid to the Company a non-refundable $15.0 million deposit as consideration for non-exclusive and exclusive rights and licenses provided for in the Exclusivity Agreement.\nOn February 22, 2016 (the Counterparty Closing Date\u201d), the Company and the Counterparty announced the formation of a strategic collaboration for the Counterparty's use of the Company's injectable drug delivery systems with the Counterparty's product portfolio. In connection with the strategic collaboration, the Company entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement (the Counterparty SPA\u201d) with the Counterparty, pursuant to which the Counterparty agreed to purchase from the Company a new series of 6% Senior Secured Convertible Notes Due 2023 in the aggregate original principal amount of up to $55.0 million (each, a Note\u201d and, collectively, the Notes\u201d). The Notes are convertible into Common Stock, and mature on February 22, 2023 (the Counterparty Maturity Date\u201d) in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Notes, as more fully described in note 10 - Long-term Debt\u201d to the consolidated financial statements.\nPursuant to the Counterparty SPA, the Notes may be issued in up to three separate closings. The Company issued to the Counterparty the first Note in the aggregate original principal amount of $30.0 million on the Counterparty Closing Date (the 2016 Convertible Note\u201d) and the Counterparty paid to the Company $30.0 million in exchange therefor. The 2016 Convertible Note is secured by certain inventory and intellectual property assets related to a specific device licensed to the Counterparty (the Collateral\u201d).\nIn connection with the transactions contemplated by the Counterparty SPA, the Company granted the Counterparty exclusive rights to the Company's wearable injectors within select drug classes for use with certain Counterparty assets, while preserving rights the Company previously granted to other customers. The Company has also granted the Counterparty non-exclusive rights to all of the Company's proprietary delivery systems within the therapeutic areas of oncology, inflammation, bone health, nephrology, cardiovascular and neuroscience. On the Counterparty Closing Date, the Counterparty paid to the Company a non-refundable $20.0 million fee (the License Fee\u201d) in consideration for such licenses.\nOrbiMed\nOn February 22, 2016, in connection with the formation of the strategic collaboration with the Counterparty, Unilife Medical Solutions, Inc., a subsidiary of the Company (the Borrower\u201d), entered into an Eighth Amendment (the Eighth Amendment to the Credit Agreement\u201d) to the Credit Agreement, dated March 12, 2014, by and between ROS Acquisition Offshore LP (the Lender\u201d), an affiliate of OrbiMed Advisors ( OrbiMed\u201d), and the Borrower (the Credit Agreement,\u201d and, as amended the Amended Credit Agreement\u201d or the OrbiMed Financing\u201d). Pursuant to and subject to the terms of the Eighth Amendment to the Credit Agreement, the Lender agreed to: (i) defer all obligations of the Borrower to pay interest to the Lender for the period from January 1, 2016 through February 22, 2018 at the rate specified in the Amended Credit Agreement, which interest will be added to the outstanding principal amount of the loan on the last day of each interest period; (ii) enable the Counterparty to take a security interest in certain inventory and intellectual property assets related to a specific device licensed to the Counterparty; and (iii) remove the minimum cash receipts\ncovenant for all future periods. In addition, on February 22, 2016, the Borrower entered into the Sixth Amendment to the Royalty Agreement (the Royalty Agreement,\u201d) with Royalty Opportunities S.A.R.L. ( ROS\u201d). Pursuant to and subject to the terms of the Sixth Amendment to the Royalty Agreement, ROS agreed to waive any rights to royalty payments otherwise payable as a result of the License Fee and the proceeds of the Notes with the Counterparty, and to defer royalty payments payable on revenues received by the Company from the Counterparty until after the end of the first fiscal quarter in which the Company sells a commercial quantity of devices developed for the Counterparty. In connection with entering into the Eighth Amendment to the Credit Agreement and the Sixth Amendment to the Royalty Agreement, the Company issued to ROS a warrant to purchase, at any time until February 22, 2026, 1,673,981 shares of Common Stock, at an exercise price of $12.50 per share, subject to adjustment for certain events. See note 10 Long Term Debt\u201d for accounting considerations relating to such warrant.\nCost Reduction Initiatives\nAs previously disclosed, during fiscal 2016 we implemented several cost reduction and business realignment initiatives pursuant to which we reduced our headcount by approximately 90 employees which initiatives are expected to reduce annual operating costs by approximately $7.9 million. Subsequent to that, the Company eliminated 10 additional positions in July 2016. In part, as a result of these headcount reductions, the Company's workforce was reduced to approximately 140 employees as of July 28, 2016, a reduction of more than 40% since January 2016 and a reduction of approximately 50% since July 1, 2015. A portion of this reduction is due to the Company's determination not to backfill certain open positions. The Company has recorded a charge from severance and related costs from these cost reduction initiatives of approximately $0.7 million in the aggregate. The Company does not believe that these cost reduction initiatives will negatively impact its ability to serve its customers.\nIn addition, the Company, on June 20, 2016, subleased a portion (the Subleased Portion\u201d) of its King of Prussia, Pennsylvania facility (the Facility\u201d). During the term of the sublease, which commenced on October 1, 2016 and will end on March 31, 2019, the Company will be entitled to receive an aggregate of approximately $1.3 million in rent with respect to the Subleased Portion. During the same time period, the Company will be obligated under the Company's lease agreement relating to the Facility to pay an aggregate of approximately $1.9 million in rent with respect to the Subleased Portion. Assuming the sublessor exercises its renewal option, the Company will be entitled to receive approximately an additional $1.9 million over the renewal term of April 1, 2019 through June 30, 2022 and the Company will be obligated under the Company's lease agreement relating to the Facility to pay an aggregate of approximately $2.5 million over the same time period. The Company ceased using the Subleased Portion as of July 20, 2016. The Company will record a non-cash charge, the amount of which the Company has not yet determined as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, which amount will be based on the discounted fair value of the difference between the amounts received from the sublessor and the amounts paid to the landlord.\nCash Receipts\nThe Company expects to generate cash receipts from wearable injector customers during fiscal 2017 and the Company continues to have business development discussions with current and prospective wearable injector customers. The Company is, however, unable to predict the amount, if any, or the timing of such receipts or any proceeds from these business development discussions.\nFundraising Efforts\nThe Company's ability to raise capital will be limited and there can be no assurance that financing will be available when needed. The Company will not be able to obtain financing through offerings of its securities registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, for the near future and until the Company can prepare, file with the SEC, and cause to become effective a registration statement on Form S-1. We are not currently eligible to register the offer and sale of our securities using a registration statement on Form S-3, cannot use our existing Form S-3 and will not become eligible to use Form S-3 until we have timely filed certain periodic reports required under the Exchange Act for 12 consecutive calendar months. As a result, the Company will not be able to obtain financing under the Controlled Equity Offering Sales Agreement that the Company entered into with Cantor Fitzgerald & Co.on July 29, 2015 (the New Sales Agreement\u201d) or the equity purchase agreement that the Company entered into with Lincoln Park Capital Fund, LLC ( LPC\u201d) on July 29, 2015 (the LPC Purchase Agreement\u201d) at least until the Company is eligible to register the offer and sale of our securities using a registration statement on Form S-3.\nPursuant to the Counterparty SPA, the Counterparty may purchase up to an additional $15.0 million in Notes in January 2017 (the 2017 Convertible Note\u201d), and up to an additional $10.0 million in Notes in January 2018 (the 2018 Convertible Note\u201d). See note 10 Long-Term Debt - Senior Secured Convertible Note\u201d for more information regarding the Notes. There can be no assurance as to when or if the Counterparty will purchase all or any part of the 2017 Convertible Note or the 2018 Convertible Note. The Counterparty's willingness to purchase the 2017 Convertible Note or the 2018 Convertible Note may be impacted by any financing the Company receives prior to January 2017 or January 2018, respectively.\nThe Company is engaged in advanced discussions to secure up to $10 million of funding (the Potential Transaction\u201d) contingent upon the completion of due diligence, the execution of a definitive agreement with respect to the Potential Transaction and the filing of (i) this 2016 10-K; (ii) the March 2016 10-Q; (iii) the December 2015 10-Q Amendment; (iv) the September 2015 10-Q Amendment; and (v) the 2015 10-K Amendment. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to enter into a definitive agreement with respect to the Potential Transaction and complete the closing of the Potential Transaction. Consummation of the Potential Transaction would require the consent of the Lender, which cannot be assured.\nThe Company has also engaged a financial advisory firm to further assist with fundraising efforts. There is no assurance that the financial advisory firm will be successful in these efforts.\nThe Company believes that potential proceeds from business development discussions, the 2017 Convertible Note, the Potential Transaction and fundraising efforts along with potential customer cash receipts, will provide the Company with enough liquidity to fund its operations for the next twelve months. However, there can be no assurance that any cash from such business development discussions, issuance of the 2017 Convertible Note, the Potential Transaction, fundraising efforts, or customer receipts will be available when needed, as such sources of liquidity largely are beyond the Company's control.

This discussion and analysis includes certain forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. You should review the Risk Factors\u201d section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by such forward-looking statements. See Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Information\u201d at the beginning of this report. References to our fiscal year refer to the fiscal year ending June 30.\nOverview\nWe are a designer, manufacturer, and supplier of innovative injectable drug delivery systems that can enhance and differentiate the injectable products of our pharmaceutical and biotechnology customers. We believe our products are differentiated from conventional products, with innovative features and functionality designed to optimize the safe, simple, and convenient administration of injectable therapies. The majority of our products are designed for sale directly to pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies who are expected to supply them as drug-device combination products, pre-filled and ready for administration by end-users, such as patients or health-care providers. We customize products within each of our platforms to address specific customer, therapy, patient and/or commercial requirements.\nAlthough we have a broad portfolio of proprietary product platforms, we have focused our business on our wearable injector products. We expect that by focusing primarily on active and new customer programs in our portfolio of wearable injector systems, we will improve our operating efficiencies and better position the Company to take advantage of commercial opportunities within the fast-growing market for wearable injectors. Our wearable injector customers include Amgen Inc., MedImmune LLC ( MedImmune\u201d), and Sanofi S.A. ( Sanofi\u201d).\nCommon Stock Reverse Stock Split\nOn May 13, 2016, pursuant to prior stockholder authorization, the Company effected a reverse split of the Company's common stock, pursuant to which every ten (10) shares of common stock outstanding before the reverse split were converted into one (1) share of common stock after the reverse split. All share and per share amounts, and exercise and conversion prices for all periods presented herein have been adjusted to reflect the reverse split as if it had occurred at the beginning of the first period presented.\nInvestigation and Amendments to Financial Statements\nOn May 8, 2016, the Company announced an investigation into violations of the Company's policies and procedures and possible violations of law and regulation by the Company's former Chief Executive Officer, Alan Shortall, whose employment with the Company ceased on March 11, 2016, and its former Chairman, Jim Bosnjak, who resigned from the Company's Board of Directors (the Board\u201d) on August 24, 2015 (the Investigation\u201d).\nThe Investigation identified certain related party and other transactions which the Company had not previously publicly disclosed or recorded in its financial statements. Also, as the result of Investigation, the Company was not able to timely file its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2016 (the March 2016 10-Q\u201d) or this Annual Report on Form 10-K (the 2016 10-K\u201d). As a result, the Company is filing this 2016 10-K and is concurrently filing the March 2016 10-Q along with (i) an amendment to the Company's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2015 (the September 2015 10-Q Amendment\u201d); (ii) an amendment to the Company's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2015 (the December 2015 10-Q Amendment\u201d); and (iii) an amendment to the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015 (the 2015 10-K Amendment\u201d). These amendments are being made to correct immaterial errors in the previously reported financial statements and to disclose certain material weaknesses in the Company's internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures. See Explanatory Note\u201d above for a summary of the results of the Investigation and of the specific amendments reflected in the September 2015 10-Q Amendment, the December 2015 10-Q Amendment and the 2015 10-K Amendment.\nManagement and Board Changes\nThe Company no longer has any business relationship with Mr. Shortall or Mr. Bosnjak. As of March 11, 2016, (i) Mr. Shortall's employment as Chief Executive Officer of the Company ceased and Mr. Shortall resigned from his position as Chairman of the Board, (ii) the Board appointed Mary Kate Wold to serve as its new Chair, and (iii) the employment of Ramin Mojdeh, Ph.D. as the Company's President and Chief Operating Officer ceased.\nEffective March 14, 2016, the Board appointed John Ryan as the Company's Interim President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company. The Board subsequently appointed Mr. Ryan as the Company's President and Chief Executive Officer and also appointed Mr. Ryan to serve as a member of the Board, in each case, effective July 28, 2016.\nOn July 25, 2016, the Company's employment of Mark Iampietro as the Company's Vice President of Quality and Regulatory Affairs and Chief Compliance Officer was ended by the Company without cause.\nOn July 28, 2016:\n \u2022 the Board appointed Michael E. Kamarck to serve as a member of the Board; \n \u2022 the Board appointed Ian Hanson as the Company's Chief Operating Officer in addition to his roles as the Company's Senior Vice President; \n \u2022 due to results of the Investigation, Dennis P. Pyers was removed from his position as the Company's Senior Vice President, Controller, Treasurer and Chief Accounting Officer and was appointed as the Company's Senior Advisor, Special Projects; \n \u2022 the Board appointed David Hastings as the Company's Chief Accounting Officer and Treasurer in addition to his roles as the Company's Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; \n \u2022 the Board appointed Stephanie Walters as Senior Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary; and \n \u2022 the Board appointed Molly Weaver, Ph.D., as Vice President of Quality and Regulatory Affairs and Chief Compliance Officer. \nInvestigation and Litigation Related to this Matter\nThe Company has reported the final results of the Investigation to the SEC and to The NASDAQ Stock Market LLC ( NASDAQ\u201d), and the Company continues to cooperate fully with the SEC with respect to the SEC's ongoing investigation. The SEC or other external parties could request further documents and information from the Company. The Company and certain of its current and former directors and officers have also been named as defendants in a number of lawsuits filed in connection with the matters set forth in this Explanatory Note. For information concerning the SEC's ongoing investigation and such lawsuits, see Part I, Item 3. Legal Proceedings\u201d of this 2016 10-K.\nMatters Relating to NASDAQ and Our Common Stock and ASX and our CDIs\nThe filing of this 2016 10-K and the March 2016 10-Q were delayed as a result of the Investigation. As a result of such delay, on May 17, 2016, the Company received a notice from the Listing Qualifications department of NASDAQ stating that, because the Company had not yet filed the March 2016 10-Q, the Company was no longer in compliance with NASDAQ Listing Rule 5250(c)(1), which requires listed companies to timely file all required periodic financial reports with the SEC. The notice received from NASDAQ stated that the Company had 60 calendar days from the date of the notice to submit a plan to regain compliance with NASDAQ's continued listing requirements.\nOn July 18, 2016, the Company timely submitted a plan to NASDAQ as to how it planned to regain compliance with NASDAQ's continued listing requirements. The staff at NASDAQ subsequently granted the Company an exception to file the March 2016 10-Q and any other delinquent SEC filings on or before November 7, 2016 in order to enable the Company to regain compliance with the listing rules.\nOn September 19, 2016, the Company received a notice from the Listing Qualifications department of NASDAQ stating that, because the Company had not yet filed this 2016 10-K, the Company is not in compliance with NASDAQ Listing Rule 5250(c)(1). The Company timely submitted to NASDAQ an updated compliance plan on October 4, 2016.\nAs noted above, the Company is concurrently filing with the SEC the March 2016 10-Q and the 2016 10-K with the 2015 10-K Amendment, the September 2015 10-Q Amendment and the December 2015 10-Q Amendment. Consequently, the Company currently believes that it has adequately remedied its non-compliance with NASDAQ Listing Rule 5250(c)(1) within NASDAQ's terms of exception. However, there can be no assurance that NASDAQ will concur that we have remedied such non-compliance.\nOn October 17, 2016, the Company received a notice from the Listing Qualifications department of NASDAQ stating that, because the Company did not maintain a minimum Market Value of Listed Securities ( MVLS\u201d) of $50,000,000 for the last 30 consecutive business days, the Company was no longer in compliance with NASDAQ Listing Rule 5450(b)(2)(A).\nThe Company has been provided a period of 180 calendar days, or until April 17, 2017, to regain compliance with the minimum MVLS listing requirement. If at any time on or before April 17, 2017, the MVLS of the Company's common stock closes at $50,000,000 or more for a minimum of 10 consecutive business days, NASDAQ will provide the Company with written confirmation that the Company has achieved compliance with the minimum MVLS listing requirement and the matter will be closed.\nIn the event that the Company does not regain compliance with the minimum MVLS listing requirement on or before April 17, 2017, NASDAQ will provide the Company with written notification that its securities are subject to delisting. At that time, the Company would be permitted to appeal the delisting determination to a NASDAQ Hearings Panel or apply to transfer its common stock to The NASDAQ Capital Market (provided that it satisfied the requirement for continued listing on that market). (See Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors of this 2016 10-K - We are not in compliance with the requirements of NASDAQ for continued listing, and if NASDAQ does not concur that we have adequately remedied our non-compliance with NASDAQ Listing Rule 5250(c)(1) or we do not adequately remedy our non-compliance with NASDAQ Listing Rule 5450(b)(2)(A), our common stock may be delisted from trading on NASDAQ, which could have a material adverse effect on us and our stockholders\u201d below).\nThe Company was also required to file audited financial statements with the Australian Securities Exchange (the ASX\u201d) no later than September 30, 2016 (the ASX Deadline\u201d). The Company was not able to file such audited financial statements by the ASX Deadline. As a result, pursuant to ASX rules, trading in the Company's CDIs on the ASX was to be suspended prior to the opening of trading on the ASX on October 3, 2016, however, the ASX accepted the Company's request for an immediate voluntary suspension of trading and as such, ASX halted trading of the Company's CDIs on the ASX prior to the opening of trading on September 30, 2016 in Australia. Such trading in Australia will not resume until after the Company files the audited financial statements included in this 2016 10-K with the ASX, which the Company is doing concurrently with filing this 2016 10-K with the SEC.\nKey Factors Affecting Performance and Financial Condition\nWe are party to several agreements with our customers, including customers with whom we have entered into customization, development and/or supply agreements. The customization, industrialization and development fees and other payments received from customers in connection with these agreements and development programs accounted for the majority of our revenue during the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016.\nLonger customer development timelines and increases in capital expenses and headcount have impacted us from a liquidity standpoint. Historically, we have funded our operations primarily from a combination of term loans, equity issuances, borrowings under our bank mortgages, and payments from various customers. See Liquidity and Capital Resources Discussion\u201d below.\nRevenue\nOur revenue is currently generated from customization, industrialization and development fees (many of which are recognized on the milestone basis of accounting). Customization, industrialization and development fees accounted for substantially all of our consolidated revenue for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016. We expect that the Company's revenue will continue to fluctuate on a quarter to quarter basis. A significant portion of our business is generated by a small number of major customers. Our top three customers generated approximately 91% of our total revenue in fiscal 2016. As our industry, market demand and our customer base changes, our major customers may also change. However, we expect that a significant portion of our future annual revenue will be concentrated among a few customers.\nOperating Expenses\nOur operating expenses had been increasing primarily as a result of increased research and development efforts in response to increasing demand from our customers for our products and services and anticipated market demand. The increase in research and development costs also related to the costs of products and components supplied to existing and prospective customers to support evaluation processes and user studies that are typically undertaken prior to the anticipated signing of customer agreements. However, during fiscal year 2016 we implemented several cost reduction and business realignment initiatives that were previously disclosed, pursuant to which we reduced our headcount by approximately 90 employees. Such headcount reductions are expected to reduce annual operating costs by approximately $7.9 million. We expect to further reduce our annual operating costs by not backfilling certain open positions. We do not believe that these cost reduction initiatives will negatively impact our ability to serve our customers.\nAlso as a result of these initiatives, our research and development expense decreased from approximately $17.0 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2015 to approximately $7.4 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016, or approximately 56%. Selling, general and administrative expense decreased from approximately $9.4 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2015, to approximately $7.6 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016, or approximately 20%.\nSignificant Developments in the Industry\nWe believe that our existing wearable injector contracts could provide significant revenue growth in relation to prior periods. Known trends in the industry that we believe will have a material favorable impact on our revenue include a shift in the focus of large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies' product development activities to biologic therapies, an emphasis within health-care providers to patient self-administration and a growing demand for passive safety for injectable drug delivery. There has been a marked shift in the product development activities of large customers toward biologic therapies, and the majority of therapies in the pipeline of large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies are complex biologic therapies. The characteristics of many of these therapies (including, for example, large dose volumes and increased viscosity) necessitates administration by injection using innovative injectable drug delivery systems such as our products. We believe that we are well-positioned to meet what we expect to be a growing demand for innovative injectable drug delivery systems in light of the focus on biologic therapies. Concurrently with the shift toward biologic therapies is an emphasis towards patient self-administration. Patient self-administration is viewed as a growing trend in order to reduce demand pressure on the health-care system as well as reducing costs, especially for treatment of chronic illnesses. Devices suitable for self-administration of injectable therapies need to be safe and intuitive to use. We believe that our products are well suited for safe and intuitive patient self-administration of injectable therapies.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nWe prepare our audited consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S., or U.S. GAAP. This requires management to make certain estimates, judgments and assumptions that could affect the amounts reported in the audited consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. We believe there are several accounting policies that are critical to understanding our historical and future performance, as these policies affect the reported amounts of revenue and other significant areas that involve management's judgments, estimates and assumptions. These critical accounting policies and estimates have been discussed with our audit committee.\nThe preparation of our audited consolidated financial statements requires us to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate these judgments, estimates and assumptions. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable at such time, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other independent sources. Actual results may ultimately differ from these estimates.\nWhile there are a number of accounting policies, methods and estimates affecting our consolidated financial statements as addressed in Note 4 to our audited consolidated financial statements, areas that are particularly significant and critical include:\nRevenue Recognition\nWe recognize revenue from industrialization and development fees, licensing fees and product sales. We recognize revenue from sales of products at the time of shipment when title passes to the customer. We recognize up front, non-refundable fees ratably over the expected life of the related agreement. Revenue from industrialization and development fees is recognized as services are rendered, under the completed contract method, under the proportional performance method or upon achievement of the at risk\u201d substantive milestone events, which represent the culmination of the earnings process related to such events. Substantive milestones can include specific deliverables such as product design, prototype availability, user tests, manufacturing proof of principle and the various steps to complete the industrialization of the product. The terms of these contracts provide for customer payments to be made as services are rendered or substantive milestones are achieved. We consider whether a milestone is substantive at the inception of the agreement. The consideration earned from the achievement of a milestone must meet all of the following criteria to be considered substantive:\n \u2022 It is commensurate with either our performance to achieve the milestone, or the enhancement of the value of the delivered item(s) as a result of a specific outcome resulting from our performance to achieve the milestone; \n \u2022 It relates solely to past performance; and \n \u2022 It is reasonable relative to all of the deliverables and payment terms (including other potential milestone consideration) within the arrangement. \nPayment terms are considered to be standard commercial terms. Revenue is recognized when each substantive milestone has been achieved and we have no future performance obligations related to the substantive milestone. Fees for completed substantive milestones which are dependent upon customer acceptance for non-refundable payment or, if paid, are refundable pending customer acceptance are recognized upon customer acceptance and the termination of refund rights.\nWe recognized $14.8 million, $13.2 million and $14.7 million of revenue during fiscal years 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, as follows:\nDuring the fiscal year 2016, we recognized $4.5 million in revenue related to substantive milestones that were completed during the year pursuant to customer agreements to provide customization and development services, clinical support services, collaborative research activities and testing support services. Milestones completed during the year included various customization activities, device design, devices developed for use in customer evaluation testing, compatibility testing, user studies, and verification activities.\nDuring fiscal year 2016, we recognized $5.3 million in revenue related to services rendered on a time and materials basis, proportional performance method and/or straight-line basis over the requisite service period pursuant to customer agreements to provide various customization and development services. During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016, we recognized $5.0 million in revenue related to an agreement with a customer to provide exclusivity for a defined period of time to evaluate certain drug delivery alternatives as the requisite exclusivity period expired during the fiscal year.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill is the excess of purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired in business acquisitions. Goodwill is subject to, at a minimum, an annual impairment assessment of its carrying value at the reporting unit level. Additional impairment assessments would be performed if events and circumstances warranted such additional assessments during the year. The Company has one reporting unit which includes its product lines, the base technology which it obtained as part of its November 2002 acquisition of Unitract Syringe Pty Limited, and the manufacturing capability which it obtained in its January 2007 acquisition of Integrated BioSciences, Inc.\nAs required under generally accepted accounting principles, the Company is required to evaluate goodwill for impairment at least annually and more frequently if certain trigger events occur. The Company determined that the culmination of the Strategic Process and the decision to focus primarily on the wearable injector business constituted trigger events that occurred in the quarter ended March 31, 2016 requiring an evaluation of the carrying value of the Company's goodwill. Potential impairment of goodwill is identified by comparing the fair value with its carrying value.\nThe Company performed a goodwill valuation as of March 31, 2016 using a combination of the market approach and a discounted cash flow method under the income approach. The Company determined an overall business enterprise value (determined by the fair of equity plus the fair value of debt) by taking a weighted average form the results of the discounted cash flow under the income approach (40%) and the market approach based on the Company's market capitalization (60%). Under the income approach, the Company calculates the fair value of its reporting unit based on the present value of estimated future cash flows. Considerable management judgment is necessary to evaluate the impact of operating and external market changes and to estimate the future cash flows used to measure fair value. The Company's estimate of cash flows consider past performance, current and anticipated market conditions, and internal projections and operating plans which incorporate estimates for sales growth, profitability and capital spending. Additional assumptions include forecasted growth rates and estimated discount rates which are risk adjusted for current market conditions. The Company believes such assumptions reflect current and anticipated market conditions and are consistent with those that would be used by other marketplace participants for similar purposes but are subject to change due to changing conditions. The weighting of the results of each method to assess the overall business enterprise value was considered reasonable as greater weight was given to the market capitalization based on the quoted stock price as this is considered more reliable information as it is publicly available and not subject to management judgment or estimate, whereas, discounted cash flow under the income approach is subject to management estimates and judgments.\nAlthough based on the results of the business enterprise value calculation there was no indication of impairment of goodwill, the Company determined as a result of the continuing losses incurred by the Company and its negative equity, and other indicators of impairment including, the significant long-lived asset impairment recorded as of March 31, 2016 and the drop in the Company's stock price, that an additional step 2 analysis was warranted under generally accepted accounting principles.\nThe Company performed a Step 2 valuation of goodwill by valuing certain intangible assets (primarily patents, trademarks and tradenames). The Company considered the impact of all assets and liabilities in allocating the fair value of the Company to determine the implied fair value of goodwill and whether any impairment is indicated. The Company believes these intangible assets would generate the most significant difference between fair value and book value as part of completing a Step 2 purchase price allocation for the purpose of determining the value of goodwill for impairment. The valuation of intangible assets was performed using the relief from royalty method under the income approach. This method utilizes the Company's revenue projections and assigns values based on determination of appropriate royalty rates considering relevant industry information. The Company then utilized the fair value of its intangible assets along with the implied fair value of its other assets and liabilities to determine the residual fair value compared to the\ncarrying value of goodwill. The residual fair value based on the results of the Step 2 valuation indicated there was no impairment of goodwill.\nThe Company considered that the results of the valuation of goodwill indicated there was no impairment of goodwill and also indicated significant cushion between the implied fair value of goodwill and its carrying value and, therefore, the Company has concluded that no goodwill impairment existed as of March 31, 2016.\nThe Company completed its annual goodwill valuation as of June 30, 2016. The Company performed a goodwill valuation as of June 30, 2016 using a combination of the market approach and a discounted cash flow method under the income approach to determine the overall business enterprise value and then performed a Step 2 valuation of the fair value of its assets and liabilities to determine the residual fair value of goodwill. The Step 2 valuation also valued the Company's intangible assets using the relief from royalty method under the income approach. Based on the results of the goodwill valuation as of June 30, 2016, there was no impairment of goodwill. The Company considered that the results of the valuation of goodwill also indicated significant cushion between the implied fair value of goodwill and its carrying value and, therefore, the Company has concluded that no goodwill impairment existed as of June 30, 2016.\nThe Company did not record any goodwill impairments during fiscal years 2016, 2015 or 2014.\nDefinite-lived intangible assets include patents which are amortized on a straight-line method over their estimated useful lives of 15 years and are included in other assets. The Company reviews intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. When factors indicate a possible impairment, if the sum of the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of an asset is less than the carrying amount of the asset, an impairment may be recognized. Measurement of an impairment loss is based on the excess of the carrying value of the asset over its fair value. Definite-lived intangible assets were less than $0.1 million as of June 30, 2016 and 2015 and are recorded in other assets on the consolidated balance sheet. There were no impairments recorded on intangible assets during the years ended June 30, 2016, 2015 or 2014.\nResearch and Development Expense\nResearch and development expense consist primarily of payroll and related personnel expenses (including share-based compensation expense), fees paid to external service providers, costs of materials, components and supplies, costs for facilities, tooling and equipment and costs related to customization and development service arrangements and developing prototype products and samples used for various evaluation, testing and related activities for existing and potential customers.\nShare-Based Compensation\nWe grant equity awards to our employees, directors, consultants and service providers. Certain employee and director awards vest over stated vesting periods and others also require achievement of specific performance or market conditions. We expense the grant-date fair value of awards to employees and directors over their respective vesting periods. To the extent that employee and director awards vest only upon the achievement of a specific performance condition, expense is recognized over the period from the date management determines that the performance condition is probable of achievement through the date they are expected to be met. Awards granted to consultants and service providers are sometimes granted for past services, in which case their fair value is expensed on their grant date, while other awards require future service, or the achievement of performance or market conditions. Timing of expense recognition for consultant awards is similar to that of employee and director awards; however, aggregate expense is re-measured each quarter-end based on the then fair value of the award through the vesting date of the award. We estimate the fair value of stock options using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, with the exception of market-based grants, which are valued based on the Monte Carlo option pricing model. Option pricing methods require the input of highly subjective assumptions, including the expected stock price volatility.\nProperty, plant and equipment\nWe evaluate the recoverability of the recorded value of long-lived assets periodically to determine if facts and circumstances exist that would indicate that the assets might be impaired or that the useful lives should be modified. As part of this valuation, we develop projections of undiscounted future cash flows of the asset or the asset group. Our projections of undiscounted cash flows include a combination of revenue from customization and development activities, capital expenses that may be necessary to support projected product sales and commercial product sales. As customization and development activities are completed, commercial product sales are expected to scale-up. Expectations of future commercial product sales included in the projections used for our impairment analysis are based on customer-specific information as well as market estimates relating to the anticipated therapies being targeted for use with our products. These projections also include assumptions of future sales growth and profitability based on\ncontracts entered into with customers as well as future contracts to be entered into based on the current discussions and negotiations with existing and prospective customers.\nSales projections are based on assumptions including a transition in the market toward patient self-administration of injectable therapies as well as transitions in the market toward biologic therapies in the pharmaceutical industry development pipeline. Our future sales could also be impacted by factors such as our ability to obtain new and retain existing customers, the timing and extent of the customers' product development activities as well as the regulatory approval process, drug efficacy and industry acceptance of injectable therapies. If our future sales or projections of future sales are impacted by any one or more of the preceding factors, we will reassess the recorded value of the long-lived assets. If impairment is indicated, an adjustment will be made to reduce the carrying amount of these assets to their fair value.\nUnder ASC 360 Property, Plant, and Equipment, the Company is required to evaluate the recoverability of the carrying amount of its long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. In February 2016, the Company completed its review of strategic alternatives and announced the formation of a strategic collaboration centered upon the use of the Company's portfolio of prefilled, customizable wearable injectors. In connection with this focus, the Company has been evaluating the prospects of its non-wearable injector customer and supplier programs. The Company's evaluation of those programs and potential disposition of certain assets, the Company determined that certain of its long lived-assets are impaired. The Company recorded a $26.6 million non-cash asset impairment charge in the third quarter of fiscal 2016 to machinery and equipment and construction in progress. The impairment was based on the future expected use of certain equipment in the production of its product. The equipment is customized for the production of medical devices and as a result of the decision not to continue to produce certain products the related equipment was written-off as any value was determined to be nominal, if any.\nFair value measurements\nIn accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC\u201d) 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures, we measure fair value based on a hierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that observable inputs be used when available. The fair value hierarchy is broken down into three levels based on the source of inputs.\nThe carrying value of financial instruments such as accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses are reasonable estimates of their fair value because of the short maturity of these items. We believe that the current carrying amount of our long-term debt approximates fair value based on the adjustment of carrying value of our term loan to its fair value as of June 30, 2016. With respect to the consideration provided to ROS (as defined below) in the form of warrants and the terms of the Eighth Amendment to the Credit Agreement and the Sixth Amendment to the Royalty Agreement, the Company evaluated whether the debt was modified or extinguished pursuant to ASC 470-50, Debt - Modifications and Extinguishments. The Company determined that the previous debt was extinguished and recorded the modified debt at fair value ($51.3 million). The Company recorded a gain on debt extinguishment during fiscal 2016 of $2.9 million which consisted of the remeasurement of the debt at fair value offset by the value of the warrants as of the Counterparty Effective Date and the deferred financing costs previously associated with the term loan\nWe have elected to measure our royalty liability at fair value in accordance with ASC 825, Financial Instruments. The fair value of the royalty liability is based on significant inputs not observable in the market, which require it to be reported as a Level 3 liability within the fair value hierarchy. The valuation uses a methodology and assumptions that we believe would be made by a market participant. In particular, the valuation analysis uses a discounted cash flow methodology under the income approach based on the present value sum of payments to be made in the future. The fair value of the royalty liability is estimated by applying a risk adjusted discount rate to the adjusted royalty revenue stream. These fair value estimates are most sensitive to changes in the payment stream.\nWe have elected to measure our derivative financial instruments in accordance with ASC 815-40, Derivative and Hedging - Contracts in Entity's Own Equity. Instruments which do not have fixed settlement provisions are deemed to be derivative instruments.\nThe fair value of the warrant liability is based on a Black-Scholes valuation. The fair value estimates are most sensitive to changes in our share price.\nThe fair value of the derivative liability is based on the average of a Monte Carlo model and a lattice model. The fair value estimates are most sensitive to changes in our share price.\nInterest expense\nWe recognize interest expense in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive loss for all debt instruments using the effective interest method. The effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortized cost of a financial liability and of allocating the interest expense over the relevant period. The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts the estimated\nfuture cash payments through the expected life of the financial instrument to the net carrying amount of the financial liability. The application of the method has the effect of recognizing expense payable on the instrument evenly in proportion to the amount outstanding over the period to maturity or repayment. In calculating the effective interest rate, we estimate cash flows considering all contractual terms of the financial instrument, including fees for early redemption and all other premiums and discounts.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nSee note 4 Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\u201d to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nBasis of Presentation\nRevenue\nWe derive revenue primarily from industrialization and development programs with our customers and licensing agreements. The agreements with our customers generally provide for fees to be paid to us for providing specific products or services. Certain of these agreements provide for fees to be paid upon completion of certain agreed-upon milestones. In instances where these milestones are substantive, we recognize revenue when these agreed-upon substantive milestones have been completed and there is no further performance obligation related to the substantive milestone. Certain of our agreements provide for fees to be paid for specific services to be rendered or the provision of certain deliverables, and we recognize revenue upon completion of the related service or deliverable. Certain of our agreements provide for fees to be paid on an ongoing basis over the life of the agreement for agreed-upon services, and we recognize revenue ratably over the requisite service period. We also recognize revenue on certain agreements under the proportional performance method.\nOperating expenses\nOperating expenses primarily include costs related to research and development, selling, general and administrative expenses, as well as depreciation and amortization expense.\nResearch and development costs\nResearch and development costs consist primarily of payroll and related personnel expenses (including share-based compensation expense), fees paid to external service providers, costs of materials, components and supplies, costs for facilities, tooling and equipment and costs related to customization and development service arrangements and developing prototype products and samples used for various evaluation, testing and related activities for existing and potential customers.\nSelling, general and administrative costs\nSelling, general and administrative costs include corporate payroll and related benefit costs (including share-based compensation expense), marketing and commercial development costs, quality assurance and regulatory costs, accounting and financial related costs, information and technology costs, legal and professional fees, and corporate facility costs.\nDepreciation\nDepreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the related assets, which range from 40 years for our York, Pennsylvania facility to 2 to 15 years for machinery, equipment, furniture and software and the lesser of the lease term or estimated useful life for leasehold improvements. Intangible assets are being amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives of 15 years.\nInterest expense\nInterest expense includes the cash and non-cash interest cost for all debt instruments. Interest expense is recognized under the effective interest method such that non-cash interest includes the additional expense recognized over and above the cash interest paid during a period as a result of the application of the effective interest method.\nChange in fair value of financial instruments\nChange in fair value of financial instruments includes the change in the Amended Royalty Agreement (defined below) liability, the Warrant liability, the Derivative liability, and the Preferred stock conversion liability, which are marked to fair value on a quarterly basis.\nNet loss\nNet loss includes the results from revenue recognized during the period after deducting all operating and non-operating expenses.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table summarizes our results of operations for fiscal years 2016, 2015 and 2014:\nTable 111: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Fiscal Years Ended June 30,\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (in thousands, except per share data)\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Revenue\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 14,841\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 13,158\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 14,689\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Research and development\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 43,191\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 52,487\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 34,111\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Selling, general and administrative\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 43,196\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 36,176\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 27,894\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Asset impairment charge\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 26,580\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Depreciation and amortization\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,491\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,923\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,079\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total operating expenses\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 118,458\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 93,586\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 66,084\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Operating loss\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (103,617\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (80,428\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (51,395\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest expense\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10,187\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 6,368\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 7,332\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Change in fair value of financial instruments\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (9,899\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 4,279\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (600\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Gain on debt extinguishment\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (2,881\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Other (income) expense, net\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (241\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (226\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (228\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net loss\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (100,783\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (90,849\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (57,899\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Net loss per share:\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Basic and diluted net loss per share\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (7.04\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (8.10\n</td> <td> )\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> (5.90\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nFiscal Year 2016 Compared to Fiscal Year 2015\nRevenue. Revenue increased by $1.7 million, or 12.8%, during fiscal year 2016 compared to fiscal year 2015 due to more revenue being recognized related to development activities for various customers. During fiscal year 2016, we recognized $4.5 million in revenue related to substantive milestones that were completed during the year pursuant to customer agreements to provide customization and development services, clinical support services, collaborative research activities and testing support services. During fiscal year 2016, we recognized $5.3 million in revenue related to services rendered on a time and materials basis, proportional performance method, completed contract method, and/or straight-line basis over the requisite service period pursuant to customer agreements to provide various customization and development services. During fiscal 2016, we recognized $5.0 million in revenue related to an agreement with a customer to provide exclusivity for a defined period of time to evaluate certain drug delivery alternatives as the requisite exclusivity period expired during the fiscal year. During fiscal year 2015, we recognized $5.1 million in revenue related to substantive milestones that were completed during the year pursuant to customer agreements to provide customization and development services, clinical support services, collaborative research activities and testing support services. During fiscal year 2015, we recognized $8.1 million in revenue related to services rendered on a time and materials basis pursuant to customer agreements to provide various customization and development services.\nResearch and development expenses. Research and development expenses decreased in fiscal year 2016 by $9.3 million, or 17.7%, compared to fiscal year 2015 primarily due to decreased tooling, prototype, and material costs of $5.8 million, decreased third-party contracting costs of $1.2 million, decreased payroll and related costs of $1.0 million, decreased travel costs of $1.0 million and decrease in other costs of $1.2 million offset by increased share-based compensation expense of $0.9 million.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased in fiscal year 2016 by $7.0 million, or 19.4%, compared to fiscal year 2015, primarily due to increased transaction costs of $5.0 million in connection with the Strategic Process and increased legal fees of $1.2 million offset by decreased travel costs of $0.9 million and decreased other costs of $0.2 million. Share-based compensation increased by $1.2 million and payroll and related costs increased by $0.7 million primarily in connection with the departure of our former CEO and COO in March 2016 which were partially offset by cost reductions as a result of business realignment initiatives.\nAsset impairment charge. The Company incurred $26.6 million of non-cash asset impairments during the year ended June 30, 2016 related to non-wearable injector machinery and equipment.\nDepreciation and amortization expense. Depreciation and amortization expense increased in fiscal year 2016 by $0.6 million, or 11.5%, compared to fiscal year 2015, primarily as a result of additional equipment previously placed in service.\nInterest expense. Interest expense increased in fiscal year 2016 by $3.8 million, or 60.0%, compared to fiscal year 2015, primarily attributable to interest on the OrbiMed Financing ($3.2 million) and the 2016 Convertible Note ($0.7 million) offset by a decrease in capitalized interest ($0.1 million).\nChange in fair value of financial instruments. Change in fair value of financial instruments decreased by $14.2 million in fiscal year 2016 compared to fiscal year 2015. A decrease of $7.9 million is related to the change in the fair value of the Royalty liability in connection with the OrbiMed Financing which is revalued each quarter. A decrease of $9.2 million is due to revaluation of the warrant liability due to a decrease in the Company's share price. A decrease of $1.3 million is due to revaluation of the derivative liability due to a decrease in the Company's share price. An increase of $4.2 million is related to the revaluation of the Preferred Stock Conversion liability.\nNet loss and net loss per share. Net loss during fiscal years 2016 and 2015 was $100.8 million and $90.8 million, respectively. Basic and diluted net loss per share was $7.04 and $8.10 during fiscal years 2016 and 2015, respectively, on weighted average shares outstanding of 14,467,510 and 11,219,490 during fiscal years 2016 and 2015, respectively. The increase in the weighted average shares outstanding was primarily due to the New Sales Agreement and Purchase Agreement (each as defined below) as well as conversions of preferred shares under the Preferred Stock Purchase Agreement.\nFiscal Year 2015 Compared to Fiscal Year 2014\nRevenue. Revenue decreased by $1.5 million, or 10.4%, during fiscal year 2015 compared to fiscal year 2014 due to less revenue being recognized related to development activities for various customers. During fiscal year 2015, we recognized $5.1 million in revenue related to substantive milestones that were completed during the year pursuant to customer agreements to provide customization and development services, clinical support services, collaborative research activities and testing support services. During fiscal year 2015, we recognized $8.1 million in revenue related to services rendered on a time and materials basis, proportional performance method and/or straight-line basis over the requisite service period pursuant to customer agreements to provide various customization and development services. During fiscal year 2014, we recognized $8.1 million in revenue related to substantive milestones that were completed during the year pursuant to customer agreements to provide customization and development services, clinical support services, collaborative research activities and testing support services. During fiscal year 2014, we recognized $4.3 million in revenue related to services rendered on a time and materials basis pursuant to customer agreements to provide various customization and development services. Also, during fiscal year 2014, we recognized $2.3 million of revenue related to our development agreement with Sanofi which was superseded by a supply agreement with Sanofi.\nResearch and development expenses. Research and development expenses increased in fiscal year 2015 by $18.4 million, or 53.9%, compared to fiscal year 2014 primarily due to increased payroll and related costs of $7.5 million and increased share-based compensation expense of $0.7 million related to increased headcount to support ongoing and future customer programs, as well as increased material and tooling costs of $8.5 million, and increased other costs of $1.7 million related to customer programs. The increased investment in research and development during fiscal year 2015 related to the supply of products and components to existing customers including for customization, industrialization and development programs and prospective customers to support evaluation processes and user studies that are typically undertaken prior to the anticipated signing of contracts.\nSelling, general and administrative expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased in fiscal year 2015 by $8.3 million, or 29.7%, compared to fiscal year 2014, primarily due to increased share-based compensation expense of $2.8 million, increased legal and professional fees of $2.3 million, increased payroll and related costs of $2.2 million and increased other administrative costs of $1.0 million.\nDepreciation and amortization expense. Depreciation and amortization expense increased in fiscal year 2015 by $0.8 million, or 20.7%, compared to fiscal year 2014, primarily as a result of machinery and equipment placed in service during the fiscal year 2015.\nInterest expense. Interest expense decreased in fiscal year 2015 by $1.0 million, or 13.1%, compared to fiscal year 2014, as a result of lower interest expense of $4.7 million due to debt that was refinanced with a term loan with the Lender in the prior year and interest of $2.2 million that was capitalized as part of construction in progress during the year partially offset by higher interest during the year of $5.9 million related to the term loan with the Lender.\nChange in fair value of financial instruments. Change in fair value of financial instruments increased by $4.9 million in fiscal year 2015 compared to fiscal year 2014, primarily due to higher royalty rates as a result of the Amendment to the Royalty Agreement we entered into with the Lender on September 30, 2014.\nNet loss and net loss per share. Net loss during fiscal years 2015 and 2014 was $90.8 million and $57.9 million, respectively. Basic and diluted net loss per share was $8.10 and $5.90 during fiscal years 2015 and 2014, respectively, on weighted average shares outstanding of 11,219,490 and 9,806,266 during fiscal years 2015 and 2014, respectively. The increase in the weighted average shares outstanding was primarily due to the issuance of common stock in connection with our February 2015 equity financing as well as shares issued under the Sales Agreement during fiscal year 2015.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAs of September 30, 2016, the Company's unaudited cash balance was approximately $8.1 million, including $2.1 million of restricted cash. Under the Company's debt facilities, the Company was required to have a cash and restricted cash balance of $5.1 million at September 30, 2016 and $5.0 million at October 31, 2016. As of June 30, 2016, cash and cash equivalents were $18.7 million, restricted cash was $2.4 million and the book value of our long-term debt was $105.1 million.\nThe Company incurred recurring losses from operations as well as negative cash flows from operating activities during fiscal years 2016, 2015, and 2014, and anticipates incurring additional losses and negative cash flows until such time that it can generate sufficient revenue from the sale, customization, or exclusive use and licensing of its wearable injectors to pharmaceutical and biotechnology customers. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. The Company has taken or intends to take the steps delineated below to address its cash requirements, the success of which is largely beyond the Company's control.\nAmgen Inc.\nOn December 31, 2015, the Company entered into an exclusivity agreement (the Exclusivity Agreement\u201d) with Amgen Inc. (the Counterparty\u201d). The Exclusivity Agreement was entered into in connection with the previously announced review of strategic alternatives to maximize shareholder value (the Strategic Process\u201d). Pursuant to the Exclusivity Agreement, the Company agreed to negotiate a potential transaction exclusively with the Counterparty and the Counterparty paid to the Company a non-refundable $15.0 million deposit as consideration for non-exclusive and exclusive rights and licenses provided for in the Exclusivity Agreement.\nOn February 22, 2016 (the Counterparty Closing Date\u201d), the Company and the Counterparty announced the formation of a strategic collaboration for the Counterparty's use of the Company's injectable drug delivery systems with the Counterparty's product portfolio. In connection with the strategic collaboration, the Company entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement (the Counterparty SPA\u201d) with the Counterparty, pursuant to which the Counterparty agreed to purchase from the Company a new series of 6% Senior Secured Convertible Notes Due 2023 in the aggregate original principal amount of up to $55.0 million (each, a Note\u201d and, collectively, the Notes\u201d). The Notes are convertible into Common Stock, and mature on February 22, 2023 (the Counterparty Maturity Date\u201d) in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Notes, as more fully described in note 10 - Long-term Debt\u201d to the consolidated financial statements.\nPursuant to the Counterparty SPA, the Notes may be issued in up to three separate closings. The Company issued to the Counterparty the first Note in the aggregate original principal amount of $30.0 million on the Counterparty Closing Date (the 2016 Convertible Note\u201d) and the Counterparty paid to the Company $30.0 million in exchange therefor. The 2016 Convertible Note is secured by certain inventory and intellectual property assets related to a specific device licensed to the Counterparty (the Collateral\u201d).\nIn connection with the transactions contemplated by the Counterparty SPA, the Company granted the Counterparty exclusive rights to the Company's wearable injectors within select drug classes for use with certain Counterparty assets, while preserving rights the Company previously granted to other customers. The Company has also granted the Counterparty non-exclusive rights to all of the Company's proprietary delivery systems within the therapeutic areas of oncology, inflammation, bone health, nephrology, cardiovascular and neuroscience. On the Counterparty Closing Date, the Counterparty paid to the Company a non-refundable $20.0 million fee (the License Fee\u201d) in consideration for such licenses.\nOrbiMed\nOn February 22, 2016, in connection with the formation of the strategic collaboration with the Counterparty, Unilife Medical Solutions, Inc., a subsidiary of the Company (the Borrower\u201d), entered into an Eighth Amendment (the Eighth Amendment to the Credit Agreement\u201d) to the Credit Agreement, dated March 12, 2014, by and between ROS Acquisition Offshore LP (the Lender\u201d), an affiliate of OrbiMed Advisors ( OrbiMed\u201d), and the Borrower (the Credit Agreement,\u201d and, as amended the Amended Credit Agreement\u201d or the OrbiMed Financing\u201d). Pursuant to and subject to the terms of the Eighth Amendment to the Credit Agreement, the Lender agreed to: (i) defer all obligations of the Borrower to pay interest to the Lender for the period from January 1, 2016 through February 22, 2018 at the rate specified in the Amended Credit Agreement, which interest will be added to the outstanding principal amount of the loan on the last day of each interest period; (ii) enable the Counterparty to take a security interest in certain inventory and intellectual property assets related to a specific device licensed to the Counterparty; and (iii) remove the minimum cash receipts\ncovenant for all future periods. In addition, on February 22, 2016, the Borrower entered into the Sixth Amendment to the Royalty Agreement (the Royalty Agreement,\u201d) with Royalty Opportunities S.A.R.L. ( ROS\u201d). Pursuant to and subject to the terms of the Sixth Amendment to the Royalty Agreement, ROS agreed to waive any rights to royalty payments otherwise payable as a result of the License Fee and the proceeds of the Notes with the Counterparty, and to defer royalty payments payable on revenues received by the Company from the Counterparty until after the end of the first fiscal quarter in which the Company sells a commercial quantity of devices developed for the Counterparty. In connection with entering into the Eighth Amendment to the Credit Agreement and the Sixth Amendment to the Royalty Agreement, the Company issued to ROS a warrant to purchase, at any time until February 22, 2026, 1,673,981 shares of Common Stock, at an exercise price of $12.50 per share, subject to adjustment for certain events. See note 10 Long Term Debt\u201d for accounting considerations relating to such warrant.\nCost Reduction Initiatives\nAs previously disclosed, during fiscal 2016 we implemented several cost reduction and business realignment initiatives pursuant to which we reduced our headcount by approximately 90 employees which initiatives are expected to reduce annual operating costs by approximately $7.9 million. Subsequent to that, the Company eliminated 10 additional positions in July 2016. In part, as a result of these headcount reductions, the Company's workforce was reduced to approximately 140 employees as of July 28, 2016, a reduction of more than 40% since January 2016 and a reduction of approximately 50% since July 1, 2015. A portion of this reduction is due to the Company's determination not to backfill certain open positions. The Company has recorded a charge from severance and related costs from these cost reduction initiatives of approximately $0.7 million in the aggregate. The Company does not believe that these cost reduction initiatives will negatively impact its ability to serve its customers.\nIn addition, the Company, on June 20, 2016, subleased a portion (the Subleased Portion\u201d) of its King of Prussia, Pennsylvania facility (the Facility\u201d). During the term of the sublease, which commenced on October 1, 2016 and will end on March 31, 2019, the Company will be entitled to receive an aggregate of approximately $1.3 million in rent with respect to the Subleased Portion. During the same time period, the Company will be obligated under the Company's lease agreement relating to the Facility to pay an aggregate of approximately $1.9 million in rent with respect to the Subleased Portion. Assuming the sublessor exercises its renewal option, the Company will be entitled to receive approximately an additional $1.9 million over the renewal term of April 1, 2019 through June 30, 2022 and the Company will be obligated under the Company's lease agreement relating to the Facility to pay an aggregate of approximately $2.5 million over the same time period. The Company ceased using the Subleased Portion as of July 20, 2016. The Company will record a non-cash charge, the amount of which the Company has not yet determined as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, which amount will be based on the discounted fair value of the difference between the amounts received from the sublessor and the amounts paid to the landlord.\nCash Receipts\nThe Company expects to generate cash receipts from wearable injector customers during fiscal 2017 and the Company continues to have business development discussions with current and prospective wearable injector customers. The Company is, however, unable to predict the amount, if any, or the timing of such receipts or any proceeds from these business development discussions.\nFundraising Efforts\nThe Company's ability to raise capital will be limited and there can be no assurance that financing will be available when needed. The Company will not be able to obtain financing through offerings of its securities registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, for the near future and until the Company can prepare, file with the SEC, and cause to become effective a registration statement on Form S-1. We are not currently eligible to register the offer and sale of our securities using a registration statement on Form S-3, cannot use our existing Form S-3 and will not become eligible to use Form S-3 until we have timely filed certain periodic reports required under the Exchange Act for 12 consecutive calendar months. As a result, the Company will not be able to obtain financing under the Controlled Equity Offering Sales Agreement that the Company entered into with Cantor Fitzgerald & Co.on July 29, 2015 (the New Sales Agreement\u201d) or the equity purchase agreement that the Company entered into with Lincoln Park Capital Fund, LLC ( LPC\u201d) on July 29, 2015 (the LPC Purchase Agreement\u201d) at least until the Company is eligible to register the offer and sale of our securities using a registration statement on Form S-3.\nPursuant to the Counterparty SPA, the Counterparty may purchase up to an additional $15.0 million in Notes in January 2017 (the 2017 Convertible Note\u201d), and up to an additional $10.0 million in Notes in January 2018 (the 2018 Convertible Note\u201d). See note 10 Long-Term Debt - Senior Secured Convertible Note\u201d for more information regarding the Notes. There can be no assurance as to when or if the Counterparty will purchase all or any part of the 2017 Convertible Note or the 2018 Convertible Note. The Counterparty's willingness to purchase the 2017 Convertible Note or the 2018 Convertible Note may be impacted by any financing the Company receives prior to January 2017 or January 2018, respectively.\nThe Company is engaged in advanced discussions to secure up to $10 million of funding (the Potential Transaction\u201d) contingent upon the completion of due diligence, the execution of a definitive agreement with respect to the Potential Transaction and the filing of (i) this 2016 10-K; (ii) the March 2016 10-Q; (iii) the December 2015 10-Q Amendment; (iv) the September 2015 10-Q Amendment; and (v) the 2015 10-K Amendment. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to enter into a definitive agreement with respect to the Potential Transaction and complete the closing of the Potential Transaction. Consummation of the Potential Transaction would require the consent of the Lender, which cannot be assured.\nThe Company has also engaged a financial advisory firm to further assist with fundraising efforts. There is no assurance that the financial advisory firm will be successful in these efforts.\nThe Company believes that potential proceeds from business development discussions, the 2017 Convertible Note, the Potential Transaction and fundraising efforts along with potential customer cash receipts, will provide the Company with enough liquidity to fund its operations for the next twelve months. However, there can be no assurance that any cash from such business development discussions, issuance of the 2017 Convertible Note, the Potential Transaction, fundraising efforts, or customer receipts will be available when needed, as such sources of liquidity largely are beyond the Company's control.
