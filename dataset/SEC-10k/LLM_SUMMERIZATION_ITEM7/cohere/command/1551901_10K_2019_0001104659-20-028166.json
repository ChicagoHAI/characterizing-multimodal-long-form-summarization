Actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in our forward-looking statements, and future results could differ materially from historical performance.

Our investment activities are managed by our investment adviser, Stellus Capital Management.\nWe were organized as a Maryland corporation on May 18, 2012 and formally commenced operations on November 7, 2012. Our investment objective is to maximize the total return to our stockholders in the form of current income and capital appreciation through debt and related equity investments in middle-market companies.\nAs a BDC, we are required to comply with certain regulatory requirements. For instance, as a BDC, we must not acquire any assets other than qualifying assets\u201d specified in the 1940 Act unless, at the time the acquisition is made, at least 70% of our total assets are qualifying assets. Qualifying assets include investments in eligible portfolio companies.\u201d Under the relevant SEC rules, the term eligible portfolio company\u201d includes all private operating companies, operating companies whose securities are not listed on a national securities exchange, and certain public operating companies that have listed their securities on a national securities exchange and have a market capitalization of less than $250 million, in each case organized and with their principal of business in the United States.\nWe have elected to be treated for tax purposes as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code. To maintain our qualification as a RIC, we must, among other things, meet certain source-of-income and asset diversification requirements. As of December 31, 2019, we were in compliance with the RIC requirements. As a RIC, we generally will not have to pay corporate-level U.S. federal income taxes on any income we distribute to our stockholders.\nPrior to June 28, 2018, we were only allowed to employ leverage to the extent that our asset coverage, as defined in the 1940 Act, was equal to at least 200% after giving effect to such leverage. On March 23, 2018, the Small Business Credit Availability Act (the SBCAA\u201d) was signed into law, which included various changes to regulations under the federal securities laws that impact BDCs. The SBCAA included changes to the 1940 Act to allow BDCs to decrease their asset coverage requirement to 150% from 200% under certain circumstances.\nOn April 4, 2018, the Board, including a required majority\u201d (as such term is defined in Section 57(o) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the 1940 Act\u201d)) of the Board, approved the application of the modified asset coverage requirements set forth in Section 61(a)(2) of the 1940 Act. The Board also approved the submission of a proposal to stockholders to approve the application of the modified asset coverage requirements set forth in Section 61(a)(2) of the 1940 Act, which was approved by stockholders at our 2018 annual meeting of stockholders. As a result, the asset coverage ratio applicable to us was decreased from 200% to 150%, effective June 28, 2018, which effectively increased the amount of leverage we may incur. As of December 31, 2019, our asset coverage ratio was 229%. The amount of leverage that we employ at any time depends on our assessment of the market and other factors at the time of any proposed borrowing.\nPortfolio Composition and Investment Activity\nPortfolio Composition\nWe originate and invest primarily in privately-held middle-market companies (typically those with $5.0 million to $50.0 million of EBITDA) through first lien (including unitranche), second lien, and unsecured debt financing, often times with a corresponding equity investment.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had $ 628.9 million (at fair value) invested in 63 companies. As of December 31, 2019, our portfolio included approximately 72% of first lien debt, 18% of second lien debt, 4% of unsecured debt and 6% of equity investments at fair value. The composition of our investments at cost and fair value as of December 31, 2019 was as follows:\nTable 10: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Cost\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Fair Value\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Senior Secured\u2009-\u2009First Lien(1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>461,107,595 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>455,169,878 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Senior Secured\u2009-\u2009Second Lien\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>130,600,172 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>111,961,013 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Unsecured Debt\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>22,279,519 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>22,137,186 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Equity\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>28,720,538 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>39,680,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total Investments\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>642,707,824 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>628,948,077 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1)\nIncludes unitranche investments, which account for 14.4% of our portfolio at fair value.

As of December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, we had unfunded commitments of\u2009 $37.5 million and $21.2 million, respectively, to provide debt financing for seventeen and eleven portfolio companies, respectively. As of December 31, 2019, the Company had sufficient liquidity to fund such unfunded commitments should the need arise.\nThe following is a summary of geographical concentration of our investment

The following changes and their December 31, 2018 cost and fair value, respectively, were made: 1) Consumer Goods: Durable to Metals & Mining; $17,237,500 for both cost and fair value, 2) Media: Broadcasting & Subscription to Media: Advertising, Printing & Publishing; $7,058,675 and $6,875,625, 3) Services: Business to Aerospace & Defense; $10,777,822 for both cost and value, 4) Services: Business to Environmental Industries; $13,058,543 and $12,505,509, 5) Services: Business to Software; $14,005,369 and $13,432,500.\nAt December 31, 2019, our average portfolio company investment at amortized cost and fair value was approximately $10.2 million and $10.0 million, respectively, and our largest portfolio company investment at amortized cost and fair value was approximately $ 21.6 million and $ 21.3 million, respectively. At December 31, 2018, our average portfolio company investment at both amortized cost and fair value was approximately $8.9 million, and our largest portfolio company investment at amortized cost and fair value was approximately $21.6 million and $22.3 million, respectively.\nAt December 31, 2019, 93% of our debt investments bore interest based on floating rates (subject to interest rate floors), such as LIBOR, and 7% bore interest at fixed rates. At December 31, 2018, 91% of our debt investments bore interest based on floating rates (subject to interest rate floors), such as LIBOR, and 9% bore interest at fixed rates.\nThe weighted average yield on all of our debt investments as of December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 was approximately 9.2% and 10.9%, respectively. The weighted average yield was computed using the effective interest rates for all of our debt investments, including accretion of original issue discount. The weighted average yield of our debt investments is not the same as a return on investment for our stockholders, but, rather relates to a portion of our investment portfolio and is calculated before the payment of all of our subsidiaries' fees and expenses.\nAs of December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, we had cash and cash equivalents of\u2009 $16.1 million and $17.5 million, respectively.\nInvestment Activity\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, we made $246.5 million of investments in seventeen new portfolio companies and twelve existing portfolio companies. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we received $128.2 million in proceeds principally from prepayments of our investments, including $19.2 million from amortization of certain other investments.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, we made $272.9 million of investments in seventeen new portfolio companies and twelve existing portfolio companies. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we received $147.6 million in proceeds principally from prepayments of our investments, including $22.9 million from amortization of certain other investments.\nOur level of investment activity can vary substantially from period to period depending on many factors, including the amount of debt and equity capital to middle market companies, the level of merger and acquisition activity, the general economic environment and the competitive environment for the types of investments we make.\nAsset Quality\nIn addition to various risk management and monitoring tools, Stellus Capital Management uses an investment rating system to characterize and monitor the credit profile and expected level of returns on each investment in our portfolio. This investment rating system uses a five-level numeric scale. The following is a description of the conditions associated with each investment category:\n\u2022\nInvestment Category 1 is used for investments that are performing above expectations, and whose risks remain favorable compared to the expected risk at the time of the original investment.\n\u2022\nInvestment Category 2 is used for investments that are performing within expectations and whose risks remain neutral compared to the expected risk at the time of the original investment. All new loans are initially rated 2.\n\u2022\nInvestment Category 3 is used for investments that are performing below expectations and that require closer monitoring, but where no loss of return or principal is expected. Portfolio companies with a rating of 3 may be out of compliance with financial covenants.\n\u2022\nInvestment Category 4 is used for investments that are performing substantially below expectations and whose risks have increased substantially since the original investment. These investments are often in work out. Investments with a rating of 4 are those for which some loss of return but no loss of principal is expected.\n\u2022\nInvestment Category 5 is used for investments that are performing substantially below expectations and whose risks have increased substantially since the original investment. These investments are almost always in work out. Investments with a rating of 5 are those for which some loss of return and principal is expected.\nTable 16: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> As of December 31, 2019\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> As of December 31, 2018\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Investment Category\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Fair Value\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> % of Total\nPortfolio\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Number of\nPortfolio\nCompanies(1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Fair Value\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> % of Total\nPortfolio\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Number of\nPortfolio\nCompanies\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (dollars in millions)\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>70.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>92.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>492.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>78% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>41 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>372.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>74% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>37 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>49.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>26.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>-% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>628.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>64 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>504.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>58 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1)\nOne portfolio company appears in two categories as of December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018.\nLoans and Debt Securities on Non-Accrual Status\nWe will not accrue interest on loans and debt securities if we have reason to doubt our ability to collect such interest. As of December 31, 2019, we had loans to 2 portfolio companies that were on non-accrual status, which represented approximately 3.6% of our loan portfolio at cost and 0.9% at fair value. As of December 31, 2018, we had loans to four portfolio companies that were on non-accrual status, which represented approximately 3.9% of our loan portfolio at cost and 2.8% at fair value.\nResults of Operations\nAn important measure of our financial performance is net increase (decrease) in net assets resulting from operations, which includes net investment income (loss), net realized gain (loss) and net unrealized appreciation (depreciation). Net investment income (loss) is the difference between our income from interest, dividends, fees and other investment income and our operating expenses including interest on borrowed funds. Net realized gain (loss) on investments is the difference between the proceeds received from dispositions of portfolio investments and their amortized cost. Net unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on investments is the net change in the fair value of our investment portfolio.\nComparison of the Years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017\nRevenues\nWe generate revenue in the form of interest income on debt investments and capital gains and distributions, if any, on investment securities that we may acquire in portfolio companies. Our debt investments typically have a term of five to seven years and bear interest at primarily floating rates. Interest on our debt securities is generally payable quarterly. Payments of principal on our debt investments may be amortized over the stated term of the investment, deferred for several years or due entirely at maturity. In some cases, our debt investments may pay interest in-kind, or PIK interest. Any outstanding principal amount of our debt securities and any accrued but unpaid interest will generally become due at the maturity date. The level of interest income we receive is directly related to the balance of interest-bearing investments multiplied by the weighted average yield of our investments. We expect that the total dollar amount of interest and any dividend income that we earn will increase as the size of our investment portfolio increases. In addition, we may generate revenue in the form of prepayment fees, commitment, loan origination, structuring or due diligence fees, fees for providing significant managerial assistance and consulting fees.\nThe following shows the breakdown of investment income for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017 (in millions).\nTable 17: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest Income(1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>56.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>49.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>37.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> PIK Income\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Miscellaneous fees(1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>58.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>53.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>39.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1)\nFor the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, we recognized $2.8 million, $3.4 million and $2.5 million of non-recurring income, respectively. Non-recurring income was related to early repayments, the recognition of previously reserved income from a prior period, and amendments to specific loan positions.\nThe increase in interest income from the respective periods were due primarily to growth in the overall investment portfolio.\nExpenses\nOur primary operating expenses include the payment of fees to Stellus Capital Management under the investment advisory agreement, our allocable portion of overhead expenses under the administration agreement and other operating costs described below. We bear all other out-of-pocket costs and expenses of our operations and transactions, which may include:\n\u2022\norganization and offering;\n\u2022\ncalculating our net asset value (including the cost and expenses of any independent valuation firm);\n\u2022\nfees and expenses payable to third parties, including agents, consultants or other advisors, in monitoring financial and legal affairs for us and in monitoring our investments and performing due diligence on our prospective portfolio companies or otherwise relating to, or associated with, evaluating and making investments;\n\u2022\ninterest payable on debt, if any, incurred to finance our investments and expenses related to unsuccessful portfolio acquisition efforts;\n\u2022\nbase management and incentive fees;\n\u2022\nadministration fees and expenses, if any, payable under the administration agreement (including our allocable portion of Stellus Capital's overhead in performing its obligations under the administration agreement, including rent and the allocable portion of the cost of our chief compliance officer and chief financial officer and their respective staff);\n\u2022\ntransfer agent,

</tr>\n</table>\nThe increase in operating expenses for the respective periods was primarily due to 1) an increase in management fees, directly related to the growth of our portfolio, 2) increased interest expense due to the higher balances on the Credit Facility and SBA-guaranteed debentures outstanding during the period, 3) excise taxes as a result of capital gains on certain equity positions, and 4) higher income incentive fees and capital gains incentive fees due to performance of the portfolio.\nNet Investment Income\nNet investment income was $22.4 million, or $1.23 per common share based on 18,275,696 weighted-average common shares outstanding at December 31, 2019. Net investment income was $22.6 million, or $1.42 per common share based on 15,953,571 weighted-average common shares outstanding at December 31, 2018. Net investment income was $18.0 million, or $1.21 per common share based on 14,870,981 weighted-average common shares outstanding at December 31, 2017.\nNet investment income for the year ended December 31, 2019 decreased compared to the year ended December 31, 2018 as a result of an increase in accrued capital gains incentive fees and excise taxes generated by realized gains on certain equity positions and higher interest expense from larger amounts outstanding under the Credit Facility and SBA-guaranteed debentures; offset by higher investment income due to a larger portfolio.\nNet Realized Gains and Losses\nWe measure realized gains or losses by the difference between the net proceeds from the repayment, sale or other disposition and the amortized cost basis of the investment, using the specific identification method, without regard to unrealized appreciation or depreciation previously recognized.\nProceeds from repayments of investments and amortization of certain other investments for the year ended December 31, 2019 totaled $128.2 million and net realized gains totaled $19.6 million. Proceeds from repayments of investments and amortization of certain other investments for the year ended December 31, 2018 totaled $147.5 million and net realized gain totaled $5.5 million. Proceeds from the sales and repayments of investments and amortization of certain other investments for the year ended December 31, 2017 totaled $172.3 million and net realized gains totaled $4.7 million. Net realized gains in all periods presented resulted from the realization of our equity investments in certain portfolio companies.\nNet Change in Unrealized Appreciation (Depreciation) of Investments\nNet change in unrealized appreciation primarily reflects the change in portfolio investment values during the reporting period, including the reversal of previously recorded appreciation or depreciation when gains or losses are realized.\nNet change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on investments and cash equivalents for the year ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 totaled ($15.5) million, ($1.6) million, and ($0.0) million, respectively.\nThe change in unrealized depreciation in 2019 was primarily due to write downs on specific investments. The change in unrealized depreciation in 2018 was due to a significant widening of spreads during the fourth quarter, offset by the write up of a specific equity investment. There was relatively no change in unrealized appreciation in 2017.\nProvision for Taxes on Unrealized Appreciation on Investments\nWe have direct wholly owned subsidiaries that have elected to be taxable entities (the Taxable Subsidiaries\u201d). The Taxable Subsidiaries permit us to hold equity investments in portfolio companies which are pass through\u201d entities for tax purposes and continue to comply with the source-of-income\u201d requirements contained in RIC tax provisions of the Code. The Taxable Subsidiaries are not consolidated with us for income tax filing purposes and may generate income tax expense, benefit, and the related tax assets and liabilities, as a result of their ownership of certain portfolio investments. The income tax expense, or benefit, if any, and related tax assets and liabilities are reflected in our consolidated financial statements.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, we recognized a deferred tax benefit (provision) related to unrealized appreciation on certain equity investments for income tax at our Taxable Subsidiaries of\u2009 $(66.8) thousand, $(68.0) thousand and $9.0 thousand, respectively. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, a deferred tax liabilities of\u2009 $134.7 thousand and $68.0 thousand, respectively, were included on the Consolidated Statement of Assets and Liabilities.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, we recognized tax expense related to the realized gains on certain equity investments at our taxable subsidiaries of\u2009 $267.0 thousand. There was no such tax expense for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2017. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, no tax liability related to the taxes on realized gains were included on the Consolidated Statement of Assets and Liabilities.\nNet Increase in Net Assets Resulting from Operations\nNet increase in net assets resulting from operations totaled $26.4 million, or $1.45 per common share based on weighted-average shares of 18,275,696 for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to $26.2 million, or $1.64 per common share based on weighted-average shares of 15,953,571 common shares outstanding for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to $22.6 million, or $1.52 per common share based on weighted-average shares of 14,870,981 common shares outstanding for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nThe increase in net assets resulting from operations for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018 was higher due primarily to a larger amount of realized gains, offset by unrealized depreciation. The increase in net assets resulting from operations for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017 was higher due primarily to a higher net investment income as a result of portfolio growth, as well as a larger amount of realized gains.\nFinancial condition, liquidity and capital resources\nCash Flows from Operating and Financing Activities\nOur operating activities used net cash of\u2009 ($93.3) million for the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily in connection with the purchase of portfolio investments, offset by sales and repayments of portfolio investments. Our financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 provided cash of $92.0 million primarily from proceeds from the issuance of common stock, proceeds from SBA-guaranteed debentures and net borrowings on our credit facility.\nOur operating activities used net cash of\u2009 ($102.4) million for the year ended December 31, 2018, primarily in connection with the purchase of portfolio investments, offset by sales and repayments of portfolio investments. Our financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2018 provided cash of $94.8 million primarily from proceeds from SBA-guaranteed debentures and net borrowings on our credit facility\nOur operating activities provided net cash of\u2009 $18.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily in connection with income earned on our portfolio investments, offset by the purchase and origination of portfolio investments. Our financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2017 used cash of\u2009 ($2.9) million, primarily from net repayments on our credit facility.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nOur liquidity and capital resources are derived from the Credit Facility, the 2022 Notes, SBA-guaranteed debentures and cash flows from operations, including investment sales and repayments, and income earned. Our primary use of funds from operations includes investments in portfolio companies and other operating expenses we incur, as well as the payment of dividends to the holders of our common stock. We used, and expect to continue to use, these capital resources as well as proceeds from turnover within our portfolio and from public and private offerings of securities to finance our investment activities.\nAlthough we expect to fund the growth of our investment portfolio through the net proceeds from future public and private equity offerings and issuances of senior securities or future borrowings to the extent permitted by the 1940 Act, our plans to raise capital may not be successful. In this regard, if our common stock trades at a price below our then-current net asset value per share, we may be limited in our ability to raise equity capital given that we cannot sell our common stock at a price below net asset value per share unless our stockholders approve such a sale and our board of directors makes certain determinations in connection therewith. A proposal, approved by our stockholders at our 2019 annual stockholders meeting, authorizes us to sell up to 25% of our outstanding common shares at a price equal to or below the then current net asset value per share in one or more offerings. This approval will expire on the earlier of our 2020 annual stockholder meeting or July 22, 2020, the one-year anniversary of our 2019 annual stockholders meeting. We would need similar future approval from our stockholders to issue shares below the then current net asset value per share any time after the expiration of the current approval. In addition, we intend to distribute between 90% and 100% of our taxable income to our stockholders in order to satisfy the requirements applicable to RICs under Subchapter M of the Code. Consequently, we may not have the funds or the ability to fund new investments, to make additional investments in our portfolio companies, to fund our unfunded commitments to portfolio companies or to repay borrowings. In addition, the illiquidity of our portfolio investments may make it difficult for us to sell these investments when desired and, if we are required to sell these investments, we may realize significantly less than their recorded value.\nAlso, as a BDC, we generally are required to meet a coverage ratio of total assets, less liabilities and indebtedness not represented by senior securities, to total senior securities, which include all of our borrowings and any outstanding preferred stock, of at least 150% effective June 28, 2018 (at least 200% prior to June 28, 2018). This requirement limits the amount that we may borrow. We have received exemptive relief from the SEC to permit us to exclude the debt of our SBIC subsidiaries guaranteed by the SBA from the definition of senior securities in the asset coverage test under the 1940 Act. We were in compliance with the asset coverage ratios at all times. As of December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, our asset coverage ratio was 229% and 251%, respectively. The amount of leverage that we employ will depend on our assessment of market conditions and other factors at the time of any proposed borrowing, such as the maturity,\ncovenant package and rate structure of the proposed borrowings, our ability to raise funds through the issuance of shares of our common stock and the risks of such borrowings within the context of our investment outlook. Ultimately, we only intend to use leverage if the expected returns from borrowing to make investments will exceed the cost of such borrowing. As of December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, we had cash and cash equivalents of\u2009 $16.1 million and $17.5 million, respectively.\nCredit Facility\nOn November 7, 2012, we entered into a revolving credit facility (the Original Facility\u201d) with various lenders. SunTrust Bank, one of the lenders, served as administrative agent under the Original Facility. We terminated the Original Facility on October 11, 2017, in conjunction with securing and entering into a new senior secured revolving credit agreement, dated as of October 10, 2017, as amended on March 28, 2018, August 2, 2018, September 13, 2019, and December 27, 2019, with ZB, N.A., dba Amegy Bank and various other lenders (the Credit Facility\u201d).\nThe Credit Facility, as amended, provides for borrowings up to a maximum of\u2009 $220.0 million on a committed basis with an accordion feature that allows the Company to increase the aggregate commitments up to $250.0 million, subject to new or existing lenders agreeing to participate in the increase and other customary conditions.\nBorrowings under the Credit Facility bear interest, subject to our election, on a per annum basis equal to (i) LIBOR plus 2.50% (or 2.75% during certain periods in which the our asset coverage ratio is equal to or below 1.90 to 1.00) with no LIBOR floor, or (ii) 1.50% (or 1.75% during certain periods in which our asset coverage ratio is equal to or below 1.90 to 1.00) plus an alternate base rate based on the highest of the Prime Rate, Federal Funds Rate plus 0.5% or one month LIBOR plus 1.0%. We pay unused commitment fees of 0.50% per annum on the unused lender commitments under the Credit Facility. Interest is payable quarterly in arrears. The commitment to fund the revolver expires on October 10, 2020, after which we may no longer borrow under the Credit Facility. We must begin repaying principal equal to 1/12 of the aggregate amount outstanding under the Credit Facility beginning October 15, 2020. Any amounts borrowed under the Credit Facility will mature, and all accrued and unpaid interest thereunder will be due and payable, on October 10, 2021.\nOur obligations to the lenders are secured by a first priority security interest in its portfolio of securities and cash not held at the SBIC subsidiaries, but excluding short term investments. The Credit Facility contains certain covenants, including but not limited to: (i) maintaining a minimum liquidity test of at least $10.0 million, including cash, liquid investments and undrawn availability, (ii) maintaining an asset coverage ratio of at least 1.75 to 1.0, and (iii) maintaining a minimum shareholder's equity. As of December 31, 2019, we were in compliance with these covenants.\nAs of December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, the outstanding balance under the Credit Facility was $161.6 million and $99.6 million, respectively. The carrying amount of the amount outstanding under the Credit Facility approximates its fair value. The fair values of the Credit Facility is determined in accordance with ASC 820, which defines fair value in terms of the price that would be paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date under current market conditions. The fair value of the Credit Facility is estimated based upon market interest rates for our own borrowings or entities with similar credit risk, adjusted for nonperformance risk, if any. We have incurred costs of $1.8 million in connection with the current Credit Facility, which are being amortized over the life of the facility. Additionally, $0.3 million of costs from the Original Facility will continue to be amortized over the remaining life of the Credit Facility. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, $1.0 million and $1.3 million of such prepaid loan structure fees and administration fees had yet to be amortized, respectively. These prepaid loan fees are presented on our consolidated statement of assets and liabilities as a deduction from the debt liability attributable to the Credit Facility.\nInterest is paid quarterly in arrears. The following table summarizes the interest expense and amortized loan fees on the Credit Facility for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017 (dollars in millions):\nTable 19: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> For the years ended\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest expense\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loan fee amortization\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Commitment fees on unused portion\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Administration fees\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total interest expense and other fees\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>6.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loss on extinguishment of debt\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>0.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Weighted average interest rate\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.8% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.7% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.7% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Effective interest rate (including fee amortization)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.7% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.7% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.0% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Average debt outstanding\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>106.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>79.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>60.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash paid for interest and unused fees\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nSBA-guaranteed debentures\nDue to the SBIC subsidiaries' status as licensed SBICs, we can issue debentures guaranteed by the SBA at favorable interest rates. Under the regulations applicable to SBIC funds, a single licensee can have outstanding debentures guaranteed by the SBA subject to a regulatory leverage limit, up to two times the amount of regulatory capital. As of both December 31, 2019 and 2018, the SBIC subsidiary had $75.0 million in regulatory capital, as such term is defined by the SBA.\nAs of December 31, 2019, the year ending the first year of operations, the SBIC II subsidiary had $20.0 million in regulatory capital, as such term is defined by the SBA.\nOn August 12, 2014, we obtained exemptive relief from the SEC to permit us to exclude the debt of the SBIC subsidiaries guaranteed by the SBA from our asset coverage test under the 1940 Act. The exemptive relief provides us with increased flexibility under the asset coverage test by permitting us to borrow up to $325.0 million more than we would otherwise be able to absent the receipt of this exemptive relief.\nOn a stand-alone basis, the SBIC subsidiaries held $240.1 million and $225.5 million in assets at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, which accounted for approximately 37.0% and 42.9% of our total consolidated assets at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nDebentures guaranteed by the SBA have fixed interest rates that equal prevailing 10-year Treasury Note rates plus a market spread and have a maturity of ten years with interest payable semi-annually. The principal amount of the debentures is not required to be paid before maturity, but may be pre-paid at any time with no prepayment penalty. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the SBIC subsidiaries had $161.0 million and $150.0 million of the SBA-guaranteed debentures outstanding, respectively. SBA-guaranteed debentures drawn before October 1, 2019 incur upfront fees of 3.425%, which consists of a 1.00% commitment fee and a 2.425% issuance discount, which are amortized over the life of the SBA-guaranteed debentures. SBA-guaranteed debentures drawn after October 1, 2019 incur upfront fees of 3.435%, which consists of a 1.00% commitment fee and a 2.435% issuance discount, which are amortized over the life of the SBA-guaranteed debentures. Once pooled, which occurs in March and September each year, the SBA-guaranteed debentures bear interest at a fixed rate that is set to the current 10-year treasury rate plus a spread at each pooling date.\nAs of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the carrying amount of the SBA-guaranteed debentures approximated their fair value. The fair values of the SBA-guaranteed debentures are determined in accordance with ASC 820, which defines fair value in terms of the price that would be paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date under current market conditions. The fair value of the SBA-guaranteed debentures are estimated based upon market interest\nrates for our own borrowings or entities with similar credit risk, adjusted for nonperformance risk, if any. At December 31, 2019 and 2018, the SBA-guaranteed debentures would be deemed to be Level 3, as defined in Note 6.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we have incurred $5.6 million in financing costs related to the SBA-guaranteed debentures since the SBIC subsidiaries have received their licenses, which were recorded as prepaid loan fees. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, $3.5 million and $3.6 million of prepaid financing costs had yet to be amortized, respectively. These prepaid loan fees are presented on the consolidated statement of assets and liabilities as a deduction from the debt liability.\nThe following table summarizes the interest expense and amortized fees on the SBA-guaranteed debentures for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 (dollars in millions; averages for periods outstanding):\nTable 20: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> For the years ended\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest expense\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Debenture fee amortization\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total interest expense and other fees\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Weighted average interest rate\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.4% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.2% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.1% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Effective interest rate (including fee amortization)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.8% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.7% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3.6% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Average debt outstanding\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>151.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>125.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>67.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash paid for interest\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nNotes\nOn May 5, 2014, we closed a public offering of\u2009 $25.0 million aggregate principal amount of 6.50% notes (the 2019 Notes\u201d) due April 30, 2019. We redeemed all $25.0 million in aggregate principal amount of the 2019 Notes on September 20, 2017. As a result of the redemption, we recognized a loss on the extinguishment of debt of\u2009 $0.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, due to the write off of the remaining deferred financing costs on the 2019 Notes.\nThe following table summarizes the interest expense and deferred financing costs on the 2019 Notes for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017 (dollars in millions; averages for period outstanding):\nTable 21: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> For the year ended\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> December 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest expense\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> - </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td> - </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Deferred financing costs\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total interest expense and other fees\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Loss on extinguishment of debt\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Weighted average interest rate\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>-% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>-% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6.5% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Effective interest rate (including fee amortization)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>-% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>-% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7.3% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Average debt outstanding\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>25.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Cash paid for interest\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOn August 21, 2017, we issued $42.5 million in aggregate principal amount of 5.75% fixed-rate notes due 2022 (the 2022 Notes\u201d). On September 8, 2017, we issued an additional $6.4 million in aggregate principal amount of the 2022 Notes pursuant to a full exercise of the underwriters' overallotment option. The 2022 Notes will mature on September 15, 2022, and may be redeemed in whole or in part at any time or\nfrom time to time at the Company's option on or after September 15, 2019 at a redemption price equal to 100% of the outstanding principal, plus accrued and unpaid interest. Interest is payable quarterly.\nWe used all of the net proceeds from this offering to fully redeem the 2019 Notes and a portion of the amount outstanding under the Original Facility. As of both December 31, 2019 and 2018, the aggregate carrying amount of all Notes was $48.9 million and the fair value of the Notes was approximately $49.7 million and $47.6 million, respectively. The 2022 Notes are listed on New York Stock Exchange under the trading symbol SCA\u201d. The fair value of the Notes is based on the closing price of the security, which is a Level 2 input under ASC 820 due to sufficient trading volume.\nIn connection with the issuance and maintenance of the 2022 Notes, we have incurred $1.7 million of fees which are being amortized over the term of the 2022 Notes, of which $0.9 million and $1.2 million remained to be amortized as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.

See Note 9 for further discussion.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe may be a party to financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financial needs of our portfolio companies. As of December 31, 2019, our only off-balance sheet arrangements consisted of\u2009 $37.5 million of unfunded commitments to provide debt financing to seventeen of our portfolio companies. As of December 31, 2018, our only off-balance sheet arrangements consisted of a $21.2 million unfunded commitments to provide debt financing to eleven of our portfolio companies.\nRegulated Investment Company Status and Dividends\nWe have elected to be treated as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code. So long as we maintain our status as a RIC, we will not be taxed on our investment company taxable income or realized net capital gains, to the extent that such taxable income or gains are distributed, or deemed to be distributed, to stockholders as dividends on a timely basis.\nTaxable income generally differs from net income for financial reporting purposes due to temporary and permanent differences in the recognition of income and expenses, and generally excludes net unrealized appreciation or depreciation until realized. Distributions declared and paid by us in a year may differ from taxable income for that year as such dividends may include the distribution of current year taxable income or the distribution of prior year taxable income carried forward into and distributed in the current year. Distributions also may include returns of capital.\nTo qualify for RIC tax treatment, we must, among other things, distribute, with respect to each taxable year, at least 90% of our investment company net taxable income (i.e., our net ordinary income and our realized net short-term capital gains in excess of realized net long-term capital losses, if any). If we maintain our qualification as a RIC, we must also satisfy certain distribution requirements each calendar year in order to avoid a federal excise tax on our undistributed earnings of a RIC.\nWe intend to distribute to our stockholders between 90% and 100% of our annual taxable income (which includes our taxable interest and fee income). However, the covenants contained in the Credit Facility may prohibit us from making distributions to our stockholders, and, as a result, could hinder our ability to satisfy the distribution requirement. In addition, we may retain for investment some or all of our net taxable capital gains (i.e., realized net long-term capital gains in excess of realized net short-term capital losses) and treat such amounts as deemed distributions to our stockholders. If we do this, our stockholders will be treated as if they received actual distributions of the capital gains we retained and then reinvested the net after-tax proceeds in our common stock. Our stockholders also may be eligible to claim tax credits (or, in certain circumstances, tax refunds) equal to their allocable share of the tax we paid on the capital gains deemed distributed to them. To the extent our taxable earnings for a fiscal taxable year fall below the total amount of our dividends for that fiscal year, a portion of those dividend distributions may be deemed a return of capital to our stockholders.\nWe may not be able to achieve operating results that will allow us to make distributions at a specific level or to increase the amount of these distributions from time to time. In addition, we may be limited in our ability to make distributions due to the asset coverage test for borrowings applicable to us as a business development company under the 1940 Act and due to provisions in Credit Facility. We cannot assure stockholders that they will receive any distributions or distributions at a particular level.\nIn accordance with certain applicable Treasury regulations and private letter rulings issued by the Internal Revenue Service, a RIC may treat a distribution of its own stock as fulfilling its RIC distribution requirements if each stockholder may elect to receive his or her entire distribution in either cash or stock of the RIC, subject to a limitation that the aggregate amount of cash to be distributed to all stockholders must be at least 20% of the aggregate declared distribution. If too many stockholders elect to receive cash, each stockholder electing to receive cash must receive a pro rata amount of cash (with the balance of the distribution paid in stock). In no event will any stockholder, electing to receive cash, receive less than 20% of his or her entire distribution in cash. If these and certain other requirements are met, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the amount of the dividend paid in stock will be equal to the amount of cash that could have been received instead of stock. We have no current intention of paying dividends in shares of our stock in accordance with these Treasury regulations or private letter rulings.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 1 to the financial statements for a description of recent accounting pronouncements, if any, including the expected dates of adoption and the anticipated impact on the financial statements.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe preparation of our financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. Changes in the economic\nenvironment, financial markets and any other parameters used in determining such estimates could cause actual results to differ. In addition to the discussion below, our significant accounting policies are further described in the notes to the financial statements.\nValuation of portfolio investments\nAs a business development company, we generally invest in illiquid loans and securities including debt and equity securities of middle-market companies. Under procedures established by our Board, we may value investments for which market quotations are readily available at such market quotations. We obtain these market values from an independent pricing service or at the mean between the bid and ask prices obtained from at least two brokers or dealers (if available, otherwise by a principal market maker or a primary market dealer). Debt and equity securities that are not publicly traded or whose market prices are not readily available are valued at fair value as determined in good faith by our Board. Such determination of fair values may involve subjective judgments and estimates, although we engage independent valuation providers to review the valuation of each portfolio investment that does not have a readily available market quotation at least twice each year. Investments purchased within 90 days of maturity are valued at cost plus accreted discount, or minus amortized premium, which approximates value. With respect to unquoted securities, our Board, together with our independent valuation advisors, values each investment considering, among other measures, discounted cash flow models, comparisons of financial ratios of peer companies that are public and other factors.\nWhen an external event such as a purchase transaction, public offering or subsequent equity sale occurs, our Board uses the pricing indicated by the external event to corroborate and/or assist us in our valuation. Because there is not a readily available market for substantially all of the investments in our portfolio, we value most of our portfolio investments at fair value as determined in good faith by our Board using a documented valuation policy and a consistently applied valuation process. Due to the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of investments that do not have a readily available market value, the fair value of our investments may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a readily available market value existed for such investments, and the differences could be material.\nWith respect to investments for which market quotations are not readily available, our Board undertakes a multi-step valuation process each quarter, as described below:\n\u2022\nOur quarterly valuation process begins with each portfolio company or investment being initially valued by the investment professionals of Stellus Capital Management responsible for the portfolio investment;\n\u2022\nPreliminary valuation conclusions are then documented and discussed with our senior management and Stellus Capital Management;\n\u2022\nAt least twice annually, the valuation for each portfolio investment is reviewed by an independent valuation firm;\n\u2022\nThe audit committee of our Board then reviews these preliminary valuations; and\n\u2022\nThe Board then discusses valuations and determines the fair value of each investment in our portfolio in good faith, based on the input of Stellus Capital Management, the independent valuation firm and the audit committee.\nRevenue recognition\nWe record interest income on an accrual basis to the extent that we expect to collect such amounts. For loans and debt securities with contractual PIK interest, which represents contractual interest accrued and added to the loan balance that generally becomes due at maturity, we do not accrue PIK interest if the portfolio company valuation indicates that such PIK interest is not collectible. We will not accrue interest on loans and debt securities if we have reason to doubt our ability to collect such interest. Loan origination fees, original issue discount and market discount or premium are capitalized, and we then accrete or amortize such amounts using the effective interest method as interest income. Upon the prepayment of a loan or\ndebt security, any unamortized loan origination is recorded as interest income. We record prepayment premiums on loans and debt securities as interest income. Dividend income, if any, will be recognized on the ex-dividend date.\nWe have investments in our portfolio that contain a PIK interest provision. Any PIK interest is added to the principal balance of such investments and is recorded as income, if the portfolio company valuation indicates that such PIK interest is collectible. In order to maintain our status as a RIC, substantially all of this income must be paid out to stockholders in the form of dividends, even if we have not collected any cash.\nNet realized gains or losses and net change in unrealized appreciation or depreciation\nWe measure realized gains or losses by the difference between the net proceeds from the repayment, sale, or other disposition and the amortized cost basis of the investment, without regard to unrealized appreciation or depreciation previously recognized. Net change in unrealized appreciation or depreciation reflects the change in portfolio investment values during the reporting period, including any reversal of previously recorded unrealized appreciation or depreciation when gains or losses are realized.\nCapital Gains Incentive Fee\nUnder GAAP, the Company calculates the capital gains incentive fee payable to the Advisor as if the Company had realized all investments at their fair values as of the reporting date. Accordingly, the Company accrues a provisional capital gains incentive fee taking into account any unrealized gains or losses. As the provisional incentive fee is subject to the performance of investments until there is a realization event, the amount of provisional capital gains incentive fee accrued at a reporting date may vary from the incentive fee that is ultimately realized and the differences could be material.\nRecent Developments\nInvestment Portfolio\nOn January 3, we received full repayment on the first lien term loan of APG Intermediate Sub 2 Corp. for total proceeds of\u2009 $10 million, including a $0.1 million prepayment fee. We also received $2.4 million in full realization on the equity of the company, resulting in a $1.3 million gain.\nOn January 7, 2020, we invested $14.4 million in the first lien term loan of Sales Benchmark Index, LLC, $1.3 million in the unfunded revolver, and $3.3 million in the unfunded delayed draw term loan of Sales Benchmark, LLC, a provider of revenue growth management consulting services for private equity-owned and large enterprise clients. Additionally, we invested $0.7 million in the preferred equity of the company.\nOn January 15, 2020, Apex Environmental Resources Holdings, LLC was merged with a provider of non-hazardous waste management, collection, and recycling services, creating Interstate Waste Services, Inc. Our common and preferred ownership positions in Apex Environmental Resources Holdings, LLC was rolled into the combined entity.\nOn January 31, 2020, we invested $18.9 million in the first lien term loan and $2.7 million in the unfunded revolver of Elliott Aviation, LLC, a provider of maintenance, repair, and overhaul and fixed-base operator services to the business aviation sector. Additionally, we invested $0.9 million in the preferred equity of the company.\nCredit Facility\nThe outstanding balance under the Credit Facility as of February 28, 2020 was $175.3 million.\nATM Program\nSince December 31, 2019, we issued 332,591 shares under the At-the-Market ( ATM\u201d) Program, for gross proceeds of\u2009 $4.8 million. The average per share offering price of shares issued in the ATM Program was $14.42.\nSBA-guaranteed Debentures\nThe outstanding balance under SBA-guaranteed Debentures as of February 28, 2020 was $161.0 million.\nDividend Declared\nOn January 10, 2020, the Company's Board declared a regular monthly dividend for each of January, February and March 2020.\nTable 24: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>

Actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in our forward-looking statements, and future results could differ materially from historical performance. We undertake no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, unless required by law or SEC rule or regulation. You are advised to consult any additional disclosures that we may make directly to you or through reports that we in the future may file with the SEC, including annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K.\nOverview\nWe are an externally managed, non-diversified, closed-end investment company that has elected to be regulated as a BDC under the 1940 Act. Our investment activities are managed by our investment adviser, Stellus Capital Management.\nWe were organized as a Maryland corporation on May 18, 2012 and formally commenced operations on November 7, 2012. Our investment objective is to maximize the total return to our stockholders in the form of current income and capital appreciation through debt and related equity investments in middle-market companies.\nAs a BDC, we are required to comply with certain regulatory requirements. For instance, as a BDC, we must not acquire any assets other than qualifying assets\u201d specified in the 1940 Act unless, at the time the acquisition is made, at least 70% of our total assets are qualifying assets. Qualifying assets include investments in eligible portfolio companies.\u201d Under the relevant SEC rules, the term eligible portfolio company\u201d includes all private operating companies, operating companies whose securities are not listed on a national securities exchange, and certain public operating companies that have listed their securities on a national securities exchange and have a market capitalization of less than $250 million, in each case organized and with their principal of business in the United States.\nWe have elected to be treated for tax purposes as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code. To maintain our qualification as a RIC, we must, among other things, meet certain source-of-income and asset diversification requirements. As of December 31, 2019, we were in compliance with the RIC requirements. As a RIC, we generally will not have to pay corporate-level U.S. federal income taxes on any income we distribute to our stockholders.\nPrior to June 28, 2018, we were only allowed to employ leverage to the extent that our asset coverage, as defined in the 1940 Act, was equal to at least 200% after giving effect to such leverage. On March 23, 2018, the Small Business Credit Availability Act (the SBCAA\u201d) was signed into law, which included various changes to regulations under the federal securities laws that impact BDCs. The SBCAA included changes to the 1940 Act to allow BDCs to decrease their asset coverage requirement to 150% from 200% under certain circumstances.\nOn April 4, 2018, the Board, including a required majority\u201d (as such term is defined in Section 57(o) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the 1940 Act\u201d)) of the Board, approved the application of the modified asset coverage requirements set forth in Section 61(a)(2) of the 1940 Act. The Board also approved the submission of a proposal to stockholders to approve the application of the modified asset coverage requirements set forth in Section 61(a)(2) of the 1940 Act, which was approved by stockholders at our 2018 annual meeting of stockholders. As a result, the asset coverage ratio applicable to us was decreased from 200% to 150%, effective June 28, 2018, which effectively increased the amount of leverage we may incur. As of December 31, 2019, our asset coverage ratio was 229%. The amount of leverage that we employ at any time depends on our assessment of the market and other factors at the time of any proposed borrowing.\nPortfolio Composition and Investment Activity\nPortfolio Composition\nWe originate and invest primarily in privately-held middle-market companies (typically those with $5.0 million to $50.0 million of EBITDA) through first lien (including unitranche), second lien, and unsecured debt financing, often times with a corresponding equity investment.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had $ 628.9 million (at fair value) invested in 63 companies. As of December 31, 2019, our portfolio included approximately 72% of first lien debt, 18% of second lien debt, 4% of unsecured debt and 6% of equity investments at fair value. The composition of our investments at cost and fair value as of December 31, 2019 was as follows:\n\n(1)\nIncludes unitranche investments, which account for 14.4% of our portfolio at fair value. Unitranche structures may combine characteristics of first lien senior secured as well as second lien and/or subordinated loans and our unitranche loans will expose us to the risks associated with the second lien and subordinated loans to the extent we invest in the last-out\u201d tranche.\nAs of December 31, 2018, we had $504.5 million (at fair value) invested in 57 companies. As of December 31, 2018, our portfolio included approximately 58% of first lien debt, 30% of second lien debt, 5% of unsecured debt and 7% of equity investments at fair value. The composition of our investments at cost and fair value as of December 31, 2018 was as follows:\n\n(1)\nIncludes unitranche investments, which account for 20.6% of our portfolio at December 31, 2018 fair value. Unitranche structures may combine characteristics of first lien senior secured as well as second lien and/or subordinated loans and our unitranche loans will expose us to the risks associated with the second lien and subordinated loans to the extent we invest in the last-out\u201d tranche.\nOur investment portfolio may contain loans that are in the form of lines of credit or revolving credit facilities, which require us to provide funding when requested by portfolio companies in accordance with the terms and conditions of the underlying loan agreements. As of December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, we had unfunded commitments of\u2009 $37.5 million and $21.2 million, respectively, to provide debt financing for seventeen and eleven portfolio companies, respectively. As of December 31, 2019, the Company had sufficient liquidity to fund such unfunded commitments should the need arise.\nThe following is a summary of geographical concentration of our investment portfolio as of December 31, 2019:\n\nThe following is a summary of geographical concentration of our investment portfolio as of December 31, 2018:\n\nThe following is a summary of industry concentration of our investment portfolio as of December 31, 2019:\n\nThe following is a summary of industry concentration of our investment portfolio as of December 31, 2018:\n\nCertain portfolio company classifications were updated to more adequately align to the risks of the portfolio investments with other companies in such industries. Industry classification for the prior year financial statements included above were reclassified to the current presentation. The following changes and their December 31, 2018 cost and fair value, respectively, were made: 1) Consumer Goods: Durable to Metals & Mining; $17,237,500 for both cost and fair value, 2) Media: Broadcasting & Subscription to Media: Advertising, Printing & Publishing; $7,058,675 and $6,875,625, 3) Services: Business to Aerospace & Defense; $10,777,822 for both cost and value, 4) Services: Business to Environmental Industries; $13,058,543 and $12,505,509, 5) Services: Business to Software; $14,005,369 and $13,432,500.\nAt December 31, 2019, our average portfolio company investment at amortized cost and fair value was approximately $10.2 million and $10.0 million, respectively, and our largest portfolio company investment at amortized cost and fair value was approximately $ 21.6 million and $ 21.3 million, respectively. At December 31, 2018, our average portfolio company investment at both amortized cost and fair value was approximately $8.9 million, and our largest portfolio company investment at amortized cost and fair value was approximately $21.6 million and $22.3 million, respectively.\nAt December 31, 2019, 93% of our debt investments bore interest based on floating rates (subject to interest rate floors), such as LIBOR, and 7% bore interest at fixed rates. At December 31, 2018, 91% of our debt investments bore interest based on floating rates (subject to interest rate floors), such as LIBOR, and 9% bore interest at fixed rates.\nThe weighted average yield on all of our debt investments as of December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 was approximately 9.2% and 10.9%, respectively. The weighted average yield was computed using the effective interest rates for all of our debt investments, including accretion of original issue discount. The weighted average yield of our debt investments is not the same as a return on investment for our stockholders, but, rather relates to a portion of our investment portfolio and is calculated before the payment of all of our subsidiaries' fees and expenses.\nAs of December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, we had cash and cash equivalents of\u2009 $16.1 million and $17.5 million, respectively.\nInvestment Activity\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, we made $246.5 million of investments in seventeen new portfolio companies and twelve existing portfolio companies. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we received $128.2 million in proceeds principally from prepayments of our investments, including $19.2 million from amortization of certain other investments.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, we made $272.9 million of investments in seventeen new portfolio companies and twelve existing portfolio companies. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we received $147.6 million in proceeds principally from prepayments of our investments, including $22.9 million from amortization of certain other investments.\nOur level of investment activity can vary substantially from period to period depending on many factors, including the amount of debt and equity capital to middle market companies, the level of merger and acquisition activity, the general economic environment and the competitive environment for the types of investments we make.\nAsset Quality\nIn addition to various risk management and monitoring tools, Stellus Capital Management uses an investment rating system to characterize and monitor the credit profile and expected level of returns on each investment in our portfolio. This investment rating system uses a five-level numeric scale. The following is a description of the conditions associated with each investment category:\n\u2022\nInvestment Category 1 is used for investments that are performing above expectations, and whose risks remain favorable compared to the expected risk at the time of the original investment.\n\u2022\nInvestment Category 2 is used for investments that are performing within expectations and whose risks remain neutral compared to the expected risk at the time of the original investment. All new loans are initially rated 2.\n\u2022\nInvestment Category 3 is used for investments that are performing below expectations and that require closer monitoring, but where no loss of return or principal is expected. Portfolio companies with a rating of 3 may be out of compliance with financial covenants.\n\u2022\nInvestment Category 4 is used for investments that are performing substantially below expectations and whose risks have increased substantially since the original investment. These investments are often in work out. Investments with a rating of 4 are those for which some loss of return but no loss of principal is expected.\n\u2022\nInvestment Category 5 is used for investments that are performing substantially below expectations and whose risks have increased substantially since the original investment. These investments are almost always in work out. Investments with a rating of 5 are those for which some loss of return and principal is expected.\n\n(1)\nOne portfolio company appears in two categories as of December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018.\nLoans and Debt Securities on Non-Accrual Status\nWe will not accrue interest on loans and debt securities if we have reason to doubt our ability to collect such interest. As of December 31, 2019, we had loans to 2 portfolio companies that were on non-accrual status, which represented approximately 3.6% of our loan portfolio at cost and 0.9% at fair value. As of December 31, 2018, we had loans to four portfolio companies that were on non-accrual status, which represented approximately 3.9% of our loan portfolio at cost and 2.8% at fair value.\nResults of Operations\nAn important measure of our financial performance is net increase (decrease) in net assets resulting from operations, which includes net investment income (loss), net realized gain (loss) and net unrealized appreciation (depreciation). Net investment income (loss) is the difference between our income from interest, dividends, fees and other investment income and our operating expenses including interest on borrowed funds. Net realized gain (loss) on investments is the difference between the proceeds received from dispositions of portfolio investments and their amortized cost. Net unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on investments is the net change in the fair value of our investment portfolio.\nComparison of the Years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017\nRevenues\nWe generate revenue in the form of interest income on debt investments and capital gains and distributions, if any, on investment securities that we may acquire in portfolio companies. Our debt investments typically have a term of five to seven years and bear interest at primarily floating rates. Interest on our debt securities is generally payable quarterly. Payments of principal on our debt investments may be amortized over the stated term of the investment, deferred for several years or due entirely at maturity. In some cases, our debt investments may pay interest in-kind, or PIK interest. Any outstanding principal amount of our debt securities and any accrued but unpaid interest will generally become due at the maturity date. The level of interest income we receive is directly related to the balance of interest-bearing investments multiplied by the weighted average yield of our investments. We expect that the total dollar amount of interest and any dividend income that we earn will increase as the size of our investment portfolio increases. In addition, we may generate revenue in the form of prepayment fees, commitment, loan origination, structuring or due diligence fees, fees for providing significant managerial assistance and consulting fees.\nThe following shows the breakdown of investment income for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017 (in millions).\n\n(1)\nFor the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, we recognized $2.8 million, $3.4 million and $2.5 million of non-recurring income, respectively. Non-recurring income was related to early repayments, the recognition of previously reserved income from a prior period, and amendments to specific loan positions.\nThe increase in interest income from the respective periods were due primarily to growth in the overall investment portfolio.\nExpenses\nOur primary operating expenses include the payment of fees to Stellus Capital Management under the investment advisory agreement, our allocable portion of overhead expenses under the administration agreement and other operating costs described below. We bear all other out-of-pocket costs and expenses of our operations and transactions, which may include:\n\u2022\norganization and offering;\n\u2022\ncalculating our net asset value (including the cost and expenses of any independent valuation firm);\n\u2022\nfees and expenses payable to third parties, including agents, consultants or other advisors, in monitoring financial and legal affairs for us and in monitoring our investments and performing due diligence on our prospective portfolio companies or otherwise relating to, or associated with, evaluating and making investments;\n\u2022\ninterest payable on debt, if any, incurred to finance our investments and expenses related to unsuccessful portfolio acquisition efforts;\n\u2022\nbase management and incentive fees;\n\u2022\nadministration fees and expenses, if any, payable under the administration agreement (including our allocable portion of Stellus Capital's overhead in performing its obligations under the administration agreement, including rent and the allocable portion of the cost of our chief compliance officer and chief financial officer and their respective staff);\n\u2022\ntransfer agent, dividend agent and custodial fees and expenses;\n\u2022\nU.S. federal and state registration fees;\n\u2022\nall costs of registration and listing our securities on any securities exchange;\n\u2022\nU.S. federal, state and local taxes;\n\u2022\nindependent directors' fees and expenses;\n\u2022\ncosts of preparing and filing reports or other documents required by the SEC or other regulators;\n\u2022\ncosts of distributing any reports, proxy statements or other notices to stockholders, including printing costs;\n\u2022\ncosts and fees associated with any fidelity bond, directors and officers/errors and omissions liability insurance, and any other insurance premiums;\n\u2022\ndirect costs and expenses of administration, including printing, mailing, long distance telephone, copying, secretarial and other staff, independent auditors and outside legal costs;\n\u2022\nproxy voting expenses; and\n\u2022\nall other expenses incurred by us or Stellus Capital in connection with administering our business.\nThe following shows the breakdown of operating expenses for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 (in millions).\n\nThe increase in operating expenses for the respective periods was primarily due to 1) an increase in management fees, directly related to the growth of our portfolio, 2) increased interest expense due to the higher balances on the Credit Facility and SBA-guaranteed debentures outstanding during the period, 3) excise taxes as a result of capital gains on certain equity positions, and 4) higher income incentive fees and capital gains incentive fees due to performance of the portfolio.\nNet Investment Income\nNet investment income was $22.4 million, or $1.23 per common share based on 18,275,696 weighted-average common shares outstanding at December 31, 2019. Net investment income was $22.6 million, or $1.42 per common share based on 15,953,571 weighted-average common shares outstanding at December 31, 2018. Net investment income was $18.0 million, or $1.21 per common share based on 14,870,981 weighted-average common shares outstanding at December 31, 2017.\nNet investment income for the year ended December 31, 2019 decreased compared to the year ended December 31, 2018 as a result of an increase in accrued capital gains incentive fees and excise taxes generated by realized gains on certain equity positions and higher interest expense from larger amounts outstanding under the Credit Facility and SBA-guaranteed debentures; offset by higher investment income due to a larger portfolio.\nNet Realized Gains and Losses\nWe measure realized gains or losses by the difference between the net proceeds from the repayment, sale or other disposition and the amortized cost basis of the investment, using the specific identification method, without regard to unrealized appreciation or depreciation previously recognized.\nProceeds from repayments of investments and amortization of certain other investments for the year ended December 31, 2019 totaled $128.2 million and net realized gains totaled $19.6 million. Proceeds from repayments of investments and amortization of certain other investments for the year ended December 31, 2018 totaled $147.5 million and net realized gain totaled $5.5 million. Proceeds from the sales and repayments of investments and amortization of certain other investments for the year ended December 31, 2017 totaled $172.3 million and net realized gains totaled $4.7 million. Net realized gains in all periods presented resulted from the realization of our equity investments in certain portfolio companies.\nNet Change in Unrealized Appreciation (Depreciation) of Investments\nNet change in unrealized appreciation primarily reflects the change in portfolio investment values during the reporting period, including the reversal of previously recorded appreciation or depreciation when gains or losses are realized.\nNet change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on investments and cash equivalents for the year ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 totaled ($15.5) million, ($1.6) million, and ($0.0) million, respectively.\nThe change in unrealized depreciation in 2019 was primarily due to write downs on specific investments. The change in unrealized depreciation in 2018 was due to a significant widening of spreads during the fourth quarter, offset by the write up of a specific equity investment. There was relatively no change in unrealized appreciation in 2017.\nProvision for Taxes on Unrealized Appreciation on Investments\nWe have direct wholly owned subsidiaries that have elected to be taxable entities (the Taxable Subsidiaries\u201d). The Taxable Subsidiaries permit us to hold equity investments in portfolio companies which are pass through\u201d entities for tax purposes and continue to comply with the source-of-income\u201d requirements contained in RIC tax provisions of the Code. The Taxable Subsidiaries are not consolidated with us for income tax filing purposes and may generate income tax expense, benefit, and the related tax assets and liabilities, as a result of their ownership of certain portfolio investments. The income tax expense, or benefit, if any, and related tax assets and liabilities are reflected in our consolidated financial statements.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, we recognized a deferred tax benefit (provision) related to unrealized appreciation on certain equity investments for income tax at our Taxable Subsidiaries of\u2009 $(66.8) thousand, $(68.0) thousand and $9.0 thousand, respectively. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, a deferred tax liabilities of\u2009 $134.7 thousand and $68.0 thousand, respectively, were included on the Consolidated Statement of Assets and Liabilities.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, we recognized tax expense related to the realized gains on certain equity investments at our taxable subsidiaries of\u2009 $267.0 thousand. There was no such tax expense for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2017. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, no tax liability related to the taxes on realized gains were included on the Consolidated Statement of Assets and Liabilities.\nNet Increase in Net Assets Resulting from Operations\nNet increase in net assets resulting from operations totaled $26.4 million, or $1.45 per common share based on weighted-average shares of 18,275,696 for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to $26.2 million, or $1.64 per common share based on weighted-average shares of 15,953,571 common shares outstanding for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7.\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nForward-Looking Statements\nSome of the statements in this annual report on Form 10-K constitute forward-looking statements, which relate to future events or our future performance or financial condition.

Actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in our forward-looking statements, and future results could differ materially from historical performance. We undertake no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, unless required by law or SEC rule or regulation. You are advised to consult any additional disclosures that we may make directly to you or through reports that we in the future may file with the SEC, including annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K.\nOverview\nWe are an externally managed, non-diversified, closed-end investment company that has elected to be regulated as a BDC under the 1940 Act. Our investment activities are managed by our investment adviser, Stellus Capital Management.\nWe were organized as a Maryland corporation on May 18, 2012 and formally commenced operations on November 7, 2012. Our investment objective is to maximize the total return to our stockholders in the form of current income and capital appreciation through debt and related equity investments in middle-market companies.\nAs a BDC, we are required to comply with certain regulatory requirements. For instance, as a BDC, we must not acquire any assets other than qualifying assets\u201d specified in the 1940 Act unless, at the time the acquisition is made, at least 70% of our total assets are qualifying assets. Qualifying assets include investments in eligible portfolio companies.\u201d Under the relevant SEC rules, the term eligible portfolio company\u201d includes all private operating companies, operating companies whose securities are not listed on a national securities exchange, and certain public operating companies that have listed their securities on a national securities exchange and have a market capitalization of less than $250 million, in each case organized and with their principal of business in the United States.\nWe have elected to be treated for tax purposes as a RIC under Subchapter M of the Code. To maintain our qualification as a RIC, we must, among other things, meet certain source-of-income and asset diversification requirements. As of December 31, 2019, we were in compliance with the RIC requirements. As a RIC, we generally will not have to pay corporate-level U.S. federal income taxes on any income we distribute to our stockholders.\nPrior to June 28, 2018, we were only allowed to employ leverage to the extent that our asset coverage, as defined in the 1940 Act, was equal to at least 200% after giving effect to such leverage. On March 23, 2018, the Small Business Credit Availability Act (the SBCAA\u201d) was signed into law, which included various changes to regulations under the federal securities laws that impact BDCs. The SBCAA included changes to the 1940 Act to allow BDCs to decrease their asset coverage requirement to 150% from 200% under certain circumstances.\nOn April 4, 2018, the Board, including a required majority\u201d (as such term is defined in Section 57(o) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the 1940 Act\u201d)) of the Board, approved the application of the modified asset coverage requirements set forth in Section 61(a)(2) of the 1940 Act. The Board also approved the submission of a proposal to stockholders to approve the application of the modified asset coverage requirements set forth in Section 61(a)(2) of the 1940 Act, which was approved by stockholders at our 2018 annual meeting of stockholders. As a result, the asset coverage ratio applicable to us was decreased from 200% to 150%, effective June 28, 2018, which effectively increased the amount of leverage we may incur. As of December 31, 2019, our asset coverage ratio was 229%. The amount of leverage that we employ at any time depends on our assessment of the market and other factors at the time of any proposed borrowing.\nPortfolio Composition and Investment Activity\nPortfolio Composition\nWe originate and invest primarily in privately-held middle-market companies (typically those with $5.0 million to $50.0 million of EBITDA) through first lien (including unitranche), second lien, and unsecured debt financing, often times with a corresponding equity investment.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had $ 628.9 million (at fair value) invested in 63 companies. As of December 31, 2019, our portfolio included approximately 72% of first lien debt, 18% of second lien debt, 4% of unsecured debt and 6% of equity investments at fair value. The composition of our investments at cost and fair value as of December 31, 2019 was as follows:\nTable 10: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Cost\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Fair Value\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Senior Secured\u2009-\u2009First Lien(1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>461,107,595 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>455,169,878 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Senior Secured\u2009-\u2009Second Lien\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>130,600,172 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>111,961,013 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Unsecured Debt\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>22,279,519 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>22,137,186 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Equity\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>28,720,538 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>39,680,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total Investments\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>642,707,824 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>628,948,077 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1)\nIncludes unitranche investments, which account for 14.4% of our portfolio at fair value.

As of December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, we had unfunded commitments of\u2009 $37.5 million and $21.2 million, respectively, to provide debt financing for seventeen and eleven portfolio companies, respectively. As of December 31, 2019, the Company had sufficient liquidity to fund such unfunded commitments should the need arise.\nThe following is a summary of geographical concentration of our investment

adequately align to the risks of the portfolio investments with other companies in such industries. Industry classification for the prior year financial statements included above were reclassified to the current presentation. The following changes and their December 31, 2018 cost and fair value, respectively, were made: 1) Consumer Goods: Durable to Metals & Mining; $17,237,500 for both cost and fair value, 2) Media: Broadcasting & Subscription to Media: Advertising, Printing & Publishing; $7,058,675 and $6,875,625, 3) Services: Business to Aerospace & Defense; $10,777,822 for both cost and value, 4) Services: Business to Environmental Industries; $13,058,543 and $12,505,509, 5) Services: Business to Software; $14,005,369 and $13,432,500.\nAt December 31, 2019, our average portfolio company investment at amortized cost and fair value was approximately $10.2 million and $10.0 million, respectively, and our largest portfolio company investment at amortized cost and fair value was approximately $ 21.6 million and $ 21.3 million, respectively. At December 31, 2018, our average portfolio company investment at both amortized cost and fair value was approximately $8.9 million, and our largest portfolio company investment at amortized cost and fair value was approximately $21.6 million and $22.3 million, respectively.\nAt December 31, 2019, 93% of our debt investments bore interest based on floating rates (subject to interest rate floors), such as LIBOR, and 7% bore interest at fixed rates. At December 31, 2018, 91% of our debt investments bore interest based on floating rates (subject to interest rate floors), such as LIBOR, and 9% bore interest at fixed rates.\nThe weighted average yield on all of our debt investments as of December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018 was approximately 9.2% and 10.9%, respectively. The weighted average yield was computed using the effective interest rates for all of our debt investments, including accretion of original issue discount. The weighted average yield of our debt investments is not the same as a return on investment for our stockholders, but, rather relates to a portion of our investment portfolio and is calculated before the payment of all of our subsidiaries' fees and expenses.\nAs of December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, we had cash and cash equivalents of\u2009 $16.1 million and $17.5 million, respectively.\nInvestment Activity\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, we made $246.5 million of investments in seventeen new portfolio companies and twelve existing portfolio companies. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we received $128.2 million in proceeds principally from prepayments of our investments, including $19.2 million from amortization of certain other investments.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, we made $272.9 million of investments in seventeen new portfolio companies and twelve existing portfolio companies. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we received $147.6 million in proceeds principally from prepayments of our investments, including $22.9 million from amortization of certain other investments.\nOur level of investment activity can vary substantially from period to period depending on many factors, including the amount of debt and equity capital to middle market companies, the level of merger and acquisition activity, the general economic environment and the competitive environment for the types of investments we make.\nAsset Quality\nIn addition to various risk management and monitoring tools, Stellus Capital Management uses an investment rating system to characterize and monitor the credit profile and expected level of returns on each investment in our portfolio. This investment rating system uses a five-level numeric scale. The following is a description of the conditions associated with each investment category:\n\u2022\nInvestment Category 1 is used for investments that are performing above expectations, and whose risks remain favorable compared to the expected risk at the time of the original investment.\n\u2022\nInvestment Category 2 is used for investments that are performing within expectations and whose risks remain neutral compared to the expected risk at the time of the original investment. All new loans are initially rated 2.\n\u2022\nInvestment Category 3 is used for investments that are performing below expectations and that require closer monitoring, but where no loss of return or principal is expected. Portfolio companies with a rating of 3 may be out of compliance with financial covenants.\n\u2022\nInvestment Category 4 is used for investments that are performing substantially below expectations and whose risks have increased substantially since the original investment. These investments are often in work out. Investments with a rating of 4 are those for which some loss of return but no loss of principal is expected.\n\u2022\nInvestment Category 5 is used for investments that are performing substantially below expectations and whose risks have increased substantially since the original investment. These investments are almost always in work out. Investments with a rating of 5 are those for which some loss of return and principal is expected.\nTable 16: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> As of December 31, 2019\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> As of December 31, 2018\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Investment Category\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Fair Value\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> % of Total\nPortfolio\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Number of\nPortfolio\nCompanies(1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Fair Value\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> % of Total\nPortfolio\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Number of\nPortfolio\nCompanies\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> (dollars in millions)\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>70.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>92.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>492.2 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>78% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>41 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>372.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>74% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>37 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>49.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>26.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>-% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>628.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>64 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>504.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>58 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1)\nOne portfolio company appears in two categories as of December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018.\nLoans and Debt Securities on Non-Accrual Status\nWe will not accrue interest on loans and debt securities if we have reason to doubt our ability to collect such interest. As of December 31, 2019, we had loans to 2 portfolio companies that were on non-accrual status, which represented approximately 3.6% of our loan portfolio at cost and 0.9% at fair value. As of December 31, 2018, we had loans to four portfolio companies that were on non-accrual status, which represented approximately 3.9% of our loan portfolio at cost and 2.8% at fair value.\nResults of Operations\nAn important measure of our financial performance is net increase (decrease) in net assets resulting from operations, which includes net investment income (loss), net realized gain (loss) and net unrealized appreciation (depreciation). Net investment income (loss) is the difference between our income from interest, dividends, fees and other investment income and our operating expenses including interest on borrowed funds. Net realized gain (loss) on investments is the difference between the proceeds received from dispositions of portfolio investments and their amortized cost. Net unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on investments is the net change in the fair value of our investment portfolio.\nComparison of the Years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017\nRevenues\nWe generate revenue in the form of interest income on debt investments and capital gains and distributions, if any, on investment securities that we may acquire in portfolio companies. Our debt investments typically have a term of five to seven years and bear interest at primarily floating rates. Interest on our debt securities is generally payable quarterly. Payments of principal on our debt investments may be amortized over the stated term of the investment, deferred for several years or due entirely at maturity. In some cases, our debt investments may pay interest in-kind, or PIK interest. Any outstanding principal amount of our debt securities and any accrued but unpaid interest will generally become due at the maturity date. The level of interest income we receive is directly related to the balance of interest-bearing investments multiplied by the weighted average yield of our investments. We expect that the total dollar amount of interest and any dividend income that we earn will increase as the size of our investment portfolio increases. In addition, we may generate revenue in the form of prepayment fees, commitment, loan origination, structuring or due diligence fees, fees for providing significant managerial assistance and consulting fees.\nThe following shows the breakdown of investment income for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017 (in millions).\nTable 17: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> Year ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest Income(1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>56.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>49.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>37.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> PIK Income\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.4 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.5 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Miscellaneous fees(1)\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.0 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.8 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.6 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>58.9 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>53.3 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>39.7 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1)\nFor the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, we recognized $2.8 million, $3.4 million and $2.5 million of non-recurring income, respectively. Non-recurring income was related to early repayments, the recognition of previously reserved income from a prior period, and amendments to specific loan positions.\nThe increase in interest income from the respective periods were due primarily to growth in the overall investment portfolio.\nExpenses\nOur primary operating expenses include the payment of fees to Stellus Capital Management under the investment advisory agreement, our allocable portion of overhead expenses under the administration agreement and other operating costs described below.

</tr>\n</table>\nThe increase in operating expenses for the respective periods was primarily due to 1) an increase in management fees, directly related to the growth of our portfolio, 2) increased interest expense due to the higher balances on the Credit Facility and SBA-guaranteed debentures outstanding during the period, 3) excise taxes as a result of capital gains on certain equity positions, and 4) higher income incentive fees and capital gains incentive fees due to performance of the portfolio.\nNet Investment Income\nNet investment income was $22.4 million, or $1.23 per common share based on 18,275,696 weighted-average common shares outstanding at December 31, 2019. Net investment income was $22.6 million, or $1.42 per common share based on 15,953,571 weighted-average common shares outstanding at December 31, 2018. Net investment income was $18.0 million, or $1.21 per common share based on 14,870,981 weighted-average common shares outstanding at December 31, 2017.\nNet investment income for the year ended December 31, 2019 decreased compared to the year ended December 31, 2018 as a result of an increase in accrued capital gains incentive fees and excise taxes generated by realized gains on certain equity positions and higher interest expense from larger amounts outstanding under the Credit Facility and SBA-guaranteed debentures; offset by higher investment income due to a larger portfolio.\nNet Realized Gains and Losses\nWe measure realized gains or losses by the difference between the net proceeds from the repayment, sale or other disposition and the amortized cost basis of the investment, using the specific identification method, without regard to unrealized appreciation or depreciation previously recognized.\nProceeds from repayments of investments and amortization of certain other investments for the year ended December 31, 2019 totaled $128.2 million and net realized gains totaled $19.6 million. Proceeds from repayments of investments and amortization of certain other investments for the year ended December 31, 2018 totaled $147.5 million and net realized gain totaled $5.5 million. Proceeds from the sales and repayments of investments and amortization of certain other investments for the year ended December 31, 2017 totaled $172.3 million and net realized gains totaled $4.7 million. Net realized gains in all periods presented resulted from the realization of our equity investments in certain portfolio companies.\nNet Change in Unrealized Appreciation (Depreciation) of Investments\nNet change in unrealized appreciation primarily reflects the change in portfolio investment values during the reporting period, including the reversal of previously recorded appreciation or depreciation when gains or losses are realized.\nNet change in unrealized appreciation (depreciation) on investments and cash equivalents for the year ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 totaled ($15.5) million, ($1.6) million, and ($0.0) million, respectively.\nThe change in unrealized depreciation in 2019 was primarily due to write downs on specific investments. The change in unrealized depreciation in 2018 was due to a significant widening of spreads during the fourth quarter, offset by the write up of a specific equity investment. There was relatively no change in unrealized appreciation in 2017.\nProvision for Taxes on Unrealized Appreciation on Investments\nWe have direct wholly owned subsidiaries that have elected to be taxable entities (the Taxable Subsidiaries\u201d). The Taxable Subsidiaries permit us to hold equity investments in portfolio companies which are pass through\u201d entities for tax purposes and continue to comply with the source-of-income\u201d requirements contained in RIC tax provisions of the Code. The Taxable Subsidiaries are not consolidated with us for income tax filing purposes and may generate income tax expense, benefit, and the related tax assets and liabilities, as a result of their ownership of certain portfolio investments. The income tax expense, or benefit, if any, and related tax assets and liabilities are reflected in our consolidated financial statements.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, we recognized a deferred tax benefit (provision) related to unrealized appreciation on certain equity investments for income tax at our Taxable Subsidiaries of\u2009 $(66.8) thousand, $(68.0) thousand and $9.0 thousand, respectively. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, a deferred tax liabilities of\u2009 $134.7 thousand and $68.0 thousand, respectively, were included on the Consolidated Statement of Assets and Liabilities.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, we recognized tax expense related to the realized gains on certain equity investments at our taxable subsidiaries of\u2009 $267.0 thousand. There was no such tax expense for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2017. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, no tax liability related to the taxes on realized gains were included on the Consolidated Statement of Assets and Liabilities.\nNet Increase in Net Assets Resulting from Operations\nNet increase in net assets resulting from operations totaled $26.4 million, or $1.45 per common share based on weighted-average shares of 18,275,696 for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to $26.2 million, or $1.64 per common share based on weighted-average shares of 15,953,571 common shares outstanding for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to"}
