We also make real estate mortgage loans and other loans to our tenants. We conduct our business operations in one segment. We currently have healthcare investments in the U.S., Europe and Australia. We have operated as a REIT since April 6, 2004, and accordingly, elected REIT status upon the filing of our calendar year 2004 U.S. federal income tax return. Our existing tenants are, and our prospective tenants will generally be, healthcare operating companies and other healthcare providers that use substantial real estate assets in their operations. We offer financing for these operators' real estate through 100% lease and mortgage financing and generally seek lease and loan terms on a long-term basis ranging from 10 to 15 years with a series of shorter renewal terms at the option of our tenants and borrowers. We also have included and intend to include in our lease and loan agreements annual contractual minimum rate increases. Our existing portfolio's minimum escalators generally range from 0.5% to 3%. In addition, most of our leases and loans also include rate increases based on the general rate of inflation if greater than the minimum contractual increases. Only less than 3% of our properties do not have either a minimum escalator or an escalator based on inflation. Beyond rent or mortgage interest, our leases and loans typically require our tenants to pay all operating costs and expenses associated with the facility. Finally, we may acquire a profits or other equity interest in our tenants that gives us a right to share in the tenant's income or loss.\nWe selectively make loans to certain of our operators through our TRSs, which the operators use for acquisitions and working capital. We consider our lending business an important element of our overall business strategy for two primary reasons: (1) it provides opportunities to make income-earning investments that yield attractive risk-adjusted returns in an industry in which our management has expertise, and (2) by making debt capital available to certain qualified operators, we believe we create for our company a competitive advantage over other buyers of, and financing sources for, healthcare facilities.\nAt December 31, 2019, our portfolio (including real estate assets in joint ventures) consisted of 359 properties leased or loaned to 42 operators, of which four are under development and 11 are in the form of mortgage loans.\n2019 Highlights\nIn 2019, we invested in approximately $4.5 billion in healthcare real estate assets. These significant investments enhanced the size and scale of our healthcare portfolio, while expanding our geographic footprint in the U.S. and Europe, and entering into new territories such as Australia. These investments also extended our lease and loan maturity schedule. To fund these new investments, we raised $2.5 billion in proceeds from equity sales during 2019, received proceeds of $837 million from an Australian term loan facility in June 2019, and completed $900 million and \u00a31 billion senior unsecured notes offerings in July and December 2019, respectively. In addition to the record breaking acquisition year, we generated returns to our shareholders of 39% during 2019, outpacing the returns of several key indexes, as noted in Item 5 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our return included an increase to our dividend to $0.26 per share per quarter in 2019, which is the 5th year in a row for such an increase.\nA summary of our 2019 highlights is as follows:\nTable 197: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Acquired real estate assets or commenced development projects totaling more than $4.5 billion, as noted below:\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 198: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Invested in three acute care hospitals and one IRF for an aggregate investment of approximately $135 million.

We believe that our estimates of the amount and timing of credit losses, fair value adjustments (either as part of a purchase price allocation or impairment analyses), and periodic depreciation of our real estate assets, along with our assessment as to whether an entity that we do business with should be consolidated with our results, have significant effects on our financial statements. Each of these items involves estimates that require us to make subjective judgments. We rely on our experience, collect historical and current market data, and develop relevant assumptions to arrive at what we believe to be reasonable estimates. Under different conditions or assumptions, materially different amounts could be reported related to the critical accounting policies described below. In addition, application of these critical accounting policies involves the exercise of judgment on the use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and, as a result, actual results could materially differ from these estimates. See Note 2 to Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information regarding our accounting policies and recent accounting developments. Our accounting estimates include the following:\nCredit Losses:\nLosses from Rent Receivables: For all leases, we continuously monitor the performance of our existing tenants including, but not limited to: admission levels and surgery/procedure volumes by type; current operating margins; ratio of our tenants' operating margins both to facility rent and to facility rent plus other fixed costs; trends in revenue, cash collections, patient mix; and the effect of evolving healthcare regulations on tenants' profitability and liquidity.\nLosses from Operating Lease Receivables: We utilize the information above along with the tenants' payment and default history in evaluating (on a property-by-property basis) whether or not a provision for losses on outstanding billed rent and/or straight-line rent receivables is needed. A provision for losses on rent receivables (including straight-line rent receivables) is ultimately recorded when it becomes probable that the receivable will not be collected in full. The provision is an amount which reduces the receivable to its estimated net realizable value based on a determination of the eventual amounts to be collected either from the debtor or from existing collateral, if any.\nLosses on Financing Lease Receivables: Allowances are established for financing lease receivables based upon an estimate of probable losses on a property-by-property basis. Such receivables are impaired when it is deemed probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due in accordance with the contractual terms of the lease. Like operating lease receivables, the need for an allowance is based upon our assessment of the lessee's overall financial condition; economic resources and payment record; the prospects for support from any financially responsible guarantors; and, if appropriate, the realizable value of any collateral. These estimates consider all available evidence including the expected future cash flows discounted at the effective interest rate of the financing lease, fair value of collateral, and other relevant factors, as appropriate. Financing leases are placed on non-accrual status when we determine that the collectability of contractual amounts is not reasonably assured. If on non-accrual status, we generally account for the financing lease on a cash basis, in which income is recognized only upon receipt of cash.\nLoans: Loans consist of mortgage loans, working capital loans, and other long-term loans. Mortgage loans are collateralized by interests in real property. Working capital and other long-term loans are generally collateralized by interests in receivables and corporate and individual guarantees. We record loans at cost. We evaluate the collectability of both interest and principal on a loan-by-loan basis (using the same process as we do for assessing the collectability of rents as discussed above) to determine whether they are impaired. A loan is considered impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the existing contractual terms. When a loan is considered to be impaired, the amount of the allowance is calculated by comparing the recorded investment to either the value determined by discounting the expected future cash flows using the loan's effective interest rate or to the fair value of the collateral, if the loan is collateral dependent.\nInvestments in Real Estate: We maintain our investments in real estate at cost, and we capitalize improvements and replacements when they extend the useful life or improve the efficiency of the asset. While our tenants are generally responsible for all operating costs at a facility, to the extent that we incur costs of repairs and maintenance, we expense those costs as incurred. We compute depreciation using the straight-line method over the weighted-average useful life of approximately 39.0 years for buildings and improvements.\nWhen circumstances indicate a possible impairment of the value of our real estate investments, we review the recoverability of the facility's carrying value. The review of the recoverability is generally based on our estimate of the future undiscounted cash flows\nfrom the facility's use and eventual disposition. Our forecast of these cash flows considers factors such as expected future operating income, market and other applicable trends, and residual value, as well as the effects of leasing demand, competition, and other factors. If impairment exists due to the inability to recover the carrying value of a facility on an undiscounted basis, an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of the facility. We do not believe that the value of any of our facilities was impaired at December 31, 2019; however, given the highly specialized aspects of our properties no assurance can be given that future impairment charges will not be taken.\nAcquired Real Estate Purchase Price Allocation: For properties acquired for leasing purpose, we currently account for such acquisition based on asset acquisition accounting rules. Under this accounting method, we allocate the purchase price of acquired properties to net tangible and identified intangible assets acquired based on their fair values. In making estimates of fair value for purposes of allocating purchase prices of acquired real estate, we may utilize a number of sources, including available real estate broker data, independent appraisals that may be obtained in connection with the acquisition or financing of the respective property, internal data from previous acquisitions or developments, and other market data. We also consider information obtained about each property as a result of our pre-acquisition due diligence, marketing, and leasing activities in estimating the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets acquired.\nWe record above-market and below-market in-place lease values, if any, for the facilities we own which are based on the present value of the difference between (i) the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the in-place leases and (ii) management's estimate of fair market lease rates for the corresponding in-place leases, measured over a period equal to the remaining non-cancelable term of the lease. We amortize any resulting capitalized above-market lease values as a reduction of rental income over lease term. We amortize any resulting capitalized below-market lease values as an increase to rental income over the lease term. Because our strategy to a large degree involves the origination and acquisition of long-term lease arrangements at market rates with independent parties, we do not expect the above-market and below-market in-place lease values to be significant for many of our transactions.\nWe measure the aggregate value of other lease intangible assets to be acquired based on the difference between (i) the property valued with new or in-place leases adjusted to market rental rates and (ii) the property valued as if vacant when acquired. Management's estimates of value are made using methods similar to those used by independent appraisers (e.g., discounted cash flow analysis). Factors considered by management in our analysis include an estimate of carrying costs during hypothetical expected lease-up periods, considering current market conditions, and costs to execute similar leases. We also consider information obtained about each targeted facility as a result of our pre-acquisition due diligence, marketing, and leasing activities in estimating the fair value of the intangible assets acquired. In estimating carrying costs, management includes real estate taxes, insurance, and other operating expenses and estimates of lost rentals at market rates during the expected lease-up periods, which we expect to be about six months (based on experience) depending on specific local market conditions. Management also estimates costs to execute similar leases including leasing commissions, legal costs, and other related expenses to the extent that such costs are not already incurred in connection with a new lease origination as part of the transaction.\nOther intangible assets acquired may include customer relationship intangible values, which are based on management's evaluation of the specific characteristics of each prospective tenant's lease and our overall relationship with that tenant. Characteristics to be considered by management in allocating these values include the nature and extent of our existing business relationships with the tenant, growth prospects for developing new business with the tenant, the tenant's credit quality, and expectations of lease renewals, including those existing under the terms of the lease agreement, among other factors. At December 31, 2019, we have assigned no value to customer relationship intangibles.\nWe amortize the value of lease intangibles to expense over the term of the respective leases, which have a weighted-average useful life of 23.7 years at December 31, 2019. If a lease is terminated early, the unamortized portion of the lease intangible is charged to expense.\nPrinciples of Consolidation: Property holding entities and other subsidiaries of which we own 100% of the equity or have a controlling financial interest evidenced by ownership of a majority voting interest are consolidated. All inter-company balances and transactions are eliminated. For entities in which we own less than 100% of the equity interest, we consolidate the property if we have the direct or indirect ability to control the entities' activities based upon the terms of the respective entities' ownership agreements. For these entities, we record a non-controlling interest representing equity held by non-controlling interests.\nWe continually evaluate all of our transactions and investments to determine if they represent variable interests in a variable interest entity. If we determine that we have a variable interest in a variable interest entity, we then evaluate if we are the primary beneficiary of the variable interest entity. The evaluation is a qualitative assessment as to whether we have the ability to direct the activities of a variable interest entity that most significantly impact the entity's economic performance. We consolidate each variable interest entity in which we, by virtue of or transactions with our investments in the entity, are considered to be the primary beneficiary. At December 31, 2019 and 2018, we determined that we were not the primary beneficiary of any variable interest entity in which we hold a variable interest because we do not control the activities (such as the day-to-day operations) that most significantly impact the economic performance of these entities.\nDisclosure of Contractual Obligations\nThe following table summarizes known material

In addition, the credit agreement governing our Credit Facility limits the amount of dividends we can pay to 95% of NAFFO, as defined in the agreements, on a rolling four quarter basis. The indentures governing our senior unsecured notes also limit the amount of dividends we can pay based on the sum of 95% of funds from operations, proceeds of equity issuances, and certain other net cash proceeds. Finally, our senior unsecured notes require us to maintain total unencumbered assets (as defined in the related indenture) of not less than 150% of our unsecured indebtedness.\nIn addition to these restrictions, the Credit Facility contains customary financial and operating covenants, including covenants relating to our total leverage ratio, fixed charge coverage ratio, secured leverage ratio, unsecured leverage ratio, consolidated adjusted net worth, and unsecured interest coverage ratio. This facility also contains customary events of default, including among others, nonpayment of principal or interest, material inaccuracy of representations, and failure to comply with our covenants. If an event of default occurs and is continuing under the facility, the entire outstanding balance may become immediately due and payable. At December 31, 2019, we were in compliance with all such financial and operating covenants.\nIn order for us to continue to qualify as a REIT we are required to distribute annual dividends equal to a minimum of 90% of our REIT taxable income, computed without regard to the dividends paid deduction and our net capital gains. See section titled Distribution Policy\u201d within this Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information on our dividend policy along with the historical dividends paid on a per share basis.\nShort-term Liquidity Requirements:\nAs of February 21, 2020, we have no debt principal payments due in 2020 - see debt maturity schedule below. At February 21, 2020 (and after the funding of our \u00a31.5 billion acquisition in January 2020), our availability under our revolving credit facility plus cash on-hand approximated $1.6 billion. We believe this liquidity along with our current monthly cash receipts from rent and loan interest, regular distributions from our joint venture arrangements, and availability under our at-the-market equity program is sufficient to fund our operations, debt and interest obligations, our firm commitments, and dividends in order to comply with REIT requirements for the next twelve months.\nLong-term Liquidity Requirements:\nAs of February 21, 2020, we have no debt principal payments due between now and February 2022 when our term loan, with a current outstanding amount of $200 million, comes due. With our liquidity as of February 21, 2020 of approximately $1.6 billion, along with our current monthly cash receipts from rent and loan interest, regular distributions from our joint venture arrangements, and availability under our at-the-market equity program, we believe such liquidity is sufficient to fund our operations, debt and interest obligations, our firm commitments, and dividends in order to comply with REIT requirements for the foreseeable future.\nHowever, in order to fund additional investments, to fund debt maturities coming due in later years, or to strategically refinance any existing debt (including our Credit Facility coming due in 2022) in order to reduce interest rates, we may need to access one or a combination of the following sources of capital:\nTable 274: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> issuance of new USD, EUR, or GBP denominated debt securities, including senior unsecured notes;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 275: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> sale of equity securities;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 276: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> amending or entering into a new revolving credit facility and/or bank term loans;\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 277: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> placing new secured loans on real estate located outside the U.S.; and/or\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 278: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> proceeds from strategic property sales.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nHowever, there is no assurance that conditions will be favorable for such possible transactions or that our plans will be successful.\nPrincipal payments due on our debt (which exclude the effects of any discounts, premiums, or debt issue costs recorded) as of February 21, 2020 (which includes the new \u00a3700 million term loan to fund the Circle transaction on January 8, 2020) are as follows ($ amounts in thousands):\nTable 279: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 742,350\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 518,560\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,595,240\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Thereafter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,027,670\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 7,883,820\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nResults of Operations\nOur operating results may vary significantly from year-to-year due to a variety of reasons including acquisitions made during the year, incremental revenues and expenses from acquisitions made in the prior year, revenues and expenses from completed development properties, property disposals, annual escalation provisions, foreign currency exchange rate changes, new or amended debt agreements, issuances of shares through an equity offering, impact from accounting changes, etc. Thus, our operating results for the current year are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected in future years.\nYear Ended December 31, 2019 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2018\nNet income for the year ended December 31, 2019, was $374.7 million compared to net income of $1.02 billion for the year ended December 31, 2018. This decrease is primarily due to the approximate $720 million of gains on the sales of real estate recognized in 2018 from the disposal of five properties in the U.S. and the joint venture transaction with Primotop described in Note 3 to Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This decrease is partially offset by approximately $70 million more in revenues from new investments in 2019. FFO, after adjusting for certain items (as more fully described in the section titled Non-GAAP Financial Measures\u201d in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d in Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K), was $557.4 million, or $1.30 per diluted share for 2019, as compared to $501.0 million, or $1.37 per diluted share, for 2018. This increase in FFO dollars is primarily due to incremental revenue from new investments in 2019, while FFO per share is lower due to approximately 145 million of new shares issued to fund new investments in 2019.\nA comparison of revenues for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 is as follows (dollar amounts in thousands):\nTable 280: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Rent billed\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 474,151\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 55.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 473,343\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 60.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Straight-line rent\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 110,456\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 74,741\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 35,715\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income from financing leases\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 119,617\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 14.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 73,983\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 45,634\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest and other income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 149,973\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 17.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 162,455\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 20.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (12,482\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 854,197\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 100.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 784,522\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 100.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 69,675\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur total revenues for 2019 are up $69.7 million or 9% over the prior year.

This increase is primarily related to new debt issuances in 2019 including the \u00a31 billion senior unsecured notes issued in December 2019, the $900 million of senior unsecured notes issued in July 2019, and the AUD $1.2 billion term loan funded in June 2019. In addition, we incurred $6.1 million of bridge loan fees and accelerated commitment fee amortization expense associated with our Australian and GBP term loan facilities in 2019. These increases were partially offset by lower interest in 2019 from the paydown of our revolver, in addition to a reduction in our weighted-average interest rate year-over-year from 4.55% in 2018 to 4.45% in 2019.\nReal estate depreciation and amortization during 2019 increased to $152.3 million from $133.1 million in 2018 due to new investments made in 2018 and 2019 and the conversion of the five Steward mortgage loans to fee simple assets, partially offset by property sales in 2018.\nProperty-related expenses for 2019 increased $14.8 million compared to 2018. As noted above under the caption Other income\u201d, this increase was primarily due to the grossing up of certain expenses (such as ground lease, property taxes, and insurance) as part of our implementation of the lease accounting standard on January 1, 2019.\nGeneral and administrative expenses in 2019 totaled $96.4 million, which is a $16.3 million increase from 2018. The majority of the increase relates to stock compensation expense from our performance-based awards. Given our strong performance in 2019 including a 39% total shareholder return and significant growth from $4.5 billion of new investments, certain performance awards were earned at maximum level, resulting in higher stock compensation expense in 2019.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, we sold five properties resulting in a total gain of $41.6 million. In addition, we made a $21 million adjustment to lower the carrying value of the real estate on certain vacant facilities in 2019- see Note 3 to Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details. In 2018, we sold five properties in the U.S. and 71 properties as part of the joint venture transaction with Primotop resulting in a gain of $719.4 million. In addition, we made a $48 million adjustment to lower the carrying value of the real estate to fair value on seven of our transitioning Adeptus facilities and four of our Alecto facilities in 2018.\nEarnings from equity interests was $16.1 million for 2019, up $1.9 million from 2018 due to our investment in the Primotop joint venture in the third quarter of 2018 and our investment in Infracore made at the end of the second quarter of 2019, partially offset by a lower return year-over-year in our Hoboken investment.\nIncome tax expense typically includes U.S. federal and state income taxes on our TRS entities, as well as non-U.S. income based or withholding taxes on certain investments located in jurisdictions outside the U.S. The $2.6 million income tax benefit for 2019 represents the benefit on losses incurred by our TRS during the year. The benefit is partially offset by tax expense on income generated by our international investments. In comparison, we incurred $0.9 million of income tax expense in 2018 from income generated by our international investments that was partially offset by $4.4 million of valuation allowances released related to U.S. federal and state deferred tax assets of our TRS.\nWe utilize the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Deferred tax assets are recorded to the extent we believe these assets will more likely than not be realized. In making such determination, all available positive and negative evidence is\nconsidered, including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies, and recent financial performance. Based upon our review of all positive and negative evidence, including our three-year cumulative pre-tax book loss position in certain entities, we concluded that a full valuation allowance of $11.4 million should continue to be recorded against certain of our international and domestic net deferred tax assets at December 31, 2019. In the future, if we determine that it is more likely than not that we will realize our net deferred tax assets, we will reverse the applicable portion of the valuation allowance, recognize an income tax benefit in the period in which such determination is made, and incur higher income taxes in future periods as income is earned. For more detailed information, see Note 5 to Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nYear Ended December 31, 2018 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2017\nNet income for the year ended December 31, 2018, was $1.02 billion compared to net income of $289.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. This increase is primarily due to the approximate $720 million of gains on the sales of real estate recognized in 2018 from the disposal of five properties in the U.S. and the joint venture transaction with Primotop described in Note 3 to Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. FFO, after adjusting for certain items (as more fully described in the section titled Non-GAAP Financial Measures\u201d in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d in Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K), was $501.0 million, or $1.37 per diluted share for 2018 as compared to $474.9 million, or $1.35 per diluted share for 2017. This 5.5% increase in FFO dollars is primarily due to the increase in revenue from acquisitions and completed development projects during 2018 and 2017.\nA comparison of revenues for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 is as follows (dollar amounts in thousands):\nTable 287: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Rent billed\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 473,343\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 60.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 435,782\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 61.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 37,561\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Straight-line rent\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 74,741\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 65,468\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9,273\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income from financing leases\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 73,983\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 74,495\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (512\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest and other income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 162,455\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 20.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 129,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 18.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 33,455\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 784,522\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 100.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 704,745\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 100.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 79,777\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur total revenues for 2018 are up $79.8 million or 11.3% over the prior year.

These increases are partially offset by approximately $31.4 million of lower revenue as 71 revenue producing properties were contributed to the joint venture transaction with Primotop on August 31, 2018, along with approximately $16 million of lower revenue and approximately $11.2 million of higher straight-line rent write-offs in 2018 associated with other disposals and loss of revenue from certain properties vacated during 2018 - see Note 3 to Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 289: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td> \u2022\n</td> <td> Income from financing leases - down $0.5 million over the prior year, of which $1.2 million is from net revenue earned in 2017 but not in 2018 on the Boise lease that converted from DFL to operating lease accounting classification upon execution of the new lease with the Vibra/Ernest joint venture and by the write-off of $1.5 million of DFL unbilled interest associated with the same transaction.

These increases are partially offset by $15.7 million of lower interest revenue related to certain Steward loans that were converted to fee simple assets in 2018 and $4.1 million of lower revenue related to the Ernest acquisition loan repayment discussed in Note 3 to Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nInterest expense for 2018 and 2017 totaled $223.3 million and $177.0 million, respectively. Although our debt balance at December 31, 2018 is lower than the prior year with the paydown of our revolver from the proceeds of asset disposals, our average debt balance for 2018 was higher than 2017 due to the issuance of the $1.4 billion bonds in September 2017. Our weighted-average interest rate was 4.6% for 2018, consistent with 4.6% in 2017. See Note 4 in Item 8 to this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information on our debt activities.\nReal estate depreciation and amortization during 2018 was $133.1 million compared to $125.1 million in 2017 primarily due to the incremental depreciation/amortization from the facilities acquired (particularly the Steward and MEDIAN facilities acquired in 2017) and the development properties completed in 2017 and 2018.\nProperty expenses for 2018 increased $3.4 million compared to 2017 primarily due to the growth of our business internationally along with expense from certain properties vacated during 2018. See Note 3 to Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more details, including the successful re-tenanting of many of these facilities.\nGeneral and administrative expenses in 2018 totaled $80.1 million, which is 10.2% of revenues, up from 8.3% of revenues in the prior year. General and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues was higher during 2018 due to our adoption of ASU 2017-01, as more fully explained in Note 2 to Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and the impact on revenues from the joint venture transaction with Primotop on August 31, 2018. Excluding the $6.2 million of higher expense due to the accounting change and adjusting for the revenues included in joint ventures, general and administrative expenses represented 9.0% of adjusted revenues in 2018. On a dollar basis (exclusive of the accounting change impact), general and administrative expenses were up $15.3 million from the prior year due to travel, compensation expenses, and costs associated with expanding our team at our European office, which are all up as a result of the growth and expansion of our company.\nAcquisition costs decreased from $29.6 million in 2017 to $0.9 million in 2018. The acquisition costs in 2017 primarily related to real estate transfer taxes on the MEDIAN acquisition. Beginning in 2018, all third party transaction costs directly related to acquisitions are now capitalized due to the adoption of ASU 2017-01. However, we did incur $0.9 million in the current period related to the settlement of contingencies involving acquisitions that occurred prior to the adoption of ASU 2017-01.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, we sold one acute care property (operated by Steward), three long-term acute care properties (operated by Vibra), 71 inpatient rehabilitation hospitals (operated by MEDIAN) by way of a joint venture arrangement, and one general acute care hospital located in Texas (operated by North Cypress), resulting in a total net gain of $719.4 million. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we sold one LifePoint property resulting in a $7.4 million gain.\nIn 2018, we had a $48 million adjustment to lower the carrying value of the real estate to fair value on seven of our transitioning Adeptus facilities and four of our Alecto facilities - see Note 3 to Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details. We did not have any impairment charges in 2017.\nDuring 2017, we incurred $32.6 million of debt refinancing charges related to the replacement of our credit facility, the payoff of our \u20ac200 million term loan, the payoff of our \u20ac200 million euro bonds, the prepayment of our $350 million senior unsecured notes, and structuring and underwriting fees associated with the termination of the short-term loan commitment we made in anticipation of the Steward transaction in 2017. We did not have any similar charges during the year ended December 31, 2018.\nOther income (including our earnings from equity interests) was $10.1 million in 2018, which was basically flat with 2017.\nWe recognize income tax expense related to our TRS and the local, state, and foreign jurisdictions in which we operate. Income tax expense for 2018 was $0.9 million as compared to $2.7 million for 2017. The decrease in tax expense is primarily due to the release of $4.4 million in valuation allowances previously recorded on our federal and state deferred tax assets at our TRS. The tax benefit from the valuation allowance release was partially offset by increases in income tax expense on earnings from our foreign investments. For more detailed information, see Note 5 to Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nWe consider non-GAAP financial measures to be useful supplemental measures of our operating performance. A non-GAAP financial measure is a measure of financial performance, financial position, or cash flows that excludes or includes amounts that are not so excluded from or included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. Described below are the non-GAAP financial measures used by management to evaluate our operating performance and that we consider most useful to investors, together with reconciliations of these measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures.\nFunds From Operations and Normalized Funds From Operations\nInvestors and analysts following the real estate industry utilize funds from operations, or FFO, as a supplemental performance measure. FFO, reflecting the assumption that real estate asset values rise or fall with market conditions, principally adjusts for the effects of GAAP depreciation and amortization of real estate assets, which assumes that the value of real estate diminishes predictably over time. We compute FFO in accordance with the definition provided by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, or Nareit, which represents net income (loss) (computed in accordance with GAAP), excluding gains (losses) on sales of real estate and impairment charges on real estate assets, plus real estate depreciation and amortization and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures.\nIn addition to presenting FFO in accordance with the Nareit definition, we also disclose normalized FFO, which adjusts FFO for items that relate to unanticipated or non-core events or activities or accounting changes that, if not noted, would make comparison to prior period results and market expectations potentially less meaningful to investors and analysts.\nWe believe that the use of FFO, combined with the required GAAP presentations, improves the understanding of our operating results among investors and the use of normalized FFO makes comparisons of our operating results with prior periods and other companies more meaningful. While FFO and normalized FFO are relevant and widely used supplemental measures of operating and financial performance of REITs, they should not be viewed as a substitute measure of our operating performance since the measures do not reflect either depreciation and amortization costs or the level of capital expenditures and leasing costs necessary to maintain the operating performance of our properties, which can be significant economic costs that could materially impact our results of operations. FFO and normalized FFO should not be considered an alternative to net income (loss) (computed in accordance with GAAP) as indicators of our financial performance or to cash flow from operating activities (computed in accordance with GAAP) as an indicator of our liquidity.\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of net income attributable to MPT common stockholders to FFO and normalized FFO for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, 2017, 2016, and 2015, ($ amounts in thousands except per share data):\nTable 291: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> For the Year

we,\u201d and us\u201d in this management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations refer to Medical Properties Trust, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries, including MPT Operating Partnership, L.P.\nOverview\nWe were incorporated in Maryland on August 27, 2003, primarily for the purpose of investing in and owning net-leased healthcare facilities. We also make real estate mortgage loans and other loans to our tenants. We conduct our business operations in one segment. We currently have healthcare investments in the U.S., Europe and Australia. We have operated as a REIT since April 6, 2004, and accordingly, elected REIT status upon the filing of our calendar year 2004 U.S. federal income tax return. Our existing tenants are, and our prospective tenants will generally be, healthcare operating companies and other healthcare providers that use substantial real estate assets in their operations. We offer financing for these operators' real estate through 100% lease and mortgage financing and generally seek lease and loan terms on a long-term basis ranging from 10 to 15 years with a series of shorter renewal terms at the option of our tenants and borrowers. We also have included and intend to include in our lease and loan agreements annual contractual minimum rate increases. Our existing portfolio's minimum escalators generally range from 0.5% to 3%. In addition, most of our leases and loans also include rate increases based on the general rate of inflation if greater than the minimum contractual increases. Only less than 3% of our properties do not have either a minimum escalator or an escalator based on inflation. Beyond rent or mortgage interest, our leases and loans typically require our tenants to pay all operating costs and expenses associated with the facility. Finally, we may acquire a profits or other equity interest in our tenants that gives us a right to share in the tenant's income or loss.\nWe selectively make loans to certain of our operators through our TRSs, which the operators use for acquisitions and working capital. We consider our lending business an important element of our overall business strategy for two primary reasons: (1) it provides opportunities to make income-earning investments that yield attractive risk-adjusted returns in an industry in which our management has expertise, and (2) by making debt capital available to certain qualified operators, we believe we create for our company a competitive advantage over other buyers of, and financing sources for, healthcare facilities.\nAt December 31, 2019, our portfolio (including real estate assets in joint ventures) consisted of 359 properties leased or loaned to 42 operators, of which four are under development and 11 are in the form of mortgage loans.\n2019 Highlights\nIn 2019, we invested in approximately $4.5 billion in healthcare real estate assets. These significant investments enhanced the size and scale of our healthcare portfolio, while expanding our geographic footprint in the U.S. and Europe, and entering into new territories such as Australia. These investments also extended our lease and loan maturity schedule. To fund these new investments, we raised $2.5 billion in proceeds from equity sales during 2019, received proceeds of $837 million from an Australian term loan facility in June 2019, and completed $900 million and \u00a31 billion senior unsecured notes offerings in July and December 2019, respectively. In addition to the record breaking acquisition year, we generated returns to our shareholders of 39% during 2019, outpacing the returns of several key indexes, as noted in Item 5 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our return included an increase to our dividend to $0.26 per share per quarter in 2019, which is the 5th year in a row for such an increase.\nA summary of our 2019 highlights is as follows:\n \u2022 Acquired real estate assets or commenced development projects totaling more than $4.5 billion, as noted below: \n \u2022 Invested in three acute care hospitals and one IRF for an aggregate investment of approximately $135 million. One of the acute care hospitals is located in Big Spring, Texas and leased to Steward pursuant to the existing master lease agreement. The second facility, located in Poole, England, is leased to BMI Healthcare ( BMI\u201d). The third acute care facility is located in Watsonville, California and is leased to Halsen Healthcare. The IRF is located in Germany and leased to affiliates of Median Kliniken S.\u00e0 r.l. ( MEDIAN\u201d); \n \u2022 Invested in a portfolio of 13 acute care campuses and two additional properties in Switzerland for a combined purchase price of approximately CHF 236.6 million, effected through our purchase of a 46% stake in a Swiss healthcare real estate company, Infracore SA. These facilities are leased to Swiss Medical Network. Additionally, we purchased a 4.9% stake in Aevis Victoria SA, previous majority shareholder of Infracore, for CHF 47 million; \n \u2022 Acquired 11 hospitals in Australia for a purchase price of approximately AUD $1.2 billion plus stamp duties and registration fees of AUD $66.6 million. These facilities are leased to Healthscope; \n \u2022 Acquired seven community hospitals in Kansas for approximately $145.4 million. These facilities are leased to Saint Luke's Health System; \n \u2022 Acquired 14 acute care hospitals and two behavioral health facilities for a combined purchase price of approximately $1.55 billion. These facilities are leased to Prospect; \n \u2022 Acquired eight private hospitals located throughout England for an aggregate purchase price of \u00a3347 million. These facilities are leased to Ramsay Health Care; \n \u2022 Acquired 10 post-acute facilities in various states throughout the U.S. for approximately $268 million. These facilities are leased to Vibra; \n \u2022 Commenced the development of a behavioral hospital in Houston, Texas for $27.5 million. This facility will be leased to NeuroPsychiatric Hospitals upon completion in the fourth quarter of 2020; \n \u2022 Acquired an acute care hospital in Portugal for approximately \u20ac28.2 million. This facility is leased to Jose de Mello; \n \u2022 Acquired two acute care hospitals in Spain for \u20ac117.3 million, effected through our purchase of a 45% interest in a joint venture. These facilities are leased to HM Hospitales; and \n \u2022 Acquired 10 acute care hospitals in six U.S. states for approximately $700.0 million leased to LifePoint. \nWith these new investments, we expanded our total assets to $14.5 billion, increased the number of properties in our portfolio to 359, increased our total operators to 42, expanded our geographic footprint in the U.S. to 34 states, and entered the Australian market.\n \u2022 To help fund these investments, we used cash on-hand and generated proceeds through equity offerings, utilization of our at-the-market equity program, through new issuances of unsecured notes, and from sales of real estate. Details of such activities are as follows: \n \u2022 Sold 36.1 million shares under our at-the-market equity program, generating proceeds of approximately $650 million; \n \u2022 Received proceeds from an Australian term facility of approximately $837 million in June 2019 and fixed the interest rate to approximately 2.45% in July 2019 using an interest rate swap; \n \u2022 Completed an underwritten public offering of 51.75 million shares of our common stock in July 2019, resulting in net proceeds of approximately $860 million; after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses; \n \u2022 Completed a $900 million senior unsecured notes offering in July 2019 with a rate of 4.625%; \n \u2022 Completed an underwritten public offering of 57.5 million shares of our common stock in November 2019, resulting in net proceeds of $1.026 billion, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses; \n \u2022 Completed a \u00a3400 million and \u00a3600 million unsecured notes offering in December 2019 with a rate of 2.550% and 3.692%, respectively; and \n \u2022 Sold five properties in 2019 generating net proceeds of $97 million and a gain of $41.6 million. \nSubsequent to year-end, we acquired 30 acute care hospital facilities located throughout the United Kingdom for a purchase price of \u00a31.5 billion. These facilities will ultimately be leased to Circle as they acquired the hospital operations from BMI in a related transaction. This acquisition was funded using proceeds from the December 2019 Sterling bond offering along with proceeds from a \u00a3700 million term loan entered into in January 2020.\n2018 Highlights\nIn 2018, we demonstrated the value of our portfolio through strategic property sales that generated gains exceeding $700 million and cash proceeds of approximately $2 billion. In addition, we generated strong returns to our shareholders of 25% during 2018. Our return included an increase in our quarterly dividend to $0.25 per share in 2018. Finally, we improved our liquidity position and leverage metrics during 2018.\nA summary of our 2018 highlights is as follows:\n \u2022 Sold the real estate of 76 properties (71 of which are leased to MEDIAN and were contributed to a joint venture arrangement) and sold our equity interest in Ernest Health, Inc. ( Ernest\u201d) (along with the repayment of all outstanding loans and accrued interest) for a net gain of approximately $720 million, as noted below: \n \u2022 Sold two acute care hospitals in Houston, Texas for a net gain of approximately $100 million; \n \u2022 Sold three long-term acute care hospitals located in California, Texas, and Oregon, for $53 million of cash and resulting in a net gain of $19.1 million; \n \u2022 Sold 71 properties located in Germany for a net gain of approximately \u20ac500 million by way of a joint venture arrangement, for which we own a 50% interest; and \n \u2022 Sold our investment in the operations of Ernest and were repaid outstanding loans and accrued interest generating over $176 million in cash. \n \u2022 Acquired the following real estate assets: \n \u2022 Acquired three inpatient rehabilitation hospitals in Germany for a combined purchase price of \u20ac17.3 million. These facilities are leased to MEDIAN; \n \u2022 Acquired five acute care hospitals from Steward in exchange for the reduction of $764 million in mortgage loans plus cash, which further increased the strength of our portfolio; and \n \u2022 Acquired an acute care hospital in Pasco, Washington for $17.5 million. This facility is leased to LifePoint. \n \u2022 After completing our strategic dispositions, we repaid over $800 million in outstanding revolver debt, resulting in approximately $1.3 billion in available liquidity from the revolving credit facility at December 31, 2018. \n \u2022 Sold 5.6 million shares under our at-the-market equity program, generating proceeds of approximately $95 million. \n \u2022 Successfully re-tenanted nine of the 16 Adeptus transition properties and our Florence facility. \n2017 Highlights\nIn 2017, we invested or committed to invest approximately $2.2 billion in healthcare real estate assets. These significant investments enhanced the size and scale of our healthcare portfolio, while expanding our geographic footprint in the U.S. and extending our lease and mortgage loan maturity schedule. Furthermore, we strategically sold an asset for proceeds totaling $64 million, raised $548 million in proceeds from a successful equity offering, and refinanced approximately $0.6 billion of debt, which strengthened our balance sheet, reduced interest rates, and funded acquisitions. Finally, we increased our dividend to $0.24 per share per quarter in 2017.\nA summary of our 2017 highlights is as follows:\n \u2022 Acquired real estate assets, entered into development agreements, entered into leases, and made new loan investments, totaling more than $2.2 billion as noted below: \n \u2022 Acquired 17 inpatient rehabilitation hospitals and one acute care hospital in Germany for a combined purchase price of \u20ac274 million. These facilities are leased to MEDIAN or its affiliates; \n \u2022 Acquired 15 acute care hospitals, one rehabilitation hospital, and one behavioral health facility, completed mortgage financing on two acute care hospitals, and invested in an additional minority equity contribution in Steward for an aggregate investment of $1.8 billion; \n \u2022 Acquired an acute care hospital in Lewiston, Idaho for $87.5 million. This facility is leased to LifePoint; and \n \u2022 Executed agreements totaling more than $150 million with Circle and Surgery Partners, Inc. to develop acute care hospitals in Birmingham, England and Idaho Falls, Idaho, respectively. \nWith these new investments, we expanded our gross assets to $9.5 billion, increased the total number of properties in our portfolio to 275, and increased our total number of beds to more than 32 thousand, as of December 31, 2017.\n \u2022 Sold the real estate of an acute care facility in Muskogee, Oklahoma, for a net gain of $7.4 million. \n \u2022 To fund our over $2.2 billion of asset investments, while lowering our average interest cost, we successfully refinanced approximately $0.6 billion of debt and generated proceeds of approximately $2.5 billion from the sale of 43.1 million shares in an equity offering and through new issuances of unsecured notes. Details of such activities are as follows: \n \u2022 Replaced our previous unsecured credit facility with a $1.3 billion unsecured revolving loan facility, a $200 million unsecured term loan facility, and a \u20ac200 million unsecured term loan facility; \n \u2022 Redeemed our 5.750% Senior Unsecured Notes due 2020 using proceeds from our \u20ac200 million term loan and cash on hand; \n \u2022 Completed a \u20ac500 million senior unsecured notes offering in March 2017 and used a portion of the proceeds to pay off our \u20ac200 million term loan; \n \u2022 Completed a $1.4 billion senior unsecured notes offering in September 2017 at a rate of 5.000% and used a portion of the proceeds to redeem our 6.375% Senior Unsecured Notes due 2022; \n \u2022 Prepaid the principal amount of the mortgage loan on our property in Kansas City, Missouri at par in the amount of $12.9 million; and \n \u2022 Completed an underwritten public offering of 43.1 million shares of our common stock, resulting in net proceeds of $548 million, after deducting offering expenses. \nCritical Accounting Policies\nIn order to prepare financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP\u201d) in the U.S., we must make estimates about certain types of transactions and account balances. We believe that our estimates of the amount and timing of credit losses, fair value adjustments (either as part of a purchase price allocation or impairment analyses), and periodic depreciation of our real estate assets, along with our assessment as to whether an entity that we do business with should be consolidated with our results, have significant effects on our financial statements. Each of these items involves estimates that require us to make subjective judgments. We rely on our experience, collect historical and current market data, and develop relevant assumptions to arrive at what we believe to be reasonable estimates. Under different conditions or assumptions, materially different amounts could be reported related to the critical accounting policies described below. In addition, application of these critical accounting policies involves the exercise of judgment on the use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and, as a result, actual results could materially differ from these estimates. See Note 2 to Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information regarding our accounting policies and recent accounting developments. Our accounting estimates include the following:\nCredit Losses:\nLosses from Rent Receivables: For all leases, we continuously monitor the performance of our existing tenants including, but not limited to: admission levels and surgery/procedure volumes by type; current operating margins; ratio of our tenants' operating margins both to facility rent and to facility rent plus other fixed costs; trends in revenue, cash collections, patient mix; and the effect of evolving healthcare regulations on tenants' profitability and liquidity.\nLosses from Operating Lease Receivables: We utilize the information above along with the tenants' payment and default history in evaluating (on a property-by-property basis) whether or not a provision for losses on outstanding billed rent and/or straight-line rent receivables is needed. A provision for losses on rent receivables (including straight-line rent receivables) is ultimately recorded when it becomes probable that the receivable will not be collected in full. The provision is an amount which reduces the receivable to its estimated net realizable value based on a determination of the eventual amounts to be collected either from the debtor or from existing collateral, if any.\nLosses on Financing Lease Receivables: Allowances are established for financing lease receivables based upon an estimate of probable losses on a property-by-property basis. Such receivables are impaired when it is deemed probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due in accordance with the contractual terms of the lease. Like operating lease receivables, the need for an allowance is based upon our assessment of the lessee's overall financial condition; economic resources and payment record; the prospects for support from any financially responsible guarantors; and, if appropriate, the realizable value of any collateral. These estimates consider all available evidence including the expected future cash flows discounted at the effective interest rate of the financing lease, fair value of collateral, and other relevant factors, as appropriate. Financing leases are placed on non-accrual status when we determine that the collectability of contractual amounts is not reasonably assured. If on non-accrual status, we generally account for the financing lease on a cash basis, in which income is recognized only upon receipt of cash.\nLoans: Loans consist of mortgage loans, working capital loans, and other long-term loans. Mortgage loans are collateralized by interests in real property. Working capital and other long-term loans are generally collateralized by interests in receivables and corporate and individual guarantees. We record loans at cost. We evaluate the collectability of both interest and principal on a loan-by-loan basis (using the same process as we do for assessing the collectability of rents as discussed above) to determine whether they are impaired. A loan is considered impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the existing contractual terms. When a loan is considered to be impaired, the amount of the allowance is calculated by comparing the recorded investment to either the value determined by discounting the expected future cash flows using the loan's effective interest rate or to the fair value of the collateral, if the loan is collateral dependent.\nInvestments in Real Estate: We maintain our investments in real estate at cost, and we capitalize improvements and replacements when they extend the useful life or improve the efficiency of the asset. While our tenants are generally responsible for all operating costs at a facility, to the extent that we incur costs of repairs and maintenance, we expense those costs as incurred. We compute depreciation using the straight-line method over the weighted-average useful life of approximately 39.0 years for buildings and improvements.\nWhen circumstances indicate a possible impairment of the value of our real estate investments, we review the recoverability of the facility's carrying value. The review of the recoverability is generally based on our estimate of the future undiscounted cash flows\nfrom the facility's use and eventual disposition. Our forecast of these cash flows considers factors such as expected future operating income, market and other applicable trends, and residual value, as well as the effects of leasing demand, competition, and other factors. If impairment exists due to the inability to recover the carrying value of a facility on an undiscounted basis, an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of the facility. We do not believe that the value of any of our facilities was impaired at December 31, 2019; however, given the highly specialized aspects of our properties no assurance can be given that future impairment charges will not be taken.\nAcquired Real Estate Purchase Price Allocation: For properties acquired for leasing purpose, we currently account for such acquisition based on asset acquisition accounting rules. Under this accounting method, we allocate the purchase price of acquired properties to net tangible and identified intangible assets acquired based on their fair values. In making estimates of fair value for purposes of allocating purchase prices of acquired real estate, we may utilize a number of sources, including available real estate broker data, independent appraisals that may be obtained in connection with the acquisition or financing of the respective property, internal data from previous acquisitions or developments, and other market data. We also consider information obtained about each property as a result of our pre-acquisition due diligence, marketing, and leasing activities in estimating the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets acquired.\nWe record above-market and below-market in-place lease values, if any, for the facilities we own which are based on the present value of the difference between (i) the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the in-place leases and (ii) management's estimate of fair market lease rates for the corresponding in-place leases, measured over a period equal to the remaining non-cancelable term of the lease. We amortize any resulting capitalized above-market lease values as a reduction of rental income over lease term. We amortize any resulting capitalized below-market lease values as an increase to rental income over the lease term. Because our strategy to a large degree involves the origination and acquisition of long-term lease arrangements at market rates with independent parties, we do not expect the above-market and below-market in-place lease values to be significant for many of our transactions.\nWe measure the aggregate value of other lease intangible assets to be acquired based on the difference between (i) the property valued with new or in-place leases adjusted to market rental rates and (ii) the property valued as if vacant when acquired. Management's estimates of value are made using methods similar to those used by independent appraisers (e.g., discounted cash flow analysis). Factors considered by management in our analysis include an estimate of carrying costs during hypothetical expected lease-up periods, considering current market conditions, and costs to execute similar leases. We also consider information obtained about each targeted facility as a result of our pre-acquisition due diligence, marketing, and leasing activities in estimating the fair value of the intangible assets acquired. In estimating carrying costs, management includes real estate taxes, insurance, and other operating expenses and estimates of lost rentals at market rates during the expected lease-up periods, which we expect to be about six months (based on experience) depending on specific local market conditions. Management also estimates costs to execute similar leases including leasing commissions, legal costs, and other related expenses to the extent that such costs are not already incurred in connection with a new lease origination as part of the transaction.\nOther intangible assets acquired may include customer relationship intangible values, which are based on management's evaluation of the specific characteristics of each prospective tenant's lease and our overall relationship with that tenant. Characteristics to be considered by management in allocating these values include the nature and extent of our existing business relationships with the tenant, growth prospects for developing new business with the tenant, the tenant's credit quality, and expectations of lease renewals, including those existing under the terms of the lease agreement, among other factors. At December 31, 2019, we have assigned no value to customer relationship intangibles.\nWe amortize the value of lease intangibles to expense over the term of the respective leases, which have a weighted-average useful life of 23.7 years at December 31, 2019. If a lease is terminated early, the unamortized portion of the lease intangible is charged to expense.\nPrinciples of Consolidation: Property holding entities and other subsidiaries of which we own 100% of the equity or have a controlling financial interest evidenced by ownership of a majority voting interest are consolidated. All inter-company balances and transactions are eliminated. For entities in which we own less than 100% of the equity interest, we consolidate the property if we have the direct or indirect ability to control the entities' activities based upon the terms of the respective entities' ownership agreements. For these entities, we record a non-controlling interest representing equity held by non-controlling interests.\nWe continually evaluate all of our transactions and investments to determine if they represent variable interests in a variable interest entity. If we determine that we have a variable interest in a variable interest entity, we then evaluate if we are the primary beneficiary of the variable interest entity. The evaluation is a qualitative assessment as to whether we have the ability to direct the activities of a variable interest entity that most significantly impact the entity's economic performance. We consolidate each variable interest entity in which we, by virtue of or transactions with our investments in the entity, are considered to be the primary beneficiary. At December 31, 2019 and 2018, we determined that we were not the primary beneficiary of any variable interest entity in which we hold a variable interest because we do not control the activities (such as the day-to-day operations) that most significantly impact the economic performance of these entities.\nDisclosure of Contractual Obligations\nThe following table summarizes known material contractual obligations (including interest) as of December 31, 2019, excluding the impact of subsequent events (amounts in thousands):\n\n (1) Our 4.000% Senior Unsecured Notes due 2022 and 3.325% Senior Unsecured Notes due 2025 are euro-denominated. Our 2.550% Senior Unsecured Notes due 2023 and 3.692% Senior Unsecured Notes due 2028 are British pound-denominated. We used the exchange rate at December 31, 2019 (1.1213 for euros and 1.3257 for British pounds) in preparing this table. \n (2) As of December 31, 2019, we have a $1.3 billion revolving credit facility. This table assumes the balance outstanding under the revolver and rate in effect at December 31, 2019 (which was $0 million as of December 31, 2019) remains in effect through maturity. \n (3) This note is Australian dollar-denominated and reflects the exchange rate of 0.7021 at December 31, 2019. \n (4) Most of our contractual obligations to make operating lease payments are related to ground leases for which we are reimbursed by our tenants along with corporate office and equipment leases. \n (5) Includes approximately $41.7 million of future expenditures related to development projects, a \u00a31.5 billion commitment to acquire 30 Circle facilities post December 31, 2019, and future expenditures on commenced capital improvement projects. We have excluded from the table above $16.8 million of capital expenditure commitments in our leases that we are not definitive on the amount, timing, and certainty of funding. However, payment on any of these commitments, if made, would be added to the lease base upon which the lessee will pay us rents. \nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe own interests in certain unconsolidated joint ventures as described under Note 3 to Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Except in limited circumstances, our risk of loss is limited to our investment in the joint venture and any outstanding receivables. We have no other material off-balance sheet arrangements that we expect would materially affect our liquidity and capital resources, except those described above under Disclosure of Contractual Obligations\u201d.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n2019 Cash Flow Activity\nWe generated cash of $494.1 million from operating activities during 2019, primarily consisting of rent and interest from mortgage and other loans. We used these operating cash flows along with cash on-hand to fund our dividends of $412 million and certain investing activities including the additional funding of our development activities.\nIn regards to other investing and financing activities in 2019, we did the following:\n a) Purchased $4.5 billion in real estate assets representing over 80 facilities across seven countries; \n b) Funded approximately $377.0 million of development, capital addition, and other projects; \n c) In 2019, we sold 36.1 million shares of common stock under our at-the-market equity offering program, resulting in net proceeds of approximately $650 million; \n d) On June 3, 2019, we received proceeds from an Australian term loan facility of approximately $837 million to help fund the Healthscope acquisition; \n e) On July 18, 2019, we completed an underwritten public offering of 51.75 million shares, resulting in net proceeds of $858 million; \n f) On July 26, 2019, we completed a $900 million senior unsecured notes offering resulting in net proceeds of approximately $885 million; \n g) In 2019, we sold five facilities generating net proceeds of $97 million and a gain of $41.6 million; \n h) On November 8, 2019, we completed an underwritten public offering of 57.5 million shares of our common stock, resulting in net proceeds of $1.026 billion; \n i) On December 5, 2019, we completed a \u00a3400 million and \u00a3600 million unsecured notes offering resulting in net proceeds of approximately \u00a3993 million, of which \u00a3367 million was used to pay down our balance on the revolving credit facility; and \n j) On December 27, 2019, we established a new at-the-market equity program, giving us the ability to sell up to $1.0 billion of stock. \nAs noted previously, we acquired 30 acute care hospital facilities located in the United Kingdom for \u00a31.5 billion on January 8, 2020. This acquisition was funded using proceeds from the December 2019 Sterling bond offering along with proceeds from a \u00a3700 million term loan entered into in January 2020.\n2018 Cash Flow Activity\nWe generated cash of $449.1 million from operating activities during 2018, primarily consisting of rent and interest from mortgage and other loans. We used these operating cash flows along with cash on-hand to fund our dividends of $364 million and certain investing activities including the additional funding of our development activities.\nIn regards to other investing and financing activities in 2018, we did the following:\n a) In 2018, we generated more than $2 billion of cash proceeds from the joint venture transaction with Primotop (which included the disposal of 71 inpatient rehabilitation hospitals in Germany and issuance of secured debt) and the sale of five other acute care and long-term acute care properties. Approximately $580 million was reinvested in the joint venture with Primotop in the form of an equity interest and shareholder loan; \n b) On August 31, 2018, we funded the acquisition of one property in Pasco, Washington for $17.5 million; \n c) On August 28, 2018, we funded the acquisition of three properties in Germany for \u20ac17.3 million; \n d) Originated $212 million in mortgage and other loans; \n e) Funded less than $200 million for development and capital improvement projects; \n f) Acquired five facilities operated by Steward by converting the $764.4 million in mortgage loans on the same properties plus cash consideration; \n g) We used the net cash received from property disposals to reduce our revolver by approximately $810 million; \n h) On October 4, 2018, we finalized our recapitalization agreement with Ernest generating $176.3 million (which included the sale of our equity investment in Ernest and repayment in full of non-mortgage loans outstanding plus accrued interest); and \n i) In the fourth quarter of 2018, we sold 5.6 million shares of common stock under our at-the-market equity program generating approximately $95 million. \n2017 Cash Flow Activity\nWe generated cash of $362 million from operating activities during 2017, primarily consisting of rent and interest from mortgage and other loans. We used these operating cash flows along with cash on-hand to fund our dividends of $326.7 million and certain investing activities including the additional funding of our development activities.\nIn regards to other investing and financing activities in 2017, we did the following:\n a) On February 1, 2017, we replaced our previous unsecured credit facility with a new credit facility ( Credit Facility\u201d) resulting in a $50 million reduction in our U.S. dollar term loan and a new \u20ac200 million unsecured term loan facility (which was paid off on March 30, 2017). \n b) On March 4, 2017, we redeemed our \u20ac200 million aggregate principal amount of our 5.750% Senior Unsecured Notes due 2020. We funded this redemption, including the premium and accrued interest, with proceeds from the new \u20ac200 million term loan together with cash on hand. \n c) On March 24, 2017, we completed a senior unsecured notes offering for \u20ac500 million. We used the net proceeds from this offering to prepay and extinguish the new \u20ac200 million term loan with the remainder of the proceeds used to acquire 12 facilities leased to MEDIAN for \u20ac146.4 million. \n d) On March 31, 2017, we sold the EASTAR Health System real estate located in Muskogee, Oklahoma, which was leased to LifePoint. Total proceeds from this transaction were approximately $64 million resulting in a gain of $7.4 million. \n e) On May 1, 2017, we completed an underwritten public offering of approximately 43.1 million shares of our common stock, resulting in net proceeds of approximately $548 million. We used a portion of these proceeds to acquire eight facilities for $301.3 million (leased to Steward), a facility in Idaho for $87.5 million (leased to LifePoint) and two other facilities for $40 million (leased to Alecto Healthcare Services LLC ( Alecto\u201d)). \n f) On September 7, 2017, we completed a senior unsecured notes offering for $1.4 billion. We used a portion of the net proceeds from the 5.000% Senior Unsecured Notes due 2027 offering to redeem the $350 million aggregate principal amount of our 6.375% Senior Unsecured Notes due 2022, plus a redemption premium, on October 7, 2017. The remaining proceeds, plus borrowings on our revolving credit facility, were used to acquire nine facilities and ancillary properties leased to Steward for $700 million, to make mortgage loans on two properties for $700 million, and to make a $100 million equity investment in Steward. \n g) On September 29, 2017, we prepaid the principal amount of the mortgage loan on our property in Kansas City, Missouri at par in the amount of $12.9 million. To fund such prepayment, including accrued and unpaid interest thereon, we used borrowings from the revolving credit facility. \nDebt Restrictions and REIT Requirements\nOur debt facilities impose certain restrictions on us, including, but not limited to, restrictions on our ability to: incur debt; create or incur liens; provide guarantees in respect of obligations of any other entity; make redemptions and repurchases of our capital stock; prepay, redeem, or repurchase debt; engage in mergers or consolidations; enter into affiliated transactions; dispose of real estate or other assets; and change our business. In addition, the credit agreement governing our Credit Facility limits the amount of dividends we can pay to 95% of NAFFO, as defined in the agreements, on a rolling four quarter basis. The indentures governing our senior unsecured notes also limit the amount of dividends we can pay based on the sum of 95% of funds from operations, proceeds of equity issuances, and certain other net cash proceeds. Finally, our senior unsecured notes require us to maintain total unencumbered assets (as defined in the related indenture) of not less than 150% of our unsecured indebtedness.\nIn addition to these restrictions, the Credit Facility contains customary financial and operating covenants, including covenants relating to our total leverage ratio, fixed charge coverage ratio, secured leverage ratio, unsecured leverage ratio, consolidated adjusted net worth, and unsecured interest coverage ratio. This facility also contains customary events of default, including among others, nonpayment of principal or interest, material inaccuracy of representations, and failure to comply with our covenants. If an event of default occurs and is continuing under the facility, the entire outstanding balance may become immediately due and payable. At December 31, 2019, we were in compliance with all such financial and operating covenants.\nIn order for us to continue to qualify as a REIT we are required to distribute annual dividends equal to a minimum of 90% of our REIT taxable income, computed without regard to the dividends paid deduction and our net capital gains. See section titled Distribution Policy\u201d within this Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information on our dividend policy along with the historical dividends paid on a per share basis.\nShort-term Liquidity Requirements:\nAs of February 21, 2020, we have no debt principal payments due in 2020 - see debt maturity schedule below. At February 21, 2020 (and after the funding of our \u00a31.5 billion acquisition in January 2020), our availability under our revolving credit facility plus cash on-hand approximated $1.6 billion. We believe this liquidity along with our current monthly cash receipts from rent and loan interest, regular distributions from our joint venture arrangements, and availability under our at-the-market equity program is sufficient to fund our operations, debt and interest obligations, our firm commitments, and dividends in order to comply with REIT requirements for the next twelve months.\nLong-term Liquidity Requirements:\nAs of February 21, 2020, we have no debt principal payments due between now and February 2022 when our term loan, with a current outstanding amount of $200 million, comes due. With our liquidity as of February 21, 2020 of approximately $1.6 billion, along with our current monthly cash receipts from rent and loan interest, regular distributions from our joint venture arrangements, and availability under our at-the-market equity program, we believe such liquidity is sufficient to fund our operations, debt and interest obligations, our firm commitments, and dividends in order to comply with REIT requirements for the foreseeable future.\nHowever, in order to fund additional investments, to fund debt maturities coming due in later years, or to strategically refinance any existing debt (including our Credit Facility coming due in 2022) in order to reduce interest rates, we may need to access one or a combination of the following sources of capital:\n \u2022 issuance of new USD, EUR, or GBP denominated debt securities, including senior unsecured notes; \n \u2022 sale of equity securities; \n \u2022 amending or entering into a new revolving credit facility and/or bank term loans; \n \u2022 placing new secured loans on real estate located outside the U.S.; and/or \n \u2022 proceeds from strategic property sales. \nHowever, there is no assurance that conditions will be favorable for such possible transactions or that our plans will be successful.\nPrincipal payments due on our debt (which exclude the effects of any discounts, premiums, or debt issue costs recorded) as of February 21, 2020 (which includes the new \u00a3700 million term loan to fund the Circle transaction on January 8, 2020) are as follows ($ amounts in thousands):\n\nResults of Operations\nOur operating results may vary significantly from year-to-year due to a variety of reasons including acquisitions made during the year, incremental revenues and expenses from acquisitions made in the prior year, revenues and expenses from completed development properties, property disposals, annual escalation provisions, foreign currency exchange rate changes, new or amended debt agreements, issuances of shares through an equity offering, impact from accounting changes, etc. Thus, our operating results for the current year are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected in future years.\nYear Ended December 31, 2019 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2018\nNet income for the year ended December 31, 2019, was $374.7 million compared to net income of $1.02 billion for the year ended December 31, 2018. This decrease is primarily due to the approximate $720 million of gains on the sales of real estate recognized in 2018 from the disposal of five properties in the U.S. and the joint venture transaction with Primotop described in Note 3 to Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This decrease is partially offset by approximately $70 million more in revenues from new investments in 2019. FFO, after adjusting for certain items (as more fully described in the section titled Non-GAAP Financial Measures\u201d in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d in Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K), was $557.4 million, or $1.30 per diluted share for 2019, as compared to $501.0 million, or $1.37 per diluted share, for 2018. This increase in FFO dollars is primarily due to incremental revenue from new investments in 2019, while FFO per share is lower due to approximately 145 million of new shares issued to fund new investments in 2019.\nA comparison of revenues for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 is as follows (dollar amounts in thousands):\n\nOur total revenues for 2019 are up $69.7 million or 9% over the prior year. This increase is made up of the following:\n \u2022 Operating lease revenue (including rent billed and straight-line rent) - up $36.5 million over the prior year of which $54.8 million of additional lease revenue is related to the conversion of five Steward mortgage loans to fee simple assets \n in 2018, and approximately $68.7 million of incremental revenue from acquisitions ($30.0 million of which relates to Healthscope). This increase is partially offset by a net $82.8 million of lower revenues due to property dispositions in 2018 (majority of which relates to the formation of the Primotop joint venture in the 2018 third quarter) and approximately $5.7 million from unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations. \n \u2022 Income from financing leases - up $45.6 million over the prior year due to $50 million of revenue from the Prospect acquisition in the 2019 third quarter, partially offset by approximately $5 million loss of revenue on two Alecto properties that closed during 2019. See Note 3 to Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more details. \n \u2022 Interest and other income - down $12.5 million from the prior year due to the following: \n \u2022 Interest from loans - down $26.2 million over the prior year of which $35.6 million is the result of lower interest revenue related to Steward mortgage loans converted to fee simple assets in 2018 and $13.3 million is from the payoff of our Ernest acquisition and other loans in the fourth quarter of 2018. This decrease is partially offset by $18.6 million of incremental interest revenue earned on loan investments, including $10.9 million from the Primotop joint venture shareholder loan made in August 2018 and $4.4 million related to Prospect loans made in 2019. \n \u2022 Other income - up $13.7 million due to the implementation of the lease accounting standard on January 1, 2019, whereby we are now reflecting certain payments made by our tenants, including ground lease payments and reimbursements of property taxes and insurance, as revenue. This revenue is offset by a corresponding expense in the Property-related\u201d line on the consolidated statements of net income. \nInterest expense for 2019 and 2018 totaled $237.8 million and $223.3 million, respectively. This increase is primarily related to new debt issuances in 2019 including the \u00a31 billion senior unsecured notes issued in December 2019, the $900 million of senior unsecured notes issued in July 2019, and the AUD $1.2 billion term loan funded in June 2019. In addition, we incurred $6.1 million of bridge loan fees and accelerated commitment fee amortization expense associated with our Australian and GBP term loan facilities in 2019. These increases were partially offset by lower interest in 2019 from the paydown of our revolver, in addition to a reduction in our weighted-average interest rate year-over-year from 4.55% in 2018 to 4.45% in 2019.\nReal estate depreciation and amortization during 2019 increased to $152.3 million from $133.1 million in 2018 due to new investments made in 2018 and 2019 and the conversion of the five Steward mortgage loans to fee simple assets, partially offset by property sales in 2018.\nProperty-related expenses for 2019 increased $14.8 million compared to 2018. As noted above under the caption Other income\u201d, this increase was primarily due to the grossing up of certain expenses (such as ground lease, property taxes, and insurance) as part of our implementation of the lease accounting standard on January 1, 2019.\nGeneral and administrative expenses in 2019 totaled $96.4 million, which is a $16.3 million increase from 2018. The majority of the increase relates to stock compensation expense from our performance-based awards. Given our strong performance in 2019 including a 39% total shareholder return and significant growth from $4.5 billion of new investments, certain performance awards were earned at maximum level, resulting in higher stock compensation expense in 2019.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, we sold five properties resulting in a total gain of $41.6 million. In addition, we made a $21 million adjustment to lower the carrying value of the real estate on certain vacant facilities in 2019- see Note 3 to Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details. In 2018, we sold five properties in the U.S. and 71 properties as part of the joint venture transaction with Primotop resulting in a gain of $719.4 million. In addition, we made a $48 million adjustment to lower the carrying value of the real estate to fair value on seven of our transitioning Adeptus facilities and four of our Alecto facilities in 2018.\nEarnings from equity interests was $16.1 million for 2019, up $1.9 million from 2018 due to our investment in the Primotop joint venture in the third quarter of 2018 and our investment in Infracore made at the end of the second quarter of 2019, partially offset by a lower return year-over-year in our Hoboken investment.\nIncome tax expense typically includes U.S. federal and state income taxes on our TRS entities, as well as non-U.S. income based or withholding taxes on certain investments located in jurisdictions outside the U.S. The $2.6 million income tax benefit for 2019 represents the benefit on losses incurred by our TRS during the year. The benefit is partially offset by tax expense on income generated by our international investments. In comparison, we incurred $0.9 million of income tax expense in 2018 from income generated by our international investments that was partially offset by $4.4 million of valuation allowances released related to U.S. federal and state deferred tax assets of our TRS.\nWe utilize the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Deferred tax assets are recorded to the extent we believe these assets will more likely than not be realized. In making such determination, all available positive and negative evidence is\nconsidered, including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies, and recent financial performance. Based upon our review of all positive and negative evidence, including our three-year cumulative pre-tax book loss position in certain entities, we concluded that a full valuation allowance of $11.4 million should continue to be recorded against certain of our international and domestic net deferred tax assets at December 31, 2019. In the future, if we determine that it is more likely than not that we will realize our net deferred tax assets, we will reverse the applicable portion of the valuation allowance, recognize an income tax benefit in the period in which such determination is made, and incur higher income taxes in future periods as income is earned. For more detailed information, see Note 5 to Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nYear Ended December 31, 2018 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2017\nNet income for the year ended December 31, 2018, was $1.02 billion compared to net income of $289.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. This increase is primarily due to the approximate $720 million of gains on the sales of real estate recognized in 2018 from the disposal of five properties in the U.S. and the joint venture transaction with Primotop described in Note 3 to Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. FFO, after adjusting for certain items (as more fully described in the section titled Non-GAAP Financial Measures\u201d in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d in Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K), was $501.0 million, or $1.37 per diluted share for 2018 as compared to $474.9 million, or $1.35 per diluted share for 2017. This 5.5% increase in FFO dollars is primarily due to the increase in revenue from acquisitions and completed development projects during 2018 and 2017.\nA comparison of revenues for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 is as follows (dollar amounts in thousands):\n\nOur total revenues for 2018 are up $79.8 million or 11.3% over the prior year. This increase is made up of the following:\n \u2022 Operating lease revenue (including rent billed and straight-line rent) - up $46.8 million over the prior year of which $60 million is incremental revenue from acquisitions primarily due to the Steward and MEDIAN acquisitions in 2017 and 2018, $24.6 million is from rent recorded on the new Steward leases that converted from mortgage loans in 2018, $11 million is incremental revenue from capital additions, $3.7 million is incremental revenue from development properties that were placed in service, and approximately $5.8 million is from favorable foreign currency fluctuations. These increases are partially offset by approximately $31.4 million of lower revenue as 71 revenue producing properties were contributed to the joint venture transaction with Primotop on August 31, 2018, along with approximately $16 million of lower revenue and approximately $11.2 million of higher straight-line rent write-offs in 2018 associated with other disposals and loss of revenue from certain properties vacated during 2018 - see Note 3 to Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information. \n \u2022 Income from financing leases - down $0.5 million over the prior year, of which $1.2 million is from net revenue earned in 2017 but not in 2018 on the Boise lease that converted from DFL to operating lease accounting classification upon execution of the new lease with the Vibra/Ernest joint venture and by the write-off of $1.5 million of DFL unbilled interest associated with the same transaction. The impact was partially offset by $1.9 million of incremental revenue from acquisitions made in 2017 and $0.3 million is from annual escalations of rental rates in accordance with provisions in our leases. \n \u2022 Interest and other income - up $33.5 million over the prior year of which $51.1 million is from incremental revenue from new loans (primarily the $700 million of Steward mortgage loans in 2017) and $0.7 million is from our annual escalations in interest rates in accordance with loan provisions. These increases are partially offset by $15.7 million of lower interest revenue related to certain Steward loans that were converted to fee simple assets in 2018 and $4.1 million of lower revenue related to the Ernest acquisition loan repayment discussed in Note 3 to Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. \nInterest expense for 2018 and 2017 totaled $223.3 million and $177.0 million, respectively. Although our debt balance at December 31, 2018 is lower than the prior year with the paydown of our revolver from the proceeds of asset disposals, our average debt balance for 2018 was higher than 2017 due to the issuance of the $1.4 billion bonds in September 2017. Our weighted-average interest rate was 4.6% for 2018, consistent with 4.6% in 2017. See Note 4 in Item 8 to this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information on our debt activities.\nReal estate depreciation and amortization during 2018 was $133.1 million compared to $125.1 million in 2017 primarily due to the incremental depreciation/amortization from the facilities acquired (particularly the Steward and MEDIAN facilities acquired in 2017) and the development properties completed in 2017 and 2018.\nProperty expenses for 2018 increased $3.4 million compared to 2017 primarily due to the growth of our business internationally along with expense from certain properties vacated during 2018. See Note 3 to Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more details, including the successful re-tenanting of many of these facilities.\nGeneral and administrative expenses in 2018 totaled $80.1 million, which is 10.2% of revenues,", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7.\n</td> <td> Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nUnless otherwise indicated, references to our,\u201d we,\u201d and us\u201d in this management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations refer to Medical Properties Trust, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries, including MPT Operating Partnership, L.P.\nOverview\nWe were incorporated in Maryland on August 27, 2003, primarily for the purpose of investing in and owning net-leased healthcare facilities. We also make real estate mortgage loans and other loans to our tenants. We conduct our business operations in one segment. We currently have healthcare investments in the U.S., Europe and Australia. We have operated as a REIT since April 6, 2004, and accordingly, elected REIT status upon the filing of our calendar year 2004 U.S. federal income tax return. Our existing tenants are, and our prospective tenants will generally be, healthcare operating companies and other healthcare providers that use substantial real estate assets in their operations. We offer financing for these operators' real estate through 100% lease and mortgage financing and generally seek lease and loan terms on a long-term basis ranging from 10 to 15 years with a series of shorter renewal terms at the option of our tenants and borrowers. We also have included and intend to include in our lease and loan agreements annual contractual minimum rate increases. Our existing portfolio's minimum escalators generally range from 0.5% to 3%. In addition, most of our leases and loans also include rate increases based on the general rate of inflation if greater than the minimum contractual increases. Only less than 3% of our properties do not have either a minimum escalator or an escalator based on inflation. Beyond rent or mortgage interest, our leases and loans typically require our tenants to pay all operating costs and expenses associated with the facility. Finally, we may acquire a profits or other equity interest in our tenants that gives us a right to share in the tenant's income or loss.\nWe selectively make loans to certain of our operators through our TRSs, which the operators use for acquisitions and working capital. We consider our lending business an important element of our overall business strategy for two primary reasons: (1) it provides opportunities to make income-earning investments that yield attractive risk-adjusted returns in an industry in which our management has expertise, and (2) by making debt capital available to certain qualified operators, we believe we create for our company a competitive advantage over other buyers of, and financing sources for, healthcare facilities.\nAt December 31, 2019, our portfolio (including real estate assets in joint ventures) consisted of 359 properties leased or loaned to 42 operators, of which four are under development and 11 are in the form of mortgage loans.\n2019 Highlights\nIn 2019, we invested in approximately $4.5 billion in healthcare real estate assets. These significant investments enhanced the size and scale of our healthcare portfolio, while expanding our geographic footprint in the U.S. and Europe, and entering into new territories such as Australia. These investments also extended our lease and loan maturity schedule. To fund these new investments, we raised $2.5 billion in proceeds from equity sales during 2019, received proceeds of $837 million from an Australian term loan facility in June 2019, and completed $900 million and \u00a31 billion senior unsecured notes offerings in July and December 2019, respectively. In addition to the record breaking acquisition year, we generated returns to our shareholders of 39% during 2019, outpacing the returns of several key indexes, as noted in Item 5 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our return included an increase to our dividend to $0.26 per share per quarter in 2019, which is the 5th year in a row for such an increase.\nA summary of our 2019 highlights is as follows:\n \u2022 Acquired real estate assets or commenced development projects totaling more than $4.5 billion, as noted below: \n \u2022 Invested in three acute care hospitals and one IRF for an aggregate investment of approximately $135 million. One of the acute care hospitals is located in Big Spring, Texas and leased to Steward pursuant to the existing master lease agreement. The second facility, located in Poole, England, is leased to BMI Healthcare ( BMI\u201d). The third acute care facility is located in Watsonville, California and is leased to Halsen Healthcare.

These facilities are leased to Prospect; \n \u2022 Acquired eight private hospitals located throughout England for an aggregate purchase price of \u00a3347 million. These facilities are leased to Ramsay Health Care; \n \u2022 Acquired 10 post-acute facilities in various states throughout the U.S. for approximately $268 million. These facilities are leased to Vibra; \n \u2022 Commenced the development of a behavioral hospital in Houston, Texas for $27.5 million. This facility will be leased to NeuroPsychiatric Hospitals upon completion in the fourth quarter of 2020; \n \u2022 Acquired an acute care hospital in Portugal for approximately \u20ac28.2 million. This facility is leased to Jose de Mello; \n \u2022 Acquired two acute care hospitals in Spain for \u20ac117.3 million, effected through our purchase of a 45% interest in a joint venture. These facilities are leased to HM Hospitales; and \n \u2022 Acquired 10 acute care hospitals in six U.S. states for approximately $700.0 million leased to LifePoint. \nWith these new investments, we expanded our total assets to $14.5 billion, increased the number of properties in our portfolio to 359, increased our total operators to 42, expanded our geographic footprint in the U.S. to 34 states, and entered the Australian market.\n \u2022 To help fund these investments, we used cash on-hand and generated proceeds through equity offerings, utilization of our at-the-market equity program, through new issuances of unsecured notes, and from sales of real estate. Details of such activities are as follows: \n \u2022 Sold 36.1 million shares under our at-the-market equity program, generating proceeds of approximately $650 million; \n \u2022 Received proceeds from an Australian term facility of approximately $837 million in June 2019 and fixed the interest rate to approximately 2.45% in July 2019 using an interest rate swap; \n \u2022 Completed an underwritten public offering of 51.75 million shares of our common stock in July 2019, resulting in net proceeds of approximately $860 million; after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses; \n \u2022 Completed a $900 million senior unsecured notes offering in July 2019 with a rate of 4.625%; \n \u2022 Completed an underwritten public offering of 57.5 million shares of our common stock in November 2019, resulting in net proceeds of $1.026 billion, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses; \n \u2022 Completed a \u00a3400 million and \u00a3600 million unsecured notes offering in December 2019 with a rate of 2.550% and 3.692%, respectively; and \n \u2022 Sold five properties in 2019 generating net proceeds of $97 million and a gain of $41.6 million. \nSubsequent to year-end, we acquired 30 acute care hospital facilities located throughout the United Kingdom for a purchase price of \u00a31.5 billion. These facilities will ultimately be leased to Circle as they acquired the hospital operations from BMI in a related transaction. This acquisition was funded using proceeds from the December 2019 Sterling bond offering along with proceeds from a \u00a3700 million term loan entered into in January 2020.\n2018 Highlights\nIn 2018, we demonstrated the value of our portfolio through strategic property sales that generated gains exceeding $700 million and cash proceeds of approximately $2 billion. In addition, we generated strong returns to our shareholders of 25% during 2018. Our return included an increase in our quarterly dividend to $0.25 per share in 2018. Finally, we improved our liquidity position and leverage metrics during 2018.\nA summary of our 2018 highlights is as follows:\n \u2022 Sold the real estate of 76 properties (71 of which are leased to MEDIAN and were contributed to a joint venture arrangement) and sold our equity interest in Ernest Health, Inc. ( Ernest\u201d) (along with the repayment of all outstanding loans and accrued interest) for a net gain of approximately $720 million, as noted below: \n \u2022 Sold two acute care hospitals in Houston, Texas for a net gain of approximately $100 million; \n \u2022 Sold three long-term acute care hospitals located in California, Texas, and Oregon, for $53 million of cash and resulting in a net gain of $19.1 million; \n \u2022 Sold 71 properties located in Germany for a net gain of approximately \u20ac500 million by way of a joint venture arrangement, for which we own a 50% interest; and \n \u2022 Sold our investment in the operations of Ernest and were repaid outstanding loans and accrued interest generating over $176 million in cash. \n \u2022 Acquired the following real estate assets: \n \u2022 Acquired three inpatient rehabilitation hospitals in Germany for a combined purchase price of \u20ac17.3 million. These facilities are leased to MEDIAN; \n \u2022 Acquired five acute care hospitals from Steward in exchange for the reduction of $764 million in mortgage loans plus cash, which further increased the strength of our portfolio; and \n \u2022 Acquired an acute care hospital in Pasco, Washington for $17.5 million. This facility is leased to LifePoint. \n \u2022 After completing our strategic dispositions, we repaid over $800 million in outstanding revolver debt, resulting in approximately $1.3 billion in available liquidity from the revolving credit facility at December 31, 2018. \n \u2022 Sold 5.6 million shares under our at-the-market equity program, generating proceeds of approximately $95 million. \n \u2022 Successfully re-tenanted nine of the 16 Adeptus transition properties and our Florence facility. \n2017 Highlights\nIn 2017, we invested or committed to invest approximately $2.2 billion in healthcare real estate assets. These significant investments enhanced the size and scale of our healthcare portfolio, while expanding our geographic footprint in the U.S. and extending our lease and mortgage loan maturity schedule. Furthermore, we strategically sold an asset for proceeds totaling $64 million, raised $548 million in proceeds from a successful equity offering, and refinanced approximately $0.6 billion of debt, which strengthened our balance sheet, reduced interest rates, and funded acquisitions. Finally, we increased our dividend to $0.24 per share per quarter in 2017.\nA summary of our 2017 highlights is as follows:\n \u2022 Acquired real estate assets, entered into development agreements, entered into leases, and made new loan investments, totaling more than $2.2 billion as noted below: \n \u2022 Acquired 17 inpatient rehabilitation hospitals and one acute care hospital in Germany for a combined purchase price of \u20ac274 million. These facilities are leased to MEDIAN or its affiliates; \n \u2022 Acquired 15 acute care hospitals, one rehabilitation hospital, and one behavioral health facility, completed mortgage financing on two acute care hospitals, and invested in an additional minority equity contribution in Steward for an aggregate investment of $1.8 billion; \n \u2022 Acquired an acute care hospital in Lewiston, Idaho for $87.5 million. This facility is leased to LifePoint; and \n \u2022 Executed agreements totaling more than $150 million with Circle and Surgery Partners, Inc. to develop acute care hospitals in Birmingham, England and Idaho Falls, Idaho, respectively. \nWith these new investments, we expanded our gross assets to $9.5 billion, increased the total number of properties in our portfolio to 275, and increased our total number of beds to more than 32 thousand, as of December 31, 2017.\n \u2022 Sold the real estate of an acute care facility in Muskogee, Oklahoma, for a net gain of $7.4 million. \n \u2022 To fund our over $2.2 billion of asset investments, while lowering our average interest cost, we successfully refinanced approximately $0.6 billion of debt and generated proceeds of approximately $2.5 billion from the sale of 43.1 million shares in an equity offering and through new issuances of unsecured notes. Details of such activities are as follows: \n \u2022 Replaced our previous unsecured credit facility with a $1.3 billion unsecured revolving loan facility, a $200 million unsecured term loan facility, and a \u20ac200 million unsecured term loan facility; \n \u2022 Redeemed our 5.750% Senior Unsecured Notes due 2020 using proceeds from our \u20ac200 million term loan and cash on hand; \n \u2022 Completed a \u20ac500 million senior unsecured notes offering in March 2017 and used a portion of the proceeds to pay off our \u20ac200 million term loan; \n \u2022 Completed a $1.4 billion senior unsecured notes offering in September 2017 at a rate of 5.000% and used a portion of the proceeds to redeem our 6.375% Senior Unsecured Notes due 2022; \n \u2022 Prepaid the principal amount of the mortgage loan on our property in Kansas City, Missouri at par in the amount of $12.9 million; and \n \u2022 Completed an underwritten public offering of 43.1 million shares of our common stock, resulting in net proceeds of $548 million, after deducting offering expenses. \nCritical Accounting Policies\nIn order to prepare financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles ( GAAP\u201d) in the U.S., we must make estimates about certain types of transactions and account balances. We believe that our estimates of the amount and timing of credit losses, fair value adjustments (either as part of a purchase price allocation or impairment analyses), and periodic depreciation of our real estate assets, along with our assessment as to whether an entity that we do business with should be consolidated with our results, have significant effects on our financial statements. Each of these items involves estimates that require us to make subjective judgments. We rely on our experience, collect historical and current market data, and develop relevant assumptions to arrive at what we believe to be reasonable estimates. Under different conditions or assumptions, materially different amounts could be reported related to the critical accounting policies described below. In addition, application of these critical accounting policies involves the exercise of judgment on the use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and, as a result, actual results could materially differ from these estimates. See Note 2 to Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information regarding our accounting policies and recent accounting developments. Our accounting estimates include the following:\nCredit Losses:\nLosses from Rent Receivables: For all leases, we continuously monitor the performance of our existing tenants including, but not limited to: admission levels and surgery/procedure volumes by type; current operating margins; ratio of our tenants' operating margins both to facility rent and to facility rent plus other fixed costs; trends in revenue, cash collections, patient mix; and the effect of evolving healthcare regulations on tenants' profitability and liquidity.\nLosses from Operating Lease Receivables: We utilize the information above along with the tenants' payment and default history in evaluating (on a property-by-property basis) whether or not a provision for losses on outstanding billed rent and/or straight-line rent receivables is needed. A provision for losses on rent receivables (including straight-line rent receivables) is ultimately recorded when it becomes probable that the receivable will not be collected in full. The provision is an amount which reduces the receivable to its estimated net realizable value based on a determination of the eventual amounts to be collected either from the debtor or from existing collateral, if any.\nLosses on Financing Lease Receivables: Allowances are established for financing lease receivables based upon an estimate of probable losses on a property-by-property basis. Such receivables are impaired when it is deemed probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due in accordance with the contractual terms of the lease. Like operating lease receivables, the need for an allowance is based upon our assessment of the lessee's overall financial condition; economic resources and payment record; the prospects for support from any financially responsible guarantors; and, if appropriate, the realizable value of any collateral. These estimates consider all available evidence including the expected future cash flows discounted at the effective interest rate of the financing lease, fair value of collateral, and other relevant factors, as appropriate. Financing leases are placed on non-accrual status when we determine that the collectability of contractual amounts is not reasonably assured. If on non-accrual status, we generally account for the financing lease on a cash basis, in which income is recognized only upon receipt of cash.\nLoans: Loans consist of mortgage loans, working capital loans, and other long-term loans. Mortgage loans are collateralized by interests in real property. Working capital and other long-term loans are generally collateralized by interests in receivables and corporate and individual guarantees. We record loans at cost. We evaluate the collectability of both interest and principal on a loan-by-loan basis (using the same process as we do for assessing the collectability of rents as discussed above) to determine whether they are impaired. A loan is considered impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the existing contractual terms. When a loan is considered to be impaired, the amount of the allowance is calculated by comparing the recorded investment to either the value determined by discounting the expected future cash flows using the loan's effective interest rate or to the fair value of the collateral, if the loan is collateral dependent.\nInvestments in Real Estate: We maintain our investments in real estate at cost, and we capitalize improvements and replacements when they extend the useful life or improve the efficiency of the asset. While our tenants are generally responsible for all operating costs at a facility, to the extent that we incur costs of repairs and maintenance, we expense those costs as incurred. We compute depreciation using the straight-line method over the weighted-average useful life of approximately 39.0 years for buildings and improvements.\nWhen circumstances indicate a possible impairment of the value of our real estate investments, we review the recoverability of the facility's carrying value. The review of the recoverability is generally based on our estimate of the future undiscounted cash flows\nfrom the facility's use and eventual disposition. Our forecast of these cash flows considers factors such as expected future operating income, market and other applicable trends, and residual value, as well as the effects of leasing demand, competition, and other factors. If impairment exists due to the inability to recover the carrying value of a facility on an undiscounted basis, an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of the facility. We do not believe that the value of any of our facilities was impaired at December 31, 2019; however, given the highly specialized aspects of our properties no assurance can be given that future impairment charges will not be taken.\nAcquired Real Estate Purchase Price Allocation: For properties acquired for leasing purpose, we currently account for such acquisition based on asset acquisition accounting rules. Under this accounting method, we allocate the purchase price of acquired properties to net tangible and identified intangible assets acquired based on their fair values. In making estimates of fair value for purposes of allocating purchase prices of acquired real estate, we may utilize a number of sources, including available real estate broker data, independent appraisals that may be obtained in connection with the acquisition or financing of the respective property, internal data from previous acquisitions or developments, and other market data. We also consider information obtained about each property as a result of our pre-acquisition due diligence, marketing, and leasing activities in estimating the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets acquired.\nWe record above-market and below-market in-place lease values, if any, for the facilities we own which are based on the present value of the difference between (i) the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the in-place leases and (ii) management's estimate of fair market lease rates for the corresponding in-place leases, measured over a period equal to the remaining non-cancelable term of the lease. We amortize any resulting capitalized above-market lease values as a reduction of rental income over lease term. We amortize any resulting capitalized below-market lease values as an increase to rental income over the lease term. Because our strategy to a large degree involves the origination and acquisition of long-term lease arrangements at market rates with independent parties, we do not expect the above-market and below-market in-place lease values to be significant for many of our transactions.\nWe measure the aggregate value of other lease intangible assets to be acquired based on the difference between (i) the property valued with new or in-place leases adjusted to market rental rates and (ii) the property valued as if vacant when acquired. Management's estimates of value are made using methods similar to those used by independent appraisers (e.g., discounted cash flow analysis). Factors considered by management in our analysis include an estimate of carrying costs during hypothetical expected lease-up periods, considering current market conditions, and costs to execute similar leases. We also consider information obtained about each targeted facility as a result of our pre-acquisition due diligence, marketing, and leasing activities in estimating the fair value of the intangible assets acquired. In estimating carrying costs, management includes real estate taxes, insurance, and other operating expenses and estimates of lost rentals at market rates during the expected lease-up periods, which we expect to be about six months (based on experience) depending on specific local market conditions. Management also estimates costs to execute similar leases including leasing commissions, legal costs, and other related expenses to the extent that such costs are not already incurred in connection with a new lease origination as part of the transaction.\nOther intangible assets acquired may include customer relationship intangible values, which are based on management's evaluation of the specific characteristics of each prospective tenant's lease and our overall relationship with that tenant. Characteristics to be considered by management in allocating these values include the nature and extent of our existing business relationships with the tenant, growth prospects for developing new business with the tenant, the tenant's credit quality, and expectations of lease renewals, including those existing under the terms of the lease agreement, among other factors. At December 31, 2019, we have assigned no value to customer relationship intangibles.\nWe amortize the value of lease intangibles to expense over the term of the respective leases, which have a weighted-average useful life of 23.7 years at December 31, 2019. If a lease is terminated early, the unamortized portion of the lease intangible is charged to expense.\nPrinciples of Consolidation: Property holding entities and other subsidiaries of which we own 100% of the equity or have a controlling financial interest evidenced by ownership of a majority voting interest are consolidated. All inter-company balances and transactions are eliminated. For entities in which we own less than 100% of the equity interest, we consolidate the property if we have the direct or indirect ability to control the entities' activities based upon the terms of the respective entities' ownership agreements. For these entities, we record a non-controlling interest representing equity held by non-controlling interests.\nWe continually evaluate all of our transactions and investments to determine if they represent variable interests in a variable interest entity. If we determine that we have a variable interest in a variable interest entity, we then evaluate if we are the primary beneficiary of the variable interest entity. The evaluation is a qualitative assessment as to whether we have the ability to direct the activities of a variable interest entity that most significantly impact the entity's economic performance. We consolidate each variable interest entity in which we, by virtue of or transactions with our investments in the entity, are considered to be the primary beneficiary. At December 31, 2019 and 2018, we determined that we were not the primary beneficiary of any variable interest entity in which we hold a variable interest because we do not control the activities (such as the day-to-day operations) that most significantly impact the economic performance of these entities.\nDisclosure of Contractual Obligations\nThe following table summarizes known material

This table assumes the balance outstanding under the revolver and rate in effect at December 31, 2019 (which was $0 million as of December 31, 2019) remains in effect through maturity. \n (3) This note is Australian dollar-denominated and reflects the exchange rate of 0.7021 at December 31, 2019. \n (4) Most of our contractual obligations to make operating lease payments are related to ground leases for which we are reimbursed by our tenants along with corporate office and equipment leases. \n (5) Includes approximately $41.7 million of future expenditures related to development projects, a \u00a31.5 billion commitment to acquire 30 Circle facilities post December 31, 2019, and future expenditures on commenced capital improvement projects. We have excluded from the table above $16.8 million of capital expenditure commitments in our leases that we are not definitive on the amount, timing, and certainty of funding. However, payment on any of these commitments, if made, would be added to the lease base upon which the lessee will pay us rents. \nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe own interests in certain unconsolidated joint ventures as described under Note 3 to Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Except in limited circumstances, our risk of loss is limited to our investment in the joint venture and any outstanding receivables. We have no other material off-balance sheet arrangements that we expect would materially affect our liquidity and capital resources, except those described above under Disclosure of Contractual Obligations\u201d.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n2019 Cash Flow Activity\nWe generated cash of $494.1 million from operating activities during 2019, primarily consisting of rent and interest from mortgage and other loans. We used these operating cash flows along with cash on-hand to fund our dividends of $412 million and certain investing activities including the additional funding of our development activities.\nIn regards to other investing and financing activities in 2019, we did the following:\n a) Purchased $4.5 billion in real estate assets representing over 80 facilities across seven countries; \n b) Funded approximately $377.0 million of development, capital addition, and other projects; \n c) In 2019, we sold 36.1 million shares of common stock under our at-the-market equity offering program, resulting in net proceeds of approximately $650 million; \n d) On June 3, 2019, we received proceeds from an Australian term loan facility of approximately $837 million to help fund the Healthscope acquisition; \n e) On July 18, 2019, we completed an underwritten public offering of 51.75 million shares, resulting in net proceeds of $858 million; \n f) On July 26, 2019, we completed a $900 million senior unsecured notes offering resulting in net proceeds of approximately $885 million; \n g) In 2019, we sold five facilities generating net proceeds of $97 million and a gain of $41.6 million; \n h) On November 8, 2019, we completed an underwritten public offering of 57.5 million shares of our common stock, resulting in net proceeds of $1.026 billion; \n i) On December 5, 2019, we completed a \u00a3400 million and \u00a3600 million unsecured notes offering resulting in net proceeds of approximately \u00a3993 million, of which \u00a3367 million was used to pay down our balance on the revolving credit facility; and \n j) On December 27, 2019, we established a new at-the-market equity program, giving us the ability to sell up to $1.0 billion of stock. \nAs noted previously, we acquired 30 acute care hospital facilities located in the United Kingdom for \u00a31.5 billion on January 8, 2020. This acquisition was funded using proceeds from the December 2019 Sterling bond offering along with proceeds from a \u00a3700 million term loan entered into in January 2020.\n2018 Cash Flow Activity\nWe generated cash of $449.1 million from operating activities during 2018, primarily consisting of rent and interest from mortgage and other loans. We used these operating cash flows along with cash on-hand to fund our dividends of $364 million and certain investing activities including the additional funding of our development activities.\nIn regards to other investing and financing activities in 2018, we did the following:\n a) In 2018, we generated more than $2 billion of cash proceeds from the joint venture transaction with Primotop (which included the disposal of 71 inpatient rehabilitation hospitals in Germany and issuance of secured debt) and the sale of five other acute care and long-term acute care properties. Approximately $580 million was reinvested in the joint venture with Primotop in the form of an equity interest and shareholder loan; \n b) On August 31, 2018, we funded the acquisition of one property in Pasco, Washington for $17.5 million; \n c) On August 28, 2018, we funded the acquisition of three properties in Germany for \u20ac17.3 million; \n d) Originated $212 million in mortgage and other loans; \n e) Funded less than $200 million for development and capital improvement projects; \n f) Acquired five facilities operated by Steward by converting the $764.4 million in mortgage loans on the same properties plus cash consideration; \n g) We used the net cash received from property disposals to reduce our revolver by approximately $810 million; \n h) On October 4, 2018, we finalized our recapitalization agreement with Ernest generating $176.3 million (which included the sale of our equity investment in Ernest and repayment in full of non-mortgage loans outstanding plus accrued interest); and \n i) In the fourth quarter of 2018, we sold 5.6 million shares of common stock under our at-the-market equity program generating approximately $95 million. \n2017 Cash Flow Activity\nWe generated cash of $362 million from operating activities during 2017, primarily consisting of rent and interest from mortgage and other loans. We used these operating cash flows along with cash on-hand to fund our dividends of $326.7 million and certain investing activities including the additional funding of our development activities.\nIn regards to other investing and financing activities in 2017, we did the following:\n a) On February 1, 2017, we replaced our previous unsecured credit facility with a new credit facility ( Credit Facility\u201d) resulting in a $50 million reduction in our U.S. dollar term loan and a new \u20ac200 million unsecured term loan facility (which was paid off on March 30, 2017). \n b) On March 4, 2017, we redeemed our \u20ac200 million aggregate principal amount of our 5.750% Senior Unsecured Notes due 2020. We funded this redemption, including the premium and accrued interest, with proceeds from the new \u20ac200 million term loan together with cash on hand. \n c) On March 24, 2017, we completed a senior unsecured notes offering for \u20ac500 million. We used the net proceeds from this offering to prepay and extinguish the new \u20ac200 million term loan with the remainder of the proceeds used to acquire 12 facilities leased to MEDIAN for \u20ac146.4 million. \n d) On March 31, 2017, we sold the EASTAR Health System real estate located in Muskogee, Oklahoma, which was leased to LifePoint. Total proceeds from this transaction were approximately $64 million resulting in a gain of $7.4 million. \n e) On May 1, 2017, we completed an underwritten public offering of approximately 43.1 million shares of our common stock, resulting in net proceeds of approximately $548 million. We used a portion of these proceeds to acquire eight facilities for $301.3 million (leased to Steward), a facility in Idaho for $87.5 million (leased to LifePoint) and two other facilities for $40 million (leased to Alecto Healthcare Services LLC ( Alecto\u201d)). \n f) On September 7, 2017, we completed a senior unsecured notes offering for $1.4 billion. We used a portion of the net proceeds from the 5.000% Senior Unsecured Notes due 2027 offering to redeem the $350 million aggregate principal amount of our 6.375% Senior Unsecured Notes due 2022, plus a redemption premium, on October 7, 2017. The remaining proceeds, plus borrowings on our revolving credit facility, were used to acquire nine facilities and ancillary properties leased to Steward for $700 million, to make mortgage loans on two properties for $700 million, and to make a $100 million equity investment in Steward. \n g) On September 29, 2017, we prepaid the principal amount of the mortgage loan on our property in Kansas City, Missouri at par in the amount of $12.9 million. To fund such prepayment, including accrued and unpaid interest thereon, we used borrowings from the revolving credit facility. \nDebt Restrictions and REIT Requirements\nOur debt facilities impose certain restrictions on us, including, but not limited to, restrictions on our ability to: incur debt; create or incur liens; provide guarantees in respect of obligations of any other entity; make redemptions and repurchases of our capital stock; prepay, redeem, or repurchase debt; engage in mergers or consolidations; enter into affiliated transactions; dispose of real estate or other assets; and change our business. In addition, the credit agreement governing our Credit Facility limits the amount of dividends we can pay to 95% of NAFFO, as defined in the agreements, on a rolling four quarter basis. The indentures governing our senior unsecured notes also limit the amount of dividends we can pay based on the sum of 95% of funds from operations, proceeds of equity issuances, and certain other net cash proceeds. Finally, our senior unsecured notes require us to maintain total unencumbered assets (as defined in the related indenture) of not less than 150% of our unsecured indebtedness.\nIn addition to these restrictions, the Credit Facility contains customary financial and operating covenants, including covenants relating to our total leverage ratio, fixed charge coverage ratio, secured leverage ratio, unsecured leverage ratio, consolidated adjusted net worth, and unsecured interest coverage ratio. This facility also contains customary events of default, including among others, nonpayment of principal or interest, material inaccuracy of representations, and failure to comply with our covenants. If an event of default occurs and is continuing under the facility, the entire outstanding balance may become immediately due and payable. At December 31, 2019, we were in compliance with all such financial and operating covenants.\nIn order for us to continue to qualify as a REIT we are required to distribute annual dividends equal to a minimum of 90% of our REIT taxable income, computed without regard to the dividends paid deduction and our net capital gains. See section titled Distribution Policy\u201d within this Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information on our dividend policy along with the historical dividends paid on a per share basis.\nShort-term Liquidity Requirements:\nAs of February 21, 2020, we have no debt principal payments due in 2020 - see debt maturity schedule below. At February 21, 2020 (and after the funding of our \u00a31.5 billion acquisition in January 2020), our availability under our revolving credit facility plus cash on-hand approximated $1.6 billion. We believe this liquidity along with our current monthly cash receipts from rent and loan interest, regular distributions from our joint venture arrangements, and availability under our at-the-market equity program is sufficient to fund our operations, debt and interest obligations, our firm commitments, and dividends in order to comply with REIT requirements for the next twelve months.\nLong-term Liquidity Requirements:\nAs of February 21, 2020, we have no debt principal payments due between now and February 2022 when our term loan, with a current outstanding amount of $200 million, comes due. With our liquidity as of February 21, 2020 of approximately $1.6 billion, along with our current monthly cash receipts from rent and loan interest, regular distributions from our joint venture arrangements, and availability under our at-the-market equity program, we believe such liquidity is sufficient to fund our operations, debt and interest obligations, our firm commitments, and dividends in order to comply with REIT requirements for the foreseeable future.\nHowever, in order to fund additional investments, to fund debt maturities coming due in later years, or to strategically refinance any existing debt (including our Credit Facility coming due in 2022) in order to reduce interest rates, we may need to access one or a combination of the following sources of capital:\n \u2022 issuance of new USD, EUR, or GBP denominated debt securities, including senior unsecured notes; \n \u2022 sale of equity securities; \n \u2022 amending or entering into a new revolving credit facility and/or bank term loans; \n \u2022 placing new secured loans on real estate located outside the U.S.; and/or \n \u2022 proceeds from strategic property sales. \nHowever, there is no assurance that conditions will be favorable for such possible transactions or that our plans will be successful.\nPrincipal payments due on our debt (which exclude the effects of any discounts, premiums, or debt issue costs recorded) as of February 21, 2020 (which includes the new \u00a3700 million term loan to fund the Circle transaction on January 8, 2020) are as follows ($ amounts in thousands):\nTable 279: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> -\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 742,350\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 518,560\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 1,595,240\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Thereafter\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 5,027,670\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 7,883,820\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nResults of Operations\nOur operating results may vary significantly from year-to-year due to a variety of reasons including acquisitions made during the year, incremental revenues and expenses from acquisitions made in the prior year, revenues and expenses from completed development properties, property disposals, annual escalation provisions, foreign currency exchange rate changes, new or amended debt agreements, issuances of shares through an equity offering, impact from accounting changes, etc. Thus, our operating results for the current year are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected in future years.\nYear Ended December 31, 2019 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2018\nNet income for the year ended December 31, 2019, was $374.7 million compared to net income of $1.02 billion for the year ended December 31, 2018. This decrease is primarily due to the approximate $720 million of gains on the sales of real estate recognized in 2018 from the disposal of five properties in the U.S. and the joint venture transaction with Primotop described in Note 3 to Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This decrease is partially offset by approximately $70 million more in revenues from new investments in 2019. FFO, after adjusting for certain items (as more fully described in the section titled Non-GAAP Financial Measures\u201d in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d in Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K), was $557.4 million, or $1.30 per diluted share for 2019, as compared to $501.0 million, or $1.37 per diluted share, for 2018. This increase in FFO dollars is primarily due to incremental revenue from new investments in 2019, while FFO per share is lower due to approximately 145 million of new shares issued to fund new investments in 2019.\nA comparison of revenues for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 is as follows (dollar amounts in thousands):\nTable 280: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Rent billed\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 474,151\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 55.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 473,343\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 60.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Straight-line rent\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 110,456\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 12.9\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 74,741\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 35,715\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income from financing leases\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 119,617\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 14.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 73,983\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 45,634\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest and other income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 149,973\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 17.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 162,455\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 20.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (12,482\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 854,197\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 100.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 784,522\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 100.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 69,675\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur total revenues for 2019 are up $69.7 million or 9% over the prior year. This increase is made up of the following:\n \u2022 Operating lease revenue (including rent billed and straight-line rent) - up $36.5 million over the prior year of which $54.8 million of additional lease revenue is related to the conversion of five Steward mortgage loans to fee simple assets \n in 2018, and approximately $68.7 million of incremental revenue from acquisitions ($30.0 million of which relates to Healthscope). This increase is partially offset by a net $82.8 million of lower revenues due to property dispositions in 2018 (majority of which relates to the formation of the Primotop joint venture in the 2018 third quarter) and approximately $5.7 million from unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations. \n \u2022 Income from financing leases - up $45.6 million over the prior year due to $50 million of revenue from the Prospect acquisition in the 2019 third quarter, partially offset by approximately $5 million loss of revenue on two Alecto properties that closed during 2019. See Note 3 to Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more details. \n \u2022 Interest and other income - down $12.5 million from the prior year due to the following: \n \u2022 Interest from loans - down $26.2 million over the prior year of which $35.6 million is the result of lower interest revenue related to Steward mortgage loans converted to fee simple assets in 2018 and $13.3 million is from the payoff of our Ernest acquisition and other loans in the fourth quarter of 2018. This decrease is partially offset by $18.6 million of incremental interest revenue earned on loan investments, including $10.9 million from the Primotop joint venture shareholder loan made in August 2018 and $4.4 million related to Prospect loans made in 2019. \n \u2022 Other income - up $13.7 million due to the implementation of the lease accounting standard on January 1, 2019, whereby we are now reflecting certain payments made by our tenants, including ground lease payments and reimbursements of property taxes and insurance, as revenue. This revenue is offset by a corresponding expense in the Property-related\u201d line on the consolidated statements of net income. \nInterest expense for 2019 and 2018 totaled $237.8 million and $223.3 million, respectively. This increase is primarily related to new debt issuances in 2019 including the \u00a31 billion senior unsecured notes issued in December 2019, the $900 million of senior unsecured notes issued in July 2019, and the AUD $1.2 billion term loan funded in June 2019. In addition, we incurred $6.1 million of bridge loan fees and accelerated commitment fee amortization expense associated with our Australian and GBP term loan facilities in 2019. These increases were partially offset by lower interest in 2019 from the paydown of our revolver, in addition to a reduction in our weighted-average interest rate year-over-year from 4.55% in 2018 to 4.45% in 2019.\nReal estate depreciation and amortization during 2019 increased to $152.3 million from $133.1 million in 2018 due to new investments made in 2018 and 2019 and the conversion of the five Steward mortgage loans to fee simple assets, partially offset by property sales in 2018.\nProperty-related expenses for 2019 increased $14.8 million compared to 2018. As noted above under the caption Other income\u201d, this increase was primarily due to the grossing up of certain expenses (such as ground lease, property taxes, and insurance) as part of our implementation of the lease accounting standard on January 1, 2019.\nGeneral and administrative expenses in 2019 totaled $96.4 million, which is a $16.3 million increase from 2018. The majority of the increase relates to stock compensation expense from our performance-based awards. Given our strong performance in 2019 including a 39% total shareholder return and significant growth from $4.5 billion of new investments, certain performance awards were earned at maximum level, resulting in higher stock compensation expense in 2019.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, we sold five properties resulting in a total gain of $41.6 million. In addition, we made a $21 million adjustment to lower the carrying value of the real estate on certain vacant facilities in 2019- see Note 3 to Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details. In 2018, we sold five properties in the U.S. and 71 properties as part of the joint venture transaction with Primotop resulting in a gain of $719.4 million. In addition, we made a $48 million adjustment to lower the carrying value of the real estate to fair value on seven of our transitioning Adeptus facilities and four of our Alecto facilities in 2018.\nEarnings from equity interests was $16.1 million for 2019, up $1.9 million from 2018 due to our investment in the Primotop joint venture in the third quarter of 2018 and our investment in Infracore made at the end of the second quarter of 2019, partially offset by a lower return year-over-year in our Hoboken investment.\nIncome tax expense typically includes U.S. federal and state income taxes on our TRS entities, as well as non-U.S. income based or withholding taxes on certain investments located in jurisdictions outside the U.S. The $2.6 million income tax benefit for 2019 represents the benefit on losses incurred by our TRS during the year. The benefit is partially offset by tax expense on income generated by our international investments. In comparison, we incurred $0.9 million of income tax expense in 2018 from income generated by our international investments that was partially offset by $4.4 million of valuation allowances released related to U.S. federal and state deferred tax assets of our TRS.\nWe utilize the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Deferred tax assets are recorded to the extent we believe these assets will more likely than not be realized. In making such determination, all available positive and negative evidence is\nconsidered, including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies, and recent financial performance. Based upon our review of all positive and negative evidence, including our three-year cumulative pre-tax book loss position in certain entities, we concluded that a full valuation allowance of $11.4 million should continue to be recorded against certain of our international and domestic net deferred tax assets at December 31, 2019. In the future, if we determine that it is more likely than not that we will realize our net deferred tax assets, we will reverse the applicable portion of the valuation allowance, recognize an income tax benefit in the period in which such determination is made, and incur higher income taxes in future periods as income is earned. For more detailed information, see Note 5 to Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nYear Ended December 31, 2018 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2017\nNet income for the year ended December 31, 2018, was $1.02 billion compared to net income of $289.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. This increase is primarily due to the approximate $720 million of gains on the sales of real estate recognized in 2018 from the disposal of five properties in the U.S. and the joint venture transaction with Primotop described in Note 3 to Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. FFO, after adjusting for certain items (as more fully described in the section titled Non-GAAP Financial Measures\u201d in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d in Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K), was $501.0 million, or $1.37 per diluted share for 2018 as compared to $474.9 million, or $1.35 per diluted share for 2017. This 5.5% increase in FFO dollars is primarily due to the increase in revenue from acquisitions and completed development projects during 2018 and 2017.\nA comparison of revenues for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 is as follows (dollar amounts in thousands):\nTable 287: <table> <tr> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> Change\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Rent billed\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 473,343\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 60.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 435,782\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 61.8\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 37,561\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Straight-line rent\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 74,741\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 65,468\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9,273\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Income from financing leases\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 73,983\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 9.5\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 74,495\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 10.6\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> (512\n</td> <td> )\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Interest and other income\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 162,455\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 20.7\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 129,000\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 18.3\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 33,455\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> Total revenues\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 784,522\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 100.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 704,745\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> 100.0\n</td> <td> %\n</td> <td>\n</td> <td> $\n</td> <td> 79,777\n</td> <td>\n</td> </tr>\n</table>\nOur total revenues for 2018 are up $79.8 million or 11.3% over the prior year. This increase is made up of the following:\n \u2022 Operating lease revenue (including rent billed and straight-line rent) - up $46.8 million over the prior year of which $60 million is incremental revenue from acquisitions primarily due to the Steward and MEDIAN acquisitions in 2017 and 2018, $24.6 million is from rent recorded on the new Steward leases that converted from mortgage loans in 2018, $11 million is incremental revenue from capital additions, $3.7 million is incremental revenue from development properties that were placed in service, and approximately $5.8 million is from favorable foreign currency fluctuations. These increases are partially offset by approximately $31.4 million of lower revenue as 71 revenue producing properties were contributed to the joint venture transaction with Primotop on August 31, 2018, along with approximately $16 million of lower revenue and approximately $11.2 million of higher straight-line rent write-offs in 2018 associated with other disposals and loss of revenue from certain properties vacated during 2018 - see Note 3 to Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information. \n \u2022 Income from financing leases - down $0.5 million over the prior year, of which $1.2 million is from net revenue earned in 2017 but not in 2018 on the Boise lease that converted from DFL to operating lease accounting classification upon execution of the new lease with the Vibra/Ernest joint venture and by the write-off of $1.5 million of DFL unbilled interest associated with the same transaction. The impact was partially offset by $1.9 million of incremental revenue from acquisitions made in 2017 and $0.3 million is from annual escalations of rental rates in accordance with provisions in our leases. \n \u2022 Interest and other income - up $33.5 million over the prior year of which $51.1 million is from incremental revenue from new loans (primarily the $700 million of Steward mortgage loans in 2017) and $0.7 million is from our annual escalations in interest rates in accordance with loan provisions. These increases are partially offset by $15.7 million of lower interest revenue related to certain Steward loans that were converted to fee simple assets in 2018 and $4.1 million of lower revenue related to the Ernest acquisition loan repayment discussed in Note 3 to Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. \nInterest expense for 2018 and 2017 totaled $223.3 million and $177.0 million, respectively. Although our debt balance at December 31, 2018 is lower than the prior year with the paydown of our revolver from the proceeds of asset disposals, our average debt balance for 2018 was higher than 2017 due to the issuance of the $1.4 billion bonds in September 2017. Our weighted-average interest rate was 4.6% for 2018, consistent with 4.6% in 2017. See Note 4 in Item 8 to this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information on our debt activities.\nReal estate depreciation and amortization during 2018 was $133.1 million compared to $125.1 million in 2017 primarily due to the incremental depreciation/amortization from the facilities acquired (particularly the Steward and MEDIAN facilities acquired in 2017) and the development properties completed in 2017 and 2018.\nProperty expenses for 2018 increased $3.4 million compared to 2017 primarily due to the growth of our business internationally along with expense from certain properties vacated during 2018. See Note 3 to Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more details, including the successful re-tenanting of many of these facilities.\nGeneral and administrative expenses in 2018 totaled $80.1 million, which is 10.2% of revenues,"}
