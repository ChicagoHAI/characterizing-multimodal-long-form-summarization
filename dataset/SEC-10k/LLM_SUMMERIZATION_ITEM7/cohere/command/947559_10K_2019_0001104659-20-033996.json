MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following provides a narrative discussion and analysis of The First Bancshares' financial condition and results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017. This discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the supplemental financial data included in Part II. Item 8.-Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - included elsewhere in this report.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nIn the preparation of the Company's consolidated financial statements, certain significant amounts are based upon judgment and estimates. The most critical of these is the accounting policy related to the allowance for loan losses. The allowance is based in large measure upon management's evaluation of borrowers' abilities to make loan payments, local and national economic conditions, and other subjective factors. If any of these factors were to deteriorate, management would update its estimates and judgments which may require additional loss provisions.\nEffective January 1, 2020, the Company adopted ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Measurement of Current Expected Credit Losses on Financial Instruments (CECL), which will modify the accounting for the allowance for loan losses from an incurred loss model to an expected loss model, as discussed more fully under Part II - Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note B - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d of this report.\nCompanies are required to perform periodic reviews of individual securities in their investment portfolios to determine whether decline in the value of a security is other than temporary. A review of other-than-temporary impairment requires companies to make certain judgments regarding the materiality of the decline, its effect on the financial statements and the probability, extent and timing of a valuation recovery and the company's intent and ability to hold the security. Pursuant to these requirements, Management assesses valuation declines to determine the extent to which such changes are attributable to fundamental factors specific to the issuer, such as financial condition, business prospects or other factors or market-related factors, such as interest rates. Declines in the fair value of securities below their cost that are deemed to be other-than-temporary are recorded in earnings as realized losses.\nGoodwill is assessed for impairment both annually and when events or circumstances occur that make it more likely than not that impairment has occurred. As part of its testing, the Company first assesses qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If the Company determines the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount using these qualitative factors, the Company compares the fair value of goodwill with its carrying amount, and then measures impaired loss by comparing the implied fair value of goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. Other intangibles are also assessed for impairment, both annually and when events or circumstances occur, that make it more likely than not that impairment has occurred. No impairment was indicated when the annual test was performed in December, 2019.\nOverview\nThe First Bancshares, Inc. (the Company) was incorporated on June 23, 1995, and serves as a bank holding company for The First, A National Banking Association ( The First\u201d), located in Hattiesburg, Mississippi. The First began operations on August 5, 1996, from its main office in the Oak Grove community, which is now incorporated within the city of Hattiesburg. Currently, the First has 78 locations in Mississippi, Alabama, Florida, Georgia and Louisiana. The Company and The First engage in a general commercial and retail banking business characterized by personalized service and local decision-making, emphasizing the banking needs of small to medium-sized businesses, professional concerns, and individuals.\nThe Company's primary source of revenue is interest income and fees, which it earns by lending and investing the funds which are held on deposit. Because loans generally earn higher rates of interest than investments, the Company seeks to employ as much of its deposit funds as possible in the form of loans to individuals, businesses, and other organizations. To ensure sufficient liquidity, the Company also maintains a portion of its deposits in cash, government securities, deposits with other financial institutions, and overnight loans of excess reserves (known as Federal Funds Sold\u201d) to correspondent banks. The revenue which the Company earns (prior to deducting its overhead expenses) is essentially a function of the amount of the Company's loans and deposits, as well as the profit margin ( interest spread\u201d) and fee income which can be generated on these amounts.\nHighlights for the year ended December 31, 2019 include:\nTable 56: <table><tr> <td> </td> <td>\u00b7 </td> <td>On March 2, 2019, the Company closed its acquisition of FPB, parent company to Florida Parishes Bank, headquarter in Hammond, LA.

common stockholders of $43.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to a consolidated net income of $21.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Operating net earnings increased $18.0 million or 59.9% from $30.0 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018 to $48.0 million for the same period ended December 31, 2019. Operating net earnings excludes merger-related costs of $4.9 million, net of tax, and financial assistance grants of $697 thousand, net of tax, for the year ended December 31, 2019, and merger-related costs of $10.6 million, net of tax, financial assistance grants of $1.6 million, net of tax, and gain on sale of securities of $256 thousand, net of tax, for the year ended December 31, 2018. Net interest income increased $36.9 million in year-over-year comparison, primarily due to interest income earned on a higher volume of loans and securities. Non-interest income was $26.9 million at December 31, 2019, an increase of $6.4 million in year-over-year comparison consisting of increases in service charges on deposit accounts, interchange fee income, mortgage income, as well as other charges and fees. Non-interest expense was $88.6 million at December 31, 2019, an increase of $12.3 million in year-over-year comparison, of which $4.3 million is related to the operations of Southwest, Sunshine, FMB, FPB and FFB. The remaining increase of $8.0 million in expenses are related to increases in salaries and employee benefits of $3.7 million and increases in other expenses of $4.3 million.\nThe Company reported consolidated net income available to common stockholders of $21.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to a consolidated net income of $10.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase in income was attributable to an increase in net interest income of $25.7 million or 43.5%, an increase in non-interest income of $6.2 million, or 43.2%, which was offset by an increase in non-interest expenses of $20.9 million or 37.6%. The increase in net interest income was primarily due to interest income earned on a higher volume of loans as well as increased interest rates. Purchase accounting adjustments accounted for only $2.1 million of the increase. Non-interest increased as a result of increases in service charges on deposit accounts of $2.2 million and interchange fee income of $1.5 million on the increased deposit base related to the acquisitions, as well as the receipt of the Financial Assistance and Bank Enterprise Awards in the amount of $2.1 million. The increase in non-interest expense can be attributed to increases in salaries and benefits of $5.9 million related to the acquisitions of Southwest, Sunshine, and FMB, along with increased acquisition charges of $7.1 million. Increases in occupancy, amortization of core deposit intangibles and other non-interest expense for the year-to-date period of 2018 were also attributable to the acquisitions.\nSee Note C - Business Combinations in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for more information on how the Company accounts for business combinations.\nConsolidated Net Interest Income\nThe largest component of net income for the Company is net interest income, which is the difference between the income earned on assets and interest paid on deposits and borrowings used to support such assets. Net interest income is determined by the rates earned on the Company's interest-earning assets and the rates paid on its interest-bearing liabilities, the relative amounts of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, and the degree of mismatch and the maturity and repricing characteristics of its interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities.\nConsolidated net interest income was approximately $121.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to $84.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This increase was the direct result of higher volume of loans and securities during 2019 as compared to 2018. Average interest-bearing liabilities for the year 2019 were $2.3 billion compared to $1.7 billion for the year 2018. At December 31, 2019, the fully tax equivalent ( FTE\u201d) net interest spread, which is the difference between the yield on earning assets and the rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities, was 3.75% compared to 3.75% at December 31, 2018. Net interest margin, which is net interest income divided by average earning assets, was 4.02% for the year 2019 compared to 3.94% for the year 2018. At December 31, 2019, the FTE average yield on all earning assets increased 26 basis points to 4.89% compared to 4.63% at December 31, 2018. Rates paid on average interest-bearing liabilities increased to 1.14% for the year 2019 compared to 0.88% for the year 2018. Interest earned on assets and interest accrued on liabilities is significantly influenced by market factors, specifically interest rates as set by Federal agencies. Average loans comprised 76.5% of average earnings assets for the year 2019 compared to 77.0% the year 2018.\nConsolidated net interest income was approximately $84.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to $59.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. This increase was the direct result of increased loan volumes during 2018 as compared to 2017, as well as increased interest rates. Average interest-bearing liabilities for the year ended December 31, 2018 were $1.7 billion compared to $1.2 billion for the year ended December 31, 2017. At December 31, 2018, the net interest spread was 3.75% compared to 3.72% at December 31, 2017. The net interest margin was 3.94% for the year 2018 compared to 3.83% for the year 2017. At December 31, 2018, the FTE average yield on all earning assets increased 36 basis points to 4.63% compared to 4.27% at December 31, 2017. Rates paid on average interest-bearing liabilities increased to 0.88% for the year 2018 compared to 0.55% for the year 2017. Average loans comprised 77.0% of average earnings assets for the year 2018 compared to 74.1% for the year 2017.\nAverage Balances, Income and Expenses, and Rates. The following tables depict, for the periods indicated, certain information related to the average balance sheet and average yields on assets and average costs of liabilities. Such yields are derived by dividing income or expense by the average balance of the corresponding assets or liabilities.

The Company monitors and manages the pricing and maturity of its assets and liabilities in order to diminish the potential adverse impact that changes in interest rates could have on its net interest income. A monitoring technique employed by the Company is the measurement of the Company's interest sensitivity \"gap,\" which is the positive or negative dollar difference between assets and liabilities that are subject to interest rate repricing within a given period of time. The Company also performs asset/liability modeling to assess the impact varying interest rates and balance sheet mix assumptions will have on net interest income. Interest rate sensitivity can be managed by repricing assets or liabilities, selling securities available-for-sale, replacing an asset or liability at maturity, or adjusting the interest rate during the life of an asset or liability. Managing the amount of assets and liabilities repricing in the same time interval helps to hedge the risk and minimize the impact on net interest income of rising or falling interest rates. The Company evaluates interest sensitivity risk and then formulates guidelines regarding asset generation and repricing, funding sources and pricing, and off-balance sheet commitments in order to decrease interest rate sensitivity risk.\nThe following tables illustrate the Company's consolidated interest rate sensitivity and consolidated cumulative gap position by maturity at December 31,

The Company currently is asset sensitive within the one-year time frame. However, the Company's gap analysis is not a precise indicator of its interest sensitivity position. The analysis presents only a static view of the timing of maturities and repricing opportunities, without taking into consideration that changes in interest rates do not affect all assets and liabilities equally. For example, rates paid on a substantial portion of core deposits may change contractually within a relatively short time frame, but those rates are viewed by management as significantly less interest-sensitive than market-based rates such as those paid on non-core deposits. Accordingly, management believes a liability sensitive-position within one year would not be as indicative of the Company's true interest sensitivity as it would be for an organization which depends to a greater extent on purchased funds to support earning assets. Net interest income is also affected by other significant factors, including changes in the volume and mix of earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities.\nThe following tables depict, for the

identification of potential problem loans. Management's judgment as to the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is based upon a number of assumptions about future events which it believes to be reasonable, but which may not prove to be accurate. Thus, there can be no assurance that charge-offs in future periods will not exceed the allowance for loan losses or that additional increases in the loan loss allowance will not be required.\nThe Company's allowance consists of two parts. The first part is determined in accordance with authoritative guidance issued by the FASB regarding the allowance. The Company's determination of this part of the allowance is based upon quantitative and qualitative factors. The Company uses a loan loss history based upon the prior ten years to determine the appropriate allowance. Historical loss factors are calculated and allocated to loans by loan type. These historical loss factors are applied to the loans by loan type to determine an indicated allowance. The loss factors of peer groups are considered in the determination of the allowance and are used to assist in the establishment of a long-term loss history for areas in which this data is unavailable and incorporated into the qualitative factors to be considered. The historical loss factors may also be modified based upon other qualitative factors including but not limited to local and national economic conditions, trends of delinquent and problem loans, changes in lending policies and underwriting standards, concentrations, and management's knowledge of the loan portfolio. These factors require judgment on the part of management and are based upon state and national economic reports received from various institutions and agencies including the Federal Reserve Bank, United States Bureau of Economic Analysis, Bureau of Labor Statistics, meetings with the Company's loan officers and loan committees, and data and guidance received or obtained from the Company's regulatory authorities.\nThe second part of the allowance is determined in accordance with guidance issued by the FASB regarding impaired loans. Impaired loans are determined based upon ongoing review by senior management in the areas of Credit Administration and Portfolio Management. Impaired loans are loans for which the Bank does not expect to receive all contractually obligated repayment by the due date. A specific allowance is assigned to each loan determined to be impaired based upon the value of the loan's underlying collateral. Appraisals are used by management to determine the value of the collateral.\nThe sum of the two parts constitutes management's best estimate of an appropriate allowance for loan losses. When the estimated allowance is determined, it is presented to the Company's ALLL Committee and Audit Committee of the Board for review and approval on a quarterly basis.\nOur allowance for loan loss model's quantitative methodology is focused on establishing a loss probability using the Bank's historical default and net charge off data. The quantitative portion of the loss estimation model also includes specific impairments individually reserved for credits that the Bank determines the ultimate repayment source will be liquidation of the subject collateral. The other qualitative component used in calculating a loss estimate takes into account other factors such as local and national economic factors, portfolio composition and collateral concentrations, asset quality, lending personnel knowledge and experience, as well as loan policy guidelines and their effect on underwriting standards. These trends are measured by analyzing the following variables:\nLocal Trends:\nTable 73: <table> <tr> <td>Local Unemployment Rate </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Insurance Issues (Windpool Areas) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Bankruptcy Rates (Increasing/Declining) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Local Commercial R/E Vacancy Rates </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Established Market/New Market </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Hurricane Threat </td> </tr>\n</table>\nNational Trends:\nTable 74: <table> <tr> <td>Gross Domestic Product (GDP) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Home Sales </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Consumer Price Index (CPI) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Interest Rate Environment (Increasing/Steady/Declining) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Single Family Construction Starts </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Inflation Rate </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Retail Sales </td> </tr>\n</table>\nPortfolio Trends:\nTable 75: <table> <tr> <td>Second Mortgages </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Single Pay Loans </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Non-Recourse Loans </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Limited Guaranty Loans </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Loan to Value Exceptions </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Secured by Non-Owner Occupied Property </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Raw Land Loans </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Unsecured Loans </td> </tr>\n</table>\nMeasurable Bank Trends:\nTable 76: <table> <tr> <td>Delinquency Trends </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Non-Accrual Trends </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net Charge Offs </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Loan Volume Trends </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Non-Performing Assets </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Underwriting Standards/Lending Policies </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Experience/Depth of Bank Lending\nManagement </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe bank wide information and metrics, along with the local and national economic trends listed above, are all measured quarterly. Typically, this review is performed during the second month of every quarter to facilitate the release of economic data from the reporting agencies. As of December 31, 2019, Unemployment remained at record lows throughout the 4th quarter, but fears of rising inflation caused the Federal Reserve to continue with 2019's policy of raising key rates. This increase in market rates overall caused some stress in the financial sector, and was the reason to lower the grading on economic conditions, and thus increase that allocation factor. The Qualitative and Environmental ( Q&E\u201d) factor assigned to asset quality was also increased due to a 4th quarter rise in past dues compared to the previous three quarters in 2019. Easing of the regulatory burdens brought about in the past few years, as well as increased capital and lower CRE concentrations led to a decrease in those Q&E factors from previous quarters.\nAt December 31, 2019, the consolidated allowance for loan losses was approximately $13.9 million, or 0.53% of outstanding loans excluding loans held for sale. At December 31, 2018, the allowance for loan losses amounted to approximately $10.1 million, which was 0.49% of outstanding loans. The provision for loan losses is a charge to earnings to maintain the allowance for loan losses at a level consistent with management's assessment of the collectability of the loan portfolio in light of current economic conditions and market trends. The Company's provision for loan losses was $3.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, $2.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, and $506 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2017. The $1.6 million increase in 2019 was primarily related to our internal assessment of the credit quality of the loan portfolio which included additional impairments of certain loans. The overall allowance for loan losses results from consistent application of our loan loss reserve methodology as described above. At December 31, 2019, management believes the allowance is appropriate and has been derived from consistent application of our methodology. Should any of the factors considered by management in evaluating the appropriateness of the allowance for loan losses change, management's estimate of inherent losses in the portfolio could also change, which would affect the level of future provisions for loan losses.\nWith the adoption of CECL beginning on January 1, 2020, provision expense may become more volatile due to changes in CECL model assumption of credit quality, macroeconomics factors and conditions, and loan composition, which drive the allowance for credit losses balance.\nNonPerforming Assets\nA loan is reviewed for impairment when, based on all available information and events, it displays characteristics causing management to determine that the probability of collecting all principal, interest, and other related fees due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. Also at this time, the accrual of interest is discontinued. Along with these loans in non-accrual status, all loans determined by management to be labelled as troubled debt restructure\u201d based on regulatory guidance are reviewed for impairment. Loans that are identified as criticized or classified based on unsatisfactory repayment performance, or other evidence of deteriorating credit quality, are not reviewed until being placed in non-accrual status or when considered to be troubled debt restructure.\nOnce these loans are identified, they are analyzed to determine whether the ultimate repayment source will be liquidation of collateral or some future source of cash flow. If the only source of repayment will come from the liquidation of collateral, impairment worksheets are prepared to document the amount of impairment that exists. This method takes into account collateral exposure, as well as all expected expenses related to the disposal of the collateral. Specific allowances for these loans are then accounted for on a per loan basis.\nThe following tables illustrate the Company's past due and nonaccrual loans, including PCI loans, at December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 ($ in thousands).\nTable 77: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, 2019 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Past Due 30 to\n89 Days </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Past Due 90\ndays or more and\nstill accruing </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Nonaccrual </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Real Estate-construction </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>468 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>363 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,483 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Residential secured loans including multi-family and farmland </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,569 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,608 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10,050 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Real Estate-nonfarm nonresidential </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,979 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>683 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>24,803 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Commercial </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>515 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>61 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,234 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Installment and other </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>226 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>265 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>7,757 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,715 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>38,835 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 78: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, 2018 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Past Due 30 to\n89 Days </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Past Due 90\ndays or more and\nstill accruing </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Nonaccrual </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Real Estate-construction </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>818 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>114 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>612 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Residential secured loans including multi-family and farmland </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,528 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>650 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,586 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Real Estate-nonfarm nonresidential </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,319 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>456 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14,320 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Commercial </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,650 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,377 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Installment and other </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>507 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>45 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>178 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>12,822 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,265 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>25,073 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 79: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, 2017 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Past Due 30 to\n89 Days </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Past Due 90\ndays or more and\nstill accruing </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Nonaccrual </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Real Estate-construction </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>192 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>27 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>92 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Residential secured loans including multi-family and farmland </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,656 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>177 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,691 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Real Estate-nonfarm nonresidential </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,487 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>82 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,724 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Commercial </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>393 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,120 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Installment and other </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>57 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>46 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,785 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>286 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,673 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTotal nonaccrual loans at December 31, 2019, were $38.8 million, an increase of $13.3 million compared to $25.1 million at December 31, 2018. The majority of the increase is related to two legacy relationships that were moved to nonaccrual status during 2019. Total nonaccrual loans at December 31, 2018 increased $19.4 million from $5.7 million at December 31, 2017. The majority of the increase was the result of loans acquired from First Community Bank, Sunshine and FMB. Management believes these relationships were adequately reserved at December 31, 2019. Restructured loans not reported as past due or nonaccrual at December 31, 2019 totaled $79.7 million. See Note E - Loans in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for a description of restructured loans.\nA potential problem loan is one in which management has serious doubts about the borrower's future performance under the terms of the loan contract and does not include the category of special mention. These loans are current as to principal and interest and, accordingly, they are not included in nonperforming asset categories. The level of potential problem loans is one factor used in the determination of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses. At December 31, 2019, 2018 and December 31, 2017, The First had potential problem loans of $67.9 million, $55.2 million and $36.9 million, respectively. The increase of $12.7 million during 2019 was largely attributable to one legacy relationship and certain loans acquired in the FPB and FFB transactions that were identified as classified or criticized based on repayment performance or credit quality.\nSummary of Loan Loss Experience\nConsolidated Allowance For Loan Losses\nTable 80: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Years Ended

are mortgage banking operations and service charges on deposit accounts. Other sources of non-interest income include bankcard fees, commissions on check sales, safe deposit box rent, wire transfer fees, official check fees and bank owned life insurance income.\nNon-interest income was $26.9 million at December 31, 2019, an increase of $6.4 million or 31.1% compared to December 31, 2018, primarily consisting of increases in service charges on deposit accounts of $2.0 million, interchange fee income of $2.8 million on the increased deposit base related to the acquisitions, as well as mortgage income and other charges and fees. Non-interest income increased $6.2 million or 43.2% for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to $14.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. Deposit activity fees were $15.9 million for 2019 compared to $11.0 million for 2018 and $7.4 million for 2017. Other service charges increased by $51 thousand or 5.1% for the year ended 2019 to $1.0 million from $996 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2018 and other service charges increased $372 thousand or 59.7% for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to $624 thousand for the year ended December 31, 2017.\nNon-interest Expense\nNon-interest expense was $88.6 million at December 31, 2019, an increase of $12.3 million in year-over-year comparison, of which $4.3 million is related to the operations of Southwest, Sunshine, FMB, FPB and FFB. The remaining increase of $8.0 million in expenses are related to increases in salaries and employee benefits of $3.7 million and increases in other expenses of $4.3 million.\nNon-interest expense was $76.3 million at December 31, 2018, an increase of $20.9 million in year-over-year comparison primarily resulting from increases in salaries and benefits of $5.9 million related to the acquisitions of Southwest, Sunshine and FMB, and increased acquisition charges of $7.1 million. Increases in occupancy, amortization of core deposit intangibles and other non-interest expense for the year-to-date period of 2018 were also attributable to the acquisitions.\nThe following table sets forth the primary components of non-interest expense for the periods indicated ($ in thousands):\nNon-interest Expense\nTable 86: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Years ended December 31, </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Salaries and employee benefits </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>47,675 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>38,302 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>30,548 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Occupancy </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,775 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,818 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,828 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Furniture and equipment </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,838 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,575 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,225 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Supplies and printing </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>890 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>846 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>640 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Professional and consulting fees </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,449 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,381 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,757 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Marketing and public relations </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>859 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>508 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>406 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Deposit and other insurance </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>632 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,382 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,252 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>ATM expense </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,821 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,241 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,188 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Bank communications </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,367 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,014 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,296 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Data processing </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,285 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,931 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,039 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Postage </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>933 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>751 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>546 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Other </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15,045 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,562 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,721 </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>88,569 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>76,311 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>55,446 </td> </tr>\n</table>\nIncome Tax Expense\nIncome tax expense consists of two components. The first is the current tax expense which represents the expected income tax to be paid to taxing authorities. The Company also recognizes deferred tax for future income/deductible amounts resulting from differences in the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities. Income tax expense was $12.7 million at December 31, 2019, $5.8 million at December 31, 2018 and $7.0 million at December 31, 2017. As a result of the Tax Act, in 2017 we revalued our deferred tax assets and recorded an additional income tax expense of $2.1 million due to the statutory federal income tax for corporate entities decreasing from 35% to 21% for 2018 and future periods. The Company's effective income tax rate was 22.5%, 21.4% and 39.6% for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The effective tax rate differs each year primarily due to our investments in bank-qualified municipal securities, bank-owed life insurance, and certain merger related expenses. The reduction in the Company's effective rate for 2018 compared to 2017 was primarily due to the reduction in the federal statutory corporate tax rate following enactment of the Tax Act. Income taxes are discussed more fully under Note K - Income Tax\u201d of this report.\nAnalysis of Financial Condition\nEarning Assets\nLoans. Loans typically provide higher yields than the other types of earning assets, and thus one of the Company's goals is for loans to be the largest category of the Company's earning assets. At December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively, average loans accounted for 76.5%, 77.0% and 74.1% of average earning assets. Management attempts to control and counterbalance the inherent credit and liquidity risks associated with the higher loan yields without sacrificing asset quality to achieve its asset mix goals. Loans averaged $2.341 billion during 2019 and $1.679 billion during 2018, as compared to $1.169 billion during 2017.\nThe following table shows the composition of the loan portfolio by category ($ in thousands):\nComposition of Loan Portfolio\nTable 87: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Amount </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Percent\nof Total </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Amount </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Percent\nof Total </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Amount </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Percent of\nTotal </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Mortgage loans held for sale </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>10,810 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.4 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,838 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.3 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,790 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.3 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Commercial, financial and agricultural </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>332,600 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12.7 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>301,182 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14.6 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>165,780 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13.5 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Real Estate: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Mortgage-commercial </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,028,012 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>39.4 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>776,880 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>37.6 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>467,484 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>38.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Mortgage-residential </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>814,282 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>31.2 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>617,804 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>29.9 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>385,099 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>31.3 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Construction </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>359,195 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13.8 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>298,718 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14.5 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>183,328 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14.9 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Lease Financing Receivable </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,095 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.1 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,891 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.1 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,450 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.2 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Obligations of states and subdivisions </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>20,716 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.8 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16,941 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.8 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,109 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.3 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Installment and other </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>42,458 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.6 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>46,006 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.2 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>18,056 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.5 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total loans </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,611,168 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,065,260 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,230,096 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>100 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Allowance for loan losses </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(13,908 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(10,065 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(8,288 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net loans </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,597,260 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,055,195 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,221,808 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nIn the context of this discussion, a \"real estate mortgage loan\" is defined as any loan, other than loans for construction purposes, secured by real estate, regardless of the purpose of the loan. The Company follows the common practice of financial institutions in the Company's market area of obtaining a security interest in real estate whenever possible, in addition to any other available collateral. This collateral is taken to reinforce the likelihood of the ultimate repayment of the loan and tends to increase the magnitude of the real estate loan portfolio component. Generally, the Company limits its loan-to-value ratio to 80%. Management attempts to maintain a conservative philosophy regarding its underwriting guidelines and believes it will reduce the risk elements of its loan portfolio through strategies that diversify the lending mix.\nLoans held for sale consist of mortgage loans originated by the Bank and sold into the secondary market. Commitments from investors to purchase the loans are obtained upon origination.\nThe following table sets forth the Company's commercial and construction real estate loans maturing within specified intervals at December 31, 2019 ($ in thousands).\nLoan Maturity Schedule and Sensitivity to Changes in Interest Rates\nTable 88: <table> <tr> <td>Type </td> <td> </td> <td>One Year\nor Less </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Over One Year\nThrough\nFive Years </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Over Five\nYears </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Commercial, financial and agricultural </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>78,820 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>160,439 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>93,341 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>332,600 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Real estate - construction </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>157,215 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>134,774 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>67,206 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>359,195 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>236,035 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>295,213 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>160,547 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>691,795 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 89: <table> <tr> <td>Loans maturing after one year with: </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Fixed interest rates </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>338,570 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Floating interest rates </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>117,190 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>455,760 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe information presented in the above table is based on the contractual maturities of the individual loans, including loans which may be subject to renewal at their contractual maturity.

The investment securities portfolio is a significant component of the Company's total earning assets. Total securities averaged $636.0 million in 2019, as compared to $442.7 million in 2018, and $359.2 million in 2017. This represents 20.8%, 20.3%, and 22.8% of the average earning assets for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. At December 31, 2019, investment securities, including equity securities, were $791.8 million and represented 21.4% of earning assets. The Company attempts to maintain a portfolio of high quality, highly liquid investments with returns competitive with short-term U.S. Treasury or agency obligations. This objective is particularly important as the Company focuses on growing its loan portfolio. The Company primarily invests in securities of U.S. Government agencies, municipals, and corporate obligations with maturities up to ten years.\nThe following table summarizes the carrying value of securities for the dates indicated ($ in thousands).\nSecurities Portfolio\nTable 90: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Available-for-sale </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>U.S. Treasury </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,894 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>U.

The loan-to-deposit ratio averaged 83.5% during 2019. Core deposits, which exclude time deposits of $100,000 or more, provide a relatively stable funding source for the Company's loan portfolio and other earning assets. The Company's core deposits were $2.650 billion at December 31, 2019, $2.166 billion at December 31, 2018, and $1.292 billion at December 31, 2017. Management anticipates that a stable base of deposits will be the Company's primary source of funding to meet both its short-term and long-term liquidity needs in the future. The Company has purchased brokered deposits from time to time to help fund loan growth. Brokered deposits and jumbo certificates of deposit generally carry a higher interest rate than traditional core deposits. Further, brokered deposit customers typically do not have loan or other relationships with the Company. The Company has adopted a policy not to permit brokered deposits to represent more than 10% of all of the Company's deposits.\nMaturities of Certificates of Deposit\nof $100,000 or More\nTable 93: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>After Three </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Within Three </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Through </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>After Twelve </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>($ in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td>Months </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Twelve Months </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Months </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>December 31, 2019 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>75,808 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>249,234 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>101,308 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>426,350 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nBorrowed Funds\nBorrowed funds consist of advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Dallas ( FHLB\u201d), loans from First Horizon Bank, federal funds purchased and reverse repurchase agreements. At December 31, 2019, advances from the FHLB totaled $206.3 million compared to $85.5 million at December 31, 2018 and $88.1 million at December 31, 2017. The advances are collateralized by a blanket lien on the first mortgage loans in the amount of the outstanding borrowings, FHLB capital stock, and amounts on deposit with the FHLB. There were $2.7 million, $0 and $0 federal funds purchased at December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively. As part of the FFB acquisition, the Company assumed two loans in the amount of $3.5 million and $2.0 million with First Horizon Bank. Principal and interest is payable quarterly at rates ranging from 3.80% - 4.10%.\nSubordinated Debentures\nIn 2006, the Company issued subordinated debentures of $4.1 million to The First Bancshares, Inc. Statutory Trust 2 ( Trust 2\u201d). The Company is the sole owner of the equity of the Trust 2. The Trust 2 issued $4.0 million of preferred securities to investors. The Company makes interest payments and will make principal payments on the debentures to the Trust 2. These payments will be the source of funds used to retire the preferred securities, which are redeemable at any time beginning in 2011 and thereafter, and mature in 2036. The Company entered into this arrangement to provide funding for expected growth.\nIn 2007, the Company issued subordinated debentures of $6.2 million to The First Bancshares, Inc. Statutory Trust 3 ( Trust 3\u201d). The Company is the sole owner of the equity of the Trust 3. The Trust 3 issued $6.0 million of preferred securities to investors. The Company makes interest payments and will make principal payments on the debentures to the Trust 3. These payments will be the source of funds used to retire the preferred securities, which are redeemable at any time beginning in 2012 and thereafter, and mature in 2037. The Company entered into this arrangement to provide funding for expected growth.\nIn 2018, the Company acquired FMB Capital Trust 1 ( Trust 1\u201d) as part of its acquisition of FMB Banking Corporation. The Company is the sole owner of the equity of Trust 1. The Trust 1 issued $6.0 million of preferred securities to investors. The Company makes interest payments and will make principal payments on the debentures to the Trust 1. These payments will be the source of funds used to retire the preferred securities, which are redeemable at any time beginning in 2008 and thereafter, and mature in 2033.\nSubordinated Notes\nOn April 30, 2018, The Company entered into two Subordinated Note Purchase Agreements pursuant to which the Company sold and issued $24.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 5.875% fixed-to-floating rate subordinated notes due 2028 and $42.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 6.40% fixed-to-floating rate subordinated notes due 2033 (collectively, the Notes\u201d).\nThe Notes are not convertible into or exchangeable for any other securities or assets of the Company or any of its subsidiaries. The Notes are not subject to redemption at the option of the holder. Principal and interest on the Notes are subject to acceleration only in limited circumstances. The Notes are unsecured, subordinated obligations of the Company and rank junior in right to payment to the Company's current and future senior indebtedness, and each Note is pari passu in right to payment with respect to the other Notes. The Company entered into this arrangement to provide funding for expected growth.\nCapital\nThe Federal Reserve Board and bank regulatory agencies require bank holding companies and financial institutions to maintain capital at adequate levels based on a percentage of assets and off-balance sheet exposures, adjusted for risk weights ranging from 0% for U.S government and agency securities, to 600% for certain equity exposures. In November 2019, the federal banking agencies adopted a rule revising the scope of commercial real estate mortgages subject to a 150% risk weight. Under the risk-based standard, capital is classified into two tiers. Tier 1 capital consists of common stockholders' equity, excluding the unrealized gain (loss) on available-for-sale securities, minus certain intangible assets. Tier 2 capital consists of the general reserve for loan losses, subject to certain limitations. An institution's total risk-based capital for purposes of its risk-based capital ratio consists of the sum of its Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital. The risk-based regulatory minimum requirements are 6% for Tier 1 and 8% for total risk-based capital.\nBank holding companies and banks are also required to maintain capital at a minimum level based on total assets, which is known as the leverage ratio. The minimum requirement for the leverage ratio is 4%. All but the highest rated institutions are required to maintain ratios 100 to 200 basis points above the minimum. The Company and The First exceeded their minimum regulatory capital ratios as of December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017.\nThe Federal Reserve and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation approved final capital rules in July 2013, that substantially amended the existing capital rules for banks. These new rules reflect, in part, certain standards initially adopted by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision in December 2010 (which standards are commonly referred to as Basel III\u201d) as well as requirements contemplated by the Dodd-Frank Act.\nUnder the Basel III capital rules, the Company is required to meet certain minimum capital requirements that differ from past capital requirements. The rules implement a new capital ratio of common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets. Common equity Tier 1 capital generally consists of retained earnings and common stock (subject to certain adjustments) as well as accumulated other comprehensive income ( AOCI\u201d), however, the Company exercised a one-time irrevocable option to exclude certain components of AOCI as of March 31, 2015. The Company is required to establish a conservation buffer,\u201d consisting of a common equity Tier 1 capital amount equal to 2.5% of risk-weighted assets effective January 2019. An institution that does not meet the conservation buffer will be subject to restrictions on certain activities including payment of dividends, stock repurchases, and discretionary bonuses to executive officers.\nThe prompt corrective action rules have been modified to include the common equity Tier 1 capital ratio and to increase the Tier 1 capital ratio requirements for the various thresholds. For example, the requirements for the Company to be considered well-capitalized under the rules include a 5.0% leverage ratio, a 7.0% common equity Tier 1capital ratio, an 8.5% Tier 1 capital ratio, and a 10.5% total capital ratio.\nThe rules modify the manner in which certain capital elements are determined. The rules make changes to the methods of calculating the risk-weighting of certain assets, which in turn affects the calculation of the risk-weighted capital ratios. Higher risk weights are assigned to various categories of assets, including commercial real estate loans, credit facilities that finance the acquisition, development or construction of real property, certain exposures or credit that are 90 days past due or are non-accrual, securitization exposures, and in certain cases mortgage servicing rights and deferred tax assets.\nThe Company was required to comply with the new capital rules on January 1, 2015, with a measurement date of March 31, 2015. The conservation buffer was phased-in beginning in 2016, and took full effect on January 1, 2019. Certain calculations under the rules will also have phase-in periods.\nAnalysis of Capital\nTable 94: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>The Company </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>The First </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Adequately </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Well </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Capital Ratios </td> <td> </td> <td>Capitalized </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Capitalized </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Leverage </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10.3 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10.2 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11.7 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11.8 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12.2 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11.4 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Risk-based capital: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Common equity Tier 1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4.5 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6.5 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12.5 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11.5 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14.2 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15.1 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14.8 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14.5 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Tier 1 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12.2 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14.9 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15.1 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14.8 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14.5 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Total </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>10.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15.8 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15.6 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15.5 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15.6 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15.2 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15.1 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nRatios\nTable 95: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2019 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Return on assets (net income available to common stockholders divided by average total assets) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1.26 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.87 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>0.60 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Return on equity (net income available to common stockholders divided by average equity) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9.5 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7.6 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6.2 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Dividend payout ratio (dividends per share divided by net income per common share) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12.2 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>12.3 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13.5 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Equity to asset ratio (average equity divided by average total assets) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13.3 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11.5 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>9.7 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nLiquidity management involves monitoring the Company's sources and uses of funds in order to meet its day-to-day cash flow requirements while maximizing profits. Liquidity represents the ability of a company to convert assets into cash or cash equivalents without significant loss and to raise additional funds by increasing liabilities. Liquidity management is made more complicated because different balance sheet components are subject to varying degrees of management control. For example, the timing of maturities of the investment portfolio is very predictable and subject to a high degree of control at the time investment decisions are made; however, net deposit inflows and outflows are far less predictable and are not subject to the same degree of control. Asset liquidity is provided by cash and assets which are readily marketable, which can be pledged, or which will mature in the near future. Liability liquidity is provided by access to core funding sources, principally the ability to generate customer deposits in the Company's market area.\nThe Company's federal funds sold position, which includes funds due from banks and interest-bearing deposits with banks, is typically its primary source of liquidity. Federal funds sold averaged $84.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2019 and averaged $58.9 million at December 31, 2018. In addition, the Company has available advances from the FHLB. Advances available are generally based upon the amount of qualified first mortgage loans which can be used for collateral. At December 31, 2019, advances available totaled approximately $963.3 million, of which $211.4 million had been drawn, or used for letters of credit.\nAs of December 31, 2019, the market value of unpledged debt securities plus pledged securities in excess of current pledging requirements comprised $348.3 million of the Company's investment balances, compared to $110.8 million at December 31, 2018. The increase in unpledged debt from December 2019 compared to December 2018 is primarily due to an increase in acquired deposits. Other forms of balance sheet liquidity include but are not necessarily limited to any outstanding federal funds sold and vault cash. Management believes that available investments and other potentially liquid assets, along with the standby funding sources it has arranged, are more than sufficient to meet the Company's current and anticipated short-term liquidity needs.\nThe Company's liquidity ratio as of December 31, 2019 was 17.1%, as compared to internal liquidity policy guidelines of 10% minimum.

Management anticipates that the Bank will have sufficient earnings to provide dividends to the holding company to meet its funding requirements for the foreseeable future.\nManagement regularly reviews the liquidity position of the Company and has implemented internal policies which establish guidelines for sources of asset-based liquidity and limit the total amount of purchased funds used to support the balance sheet and funding from non-core sources.\nOn March 28, 2019, the Company announced that its Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program to purchase up to an aggregate of $20 million of the Company's common stock (the March 2019 program\u201d). This share repurchase program has an expiration date of December 31, 2019. Under the March 2019 program, the Company may repurchase shares of its common stock periodically in a manner determined by the Company's management. The actual means and timing of purchase, target number of shares and maximum price or range of prices under the program will be determined by management at its discretion and will depend on a number of factors, including the market price of the Company's common stock, general market and economic conditions, and applicable legal and regulatory requirements. The Company repurchased 168,188 shares under the March 2019 program in 2019.\nCommitments and Contractual Obligations\nThe following table presents, as of December 31, 2019, fixed and determinable contractual obligations to third parties by payment date.

This information is incorporated herein by reference.\nImpact of Inflation\nUnlike most industrial companies, the assets and liabilities of financial institutions such as the Company are primarily monetary in nature. Therefore, interest rates have a more significant effect on the Company's performance than do the effects of changes in the general rate of inflation and change in prices. In addition, interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or in the same magnitude as the prices of goods and services. As discussed previously, management seeks to manage the relationships between interest sensitive assets and liabilities in order to protect against wide interest rate fluctuations, including those resulting from inflation.", "summary": "- The income statement of a bank shows the sources and uses of a bank's operating income during a specific period of time, typically over a quarter or a year.\n- Net interest income is the difference between the interest income generated by a bank's lending activities and the interest expense associated with its deposit-taking and other debt activities.\n- The net interest income of the bank is calculated by subtracting $6,165 (total interest expense) from $121,806 (total interest income).\n- The bank's net interest income is $84,887.\n- The calculation is as follows: $121,806 - $6,165 = $84,887.\n- After subtracting $59,160 (non-interest expenses) from $84,887 (net interest income), the bank's earning assets result in a profit of $25,885.\n- The calculation is as follows: $84,887 - $59,160 = $25,885.\n- The bank's total assets are $1,511,572,000,000, and its total liabilities are $1,342,712,000,000.", "item_7_tables": "Table

"ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following provides a narrative discussion and analysis of The First Bancshares' financial condition and results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017. This discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the supplemental financial data included in Part II. Item 8.-Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - included elsewhere in this report.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nIn the preparation of the Company's consolidated financial statements, certain significant amounts are based upon judgment and estimates. The most critical of these is the accounting policy related to the allowance for loan losses. The allowance is based in large measure upon management's evaluation of borrowers' abilities to make loan payments, local and national economic conditions, and other subjective factors. If any of these factors were to deteriorate, management would update its estimates and judgments which may require additional loss provisions.\nEffective January 1, 2020, the Company adopted ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Measurement of Current Expected Credit Losses on Financial Instruments (CECL), which will modify the accounting for the allowance for loan losses from an incurred loss model to an expected loss model, as discussed more fully under Part II - Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note B - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d of this report.\nCompanies are required to perform periodic reviews of individual securities in their investment portfolios to determine whether decline in the value of a security is other than temporary. A review of other-than-temporary impairment requires companies to make certain judgments regarding the materiality of the decline, its effect on the financial statements and the probability, extent and timing of a valuation recovery and the company's intent and ability to hold the security. Pursuant to these requirements, Management assesses valuation declines to determine the extent to which such changes are attributable to fundamental factors specific to the issuer, such as financial condition, business prospects or other factors or market-related factors, such as interest rates. Declines in the fair value of securities below their cost that are deemed to be other-than-temporary are recorded in earnings as realized losses.\nGoodwill is assessed for impairment both annually and when events or circumstances occur that make it more likely than not that impairment has occurred. As part of its testing, the Company first assesses qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If the Company determines the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount using these qualitative factors, the Company compares the fair value of goodwill with its carrying amount, and then measures impaired loss by comparing the implied fair value of goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. Other intangibles are also assessed for impairment, both annually and when events or circumstances occur, that make it more likely than not that impairment has occurred. No impairment was indicated when the annual test was performed in December, 2019.\nOverview\nThe First Bancshares, Inc. (the Company) was incorporated on June 23, 1995, and serves as a bank holding company for The First, A National Banking Association ( The First\u201d), located in Hattiesburg, Mississippi. The First began operations on August 5, 1996, from its main office in the Oak Grove community, which is now incorporated within the city of Hattiesburg. Currently, the First has 78 locations in Mississippi, Alabama, Florida, Georgia and Louisiana. The Company and The First engage in a general commercial and retail banking business characterized by personalized service and local decision-making, emphasizing the banking needs of small to medium-sized businesses, professional concerns, and individuals.\nThe Company's primary source of revenue is interest income and fees, which it earns by lending and investing the funds which are held on deposit. Because loans generally earn higher rates of interest than investments, the Company seeks to employ as much of its deposit funds as possible in the form of loans to individuals, businesses, and other organizations. To ensure sufficient liquidity, the Company also maintains a portion of its deposits in cash, government securities, deposits with other financial institutions, and overnight loans of excess reserves (known as Federal Funds Sold\u201d) to correspondent banks. The revenue which the Company earns (prior to deducting its overhead expenses) is essentially a function of the amount of the Company's loans and deposits, as well as the profit margin ( interest spread\u201d) and fee income which can be generated on these amounts.\nHighlights for the year ended December 31, 2019 include:\n \u00b7 On March 2, 2019, the Company closed its acquisition of FPB, parent company to Florida Parishes Bank, headquarter in Hammond, LA. The acquisition added 7 locations and expanded the First's footprint in the Gulf South and the greater New Orleans area. Systems integration was completed during the first quarter of 2019. \n \u00b7 On November 1, 2019, the Company closed its acquisition of FFB, parent company of First Florida Bank, headquartered in Destin, FL. The acquisition added 7 locations servicing the areas of Destin, Fort Walton, Crestview and Panama City, Florida. Systems integration was completed during the fourth quarter of 2019. \n \u00b7 On December 18, 2019, the Company announced the signing of an Agreement and Plan of Merger with Southwest Georgia Financial Corporation ( SWG\u201d), parent company of Southwest Georgia Bank, headquartered in Moultrie, GA. Upon completion, the acquisition will add 8 full service offices servicing the areas of Moultrie, Valdosta, Albany and Tifton, Georgia. The closing of the transaction is expected to occur in the second quarter of 2020 and is subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory approvals and approval by the shareholders of SWG. \n \u00b7 Operating net earnings increased 59.9%, or $18.0 million for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019, totaling $48.0 million as compared to $30.0 million for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018. Operating net earnings for fiscal year 2019 excludes merger-related costs of $4.9 million, net of tax, and income in the form of financial assistance grant from the U. S. Department of Treasury of $0.7 million, net of tax. Operating net earnings for fiscal year 2018 excludes merger-related costs of $10.6 million, net of tax, income in the form of financial assistance grant from the U. S. Department of Treasury of $1.6 million, net of tax, and income from the sale of securities of $0.3 million, net of tax. Operating net earnings increased 59.9% to $48.0 million for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to fiscal year ended December 31, 2018. \nAt December 31, 2019, the Company had approximately $3.942 billion in total assets, an increase of $937.9 million compared to $3.004 billion at December 31, 2018. Loans, net of the allowance for loan losses, increased to $2.597 billion at December 31, 2019 from $2.055 billion at December 31, 2018. Deposits increased to $3.077 billion at December 31, 2019 from $2.457 billion at December 31, 2018. Stockholders' equity increased to $543.7 million at December 31, 2019 from $363.3 million at December 31, 2018. The addition of Florida Parish Bank and First Florida Bank during 2019 contributed, at acquisition, $884.8 million, $492.0 million and $686.4 million in assets, loans, and deposits, respectively.\nThe First reported net income of $51.1 million, $26.9 million and $12.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, the Company reported consolidated net income available to common stockholders of $43.7 million, $21.2 million and $10.6 million, respectively. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the Selected Consolidated Financial Data\u201d and the Company's consolidated financial statements and the Notes thereto and the other financial data included elsewhere.\nResults of Operations\nThe following is a summary of the results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017 ($ in thousands).\n\nThe following reconciles the above table to the amounts reflected in the consolidated financial statements of the Company at December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017 ($ in thousands):\n\nConsolidated Net Income\nThe Company reported consolidated net income available to common stockholders of $43.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to a consolidated net income of $21.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Operating net earnings increased $18.0 million or 59.9% from $30.0 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018 to $48.0 million for the same period ended December 31, 2019. Operating net earnings excludes merger-related costs of $4.9 million, net of tax, and financial assistance grants of $697 thousand, net of tax, for the year ended December 31, 2019, and merger-related costs of $10.6 million, net of tax, financial assistance grants of $1.6 million, net of tax, and gain on sale of securities of $256 thousand, net of tax, for the year ended December 31, 2018. Net interest income increased $36.9 million in year-over-year comparison, primarily due to interest income earned on a higher volume of loans and securities. Non-interest income was $26.9 million at December 31, 2019, an increase of $6.4 million in year-over-year comparison consisting of increases in service charges on deposit accounts, interchange fee income, mortgage income, as well as other charges and fees. Non-interest expense was $88.6 million at December 31, 2019, an increase of $12.3 million in year-over-year comparison, of which $4.3 million is related to the operations of Southwest, Sunshine, FMB, FPB and FFB. The remaining increase of $8.0 million in expenses are related to increases in salaries and employee benefits of $3.7 million and increases in other expenses of $4.3 million.\nThe Company reported consolidated net income available to common stockholders of $21.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to a consolidated net income of $10.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase in income was attributable to an increase in net interest income of $25.7 million or 43.5%, an increase in non-interest income of $6.2 million, or 43.2%, which was offset by an increase in non-interest expenses of $20.9 million or 37.6%. The increase in net interest income was primarily due to interest income earned on a higher volume of loans as well as increased interest rates. Purchase accounting adjustments accounted for only $2.1 million of the increase. Non-interest increased as a result of increases in service charges on deposit accounts of $2.2 million and interchange fee income of $1.5 million on the increased deposit base related to the acquisitions, as well as the receipt of the Financial Assistance and Bank Enterprise Awards in the amount of $2.1 million. The increase in non-interest expense can be attributed to increases in salaries and benefits of $5.9 million related to the acquisitions of Southwest, Sunshine, and FMB, along with increased acquisition charges of $7.1 million. Increases in occupancy, amortization of core deposit intangibles and other non-interest expense for the year-to-date period of 2018 were also attributable to the acquisitions.\nSee Note C - Business Combinations in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for more information on how the Company accounts for business combinations.\nConsolidated Net Interest Income\nThe largest component of net income for the Company is net interest income, which is the difference between the income earned on assets and interest paid on deposits and borrowings used to support such assets. Net interest income is determined by the rates earned on the Company's interest-earning assets and the rates paid on its interest-bearing liabilities, the relative amounts of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, and the degree of mismatch and the maturity and repricing characteristics of its interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities.\nConsolidated net interest income was approximately $121.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to $84.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This increase was the direct result of higher volume of loans and securities during 2019 as compared to 2018. Average interest-bearing liabilities for the year 2019 were $2.3 billion compared to $1.7 billion for the year 2018. At December 31, 2019, the fully tax equivalent ( FTE\u201d) net interest spread, which is the difference between the yield on earning assets and the rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities, was 3.75% compared to 3.75% at December 31, 2018. Net interest margin, which is net interest income divided by average earning assets, was 4.02% for the year 2019 compared to 3.94% for the year 2018. At December 31, 2019, the FTE average yield on all earning assets increased 26 basis points to 4.89% compared to 4.63% at December 31, 2018. Rates paid on average interest-bearing liabilities increased to 1.14% for the year 2019 compared to 0.88% for the year 2018. Interest earned on assets and interest accrued on liabilities is significantly influenced by market factors, specifically interest rates as set by Federal agencies. Average loans comprised 76.5% of average earnings assets for the year 2019 compared to 77.0% the year 2018.\nConsolidated net interest income was approximately $84.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to $59.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. This increase was the direct result of increased loan volumes during 2018 as compared to 2017, as well as increased interest rates. Average interest-bearing liabilities for the year ended December 31, 2018 were $1.7 billion compared to $1.2 billion for the year ended December 31, 2017. At December 31, 2018, the net interest spread was 3.75% compared to 3.72% at December 31, 2017. The net interest margin was 3.94% for the year 2018 compared to 3.83% for the year 2017. At December 31, 2018, the FTE average yield on all earning assets increased 36 basis points to 4.63% compared to 4.27% at December 31, 2017. Rates paid on average interest-bearing liabilities increased to 0.88% for the year 2018 compared to 0.55% for the year 2017. Average loans comprised 77.0% of average earnings assets for the year 2018 compared to 74.1% for the year 2017.\nAverage Balances, Income and Expenses, and Rates. The following tables depict, for the periods indicated, certain information related to the average balance sheet and average yields on assets and average costs of liabilities. Such yields are derived by dividing income or expense by the average balance of the corresponding assets or liabilities. Average balances have been derived from daily averages.\nAverage Balances, Income and Expenses, and Rates\n\n\nAnalysis of Changes in Net Interest Income. The following table presents the consolidated dollar amount of changes in interest income and interest expense attributable to changes in volume and to changes in rate. The combined effect in both volume and rate which cannot be separately identified has been allocated proportionately to the change due to volume and due to rate.\nAnalysis of Changes in Consolidated Net Interest Income\n\n (1) Fully tax equivalent yield assuming a 25.3% tax rate. \nInterest Sensitivity. The Company monitors and manages the pricing and maturity of its assets and liabilities in order to diminish the potential adverse impact that changes in interest rates could have on its net interest income. A monitoring technique employed by the Company is the measurement of the Company's interest sensitivity \"gap,\" which is the positive or negative dollar difference between assets and liabilities that are subject to interest rate repricing within a given period of time. The Company also performs asset/liability modeling to assess the impact varying interest rates and balance sheet mix assumptions will have on net interest income. Interest rate sensitivity can be managed by repricing assets or liabilities, selling securities available-for-sale, replacing an asset or liability at maturity, or adjusting the interest rate during the life of an asset or liability. Managing the amount of assets and liabilities repricing in the same time interval helps to hedge the risk and minimize the impact on net interest income of rising or falling interest rates. The Company evaluates interest sensitivity risk and then formulates guidelines regarding asset generation and repricing, funding sources and pricing, and off-balance sheet commitments in order to decrease interest rate sensitivity risk.\nThe following tables illustrate the Company's consolidated interest rate sensitivity and consolidated cumulative gap position by maturity at December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017 ($ in thousands).\n\n\n\n (1) NOW and savings accounts are subject to immediate withdrawal and repricing. These deposits do not tend to immediately react to changes in interest rates and the Company believes these deposits are fairly stable. Therefore, these deposits are included in the repricing period that management believes most closely matches the periods in which they are likely to reprice rather than the period in which the funds can be withdrawn contractually. (2) Securities include mortgage backed and other installment paying obligations based upon stated maturity dates. (3) Does not include subordinated debentures of $80,678, $80,521, $10,310 for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively. \nThe Company generally would benefit from increasing market rates of interest when it has an asset-sensitive gap and generally from decreasing market rates of interest when it is liability sensitive. The Company currently is asset sensitive within the one-year time frame. However, the Company's gap analysis is not a precise indicator of its interest sensitivity position. The analysis presents only a static view of the timing of maturities and repricing opportunities, without taking into consideration that changes in interest rates do not affect all assets and liabilities equally. For example, rates paid on a substantial portion of core deposits may change contractually within a relatively short time frame, but those rates are viewed by management as significantly less interest-sensitive than market-based rates such as those paid on non-core deposits. Accordingly, management believes a liability sensitive-position within one year would not be as indicative of the Company's true interest sensitivity as it would be for an organization which depends to a greater extent on purchased funds to support earning assets. Net interest income is also affected by other significant factors, including changes in the volume and mix of earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities.\nThe following tables depict, for the periods indicated, certain information related to interest rate sensitivity in net interest income and market value of equity.\nDecember 31, 2019\n\nDecember 31, 2018\n\nDecember 31, 2017\n\nProvision and Allowance for Loan Losses\nThe Company has developed policies and procedures for evaluating the overall quality of its credit portfolio and the timely identification of potential problem loans. Management's judgment as to the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is based upon a number of assumptions about future events which it believes to be reasonable, but which may not prove to be accurate. Thus, there can be no assurance that charge-offs in future periods will not exceed the allowance for loan losses or that additional increases in the loan loss allowance will not be required.\nThe Company's allowance consists of two parts. The first part is determined in accordance with authoritative guidance issued by the FASB regarding the allowance. The Company's determination of this part of the allowance is based upon quantitative and qualitative factors. The Company uses a loan loss history based upon the prior ten years to determine the appropriate allowance. Historical loss factors are calculated and allocated to loans by loan type. These historical loss factors are applied to the loans by loan type to determine an indicated allowance. The loss factors of peer groups are considered in the determination of the allowance and are used to assist in the establishment of a long-term loss history for areas in which this data is unavailable and incorporated into the qualitative factors to be considered. The historical loss factors may also be modified based upon other qualitative factors including but not limited to local and national economic conditions, trends of delinquent and problem loans, changes in lending policies and underwriting standards, concentrations, and management's knowledge of the loan portfolio. These factors require judgment on the", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following provides a narrative discussion and analysis of The First Bancshares' financial condition and results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017. This discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the supplemental financial data included in Part II. Item 8.-Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - included elsewhere in this report.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nIn the preparation of the Company's consolidated financial statements, certain significant amounts are based upon judgment and estimates. The most critical of these is the accounting policy related to the allowance for loan losses. The allowance is based in large measure upon management's evaluation of borrowers' abilities to make loan payments, local and national economic conditions, and other subjective factors. If any of these factors were to deteriorate, management would update its estimates and judgments which may require additional loss provisions.\nEffective January 1, 2020, the Company adopted ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Measurement of Current Expected Credit Losses on Financial Instruments (CECL), which will modify the accounting for the allowance for loan losses from an incurred loss model to an expected loss model, as discussed more fully under Part II - Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note B - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\u201d of this report.\nCompanies are required to perform periodic reviews of individual securities in their investment portfolios to determine whether decline in the value of a security is other than temporary. A review of other-than-temporary impairment requires companies to make certain judgments regarding the materiality of the decline, its effect on the financial statements and the probability, extent and timing of a valuation recovery and the company's intent and ability to hold the security. Pursuant to these requirements, Management assesses valuation declines to determine the extent to which such changes are attributable to fundamental factors specific to the issuer, such as financial condition, business prospects or other factors or market-related factors, such as interest rates. Declines in the fair value of securities below their cost that are deemed to be other-than-temporary are recorded in earnings as realized losses.\nGoodwill is assessed for impairment both annually and when events or circumstances occur that make it more likely than not that impairment has occurred. As part of its testing, the Company first assesses qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If the Company determines the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount using these qualitative factors, the Company compares the fair value of goodwill with its carrying amount, and then measures impaired loss by comparing the implied fair value of goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. Other intangibles are also assessed for impairment, both annually and when events or circumstances occur, that make it more likely than not that impairment has occurred. No impairment was indicated when the annual test was performed in December, 2019.\nOverview\nThe First Bancshares, Inc. (the Company) was incorporated on June 23, 1995, and serves as a bank holding company for The First, A National Banking Association ( The First\u201d), located in Hattiesburg, Mississippi. The First began operations on August 5, 1996, from its main office in the Oak Grove community, which is now incorporated within the city of Hattiesburg. Currently, the First has 78 locations in Mississippi, Alabama, Florida, Georgia and Louisiana. The Company and The First engage in a general commercial and retail banking business characterized by personalized service and local decision-making, emphasizing the banking needs of small to medium-sized businesses, professional concerns, and individuals.\nThe Company's primary source of revenue is interest income and fees, which it earns by lending and investing the funds which are held on deposit. Because loans generally earn higher rates of interest than investments, the Company seeks to employ as much of its deposit funds as possible in the form of loans to individuals, businesses, and other organizations. To ensure sufficient liquidity, the Company also maintains a portion of its deposits in cash, government securities, deposits with other financial institutions, and overnight loans of excess reserves (known as Federal Funds Sold\u201d) to correspondent banks. The revenue which the Company earns (prior to deducting its overhead expenses) is essentially a function of the amount of the Company's loans and deposits, as well as the profit margin ( interest spread\u201d) and fee income which can be generated on these amounts.\nHighlights for the year ended December 31, 2019 include:\n \u00b7 On March 2, 2019, the Company closed its acquisition of FPB, parent company to Florida Parishes Bank, headquarter in Hammond, LA. The acquisition added 7 locations and expanded the First's footprint in the Gulf South and the greater New Orleans area. Systems integration was completed during the first quarter of 2019. \n \u00b7 On November 1, 2019, the Company closed its acquisition of FFB, parent company of First Florida Bank, headquartered in Destin, FL. The acquisition added 7 locations servicing the areas of Destin, Fort Walton, Crestview and Panama City, Florida. Systems integration was completed during the fourth quarter of 2019. \n \u00b7 On December 18, 2019, the Company announced the signing of an Agreement and Plan of Merger with Southwest Georgia Financial Corporation ( SWG\u201d), parent company of Southwest Georgia Bank, headquartered in Moultrie, GA. Upon completion, the acquisition will add 8 full service offices servicing the areas of Moultrie, Valdosta, Albany and Tifton, Georgia. The closing of the transaction is expected to occur in the second quarter of 2020 and is subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory approvals and approval by the shareholders of SWG. \n \u00b7 Operating net earnings increased 59.9%, or $18.0 million for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019, totaling $48.0 million as compared to $30.0 million for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018.

Operating net earnings increased 59.9% to $48.0 million for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to fiscal year ended December 31, 2018. \nAt December 31, 2019, the Company had approximately $3.942 billion in total assets, an increase of $937.9 million compared to $3.004 billion at December 31, 2018. Loans, net of the allowance for loan losses, increased to $2.597 billion at December 31, 2019 from $2.055 billion at December 31, 2018. Deposits increased to $3.077 billion at December 31, 2019 from $2.457 billion at December 31, 2018. Stockholders' equity increased to $543.7 million at December 31, 2019 from $363.3 million at December 31, 2018. The addition of Florida Parish Bank and First Florida Bank during 2019 contributed, at acquisition, $884.8 million, $492.0 million and $686.4 million in assets, loans, and deposits, respectively.\nThe First reported net income of $51.1 million, $26.9 million and $12.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, the Company reported consolidated net income available to common stockholders of $43.7 million, $21.2 million and $10.6 million, respectively.

common stockholders of $43.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to a consolidated net income of $21.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Operating net earnings increased $18.0 million or 59.9% from $30.0 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2018 to $48.0 million for the same period ended December 31, 2019. Operating net earnings excludes merger-related costs of $4.9 million, net of tax, and financial assistance grants of $697 thousand, net of tax, for the year ended December 31, 2019, and merger-related costs of $10.6 million, net of tax, financial assistance grants of $1.6 million, net of tax, and gain on sale of securities of $256 thousand, net of tax, for the year ended December 31, 2018. Net interest income increased $36.9 million in year-over-year comparison, primarily due to interest income earned on a higher volume of loans and securities. Non-interest income was $26.9 million at December 31, 2019, an increase of $6.4 million in year-over-year comparison consisting of increases in service charges on deposit accounts, interchange fee income, mortgage income, as well as other charges and fees. Non-interest expense was $88.6 million at December 31, 2019, an increase of $12.3 million in year-over-year comparison, of which $4.3 million is related to the operations of Southwest, Sunshine, FMB, FPB and FFB. The remaining increase of $8.0 million in expenses are related to increases in salaries and employee benefits of $3.7 million and increases in other expenses of $4.3 million.\nThe Company reported consolidated net income available to common stockholders of $21.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to a consolidated net income of $10.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The increase in income was attributable to an increase in net interest income of $25.7 million or 43.5%, an increase in non-interest income of $6.2 million, or 43.2%, which was offset by an increase in non-interest expenses of $20.9 million or 37.6%. The increase in net interest income was primarily due to interest income earned on a higher volume of loans as well as increased interest rates. Purchase accounting adjustments accounted for only $2.1 million of the increase. Non-interest increased as a result of increases in service charges on deposit accounts of $2.2 million and interchange fee income of $1.5 million on the increased deposit base related to the acquisitions, as well as the receipt of the Financial Assistance and Bank Enterprise Awards in the amount of $2.1 million. The increase in non-interest expense can be attributed to increases in salaries and benefits of $5.9 million related to the acquisitions of Southwest, Sunshine, and FMB, along with increased acquisition charges of $7.1 million. Increases in occupancy, amortization of core deposit intangibles and other non-interest expense for the year-to-date period of 2018 were also attributable to the acquisitions.\nSee Note C - Business Combinations in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for more information on how the Company accounts for business combinations.\nConsolidated Net Interest Income\nThe largest component of net income for the Company is net interest income, which is the difference between the income earned on assets and interest paid on deposits and borrowings used to support such assets. Net interest income is determined by the rates earned on the Company's interest-earning assets and the rates paid on its interest-bearing liabilities, the relative amounts of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, and the degree of mismatch and the maturity and repricing characteristics of its interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities.\nConsolidated net interest income was approximately $121.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to $84.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This increase was the direct result of higher volume of loans and securities during 2019 as compared to 2018. Average interest-bearing liabilities for the year 2019 were $2.3 billion compared to $1.7 billion for the year 2018. At December 31, 2019, the fully tax equivalent ( FTE\u201d) net interest spread, which is the difference between the yield on earning assets and the rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities, was 3.75% compared to 3.75% at December 31, 2018. Net interest margin, which is net interest income divided by average earning assets, was 4.02% for the year 2019 compared to 3.94% for the year 2018. At December 31, 2019, the FTE average yield on all earning assets increased 26 basis points to 4.89% compared to 4.63% at December 31, 2018. Rates paid on average interest-bearing liabilities increased to 1.14% for the year 2019 compared to 0.88% for the year 2018. Interest earned on assets and interest accrued on liabilities is significantly influenced by market factors, specifically interest rates as set by Federal agencies. Average loans comprised 76.5% of average earnings assets for the year 2019 compared to 77.0% the year 2018.\nConsolidated net interest income was approximately $84.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to $59.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. This increase was the direct result of increased loan volumes during 2018 as compared to 2017, as well as increased interest rates. Average interest-bearing liabilities for the year ended December 31, 2018 were $1.7 billion compared to $1.2 billion for the year ended December 31, 2017. At December 31, 2018, the net interest spread was 3.75% compared to 3.72% at December 31, 2017. The net interest margin was 3.94% for the year 2018 compared to 3.83% for the year 2017.

equivalent yield assuming a 25.3% tax rate. \nInterest Sensitivity. The Company monitors and manages the pricing and maturity of its assets and liabilities in order to diminish the potential adverse impact that changes in interest rates could have on its net interest income. A monitoring technique employed by the Company is the measurement of the Company's interest sensitivity \"gap,\" which is the positive or negative dollar difference between assets and liabilities that are subject to interest rate repricing within a given period of time. The Company also performs asset/liability modeling to assess the impact varying interest rates and balance sheet mix assumptions will have on net interest income. Interest rate sensitivity can be managed by repricing assets or liabilities, selling securities available-for-sale, replacing an asset or liability at maturity, or adjusting the interest rate during the life of an asset or liability. Managing the amount of assets and liabilities repricing in the same time interval helps to hedge the risk and minimize the impact on net interest income of rising or falling interest rates. The Company evaluates interest sensitivity risk and then formulates guidelines regarding asset generation and repricing, funding sources and pricing, and off-balance sheet commitments in order to decrease interest rate sensitivity risk.\nThe following tables illustrate the Company's consolidated interest rate sensitivity and consolidated cumulative gap position by maturity at December 31,

These deposits do not tend to immediately react to changes in interest rates and the Company believes these deposits are fairly stable. Therefore, these deposits are included in the repricing period that management believes most closely matches the periods in which they are likely to reprice rather than the period in which the funds can be withdrawn contractually. (2) Securities include mortgage backed and other installment paying obligations based upon stated maturity dates. (3) Does not include subordinated debentures of $80,678, $80,521, $10,310 for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively. \nThe Company generally would benefit from increasing market rates of interest when it has an asset-sensitive gap and generally from decreasing market rates of interest when it is liability sensitive. The Company currently is asset sensitive within the one-year time frame. However, the Company's gap analysis is not a precise indicator of its interest sensitivity position. The analysis presents only a static view of the timing of maturities and repricing opportunities, without taking into consideration that changes in interest rates do not affect all assets and liabilities equally. For example, rates paid on a substantial portion of core deposits may change contractually within a relatively short time frame, but those rates are viewed by management as significantly less interest-sensitive than market-based rates such as those paid on non-core deposits. Accordingly, management believes a liability sensitive-position within one year would not be as indicative of the Company's true interest sensitivity as it would be for an organization which depends to a greater extent on purchased funds to support earning assets. Net interest income is also affected by other significant factors, including changes in the volume and mix of earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities.\nThe following tables depict, for the periods indicated, certain information related to interest rate sensitivity in net interest income and market value of equity.\nDecember 31, 2019\nTable 70: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Net

The loss factors of peer groups are considered in the determination of the allowance and are used to assist in the establishment of a long-term loss history for areas in which this data is unavailable and incorporated into the qualitative factors to be considered. The historical loss factors may also be modified based upon other qualitative factors including but not limited to local and national economic conditions, trends of delinquent and problem loans, changes in lending policies and underwriting standards, concentrations, and management's knowledge of the loan portfolio. These factors require judgment on the"}
