Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nRECENT DEVELOPMENTS\nOn February 13, 2022, funds affiliated with Clayton Dubilier & Rice, LLC ( CD&R\u201d) submitted a non-binding proposal to acquire all of the Company's outstanding shares of common stock that CD&R does not already own for a purchase price of $24.65 in cash per share (the CD&R Offer\u201d).\nThe CD&R Offer stated that any transaction would be subject to (i) approval by a special committee ( Special Committee\u201d) of our independent directors\u037e and (ii) a vote in favor of the transaction by a majority of the voting power represented by the shares of our common stock owned by stockholders not affiliated with CD&R.\nThe board of directors of the Company (the Board\u201d) previously formed a Special Committee to evaluate and consider any potential or actual proposal from CD&R [and any other alternative proposals or other strategic alternatives that may be available to the Company].\nThe CD&R Offer provides that CD&R reserves the right to withdraw or modify the CD&R Offer at any time and no legally binding obligation with respect to any transaction will exist unless and until mutually acceptable definitive documentation is executed and delivered by us and CD&R. There can be no assurance that the transaction proposed by CD&R or any related transaction will be completed or as to the terms of any such potential transaction, including with respect to pricing or timing.\nBUSINESS OVERVIEW\nCornerstone Building Brands, Inc. is the largest manufacturer of exterior building products in North America. The Company serves residential and commercial customers across new construction and the repair & remodel markets. Our mission is to be relentlessly committed to our customers and to create great building solutions that enable communities to grow and thrive.\nWe have developed and continue to implement a well-defined business strategy focused on (i) driving profitable growth in new and existing markets; (ii) leveraging operational excellence across our businesses; and (iii) implementing a capital allocation framework balanced between a focus on opportunistic investment in high return initiatives and continued debt repayment.\nWe believe that by focusing on operational excellence every day, creating a platform for future growth and investing in market-leading residential and commercial building brands, we will deliver unparalleled financial results. We design, engineer, manufacture, install and market external building products through our three operating segments: Windows, Siding, and Commercial.\nOur manufacturing processes are vertically integrated, which we believe provides cost and competitive advantages. As the leading manufacturer of vinyl windows, vinyl siding, metal roofing and wall systems and metal accessories, Cornerstone Building Brands combines a diverse portfolio of products with an expansive national footprint that includes over 21,700 employees at manufacturing, distribution and office locations primarily in North America.\nAt Cornerstone Building Brands, corporate stewardship is a responsibility that is deeply embedded in our 75-year history. Our business practices have given us the staying power to make a real difference in countless cities and neighborhoods.\nOur sales and earnings are subject to both seasonal and cyclical trends and are influenced by general economic conditions, interest rates, the price of material costs relative to other building materials, the level of residential and nonresidential construction activity, repair and remodel demand and the availability and cost of financing for construction projects. Our sales normally are lower in the first and fourth fiscal quarters of each year compared to the second and third fiscal quarters because of unfavorable weather conditions for construction and typical business planning cycles affecting construction.\nMarkets We Serve\nOur products are available across several large and attractive end markets, including residential new construction, residential repair and remodel and low-rise non-residential construction. We believe that there are favorable underlying fundamental factors that will drive long-term growth across the end markets in which we operate. We also believe the recent COVID-19 pandemic, while still causing economic uncertainty worldwide, has driven strong demand for residential repair and remodel activity, residential new construction and select segments of the low-rise non-residential construction market, such as distribution, warehouse, healthcare and educational facilities in suburban regions; however, the COVID-19 pandemic has also caused challenges in other areas of non-residential construction, most notably in retail and commercial office facilities in densely populated urban centers, where we have minimal, if any, participation. We believe our business is well-\npositioned to benefit from broader societal and population trends favoring suburban regions, as employment and living preferences shift towards such regions.\nCornerstone Building Brands is deeply committed to the communities where our customers and employees live, work and play. We recognize that our customers are increasingly environmentally conscious in their purchasing behavior, and we believe our sustainable solutions favorably address these evolving consumer preferences. For example, certain products in our portfolio are high in recycled end content, virtually 100% recyclable at the end of their useful life and often manufactured to meet or exceed specified sustainability targets, such as ENERGY STAR and LEED certifications. We recognize that efficient use of recycled materials helps to conserve natural resources and reduces environmental impact, and we are committed to driving these sustainable practices throughout our business.\nCOVID-19 Update\nWe experienced a significant decrease in customer demand across all our markets during the second quarter of 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic mostly due to delays in construction activity driven by temporary closures of non-life sustaining businesses. The continuing impact of the pandemic on our future consolidated results of operations is uncertain. During 2020, the Company quickly implemented a range of actions aimed at reducing costs and preserving liquidity. These actions included the closure of our Ambridge, Pennsylvania Commercial facility and Corona, California Windows facility, permanent workforce reductions, employee furloughs, a hiring freeze, a deferral of annual wage raises, and reducing discretionary and non-essential expenses, such as consulting expenses. Additionally, we reduced capital expenditures to focus on key strategic initiatives, such as automation, product innovation, and critical maintenance items. We believe our business model, our existing balances of domestic cash and cash equivalents, currently anticipated operating cash flows, and overall liquidity will be sufficient to meet our cash needs arising in the ordinary course of business for the next twelve months and positions us to manage our business through this crisis as it continues to unfold. We will continue to evaluate the nature and extent of the COVID-19 pandemic's impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nSignificant Business Developments\nOur significant business development activities in 2021 include the: (i) acquisition of Prime Windows LLC (April 2021), (ii) divestitures of our IMP and DBCI businesses (August 2021), (iii) acquisition of Cascade Windows, Inc. (August 2021), and (iv) acquisition of Union Corrugating Company Holding, Inc. (December 2021). In addition, in April 2021, we amended our cash flow credit and ABL credit agreements. See Note 4 - Acquisitions, Note 5 - Divestitures and Note 13 - Long Term Debt, in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for more information on our divestitures, acquisitions, and debt.\nResidential (Windows and Siding)\nOur residential building products are typically installed on a new construction home 90 to 120 days after the start of the home, therefore, there is a lag between the timing of the single-family housing start date and the time in which our products are installed on a home. From an industry perspective, we evaluate the new construction environment by reviewing the U.S. Census Bureau single family housing start statistics to assess the performance of the new construction market for a normal period. We evaluated U.S. Census Bureau single family housing starts for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to December 31, 2020 to assess the demand impacts for our products, noting that single-family housing starts increased over 12% on a seasonally adjusted annual rate (SAAR) basis due to overall economic conditions specifically for new construction. For Canada, we evaluate the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporate statistics, which showed housing starts increased by 25% for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to 2020.\nThe graph below shows the seasonally adjusted annual single family residential new construction starts as of each year end since 1982 as compiled and reported by U.S. Census Bureau:\nIn addition to new construction, we also evaluate the repair and remodel market to assess residential market conditions by evaluating the Leading Indicator of Remodeling Activity ( LIRA\u201d). For the year ended December 31, 2021, LIRA reflected that the trailing 12 months of remodeling activity increased 9% from 2020. While LIRA is a remodeling economic indicator as it tracks all remodeling activity including kitchen, bathroom and low ticket remodeling, it is not a specific metric for our residential businesses measuring solely windows and siding remodeling growth. Therefore, we utilize this index as a trend indicator for our repair and remodeling business.\nFinally, we assess our performance relative to our competitors and the overall siding industry by evaluating the marketing indicators produced by the Vinyl Siding Institute ( VSI\u201d), a third party which summarizes vinyl siding unit sales for the industry. For the year ended December 31, 2021, the VSI reported that siding units increased 9% for the industry. Overall, our Siding segment, including stone veneer, is weighted to the repair and remodel market with approximately 53% of our net sales being attributed to repair and remodeling with the remaining 47% attributed to the new construction market. Historically, we evaluate our net sales performance within the Windows segment by evaluating our net sales for the new construction market and the repair and remodel market. Overall, our Windows segment is relatively balanced with approximately 51% of our net sales attributed to new construction with the remaining 49% attributed to the repair and remodel market.\nCommercial\nOur sales and earnings are subject to both seasonal and cyclical trends and are influenced by general economic conditions, interest rates, the price of steel relative to other building materials, the level of nonresidential construction activity, roof repair and retrofit demand and the availability and cost of financing for construction projects. Our sales in the Commercial segment normally are lower in the first half of each fiscal year compared to the second half because of unfavorable weather conditions for construction and typical business planning cycles affecting construction.\nThe nonresidential construction industry is highly sensitive to national and regional macroeconomic conditions. Following a significant downturn in 2008 and 2009, the current recovery of low-rise construction has been uneven and slow. The COVID-19 pandemic interrupted some signs of steady growth in recent years. We believe that the nonresidential construction industry will return to mid-cycle levels of activity over the next several years.\nThe graph below shows the annual nonresidential new construction starts, measured in square feet, since 1982 as compiled and reported by Dodge Data & Analytics, Inc. ( Dodge\u201d):\nCurrent market estimates continue to show recovery across the nonresidential construction markets from the 2020 dip, returning above 2019 levels. According to Dodge Data & Analytics, Inc. ( Dodge\u201d), low-rise nonresidential construction starts as measured in square feet and comprising buildings of up to five stories, were up in fiscal 2021 by approximately 19% as compared to our fiscal 2020.\nThe leading indicators that we follow and that typically have the most meaningful correlation to nonresidential low-rise construction starts are the American Institute of Architects' ( AIA\u201d) Architecture Mixed Use Index, Dodge Residential single family starts and the Conference Board Leading Economic Index ( LEI\u201d). Historically, there has been a very high correlation to the Dodge low-rise nonresidential starts when the three leading indicators are combined and then seasonally adjusted.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThis section of the Form 10-K generally discusses fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020 items and year-over-year comparisons of these periods. Discussions of fiscal 2019 items and year-over-year comparisons between fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019 that are not included in this Form 10-K can be found in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d in Part II, Item 7 of Cornerstone's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020.\nThe following table represents key results of operations on a consolidated basis for the periods indicated: Table 15: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> (Amounts in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31,\n2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31,\n2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ change </td> <td>% change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net sales </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,583,137 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,617,369 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>965,768 </td> <td> </td> <td>20.9 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross profit </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,199,075 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,050,320 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>148,755 </td> <td> </td> <td>14.2 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>% of net sales </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>21.5 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>22.7 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling, general and administrative expenses </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>649,472 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>579,200 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>70,272 </td> <td> </td> <td>12.1 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>% of net sales </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11.6 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>12.5 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Restructuring and impairment charges, net </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>26,247 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>34,120 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(7,873) </td> <td> </td> <td>(23.1) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Strategic development and acquisition related costs </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>27,875 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>19,341 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,534 </td> <td> </td> <td>44.1 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>191,301 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>213,610 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(22,309) </td> <td> </td> <td>(10.4) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income (loss) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>665,859 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(482,778) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,148,637 </td> <td> </td> <td>(237.9) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet sales - Consolidated net sales for the year ended December 31, 2021 increased by approximately 20.9%, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase was primarily due to favorable price actions taken in all segments to offset commodity inflation, higher volume mainly from increased demand in the residential end markets, and an increase from acquisitions ($113.2 million in the Windows segment from Prime and Cascade and $21.9 million in the Commercial segment from UCC).\nGross profit % of net sales - The Company's gross profit percentage was 21.5% for the year ended December 31, 2021, which was a 120 basis point decrease from the year ended December 31, 2020. The manufacturing inefficiencies and higher costs to serve our customers that were brought on by supply chain disruptions and labor constraints drove the decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales. This reduction was partially offset by positive price mix net of inflation.\nSelling, general, and administrative expenses increased 12.1% during the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. The return of near-term costs, such as variable compensation, professional services, and sales commissions drove the higher selling, general, and administrative expenses at December 31, 2021 as compared to December 31, 2020.\nRestructuring and impairment charges, net decreased $7.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily due to asset impairments in 2021 which were lower in total than the restructuring charges taken in 2020 in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nStrategic development and acquisition related costs increased $8.5 million, during the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020 as our merger-related activities increased as a result of strategic portfolio rationalization actions to accelerate long-term value creation.\nInterest expense decreased $22.3 million or 10.4% in 2021, primarily as a result of the redemption of the $645 million 8.00% Senior Notes coupled with the refinancing of the Current Term Loan Facility.\nConsolidated provision (benefit) for income taxes was an expense of $236.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to an expense of $5.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2021 was 26.2% compared to 1.2% for the year ended December 31, 2020. The change in the effective tax rate was primarily driven by the divestitures and improved financial results for the year ended December 31, 2021, and the impact associated with the goodwill impairment recorded during the year ended December 31, 2020.\nNet Income (loss) - Net income was $665.9 million or $5.19 per diluted share. Effective execution of our priorities, which included maintaining cost discipline, strengthening price leadership, driving operational excellence and investing in growth opportunities delivered improved profitability in 2021 (excluding the impact of the gain on sales from the divestitures in 2021 and the impact of the goodwill impairment in 2020).\nSegment Results of Operations\nWe report our segment information in the same way management internally organizes the business in assessing performance and making decisions regarding allocation of resources in accordance with ASC 280, Segment Reporting. We have determined that we have three reportable segments, organized and managed principally by the different industry sectors they serve. While the segments often operate using shared infrastructure, each reportable segment is managed to address specific customer needs in these diverse market sectors. We report all other business activities in Corporate and unallocated costs. Corporate assets consist primarily of cash, investments, prepaid expenses, current and deferred taxes and property, plant and equipment associated with our headquarters in Cary, North Carolina and office in Houston, Texas. These items (and income and expenses related to these items) are not allocated to the operating segments. Corporate unallocated expenses primarily include share-based compensation expenses, restructuring charges, acquisition costs, and other expenses related to executive, legal, finance, tax, treasury, human resources, information technology and strategic sourcing, and corporate travel expenses. Additional unallocated amounts primarily include non-operating items such as interest income, interest expense, loss on extinguishment of debt and other income (expense).\nOne of the primary measurements used by management to measure the financial performance of each segment is Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss), adjusted for the following items: income tax (benefit) expense; depreciation and amortization; interest expense, net; restructuring and impairment charges; strategic development and acquisition related costs; gain on divestitures; goodwill impairment; share-based compensation expense; non-cash foreign exchange transaction/translation (income) loss; other non-cash items; and other items.\nThe presentation of segment results below includes a reconciliation of the changes for each segment reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP to a pro forma basis to allow investors and the Company to meaningfully evaluate the percentage change on a comparable basis from period to period. The pro forma financial information is based on the historical information of Cornerstone Building Brands, which includes historical information of Kleary Masonry, Inc. ( Kleary\u201d), which the Company acquired on March 2, 2020; Prime Windows LLC ( Prime Windows\u201d), which the Company acquired on April 30, 2021; Cascade Windows, Inc. ( Cascade Windows\u201d), which the Company acquired on August 20, 2021; and the insulated metals panels ( IMP\u201d) and the roll-up sheet doors ( DBCI\u201d) businesses, which the Company divested on August 9, 2021 and August 18, 2021, respectively. The pro forma financial information does not give effect to the potential impact of current financial conditions, any anticipated synergies, operating efficiencies or cost savings that may result from the Kleary, Prime Windows and Cascade Windows acquisitions; or any integration costs; and from the IMP and DBCI divestitures. Pro forma balances are not necessarily indicative of operating results had the Kleary, Prime Windows and Cascade Windows acquisitions and the IMP and DBCI divestitures occurred on January 1, 2020 or of future results. UCC, which was acquired on December 3, 2021, is only included from the acquisition date as pro forma results would comprise substantially all of the comparative periods and would not be meaningful for comparison.\nSee Note 22 - Segment Information in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for more information on our segments.\nNON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\nSet forth below are certain non-GAAP financial measures\u201d as defined under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Management believes the use of such non-GAAP financial measures assists investors in understanding the ongoing operating performance of the Company by presenting the financial results between periods on a more comparable basis. Such non-GAAP financial measures should not be construed as an alternative to reported results determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We have included reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and provided in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\nThe following tables present a comparison of net sales as reported to pro forma net sales for Cornerstone Building Brands as if the Cascade Windows, Prime Windows and Kleary acquisitions, and IMP and DBCI divestitures had each occurred on January 1, 2020 rather than the respective date referenced above for each transaction. UCC's results are only included from the acquisition date as discussed above.\nTable 16: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>

2021 and Cascade Windows through August 19, 2021; and reflects the impact from January 1, 2020 of the divestitures of IMP and DBCI through the divestiture dates of August 9, 2021 and August 18, 2021, respectively.\n(2)Primarily consists of $29.0 million and $17.1 million of share-based compensation expense for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively; $11.6 million in costs for the year ended December 31, 2021 associated with debt refinancing transactions; and $(0.4) million and $12.5 million of COVID-19 pandemic related costs for years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nPro forma net sales for the year ended December 31, 2021 increased $1,026.8 million, a 23.0% improvement over pro forma net sales in the same period a year ago. Disciplined price actions in response to rising commodity costs and other inflationary impacts across all segments drove approximately 75% of the increase. Rapid recovery of residential demand drove increased volume within the Windows and Siding segments of approximately $210 million, and non-residential demand drove increased volume in the Commercial segment of approximately $48 million.\nOperating income (loss) for the year ended December 31, 2021 increased to $1,137.2 million income as compared to an operating loss of $266.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2020 primarily as a result of the gain on the sales of the IMP and DBCI businesses of $831.3 million in 2021 and the goodwill impairment of $503.2 million in the comparable period.\nPro forma Adjusted EBITDA for 2021 was $688.0 million or 12.5% of pro forma net sales, an improvement of 24.1% or 10 basis points from the same pro forma period a year ago. The improvement was primarily driven by positive price mix net of inflation of $210 million and higher demand of $85 million, mostly from the rapid recovery in the residential end markets. Partially reducing these favorable impacts were manufacturing inefficiencies and higher costs to serve our customers as a result of the challenges brought on by supply chain disruptions and labor constraints of $93 million. SG&A costs were $69 million higher than the same pro forma period last year primarily due to the return of near-term costs, such as variable compensation, professional services, and sales commissions.\nTable 18: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Windows </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ended </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Amounts in thousands) </td> <td>December 31,\n2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31,\n2020 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net sales </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,322,277 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,889,625 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impact of acquisitions(1)\n</td> <td>132,141 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>206,639 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Pro forma net sales </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,454,418 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,096,264 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income (loss), GAAP </td> <td>$ </td> <td>100,725 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(223,646) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Restructuring and impairment charges, net </td> <td>1,252 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,499 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Strategic development and acquisition related costs </td> <td>2,976 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Goodwill impairment </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>320,990 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization </td> <td>134,626 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>121,519 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other </td> <td>(88) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,338 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted EBITDA </td> <td>239,491 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>233,716 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impact of acquisitions(1)\n</td> <td>15,314 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>25,740 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Pro forma Adjusted EBITDA </td> <td>$ </td> <td>254,805 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>259,456 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted EBITDA as a % of net sales </td> <td>10.3 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>12.4 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Pro forma Adjusted EBITDA as a % of pro forma net sales </td> <td>10.4 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>12.4 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1)Reflects the impact of the net sales and Adjusted EBITDA of Prime Windows LLC through April 29, 2021 and Cascade Windows Inc. through August 19, 2021 as if the acquisitions had occurred on January 1, 2020.\nPro forma net sales for the year ended December 31, 2021 were 17.1% higher compared to the year ended December 31, 2020 due to 9.0% from disciplined price actions in response to rising commodity costs and other inflationary impacts coupled with approximately 8.1% increase in sales volume as a result of the rapid recovery within the residential end markets in the U.S. and Canada.\nOperating income (loss) for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $100.7 million of operating income as compared to an operating loss of $223.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2020 primarily due to the goodwill impairment of $321.0 million in the comparable year.\nPro forma Adjusted EBITDA was $254.8 million or 10.4% of pro forma net sales, a 200 basis point decline over the year ended December 31, 2020. Positive price mix net of inflation of $22.8 million and higher demand of $46.6 million, mostly from the rapid recovery in the residential end markets, were partially offset by manufacturing inefficiencies and higher costs to serve our customers as a result of the challenges brought on by supply chain disruptions and labor constraints of $61.3\nmillion.

The rapid recovery of residential demand contributed 3.4% of the favorable increase, while disciplined price actions to offset inflationary raw material costs resulted in favorable price mix of approximately 15.1% versus the pro forma prior year.\nOperating income for the year ended December 31, 2021 increased to $137.8 million as compared to an operating loss of $(61.9) million for the year ended December 31, 2020 primarily due to a goodwill impairment of $176.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2020. Excluding the 2020 goodwill impairment of $176.8 million and a 2021 asset impairment of $13.9 million related to a discontinued product line, operating income increased 32.1% in 2021 primarily due to disciplined price actions net of inflation of $40.0 million, favorable volume of $12.2 million and lower strategic development costs, offsetting higher costs in manufacturing and SG&A.\nPro Forma Adjusted EBITDA was $265.7 million or 19.5% of pro forma net sales, a 160 basis point decline over the year ended December 31, 2020. As mentioned above, positive price mix net of inflation and higher volume partially offset increased manufacturing costs to serve our customers and inefficiencies from supply chain disruptions of $16.7 million and an increase in SG&A of $12.8 million from return of near-term costs, such as variable compensation and professional service expenses.\nTable 20: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ended </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Amounts in thousands) </td> <td>December 31,\n2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31,\n2020 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net Sales </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,896,780 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,585,798 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impact of divestitures(1)\n</td> <td>(231,347) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(375,261) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Pro forma net sales </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,665,433 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,210,537 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income, GAAP </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,104,335 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>159,586 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Restructuring and impairment charges, net </td> <td>10,131 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>20,270 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Strategic development and acquisition related costs </td> <td>3,103 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(262) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain on divestitures </td> <td>(831,252) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Goodwill impairment </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,407 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization </td> <td>36,282 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>45,213 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other </td> <td>934 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,346 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted EBITDA </td> <td>323,533 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>234,560 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impact of divestitures(1)\n</td> <td>(23,267) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(79,832) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Pro forma Adjusted EBITDA </td> <td>$ </td> <td>300,266 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>154,728 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted EBITDA as a % of net sales </td> <td>17.1 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>14.8 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Pro forma Adjusted EBITDA as a % of pro forma net sales </td> <td>18.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>12.8 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1)Reflects the net adjustments of IMP and DBCI through the divestiture dates of August 9, 2021 and August 18, 2021, respectively, as if the divestitures had occurred on January 1, 2020.\nPro forma net sales for the year ended December 31, 2021 were higher by 37.6% compared to the year ended December 31, 2020 driven approximately by a 33.7% increase from disciplined price actions to mitigate rising steel costs. Additionally, higher volumes of 3.9% from recovering demand in the non-residential end markets also contributed to the increase in net sales. Included in pro forma net sales at December 31, 2021 are $21.9 million of net sales from Union Corrugating Company Holdings, Inc. ( UCC\u201d) from the acquisition date on December 3, 2021. The UCC acquisition furthers our presence in the high-growth residential metal roofing market.\nOperating income for the year ended December 31, 2021 increased $944.7 million compared to year ended December 31, 2020 primarily due to the gain on the sales of the IMP and DBCI businesses as a result of strategic portfolio rationalization actions to accelerate long-term value creation. Excluding the gain on the sales in 2021 and the goodwill impairment in 2020, operating income of $273.1 million increased 65.5% primarily from the realization of price actions taken to offset rising steel and other inflationary impacts. Additionally, higher volume of $26 million from recovering non-residential end markets offset manufacturing inefficiencies from steel constraints and higher SG&A costs. Included in operating income at December 31, 2021 is $1.8 million from UCC from the acquisition date.\nPro forma Adjusted EBITDA was $300.3 million or 18.0% of pro forma net sales, a 520 basis point improvement compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. Included in pro forma EBITDA at December 31, 2021 is $2.2 million from UCC from the acquisition date. As mentioned above, positive price mix net of inflation of approximately $147.6 million and higher volume of $26.3 million offset manufacturing inefficiencies of $14.7 million and higher SG&A costs of $13.6 million.\nUnallocated Operating Loss\nTable 21: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ended </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Amounts in thousands) </td> <td>December 31,\n2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31,\n2020 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Statement of operations data: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>SG&A expenses </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(180,817) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(131,087) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Strategic development and acquisition related costs </td> <td>(24,770) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(9,429) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating loss </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(205,587) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(140,516) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nUnallocated (Corporate expenses) operating losses include items that are not directly attributed to or allocated to our reporting segments.

The unallocated operating loss for the year ended December 31, 2021 increased by $65.1 million or 46.3% compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. The change is primarily due to the increase in strategic development expenses as well as debt issuance costs and the return of near-term expenses such as variable compensation and professional services. Unallocated operating loss includes $29.0 million and $17.1 million of share-based compensation expense for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nGeneral\nOur ongoing principal source of funds is cash generated from operations, supplemented by borrowings against our asset-based lending and revolving credit facility, as necessary.

See the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows in the consolidated financial statements for additional information.\nInvesting Activities\nCash provided by investing activities was $549.5 million during fiscal 2021 compared to $120.1 million used during fiscal 2020. During fiscal 2021, we paid approximately $528.3 million (net of cash acquired) toward acquisitions, primarily for the acquisitions of UCC, Cascade Windows and Prime Windows; received proceeds of $1,187.3 million from the divestitures of our insulated metal panels and roll-up sheet doors businesses; received proceeds of $5.1 million from the sale of PP&E, and used $114.7 million for capital expenditures. During fiscal 2020, we paid approximately $41.8 million (net of\ncash acquired) for the acquisition of Kleary, used $81.9 million for capital expenditures, and received proceeds of $3.6 million from the sale of PP&E.\nFinancing Activities\nCash used in financing activities was $617.2 million in fiscal 2021 compared to $389.7 million provided by financing activities in fiscal 2020. During fiscal 2021, we increased our Current Term Loan Facility by $108.4 million, borrowed and then repaid $190.0 million on our Current ABL Facility, paid $670.8 million to redeem the 8.00% Senior Notes, and paid quarterly installments totaling $25.9 million on the Current Term Loan Facility.\nDuring fiscal 2020, we issued $500.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 6.125% Senior Notes due January 2029, borrowed $40.0 million on our Existing ABL Facility to finance the acquisition of Kleary, borrowed an additional $305.0 million on our Existing ABL Facility and repaid all outstanding ABL Facility balances at December 31, 2020, and borrowed and repaid $115.0 million on our Existing Cash Flow Revolver balances. Proceeds from the offering of the 6.125% Senior Notes were used to pay down the Existing ABL Facility and Existing Cash Flow Revolver balances. Additionally, during fiscal 2020, we paid quarterly installments totaling $25.6 million on our Term Loan Facility and used $6.4 million to repurchase shares of our outstanding common stock under our stock repurchase programs.\nEquity Investment\nOn August 25, 2020, the Company filed a shelf registration statement on Form S-3, declared effective by the SEC on September 2, 2020, registering the resale of shares of the Company's common stock held by CD&R Pisces. The Company had previously registered the resale of shares of the Company's common stock held by the CD&R Fund VIII Investor Group and the Golden Gate Investor Group.\nAt December 31, 2021 and 2020, the CD&R Investor Group owned approximately 48.8% and 49.4%, respectively, of the outstanding shares of our Common Stock.\nDebt\nBelow is a reconciliation of the Company's net debt (in thousands). Management considers net debt to be more representative of the Company's financial position than total debt due to the amount of cash and cash equivalents held by the Company and the ability to utilize cash and cash equivalents to reduce debt if needed.\nTable 24: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ended </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>December 31,\n2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31,\n2020 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Asset-based revolving credit facility due April 2026 </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Term loan facility due April 2028 </td> <td>2,580,500 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,497,967 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Cash flow revolver due April 2026 </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>8.00% senior notes due April 2026 </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>645,000 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>6.125% senior notes due January 2029 </td> <td>500,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>500,000 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Debt </td> <td>3,080,500 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,642,967 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less: cash and cash equivalents </td> <td>394,447 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>674,255 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net Debt </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,686,053 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,968,712 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOn April 15, 2021, the Company redeemed its $645 million aggregate principal amount of 8.00% Senior Notes using available cash from the balance sheet and net proceeds from its extended and upsized senior term loan facility. The Company successfully upsized and extended the maturity of its $2,492 million senior term loan facility due 2025 in the form of $2,600 million in Tranche B term loans due April 12, 2028. Additionally, the Company amended and refinanced its senior cash flow based and asset-based revolving credit facilities, extending the maturities to April 12, 2026.\nIn connection with the new Tranche B term loans, the Company also terminated two interest rate swaps and entered into two new swaps maturing in April 2026 on an aggregate notional value of $1.5 billion. The interest rate swaps effectively convert a portion of the floating rate interest payment into a fixed rate interest payment.\nWe may not be successful in refinancing, extending the maturity or otherwise amending the terms of our outstanding indebtedness in the future because of market conditions, disruptions in the debt markets, our financial performance or other reasons. Furthermore, the terms of any refinancing, extension or amendment may not be as favorable as the current terms of our indebtedness. If we are not successful in refinancing our indebtedness or extending its maturity, we and our subsidiaries\ncould face substantial liquidity problems and may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures, sell assets, seek additional capital or restructure our indebtedness.\nFor additional information, see Note 13 - Long-Term Debt and Note 14 - Derivatives in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.\nAdditional Liquidity Considerations\nWe periodically evaluate our liquidity requirements, capital needs and availability of resources in view of inventory levels, expansion plans, debt service requirements and other operating cash needs. To meet our short-term and long-term liquidity requirements, including payment of operating expenses and repayment of debt, we rely primarily on cash from operations. The following table summarizes key liquidity measures under the Current ABL Credit Agreement and the Current Cash Flow Credit Agreement in effect as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 (in thousands):\nTable 25: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ended </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>December 31,\n2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31,\n2020 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Asset-based revolving credit facility due April 2026 </td> <td>$ </td> <td>611,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>611,000 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Eligible borrowing base </td> <td>611,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>568,000 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less: Borrowings </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less: LCs outstanding and priority payables </td> <td>45,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>40,000 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net ABL availability </td> <td>566,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>528,000 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Plus: Cash flow revolver due April 2026 </td> <td>115,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>115,000 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Plus: cash and cash equivalents </td> <td>394,447 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>674,255 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Liquidity </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,075,447 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,317,255 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOn April 15, 2021, the Company redeemed its $645 million aggregate principal amount of 8.00% Senior Notes, as noted above, which reduced total liquidity. We expect that cash generated from operations and our availability under the ABL Credit Facility and Current Cash Flow Revolver will be sufficient to provide us the ability to fund our operations and to provide the increased working capital necessary to support our strategy and fund planned capital expenditures for fiscal 2022 and expansion when needed.\nConsistent with our growth strategy, we evaluate potential acquisitions that would provide additional synergies in our Windows, Siding and Commercial segments. From time to time, we may enter into letters of intent or agreements to acquire assets or companies in these segments. The consummation of these transactions could require substantial cash payments and/or issuance of additional debt.\nOn April 30, 2021, the Company acquired Prime Windows. Prime Windows serves residential new construction and repair and remodel markets with energy efficient vinyl window and door products from two manufacturing facilities in the United States, expanding our manufacturing capabilities and creating new opportunities for us in the Western United States. This acquisition was funded through borrowings under the Company's existing credit facilities.\nOn August 20, 2021, the Company acquired Cascade Windows. Cascade Windows serves the residential new construction and repair and remodel markets with energy efficient vinyl window and door products from various manufacturing facilities in the United States, expanding our manufacturing capabilities and creating new opportunities for us in the Western United States. This acquisition was funded with cash available on the balance sheet.\nOn December 3, 2021, the Company acquired Union Corrugating Company Holdings, Inc. ( UCC\u201d). UCC provides metal roofing, roofing components and accessories from locations primarily in the Central and Eastern U.S. regions. This acquisition was funded with cash available on the balance sheet.\nWe also evaluate possible dispositions of assets or businesses when such assets or businesses are no longer core to our operations and do not fit into our long-term strategy. On August 9, 2021, the Company completed the sale of its insulated metal panels ( IMP\u201d) business to Nucor Insulated Panel Group Inc. and certain of its subsidiaries (collectively, Nucor\u201d) in a cash transaction for $1 billion. The IMP transaction included products sold under the Metl-Span and CENTRIA brands. On August 18, 2021, the Company completed the sale of its roll-up sheet doors business to Janus International Group, Inc. ( Janus\u201d) in a cash transaction for $169 million. The roll-up sheet doors transaction included products sold under the DBCI brand.\nFrom time to time, we have used available funds to repurchase shares of our common stock under our stock repurchase program. On March 7, 2018, we announced that our Board of Directors authorized a new stock repurchase program for the repurchase of up to an aggregate of $50.0 million of our outstanding Common Stock. Under this repurchase program, we are authorized to repurchase shares at times and in amounts that we deem appropriate in accordance with all applicable securities laws and regulations. Shares repurchased are usually retired. There is no time limit on the duration of the program. During fiscal 2021, we did not repurchase shares under the stock repurchase program. As of December 31, 2021, approximately $49.1 million remained available for stock repurchases under the program. In addition to repurchases of shares of our common stock under our stock repurchase program, we also withhold shares of restricted stock to satisfy minimum tax withholding obligations arising in connection with the vesting of awards of share-based compensation.\nWe may from time to time take steps to reduce our debt or otherwise improve our financial position. These actions could include prepayments, open market debt repurchases, negotiated repurchases, other redemptions or retirements of outstanding debt, opportunistic refinancing of debt and raising additional capital. The amount of prepayments or the amount of debt that may be refinanced, repurchased or otherwise retired, if any, will depend on market conditions, trading levels of our debt, our cash position, compliance with debt covenants and other considerations. Our affiliates may also purchase our debt from time to time through open market purchases or other transactions. In such cases, our debt may not be retired, in which case we would continue to pay interest in accordance with the terms of the debt, and we would continue to reflect the debt as outstanding on our consolidated balance sheets.\nCONTINGENT LIABILITIES AND COMMITMENTS\nOur insurance carriers require us to secure standby letters of credit as a collateral requirement for our projected exposure to future period claims growth and loss development, including IBNR claims. For all insurance carriers, the total standby letters of credit are approximately $31.9 million and $27.2 million at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, which require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those estimates that may have a significant effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Our significant accounting policies are disclosed in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements. The following discussion of critical accounting policies addresses those policies that are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require significant judgment and estimates. We base our estimates and judgment on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nAccounting for acquisitions, intangible assets and goodwill. Accounting for the acquisition of a business requires the allocation of the purchase price to the various assets and liabilities of the acquired business. For most assets and liabilities, purchase price allocation is accomplished by recording the asset or liability at its estimated fair value. The most difficult estimations of individual fair values are those involving property, plant and equipment and identifiable intangible assets. We use all available information to make these fair value determinations and, for major business acquisitions, typically engage an outside appraisal firm to assist in the fair value determination of the acquired long-lived assets.\nThe Company has approximately $1,358.1 million of goodwill as of December 31, 2021, of which approximately $541.2 million pertains to our Windows segment, $655.1 million pertains to our Siding segment, and $161.8 million pertains to our Commercial segment. We perform an annual impairment assessment of goodwill. Additionally, we assess goodwill for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the fair values may be below the carrying values of the reporting units. Unforeseen events, changes in circumstances and market conditions and material differences in the value of intangible assets due to changes in estimates of future cash flows could negatively affect the fair value of our assets and result in a non-cash impairment charge. Some factors considered important that could trigger an impairment review include the following: significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results, significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business and significant sustained negative industry or economic trends, such as the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe fair value of our reporting units is based on a blend of estimated discounted cash flows and publicly traded company multiples. A significant reduction in projected sales and earnings which would lead to a reduction in future cash flows could indicate potential impairment. The results from each of these models are then weighted and combined into a single estimate of fair value for our reporting units. Estimated discounted cash flows are based on projected sales and related cost of sales. Publicly traded company multiples and acquisition multiples are derived from information on traded shares and analysis of recent acquisitions in the marketplace, respectively, for companies with operations similar to ours. The primary assumptions used in these various models include earnings multiples of acquisitions in a comparable industry, future cash flow estimates\nof each of the reporting units, weighted average cost of capital, working capital and capital expenditure requirements. Management does not believe the estimates used in the analysis are reasonably likely to change materially in the future, but we will continue to assess the estimates in the future based on the expectations of the reporting units. Changes in assumptions used in the fair value calculation could result in an estimated reporting unit fair value that is below the carrying value, which may result in an impairment of goodwill.\nWe completed our annual goodwill impairment test as of October 3, 2021 for each of our reporting units with goodwill. We have the option of performing an assessment of certain qualitative factors to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value or proceeding directly to a quantitative impairment test. We elected to apply the quantitative assessment for the goodwill impairment test for our reporting units within each of our operating segments as of October 3, 2021.\nA summary of the key assumptions utilized in the goodwill impairment analysis at October 3, 2021, as it relates to the fair values and the sensitivities for these assumptions follows:\nTable 26: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>As of October 3, 2021 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Windows </td> <td> </td> <td>Siding </td> <td> </td> <td>Engineered Building Systems </td> <td> </td> <td>Metal Components </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Assumptions: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income Approach: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Terminal growth rate </td> <td>3.5 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>3.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>3.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>3.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Discount rate </td> <td>17.5 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>13.5 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>17.5 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>13.5 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Market approach: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Control premium </td> <td>0.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>0.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>10.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>10.0 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Sensitivities </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Estimated fair value change in the event of a 1% decrease in the terminal year growth </td> <td>$ </td> <td>58,698 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>118,932 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>26,843 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>28,149 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Estimated fair value change in the event of a 1% decrease in the discount rate </td> <td>$ </td> <td>124,389 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>226,792 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>50,247 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>44,064 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Estimated fair value change in the event of a 1% decrease in the control premium </td> <td>n/a </td> <td> </td> <td>n/a </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>6,627 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,402 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOverall, we utilize the same key assumptions in preparing the prospective financial information utilized in the discounted cash flow test for the reporting units. However, each reporting unit is impacted differently by industry trends, how market factors are influencing the reporting units' expected performance, competition, and other unique business factors as mentioned above. Table 27: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(in thousands) </td> <td>As of October 3, 2021 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Estimated Windows reporting unit fair value increase in the event of a 10% increase in the weighting of the market multiples method </td> <td>$ </td> <td>8,920 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Estimated Siding reporting unit fair value increase in the event of a 10% increase in the weighting of the market multiples method </td> <td>$ </td> <td>34,190 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Estimated Engineered Building Systems reporting unit fair value increase in the event of a 10% increase in the weighting of the market multiples method\n</td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,480 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Estimated Metal Components reporting unit fair value increase in the event of a 10% increase in the weighting of the market multiples method\n</td> <td>$ </td> <td>6,530 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nThe Company's annual goodwill impairment tests performed as of October 3, 2021 indicated no impairment. The Company's estimate of the fair value of its Windows, Siding, Engineered Building Systems, and Metal Components reporting units exceeded their carrying values by approximately 19%, 41%, 444%, and 172%, respectively.\nWe provide no assurance that: (1) valuation multiples will not decline, (2) discount rates will not increase, or (3) the earnings, book values or projected earnings and cash flows of our reporting units will not decline. We will continue to analyze changes to these assumptions in future periods. We will continue to evaluate goodwill during future periods and\nfuture declines in the residential housing and remodel markets and nonresidential markets as well as economic conditions could result in future goodwill impairments.\nWarranty. The Company sells a number of products and offers a number of warranties. The specific terms and conditions of these warranties vary depending on the product sold. The Company's warranty liabilities are undiscounted and adjusted for inflation based on third party actuarial estimates. Factors that affect the Company's warranty liabilities include the number of units sold, historical and anticipated rates of warranty claims, cost per claim and new product introduction. Warranties are normally limited to replacement or service of defective components for the original customer. Some warranties are transferable to subsequent owners and are generally limited to ten years from the date of manufacture or require pro-rata payments from the customer. A provision for estimated warranty costs is recorded based on historical experience and the Company periodically adjusts these provisions to reflect actual experience. Warranty costs are included within cost of goods sold. The Company assesses the adequacy of the recorded warranty claims and adjusts the amounts as necessary. Separately, upon the sale of a weathertightness warranty in the Commercial segment, the Company records the resulting revenue as deferred revenue, which is included in other accrued expenses and other long-term liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets depending on when the revenues are expected to be recognized.\nIncome taxes. The determination of our provision for income taxes requires significant judgment, the use of estimates and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws. The amount recorded in our consolidated financial statements reflects estimates of final amounts due to timing of completion and filing of actual income tax returns. Estimates are required with respect to, among other things, the potential utilization of operating and capital loss carry-forwards for federal, state, and foreign income tax purposes and valuation allowances required, if any, for tax assets that may not be realized in the future. We establish reserves when, despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully supportable, certain positions could be challenged, and the positions may not be fully sustained. Our provision for income taxes reflects a combination of income earned and taxed in the various U.S. federal and state, Canadian federal and provincial, Mexican federal, and other jurisdictions. Jurisdictional tax law changes, increases or decreases in permanent differences between book and tax items, accruals or adjustments of accruals for tax contingencies or valuation allowances, and the change in the mix of earnings from these taxing jurisdictions all affect the overall effective tax rate.\nAs of December 31, 2021, the $41.7 million net operating loss carryforward included $20.8 million for U.S federal losses, $13.3 million for U.S. state losses and $7.6 million for foreign losses. The state net operating loss carryforwards began to expire in 2021, if unused, and the federal and foreign loss carryforwards will begin to expire in fiscal 2029, if unused. There are limitations on the utilization of certain net operating losses.\nRECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS\nSee Note 3 - Accounting Pronouncements in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for information on recent accounting pronouncements.", "summary": "- The Company reported fourth quarter diluted earnings per share of $0.18, compared to $0.14 in the prior year period.\n- Adjusted earnings per share were $0.23 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 compared to $0.18 in the prior year period.\n- Fiscal 2018 diluted earnings per share were $1.16 compared to $0.91 in fiscal 2017.\n- Adjusted earnings per share were $1.47 in fiscal 2018 compared to $1.26 in fiscal 2017.\n- The increase in adjusted earnings per share for both the fourth quarter and full year was primarily driven by higher adjusted operating income, including the impact of acquisitions, and a lower adjusted tax rate, partially offset by an increase in depreciation and amortization.\n- Net cash provided by operating activities was $308.4 million for fiscal 2018, compared to $215.9 million in fiscal 2017.\n- The increase in net cash provided by operating activities was primarily driven by higher cash

There can be no assurance that the transaction proposed by CD&R or any related transaction will be completed or as to the terms of any such potential transaction, including with respect to pricing or timing.\nBUSINESS OVERVIEW\nCornerstone Building Brands, Inc. is the largest manufacturer of exterior building products in North America. The Company serves residential and commercial customers across new construction and the repair & remodel markets. Our mission is to be relentlessly committed to our customers and to create great building solutions that enable communities to grow and thrive.\nWe have developed and continue to implement a well-defined business strategy focused on (i) driving profitable growth in new and existing markets; (ii) leveraging operational excellence across our businesses; and (iii) implementing a capital allocation framework balanced between a focus on opportunistic investment in high return initiatives and continued debt repayment.\nWe believe that by focusing on operational excellence every day, creating a platform for future growth and investing in market-leading residential and commercial building brands, we will deliver unparalleled financial results. We design, engineer, manufacture, install and market external building products through our three operating segments: Windows, Siding, and Commercial.\nOur manufacturing processes are vertically integrated, which we believe provides cost and competitive advantages. As the leading manufacturer of vinyl windows, vinyl siding, metal roofing and wall systems and metal accessories, Cornerstone Building Brands combines a diverse portfolio of products with an expansive national footprint that includes over 21,700 employees at manufacturing, distribution and office locations primarily in North America.\nAt Cornerstone Building Brands, corporate stewardship is a responsibility that is deeply embedded in our 75-year history. Our business practices have given us the staying power to make a real difference in countless cities and neighborhoods.\nOur sales and earnings are subject to both seasonal and cyclical trends and are influenced by general economic conditions, interest rates, the price of material costs relative to other building materials, the level of residential and nonresidential construction activity, repair and remodel demand and the availability and cost of financing for construction projects. Our sales normally are lower in the first and fourth fiscal quarters of each year compared to the second and third fiscal quarters because of unfavorable weather conditions for construction and typical business planning cycles affecting construction.\nMarkets We Serve\nOur products are available across several large and attractive end markets, including residential new construction, residential repair and remodel and low-rise non-residential construction. We believe that there are favorable underlying fundamental factors that will drive long-term growth across the end markets in which we operate. We also believe the recent COVID-19 pandemic, while still causing economic uncertainty worldwide, has driven strong demand for residential repair and remodel activity, residential new construction and select segments of the low-rise non-residential construction market, such as distribution, warehouse, healthcare and educational facilities in suburban regions; however, the COVID-19 pandemic has also caused challenges in other areas of non-residential construction, most notably in retail and commercial office facilities in densely populated urban centers, where we have minimal, if any, participation. We believe our business is well-\npositioned to benefit from broader societal and population trends favoring suburban regions, as employment and living preferences shift towards such regions.\nCornerstone Building Brands is deeply committed to the communities where our customers and employees live, work and play. We recognize that our customers are increasingly environmentally conscious in their purchasing behavior, and we believe our sustainable solutions favorably address these evolving consumer preferences. For example, certain products in our portfolio are high in recycled end content, virtually 100% recyclable at the end of their useful life and often manufactured to meet or exceed specified sustainability targets, such as ENERGY STAR and LEED certifications. We recognize that efficient use of recycled materials helps to conserve natural resources and reduces environmental impact, and we are committed to driving these sustainable practices throughout our business.\nCOVID-19 Update\nWe experienced a significant decrease in customer demand across all our markets during the second quarter of 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic mostly due to delays in construction activity driven by temporary closures of non-life sustaining businesses. The continuing impact of the pandemic on our future consolidated results of operations is uncertain. During 2020, the Company quickly implemented a range of actions aimed at reducing costs and preserving liquidity. These actions included the closure of our Ambridge, Pennsylvania Commercial facility and Corona, California Windows facility, permanent workforce reductions, employee furloughs, a hiring freeze, a deferral of annual wage raises, and reducing discretionary and non-essential expenses, such as consulting expenses. Additionally, we reduced capital expenditures to focus on key strategic initiatives, such as automation, product innovation, and critical maintenance items. We believe our business model, our existing balances of domestic cash and cash equivalents, currently anticipated operating cash flows, and overall liquidity will be sufficient to meet our cash needs arising in the ordinary course of business for the next twelve months and positions us to manage our business through this crisis as it continues to unfold. We will continue to evaluate the nature and extent of the COVID-19 pandemic's impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nSignificant Business Developments\nOur significant business development activities in 2021 include the: (i) acquisition of Prime Windows LLC (April 2021), (ii) divestitures of our IMP and DBCI businesses (August 2021), (iii) acquisition of Cascade Windows, Inc. (August 2021), and (iv) acquisition of Union Corrugating Company Holding, Inc. (December 2021). In addition, in April 2021, we amended our cash flow credit and ABL credit agreements. See Note 4 - Acquisitions, Note 5 - Divestitures and Note 13 - Long Term Debt, in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for more information on our divestitures, acquisitions, and debt.\nResidential (Windows and Siding)\nOur residential building products are typically installed on a new construction home 90 to 120 days after the start of the home, therefore, there is a lag between the timing of the single-family housing start date and the time in which our products are installed on a home. From an industry perspective, we evaluate the new construction environment by reviewing the U.S. Census Bureau single family housing start statistics to assess the performance of the new construction market for a normal period. We evaluated U.S. Census Bureau single family housing starts for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to December 31, 2020 to assess the demand impacts for our products, noting that single-family housing starts increased over 12% on a seasonally adjusted annual rate (SAAR) basis due to overall economic conditions specifically for new construction. For Canada, we evaluate the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporate statistics, which showed housing starts increased by 25% for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to 2020.\nThe graph below shows the seasonally adjusted annual single family residential new construction starts as of each year end since 1982 as compiled and reported by U.S. Census Bureau:\nIn addition to new construction, we also evaluate the repair and remodel market to assess residential market conditions by evaluating the Leading Indicator of Remodeling Activity ( LIRA\u201d). For the year ended December 31, 2021, LIRA reflected that the trailing 12 months of remodeling activity increased 9% from 2020. While LIRA is a remodeling economic indicator as it tracks all remodeling activity including kitchen, bathroom and low ticket remodeling, it is not a specific metric for our residential businesses measuring solely windows and siding remodeling growth. Therefore, we utilize this index as a trend indicator for our repair and remodeling business.\nFinally, we assess our performance relative to our competitors and the overall siding industry by evaluating the marketing indicators produced by the Vinyl Siding Institute ( VSI\u201d), a third party which summarizes vinyl siding unit sales for the industry. For the year ended December 31, 2021, the VSI reported that siding units increased 9% for the industry. Overall, our Siding segment, including stone veneer, is weighted to the repair and remodel market with approximately 53% of our net sales being attributed to repair and remodeling with the remaining 47% attributed to the new construction market. Historically, we evaluate our net sales performance within the Windows segment by evaluating our net sales for the new construction market and the repair and remodel market. Overall, our Windows segment is relatively balanced with approximately 51% of our net sales attributed to new construction with the remaining 49% attributed to the repair and remodel market.\nCommercial\nOur sales and earnings are subject to both seasonal and cyclical trends and are influenced by general economic conditions, interest rates, the price of steel relative to other building materials, the level of nonresidential construction activity, roof repair and retrofit demand and the availability and cost of financing for construction projects. Our sales in the Commercial segment normally are lower in the first half of each fiscal year compared to the second half because of unfavorable weather conditions for construction and typical business planning cycles affecting construction.\nThe nonresidential construction industry is highly sensitive to national and regional macroeconomic conditions. Following a significant downturn in 2008 and 2009, the current recovery of low-rise construction has been uneven and slow. The COVID-19 pandemic interrupted some signs of steady growth in recent years. We believe that the nonresidential construction industry will return to mid-cycle levels of activity over the next several years.\nThe graph below shows the annual nonresidential new construction starts, measured in square feet, since 1982 as compiled and reported by Dodge Data & Analytics, Inc. ( Dodge\u201d):\nCurrent market estimates continue to show recovery across the nonresidential construction markets from the 2020 dip, returning above 2019 levels. According to Dodge Data & Analytics, Inc. ( Dodge\u201d), low-rise nonresidential construction starts as measured in square feet and comprising buildings of up to five stories, were up in fiscal 2021 by approximately 19% as compared to our fiscal 2020.\nThe leading indicators that we follow and that typically have the most meaningful correlation to nonresidential low-rise construction starts are the American Institute of Architects' ( AIA\u201d) Architecture Mixed Use Index, Dodge Residential single family starts and the Conference Board Leading Economic Index ( LEI\u201d). Historically, there has been a very high correlation to the Dodge low-rise nonresidential starts when the three leading indicators are combined and then seasonally adjusted.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThis section of the Form 10-K generally discusses fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020 items and year-over-year comparisons of these periods. Discussions of fiscal 2019 items and year-over-year comparisons between fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019 that are not included in this Form 10-K can be found in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d in Part II, Item 7 of Cornerstone's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020.\nThe following table represents key results of operations on a consolidated basis for the periods indicated: \nNet sales - Consolidated net sales for the year ended December 31, 2021 increased by approximately 20.9%, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase was primarily due to favorable price actions taken in all segments to offset commodity inflation, higher volume mainly from increased demand in the residential end markets, and an increase from acquisitions ($113.2 million in the Windows segment from Prime and Cascade and $21.9 million in the Commercial segment from UCC).\nGross profit % of net sales - The Company's gross profit percentage was 21.5% for the year ended December 31, 2021, which was a 120 basis point decrease from the year ended December 31, 2020. The manufacturing inefficiencies and higher costs to serve our customers that were brought on by supply chain disruptions and labor constraints drove the decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales. This reduction was partially offset by positive price mix net of inflation.\nSelling, general, and administrative expenses increased 12.1% during the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. The return of near-term costs, such as variable compensation, professional services, and sales commissions drove the higher selling, general, and administrative expenses at December 31, 2021 as compared to December 31, 2020.\nRestructuring and impairment charges, net decreased $7.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily due to asset impairments in 2021 which were lower in total than the restructuring charges taken in 2020 in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nStrategic development and acquisition related costs increased $8.5 million, during the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020 as our merger-related activities increased as a result of strategic portfolio rationalization actions to accelerate long-term value creation.\nInterest expense decreased $22.3 million or 10.4% in 2021, primarily as a result of the redemption of the $645 million 8.00% Senior Notes coupled with the refinancing of the Current Term Loan Facility.\nConsolidated provision (benefit) for income taxes was an expense of $236.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to an expense of $5.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2021 was 26.2% compared to 1.2% for the year ended December 31, 2020. The change in the effective tax rate was primarily driven by the divestitures and improved financial results for the year ended December 31, 2021, and the impact associated with the goodwill impairment recorded during the year ended December 31, 2020.\nNet Income (loss) - Net income was $665.9 million or $5.19 per diluted share. Effective execution of our priorities, which included maintaining cost discipline, strengthening price leadership, driving operational excellence and investing in growth opportunities delivered improved profitability in 2021 (excluding the impact of the gain on sales from the divestitures in 2021 and the impact of the goodwill impairment in 2020).\nSegment Results of Operations\nWe report our segment information in the same way management internally organizes the business in assessing performance and making decisions regarding allocation of resources in accordance with ASC 280, Segment Reporting. We have determined that we have three reportable segments, organized and managed principally by the different industry sectors they serve. While the segments often operate using shared infrastructure, each reportable segment is managed to address specific customer needs in these diverse market sectors. We report all other business activities in Corporate and unallocated costs. Corporate assets consist primarily of cash, investments, prepaid expenses, current and deferred taxes and property, plant and equipment associated with our headquarters in Cary, North Carolina and office in Houston, Texas. These items (and income and expenses related to these items) are not allocated to the operating segments. Corporate unallocated expenses primarily include share-based compensation expenses, restructuring charges, acquisition costs, and other expenses related to executive, legal, finance, tax, treasury, human resources, information technology and strategic sourcing, and corporate travel expenses. Additional unallocated amounts primarily include non-operating items such as interest income, interest expense, loss on extinguishment of debt and other income (expense).\nOne of the primary measurements used by management to measure the financial performance of each segment is Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss), adjusted for the following items: income tax (benefit) expense; depreciation and amortization; interest expense, net; restructuring and impairment charges; strategic development and acquisition related costs; gain on divestitures; goodwill impairment; share-based compensation expense; non-cash foreign exchange transaction/translation (income) loss; other non-cash items; and other items.\nThe presentation of segment results below includes a reconciliation of the changes for each segment reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP to a pro forma basis to allow investors and the Company to meaningfully evaluate the percentage change on a comparable basis from period to period. The pro forma financial information is based on the historical information of Cornerstone Building Brands, which includes historical information of Kleary Masonry, Inc. ( Kleary\u201d), which the Company acquired on March 2, 2020; Prime Windows LLC ( Prime Windows\u201d), which the Company acquired on April 30, 2021; Cascade Windows, Inc. ( Cascade Windows\u201d), which the Company acquired on August 20, 2021; and the insulated metals panels ( IMP\u201d) and the roll-up sheet doors ( DBCI\u201d) businesses, which the Company divested on August 9, 2021 and August 18, 2021, respectively. The pro forma financial information does not give effect to the potential impact of current financial conditions, any anticipated synergies, operating efficiencies or cost savings that may result from the Kleary, Prime Windows and Cascade Windows acquisitions; or any integration costs; and from the IMP and DBCI divestitures. Pro forma balances are not necessarily indicative of operating results had the Kleary, Prime Windows and Cascade Windows acquisitions and the IMP and DBCI divestitures occurred on January 1, 2020 or of future results. UCC, which was acquired on December 3, 2021, is only included from the acquisition date as pro forma results would comprise substantially all of the comparative periods and would not be meaningful for comparison.\nSee Note 22 - Segment Information in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for more information on our segments.\nNON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\nSet forth below are certain non-GAAP financial measures\u201d as defined under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Management believes the use of such non-GAAP financial measures assists investors in understanding the ongoing operating performance of the Company by presenting the financial results between periods on a more comparable basis. Such non-GAAP financial measures should not be construed as an alternative to reported results determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We have included reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and provided in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\nThe following tables present a comparison of net sales as reported to pro forma net sales for Cornerstone Building Brands as if the Cascade Windows, Prime Windows and Kleary acquisitions, and IMP and DBCI divestitures had each occurred on January 1, 2020 rather than the respective date referenced above for each transaction. UCC's results are only included from the acquisition date as discussed above.\n\nThe following tables reconcile Adjusted EBITDA and pro forma Adjusted EBITDA to operating income (loss) for the periods indicated.\n\n(1)Reflects the acquisition from January 1, 2020 of the net sales and Adjusted EBITDA of Kleary through March 1, 2020, Prime Windows through April 29, 2021 and Cascade Windows through August 19, 2021; and reflects the impact from January 1, 2020 of the divestitures of IMP and DBCI through the divestiture dates of August 9, 2021 and August 18, 2021, respectively.\n(2)Primarily consists of $29.0 million and $17.1 million of share-based compensation expense for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively; $11.6 million in costs for the year ended December 31, 2021 associated with debt refinancing transactions; and $(0.4) million and $12.5 million of COVID-19 pandemic related costs for years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nPro forma net sales for the year ended December 31, 2021 increased $1,026.8 million, a 23.0% improvement over pro forma net sales in the same period a year ago. Disciplined price actions in response to rising commodity costs and other inflationary impacts across all segments drove approximately 75% of the increase. Rapid recovery of residential demand drove increased volume within the Windows and Siding segments of approximately $210 million, and non-residential demand drove increased volume in the Commercial segment of approximately $48 million.\nOperating income (loss) for the year ended December 31, 2021 increased to $1,137.2 million income as compared to an operating loss of $266.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2020 primarily as a result of the gain on the sales of the IMP and DBCI businesses of $831.3 million in 2021 and the goodwill impairment of $503.2 million in the comparable period.\nPro forma Adjusted EBITDA for 2021 was $688.0 million or 12.5% of pro forma net sales, an improvement of 24.1% or 10 basis points from the same pro forma period a year ago. The improvement was primarily driven by positive price mix net of inflation of $210 million and higher demand of $85 million, mostly from the rapid recovery in the residential end markets. Partially reducing these favorable impacts were manufacturing inefficiencies and higher costs to serve our customers as a result of the challenges brought on by supply chain disruptions and labor constraints of $93 million. SG&A costs were $69 million higher than the same pro forma period last year primarily due to the return of near-term costs, such as variable compensation, professional services, and sales commissions.\n\n(1)Reflects the impact of the net sales and Adjusted EBITDA of Prime Windows LLC through April 29, 2021 and Cascade Windows Inc. through August 19, 2021 as if the acquisitions had occurred on January 1, 2020.\nPro forma net sales for the year ended December 31, 2021 were 17.1% higher compared to the year ended December 31, 2020 due to 9.0% from disciplined price actions in response to rising commodity costs and other inflationary impacts coupled with approximately 8.1% increase in sales volume as a result of the rapid recovery within the residential end markets in the U.S. and Canada.\nOperating income (loss) for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $100.7 million of operating income as compared to an operating loss of $223.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2020 primarily due to the goodwill impairment of $321.0 million in the comparable year.\nPro forma Adjusted EBITDA was $254.8 million or 10.4% of pro forma net sales, a 200 basis point decline over the year ended December 31, 2020. Positive price mix net of inflation of $22.8 million and higher demand of $46.6 million, mostly from the rapid recovery in the residential end markets, were partially offset by manufacturing inefficiencies and higher costs to serve our customers as a result of the challenges brought on by supply chain disruptions and labor constraints of $61.3\nmillion. SG&A costs were $12.8 million higher than the same pro forma period last year primarily due to the return of near-term costs, such as variable compensation, professional services, and sales commissions.\n\n(1)Reflects the impact of the net sales and Adjusted EBITDA of Kleary Masonry, Inc. through March 1, 2020 as if the acquisition had occurred on January 1, 2020.\nNet sales for the year ended December 31, 2021 were 18.6% higher compared to the pro forma net sales for the year ended December 31, 2020. The rapid recovery of residential demand contributed 3.4% of the favorable increase, while disciplined price actions to offset inflationary raw material costs resulted in favorable price mix of approximately 15.1% versus the pro forma prior year.\nOperating income for the year ended December 31, 2021 increased to $137.8 million as compared to an operating loss of $(61.9) million for the year ended December 31, 2020 primarily due to a goodwill impairment of $176.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2020. Excluding the 2020 goodwill impairment of $176.8 million and a 2021 asset impairment of $13.9 million related to a discontinued product line, operating income increased 32.1% in 2021 primarily due to disciplined price actions net of inflation of $40.0 million, favorable volume of $12.2 million and lower strategic development costs, offsetting higher costs in manufacturing and SG&A.\nPro Forma Adjusted EBITDA was $265.7 million or 19.5% of pro forma net sales, a 160 basis point decline over the year ended December 31, 2020. As mentioned above, positive price mix net of inflation and higher volume partially offset increased manufacturing costs to serve our customers and inefficiencies from supply chain disruptions of $16.7 million and an increase in SG&A of $12.8 million from return of near-term costs, such as variable compensation and professional service expenses.\n\n(1)Reflects the net adjustments of IMP and DBCI through the divestiture dates of August 9, 2021 and August 18, 2021, respectively, as if the divestitures had occurred on January 1, 2020.\nPro forma net sales for the year ended December 31, 2021 were higher by 37.6% compared to the year ended December 31, 2020 driven approximately by a 33.7% increase from disciplined price actions to mitigate rising steel costs. Additionally, higher volumes of 3.9% from recovering demand in the non-residential end markets also contributed to the increase in net sales. Included in pro forma net sales at December 31, 2021 are $21.9 million of net sales from Union Corrugating Company Holdings, Inc. ( UCC\u201d) from the acquisition date on December 3, 2021. The UCC acquisition furthers our presence in the high-growth residential metal roofing market.\nOperating income for the year ended December 31, 2021 increased $944.7 million compared to year ended December 31, 2020 primarily due to the gain on the sales of the IMP and DBCI businesses as a result of strategic portfolio rationalization actions to accelerate long-term value creation. Excluding the gain on the sales in 2021 and the goodwill impairment in 2020, operating income of $273.1 million increased 65.5% primarily from the realization of price actions taken to offset rising steel and other inflationary impacts. Additionally, higher volume of $26 million from recovering non-residential end markets offset manufacturing inefficiencies from steel constraints and higher SG&A costs. Included in operating income at December 31, 2021 is $1.8 million from UCC from the acquisition date.\nPro forma Adjusted EBITDA was $300.3 million or 18.0% of pro forma net sales, a 520 basis point improvement compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. Included in pro forma EBITDA at December 31, 2021 is $2.2 million from UCC from the acquisition date. As mentioned above, positive price mix net of inflation of approximately $147.6 million and higher volume of $26.3 million offset manufacturing inefficiencies of $14.7 million and higher SG&A costs of $13.6 million.\nUnallocated Operating Loss\n\nUnallocated (Corporate expenses) operating losses include items that are not directly attributed to or allocated to our reporting segments. Such items include legal costs, corporate payroll, and unallocated finance and accounting expenses. The unallocated operating loss for the year ended December 31, 2021 increased by $65.1 million or 46.3% compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. The change is primarily due to the increase in strategic development expenses as well as debt issuance costs and the return of near-term expenses such as variable compensation and professional services. Unallocated operating loss includes $29.0 million and $17.1 million of share-based compensation expense for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nGeneral\nOur ongoing principal source of funds is cash generated from operations, supplemented by borrowings against our asset-based lending and revolving credit facility, as necessary. We typically invest our excess cash in various overnight investments that are issued or guaranteed by the U.S. federal government. Our cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash decreased from $680.5 million as of December 31, 2020 to $396.7 million as of December 31, 2021. The following table summarizes our consolidated cash flows for fiscal 2021 and 2020 (in thousands):\n\nOperating Activities\nThe Company used cash in operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2021 to invest in working capital items to support strong market demand.\nThe following table shows the impact of working capital items on cash during fiscal 2021 and 2020, respectively (in thousands): \nThe use of cash for working capital between periods was driven by investments in net working capital to support the strong demand environment and increased inventory valuations from higher commodity costs and other inflationary aspects. See the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows in the consolidated financial statements for additional information.\nInvesting Activities\nCash provided by investing activities was $549.5 million during fiscal 2021 compared to $120.1 million used during fiscal 2020. During fiscal 2021, we paid approximately $528.3 million (net of cash acquired) toward acquisitions, primarily for the acquisitions of UCC, Cascade Windows and Prime Windows; received proceeds of $1,187.3 million from the divestitures of our insulated metal panels and roll-up sheet doors businesses; received proceeds of $5.1 million from the sale of PP&E, and used $114.7 million for capital expenditures. During fiscal 2020, we paid approximately $41.8 million (net of\ncash acquired) for the acquisition of Kleary, used $81.9 million for capital expenditures, and received proceeds of $3.6 million from the sale of PP&E.\nFinancing Activities\nCash used in financing activities was $617.2 million in fiscal 2021 compared to $389.7 million provided by financing activities in fiscal 2020. During fiscal 2021, we increased our Current Term Loan Facility by $108.4 million, borrowed and then repaid $190.0 million on our Current ABL Facility, paid $670.8 million to redeem the 8.00% Senior Notes, and paid quarterly installments totaling $25.9 million on the Current Term Loan Facility.\nDuring fiscal 2020, we issued $500.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 6.125% Senior Notes due January 2029, borrowed $40.0 million on our Existing ABL Facility to finance the acquisition of Kleary, borrowed an additional $305.0 million on our Existing ABL Facility and repaid all outstanding ABL Facility balances at December 31, 2020, and borrowed and repaid $115.0 million on our Existing Cash Flow Revolver balances. Proceeds from the offering of the 6.125% Senior Notes were used to pay down the Existing ABL Facility and Existing Cash Flow Revolver balances. Additionally, during fiscal 2020, we paid quarterly installments totaling $25.6 million on our Term Loan Facility and used $6.4 million to repurchase shares of our outstanding common stock under our stock repurchase programs.\nEquity Investment\nOn August 25, 2020, the Company filed a shelf registration statement on Form S-3, declared effective by the SEC on September 2, 2020, registering the resale of shares of the Company's common stock held by CD&R Pisces. The Company had previously registered the resale of shares of the Company's common stock held by the CD&R Fund VIII Investor Group and the Golden Gate Investor Group.\nAt December 31, 2021 and 2020, the CD&R Investor Group owned approximately 48.8% and 49.4%, respectively, of the outstanding shares of our Common Stock.\nDebt\nBelow is a reconciliation of the Company's net debt (in thousands). Management considers net debt to be more representative of the Company's financial position than total debt due to the amount of cash and cash equivalents held by the Company and the ability to utilize cash and cash equivalents to reduce debt if needed.\n\nOn April 15, 2021, the Company redeemed its $645 million aggregate principal amount of 8.00% Senior Notes using available cash from the balance sheet and net proceeds from its extended and upsized senior term loan facility. The Company successfully upsized and extended the maturity of its $2,492 million senior term loan facility due 2025 in the form of $2,600 million in Tranche B term loans due April 12, 2028. Additionally, the Company amended and refinanced its senior cash flow based and asset-based revolving credit facilities, extending the maturities to April 12, 2026.\nIn connection with the new Tranche B term loans, the Company also terminated two interest rate swaps and entered into two new swaps maturing in April 2026 on an aggregate notional value of $1.5 billion. The interest rate swaps effectively convert a portion of the floating rate interest payment into a fixed rate interest payment.\nWe may not be successful in refinancing, extending the maturity or otherwise amending the terms of our outstanding indebtedness in the future because of market conditions, disruptions in the debt markets, our financial performance or other reasons. Furthermore, the terms of any refinancing, extension or amendment may not be as favorable as the current terms of our indebtedness. If we are not successful in refinancing our indebtedness or extending its maturity, we and our subsidiaries\ncould face substantial liquidity problems and may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures, sell assets, seek additional capital or restructure our indebtedness.\nFor additional information, see Note 13 - Long-Term Debt and Note 14 - Derivatives in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.\nAdditional Liquidity Considerations\nWe periodically evaluate our liquidity requirements, capital needs and availability of resources in view of inventory levels, expansion plans, debt service requirements and other operating cash needs. To meet our short-term and long-term liquidity requirements, including payment of operating expenses and repayment of debt, we rely primarily on cash from operations. The following table summarizes key liquidity measures under the Current ABL Credit Agreement and the Current Cash Flow Credit Agreement in effect as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 (in thousands):\n\nOn April 15, 2021, the Company redeemed its $645 million aggregate principal amount of 8.00% Senior Notes, as noted above, which reduced total liquidity. We expect that cash generated from operations and our availability under the ABL Credit Facility and Current Cash Flow Revolver will be sufficient to provide us the ability to fund our operations and to provide the increased working capital necessary to support our strategy and fund planned capital expenditures for fiscal 2022 and expansion when needed.\nConsistent with our growth strategy, we evaluate potential acquisitions that would provide additional synergies in our Windows, Siding and Commercial segments. From time to time, we may enter into letters of intent or agreements to acquire assets or companies in these segments. The consummation of these transactions could require substantial cash payments and/or issuance of additional debt.\nOn April 30, 2021, the Company acquired Prime Windows. Prime Windows serves residential new construction and repair and remodel markets with energy efficient vinyl window and door products from two manufacturing facilities in the United States, expanding our manufacturing capabilities and creating new opportunities for us in the Western United States. This acquisition was funded through borrowings under the Company's existing credit facilities.\nOn August 20, 2021, the Company acquired Cascade Windows. Cascade Windows serves the residential new construction and repair and remodel markets with energy efficient vinyl window and door products from various manufacturing facilities in the United States, expanding our manufacturing capabilities and creating new opportunities for us in the Western United States. This acquisition was funded with cash available on the balance sheet.\nOn December 3, 2021, the Company acquired Union Corrugating Company Holdings, Inc. ( UCC\u201d). UCC provides metal roofing, roofing components and accessories from locations primarily in the Central and Eastern U.S. regions. This acquisition was funded with cash available on the balance sheet.\nWe also evaluate possible dispositions of assets or businesses when such assets or businesses are no longer core to our operations and do not fit into our long-term strategy. On August 9, 2021, the Company completed the sale of its insulated metal panels ( IMP\u201d) business to Nucor Insulated Panel Group Inc. and certain of its subsidiaries (collectively, Nucor\u201d) in a cash transaction for $1 billion. The IMP transaction included products sold under the Metl-Span and CENTRIA brands. On August 18, 2021, the Company completed the sale of its roll-up sheet doors business to Janus International Group, Inc. ( Janus\u201d) in a cash transaction for $169 million. The roll-up sheet doors transaction included products sold under the DBCI brand.\nFrom time to time, we have used available funds to repurchase shares of our common stock under our stock repurchase program. On March 7, 2018, we announced that our Board of Directors authorized a new stock repurchase program for the repurchase of up to an aggregate of $50.0 million of our outstanding Common Stock. Under this repurchase program, we are authorized to repurchase shares at times and in amounts that we deem appropriate in accordance with all applicable securities laws and regulations. Shares repurchased are usually retired. There is no time limit on the duration of the program. During fiscal 2021, we did not repurchase shares under the stock repurchase program. As of December 31, 2021, approximately $49.1 million remained available for stock repurchases under the program. In addition to repurchases of shares of our common stock under our stock repurchase program, we also withhold shares of restricted stock to satisfy minimum tax withholding obligations arising in connection with the vesting of awards of share-based compensation.\nWe may from time to time take steps to reduce our debt or otherwise improve our financial position. These actions could include prepayments, open market debt repurchases, negotiated repurchases, other redemptions or retirements of outstanding debt, opportunistic refinancing of debt and raising additional capital. The amount of prepayments or the amount of debt that may be refinanced, repurchased or otherwise retired, if any, will depend on market conditions, trading levels of our debt, our cash position, compliance with debt covenants and other considerations. Our affiliates may also purchase our debt from time to time through open market purchases or other transactions. In such cases, our debt may not be retired, in which case we would continue to pay interest in accordance with the terms of the debt, and we would continue to reflect the debt as outstanding on our consolidated balance sheets.\nCONTINGENT LIABILITIES AND COMMITMENTS\nOur insurance carriers require us to secure standby letters of credit as a collateral requirement for our projected exposure to future period claims growth and loss development, including IBNR claims. For all insurance carriers, the total standby letters of credit are approximately $31.9 million and $27.2 million at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, which require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those estimates that may have a significant effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Our significant accounting policies are disclosed in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements. The following discussion of critical accounting policies addresses those policies that are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require significant judgment and estimates. We base our estimates and judgment on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nAccounting for acquisitions, intangible assets and goodwill. Accounting for the acquisition of a business requires the allocation of the purchase price to the various assets and liabilities of the acquired business. For most assets and liabilities, purchase price allocation is accomplished by recording the asset or liability at its estimated fair value. The most difficult estimations of individual fair values are those involving property, plant and equipment and identifiable intangible assets. We use all available information to make these fair value determinations and, for major business acquisitions, typically engage an outside appraisal firm to assist in the fair value determination of the acquired long-lived assets.\nThe Company has approximately $1,358.1 million of goodwill as of December 31, 2021, of which approximately $541.2 million pertains to our Windows segment, $655.1 million pertains to our Siding segment, and $161.8 million pertains to our Commercial segment. We perform an annual impairment assessment of goodwill. Additionally, we assess goodwill for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the fair values may be below the carrying values of the reporting units. Unforeseen events, changes in circumstances and market conditions and material differences in the value of intangible assets due to changes in estimates of future cash flows could negatively affect the fair value of our assets and result in a non-cash impairment charge. Some factors considered important that could trigger an impairment review include the following: significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results, significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business and significant sustained negative industry or economic trends, such as the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe fair value of our reporting units is based on a blend of estimated discounted cash flows and publicly traded company multiples. A significant reduction in projected sales and earnings which would lead to a reduction in future cash flows could indicate potential impairment. The results from each of these models are then weighted and combined into a single estimate of fair value for our reporting units. Estimated discounted cash flows are based on projected sales and related cost of sales. Publicly traded company multiples and acquisition multiples are derived from information on traded shares and analysis of recent acquisitions in the marketplace, respectively, for companies with operations similar to ours. The primary assumptions used in these various models include earnings multiples of acquisitions in a comparable industry, future cash flow estimates\nof each of the reporting units, weighted average cost of capital, working capital and capital expenditure requirements. Management does not believe the estimates used in the analysis are reasonably likely to change materially in the future, but we will continue to assess the estimates in the future based on the expectations of the reporting units. Changes in assumptions used in the fair value calculation could result in an estimated reporting unit fair value that is below the carrying value, which may result in an impairment of goodwill.\nWe completed our annual goodwill impairment test as of October 3, 2021 for each of our reporting units with goodwill. We have the option of performing an assessment of certain qualitative factors to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value or proceeding directly to a quantitative impairment test. We elected to apply the quantitative assessment for the goodwill impairment test for our reporting units within each of our operating segments as of October 3, 2021.\nA summary of the key assumptions utilized in the goodwill impairment analysis at October 3, 2021, as it relates to the fair values and the sensitivities for these assumptions follows:\n", "item_7_truncated": "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nRECENT DEVELOPMENTS\nOn February 13, 2022, funds affiliated with Clayton Dubilier & Rice, LLC ( CD&R\u201d) submitted a non-binding proposal to acquire all of the Company's outstanding shares of common stock that CD&R does not already own for a purchase price of $24.65 in cash per share (the CD&R Offer\u201d).\nThe CD&R Offer stated that any transaction would be subject to (i) approval by a special committee ( Special Committee\u201d) of our independent directors\u037e and (ii) a vote in favor of the transaction by a majority of the voting power represented by the shares of our common stock owned by stockholders not affiliated with CD&R.\nThe board of directors of the Company (the Board\u201d) previously formed a Special Committee to evaluate and consider any potential or actual proposal from CD&R [and any other alternative proposals or other strategic alternatives that may be available to the Company].\nThe CD&R Offer provides that CD&R reserves the right to withdraw or modify the CD&R Offer at any time and no legally binding obligation with respect to any transaction will exist unless and until mutually acceptable definitive documentation is executed and delivered by us and CD&R. There can be no assurance that the transaction proposed by CD&R or any related transaction will be completed or as to the terms of any such potential transaction, including with respect to pricing or timing.\nBUSINESS OVERVIEW\nCornerstone Building Brands, Inc. is the largest manufacturer of exterior building products in North America. The Company serves residential and commercial customers across new construction and the repair & remodel markets. Our mission is to be relentlessly committed to our customers and to create great building solutions that enable communities to grow and thrive.\nWe have developed and continue to implement a well-defined business strategy focused on (i) driving profitable growth in new and existing markets; (ii) leveraging operational excellence across our businesses; and (iii) implementing a capital allocation framework balanced between a focus on opportunistic investment in high return initiatives and continued debt repayment.\nWe believe that by focusing on operational excellence every day, creating a platform for future growth and investing in market-leading residential and commercial building brands, we will deliver unparalleled financial results. We design, engineer, manufacture, install and market external building products through our three operating segments: Windows, Siding, and Commercial.\nOur manufacturing processes are vertically integrated, which we believe provides cost and competitive advantages. As the leading manufacturer of vinyl windows, vinyl siding, metal roofing and wall systems and metal accessories, Cornerstone Building Brands combines a diverse portfolio of products with an expansive national footprint that includes over 21,700 employees at manufacturing, distribution and office locations primarily in North America.\nAt Cornerstone Building Brands, corporate stewardship is a responsibility that is deeply embedded in our 75-year history. Our business practices have given us the staying power to make a real difference in countless cities and neighborhoods.\nOur sales and earnings are subject to both seasonal and cyclical trends and are influenced by general economic conditions, interest rates, the price of material costs relative to other building materials, the level of residential and nonresidential construction activity, repair and remodel demand and the availability and cost of financing for construction projects. Our sales normally are lower in the first and fourth fiscal quarters of each year compared to the second and third fiscal quarters because of unfavorable weather conditions for construction and typical business planning cycles affecting construction.\nMarkets We Serve\nOur products are available across several large and attractive end markets, including residential new construction, residential repair and remodel and low-rise non-residential construction. We believe that there are favorable underlying fundamental factors that will drive long-term growth across the end markets in which we operate. We also believe the recent COVID-19 pandemic, while still causing economic uncertainty worldwide, has driven strong demand for residential repair and remodel activity, residential new construction and select segments of the low-rise non-residential construction market, such as distribution, warehouse, healthcare and educational facilities in suburban regions; however, the COVID-19 pandemic has also caused challenges in other areas of non-residential construction, most notably in retail and commercial office facilities in densely populated urban centers, where we have minimal, if any, participation. We believe our business is well-\npositioned to benefit from broader societal and population trends favoring suburban regions, as employment and living preferences shift towards such regions.\nCornerstone Building Brands is deeply committed to the communities where our customers and employees live, work and play. We recognize that our customers are increasingly environmentally conscious in their purchasing behavior, and we believe our sustainable solutions favorably address these evolving consumer preferences. For example, certain products in our portfolio are high in recycled end content, virtually 100% recyclable at the end of their useful life and often manufactured to meet or exceed specified sustainability targets, such as ENERGY STAR and LEED certifications. We recognize that efficient use of recycled materials helps to conserve natural resources and reduces environmental impact, and we are committed to driving these sustainable practices throughout our business.\nCOVID-19 Update\nWe experienced a significant decrease in customer demand across all our markets during the second quarter of 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic mostly due to delays in construction activity driven by temporary closures of non-life sustaining businesses. The continuing impact of the pandemic on our future consolidated results of operations is uncertain. During 2020, the Company quickly implemented a range of actions aimed at reducing costs and preserving liquidity. These actions included the closure of our Ambridge, Pennsylvania Commercial facility and Corona, California Windows facility, permanent workforce reductions, employee furloughs, a hiring freeze, a deferral of annual wage raises, and reducing discretionary and non-essential expenses, such as consulting expenses. Additionally, we reduced capital expenditures to focus on key strategic initiatives, such as automation, product innovation, and critical maintenance items. We believe our business model, our existing balances of domestic cash and cash equivalents, currently anticipated operating cash flows, and overall liquidity will be sufficient to meet our cash needs arising in the ordinary course of business for the next twelve months and positions us to manage our business through this crisis as it continues to unfold. We will continue to evaluate the nature and extent of the COVID-19 pandemic's impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nSignificant Business Developments\nOur significant business development activities in 2021 include the: (i) acquisition of Prime Windows LLC (April 2021), (ii) divestitures of our IMP and DBCI businesses (August 2021), (iii) acquisition of Cascade Windows, Inc. (August 2021), and (iv) acquisition of Union Corrugating Company Holding, Inc. (December 2021). In addition, in April 2021, we amended our cash flow credit and ABL credit agreements. See Note 4 - Acquisitions, Note 5 - Divestitures and Note 13 - Long Term Debt, in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for more information on our divestitures, acquisitions, and debt.\nResidential (Windows and Siding)\nOur residential building products are typically installed on a new construction home 90 to 120 days after the start of the home, therefore, there is a lag between the timing of the single-family housing start date and the time in which our products are installed on a home. From an industry perspective, we evaluate the new construction environment by reviewing the U.S. Census Bureau single family housing start statistics to assess the performance of the new construction market for a normal period. We evaluated U.S. Census Bureau single family housing starts for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to December 31, 2020 to assess the demand impacts for our products, noting that single-family housing starts increased over 12% on a seasonally adjusted annual rate (SAAR) basis due to overall economic conditions specifically for new construction. For Canada, we evaluate the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporate statistics, which showed housing starts increased by 25% for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to 2020.\nThe graph below shows the seasonally adjusted annual single family residential new construction starts as of each year end since 1982 as compiled and reported by U.S. Census Bureau:\nIn addition to new construction, we also evaluate the repair and remodel market to assess residential market conditions by evaluating the Leading Indicator of Remodeling Activity ( LIRA\u201d). For the year ended December 31, 2021, LIRA reflected that the trailing 12 months of remodeling activity increased 9% from 2020. While LIRA is a remodeling economic indicator as it tracks all remodeling activity including kitchen, bathroom and low ticket remodeling, it is not a specific metric for our residential businesses measuring solely windows and siding remodeling growth. Therefore, we utilize this index as a trend indicator for our repair and remodeling business.\nFinally, we assess our performance relative to our competitors and the overall siding industry by evaluating the marketing indicators produced by the Vinyl Siding Institute ( VSI\u201d), a third party which summarizes vinyl siding unit sales for the industry. For the year ended December 31, 2021, the VSI reported that siding units increased 9% for the industry. Overall, our Siding segment, including stone veneer, is weighted to the repair and remodel market with approximately 53% of our net sales being attributed to repair and remodeling with the remaining 47% attributed to the new construction market. Historically, we evaluate our net sales performance within the Windows segment by evaluating our net sales for the new construction market and the repair and remodel market. Overall, our Windows segment is relatively balanced with approximately 51% of our net sales attributed to new construction with the remaining 49% attributed to the repair and remodel market.\nCommercial\nOur sales and earnings are subject to both seasonal and cyclical trends and are influenced by general economic conditions, interest rates, the price of steel relative to other building materials, the level of nonresidential construction activity, roof repair and retrofit demand and the availability and cost of financing for construction projects. Our sales in the Commercial segment normally are lower in the first half of each fiscal year compared to the second half because of unfavorable weather conditions for construction and typical business planning cycles affecting construction.\nThe nonresidential construction industry is highly sensitive to national and regional macroeconomic conditions. Following a significant downturn in 2008 and 2009, the current recovery of low-rise construction has been uneven and slow. The COVID-19 pandemic interrupted some signs of steady growth in recent years. We believe that the nonresidential construction industry will return to mid-cycle levels of activity over the next several years.\nThe graph below shows the annual nonresidential new construction starts, measured in square feet, since 1982 as compiled and reported by Dodge Data & Analytics, Inc. ( Dodge\u201d):\nCurrent market estimates continue to show recovery across the nonresidential construction markets from the 2020 dip, returning above 2019 levels. According to Dodge Data & Analytics, Inc. ( Dodge\u201d), low-rise nonresidential construction starts as measured in square feet and comprising buildings of up to five stories, were up in fiscal 2021 by approximately 19% as compared to our fiscal 2020.\nThe leading indicators that we follow and that typically have the most meaningful correlation to nonresidential low-rise construction starts are the American Institute of Architects' ( AIA\u201d) Architecture Mixed Use Index, Dodge Residential single family starts and the Conference Board Leading Economic Index ( LEI\u201d). Historically, there has been a very high correlation to the Dodge low-rise nonresidential starts when the three leading indicators are combined and then seasonally adjusted.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThis section of the Form 10-K generally discusses fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020 items and year-over-year comparisons of these periods. Discussions of fiscal 2019 items and year-over-year comparisons between fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019 that are not included in this Form 10-K can be found in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d in Part II, Item 7 of Cornerstone's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020.\nThe following table represents key results of operations on a consolidated basis for the periods indicated: Table 15: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Year Ended </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> (Amounts in thousands) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31,\n2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31,\n2020 </td> <td> </td> <td>$ change </td> <td>% change </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net sales </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>5,583,137 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>4,617,369 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>965,768 </td> <td> </td> <td>20.9 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gross profit </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,199,075 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,050,320 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>148,755 </td> <td> </td> <td>14.2 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>% of net sales </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>21.5 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>22.7 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Selling, general and administrative expenses </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>649,472 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>579,200 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>70,272 </td> <td> </td> <td>12.1 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>% of net sales </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>11.6 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>12.5 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Restructuring and impairment charges, net </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>26,247 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>34,120 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(7,873) </td> <td> </td> <td>(23.1) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Strategic development and acquisition related costs </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>27,875 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>19,341 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,534 </td> <td> </td> <td>44.1 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Interest expense </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>191,301 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>213,610 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(22,309) </td> <td> </td> <td>(10.4) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net income (loss) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>665,859 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(482,778) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,148,637 </td> <td> </td> <td>(237.9) </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nNet sales - Consolidated net sales for the year ended December 31, 2021 increased by approximately 20.9%, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase was primarily due to favorable price actions taken in all segments to offset commodity inflation, higher volume mainly from increased demand in the residential end markets, and an increase from acquisitions ($113.2 million in the Windows segment from Prime and Cascade and $21.9 million in the Commercial segment from UCC).\nGross profit % of net sales - The Company's gross profit percentage was 21.5% for the year ended December 31, 2021, which was a 120 basis point decrease from the year ended December 31, 2020. The manufacturing inefficiencies and higher costs to serve our customers that were brought on by supply chain disruptions and labor constraints drove the decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales. This reduction was partially offset by positive price mix net of inflation.\nSelling, general, and administrative expenses increased 12.1% during the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. The return of near-term costs, such as variable compensation, professional services, and sales commissions drove the higher selling, general, and administrative expenses at December 31, 2021 as compared to December 31, 2020.\nRestructuring and impairment charges, net decreased $7.9 million during the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily due to asset impairments in 2021 which were lower in total than the restructuring charges taken in 2020 in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nStrategic development and acquisition related costs increased $8.5 million, during the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020 as our merger-related activities increased as a result of strategic portfolio rationalization actions to accelerate long-term value creation.\nInterest expense decreased $22.3 million or 10.4% in 2021, primarily as a result of the redemption of the $645 million 8.00% Senior Notes coupled with the refinancing of the Current Term Loan Facility.\nConsolidated provision (benefit) for income taxes was an expense of $236.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to an expense of $5.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2021 was 26.2% compared to 1.2% for the year ended December 31, 2020. The change in the effective tax rate was primarily driven by the divestitures and improved financial results for the year ended December 31, 2021, and the impact associated with the goodwill impairment recorded during the year ended December 31, 2020.\nNet Income (loss) - Net income was $665.9 million or $5.19 per diluted share. Effective execution of our priorities, which included maintaining cost discipline, strengthening price leadership, driving operational excellence and investing in growth opportunities delivered improved profitability in 2021 (excluding the impact of the gain on sales from the divestitures in 2021 and the impact of the goodwill impairment in 2020).\nSegment Results of Operations\nWe report our segment information in the same way management internally organizes the business in assessing performance and making decisions regarding allocation of resources in accordance with ASC 280, Segment Reporting. We have determined that we have three reportable segments, organized and managed principally by the different industry sectors they serve. While the segments often operate using shared infrastructure, each reportable segment is managed to address specific customer needs in these diverse market sectors. We report all other business activities in Corporate and unallocated costs. Corporate assets consist primarily of cash, investments, prepaid expenses, current and deferred taxes and property, plant and equipment associated with our headquarters in Cary, North Carolina and office in Houston, Texas. These items (and income and expenses related to these items) are not allocated to the operating segments. Corporate unallocated expenses primarily include share-based compensation expenses, restructuring charges, acquisition costs, and other expenses related to executive, legal, finance, tax, treasury, human resources, information technology and strategic sourcing, and corporate travel expenses. Additional unallocated amounts primarily include non-operating items such as interest income, interest expense, loss on extinguishment of debt and other income (expense).\nOne of the primary measurements used by management to measure the financial performance of each segment is Adjusted EBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss), adjusted for the following items: income tax (benefit) expense; depreciation and amortization; interest expense, net; restructuring and impairment charges; strategic development and acquisition related costs; gain on divestitures; goodwill impairment; share-based compensation expense; non-cash foreign exchange transaction/translation (income) loss; other non-cash items; and other items.\nThe presentation of segment results below includes a reconciliation of the changes for each segment reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP to a pro forma basis to allow investors and the Company to meaningfully evaluate the percentage change on a comparable basis from period to period. The pro forma financial information is based on the historical information of Cornerstone Building Brands, which includes historical information of Kleary Masonry, Inc. ( Kleary\u201d), which the Company acquired on March 2, 2020; Prime Windows LLC ( Prime Windows\u201d), which the Company acquired on April 30, 2021; Cascade Windows, Inc. ( Cascade Windows\u201d), which the Company acquired on August 20, 2021; and the insulated metals panels ( IMP\u201d) and the roll-up sheet doors ( DBCI\u201d) businesses, which the Company divested on August 9, 2021 and August 18, 2021, respectively. The pro forma financial information does not give effect to the potential impact of current financial conditions, any anticipated synergies, operating efficiencies or cost savings that may result from the Kleary, Prime Windows and Cascade Windows acquisitions; or any integration costs; and from the IMP and DBCI divestitures. Pro forma balances are not necessarily indicative of operating results had the Kleary, Prime Windows and Cascade Windows acquisitions and the IMP and DBCI divestitures occurred on January 1, 2020 or of future results. UCC, which was acquired on December 3, 2021, is only included from the acquisition date as pro forma results would comprise substantially all of the comparative periods and would not be meaningful for comparison.\nSee Note 22 - Segment Information in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for more information on our segments.\nNON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\nSet forth below are certain non-GAAP financial measures\u201d as defined under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Management believes the use of such non-GAAP financial measures assists investors in understanding the ongoing operating performance of the Company by presenting the financial results between periods on a more comparable basis. Such non-GAAP financial measures should not be construed as an alternative to reported results determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We have included reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and provided in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\nThe following tables present a comparison of net sales as reported to pro forma net sales for Cornerstone Building Brands as if the Cascade Windows, Prime Windows and Kleary acquisitions, and IMP and DBCI divestitures had each occurred on January 1, 2020 rather than the respective date referenced above for each transaction. UCC's results are only included from the acquisition date as discussed above.\nTable 16: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td>

respectively.\n(2)Primarily consists of $29.0 million and $17.1 million of share-based compensation expense for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively; $11.6 million in costs for the year ended December 31, 2021 associated with debt refinancing transactions; and $(0.4) million and $12.5 million of COVID-19 pandemic related costs for years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nPro forma net sales for the year ended December 31, 2021 increased $1,026.8 million, a 23.0% improvement over pro forma net sales in the same period a year ago. Disciplined price actions in response to rising commodity costs and other inflationary impacts across all segments drove approximately 75% of the increase. Rapid recovery of residential demand drove increased volume within the Windows and Siding segments of approximately $210 million, and non-residential demand drove increased volume in the Commercial segment of approximately $48 million.\nOperating income (loss) for the year ended December 31, 2021 increased to $1,137.2 million income as compared to an operating loss of $266.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2020 primarily as a result of the gain on the sales of the IMP and DBCI businesses of $831.3 million in 2021 and the goodwill impairment of $503.2 million in the comparable period.\nPro forma Adjusted EBITDA for 2021 was $688.0 million or 12.5% of pro forma net sales, an improvement of 24.1% or 10 basis points from the same pro forma period a year ago. The improvement was primarily driven by positive price mix net of inflation of $210 million and higher demand of $85 million, mostly from the rapid recovery in the residential end markets. Partially reducing these favorable impacts were manufacturing inefficiencies and higher costs to serve our customers as a result of the challenges brought on by supply chain disruptions and labor constraints of $93 million. SG&A costs were $69 million higher than the same pro forma period last year primarily due to the return of near-term costs, such as variable compensation, professional services, and sales commissions.\nTable 18: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Windows </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ended </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Amounts in thousands) </td> <td>December 31,\n2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31,\n2020 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net sales </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,322,277 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,889,625 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impact of acquisitions(1)\n</td> <td>132,141 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>206,639 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Pro forma net sales </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,454,418 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,096,264 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income (loss), GAAP </td> <td>$ </td> <td>100,725 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(223,646) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Restructuring and impairment charges, net </td> <td>1,252 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,499 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Strategic development and acquisition related costs </td> <td>2,976 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Goodwill impairment </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>320,990 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization </td> <td>134,626 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>121,519 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other </td> <td>(88) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7,338 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted EBITDA </td> <td>239,491 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>233,716 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impact of acquisitions(1)\n</td> <td>15,314 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>25,740 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Pro forma Adjusted EBITDA </td> <td>$ </td> <td>254,805 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>259,456 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted EBITDA as a % of net sales </td> <td>10.3 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>12.4 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Pro forma Adjusted EBITDA as a % of pro forma net sales </td> <td>10.4 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>12.4 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1)Reflects the impact of the net sales and Adjusted EBITDA of Prime Windows LLC through April 29, 2021 and Cascade Windows Inc. through August 19, 2021 as if the acquisitions had occurred on January 1, 2020.\nPro forma net sales for the year ended December 31, 2021 were 17.1% higher compared to the year ended December 31, 2020 due to 9.0% from disciplined price actions in response to rising commodity costs and other inflationary impacts coupled with approximately 8.1% increase in sales volume as a result of the rapid recovery within the residential end markets in the U.S. and Canada.\nOperating income (loss) for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $100.7 million of operating income as compared to an operating loss of $223.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2020 primarily due to the goodwill impairment of $321.0 million in the comparable year.\nPro forma Adjusted EBITDA was $254.8 million or 10.4% of pro forma net sales, a 200 basis point decline over the year ended December 31, 2020. Positive price mix net of inflation of $22.8 million and higher demand of $46.6 million, mostly from the rapid recovery in the residential end markets, were partially offset by manufacturing inefficiencies and higher costs to serve our customers as a result of the challenges brought on by supply chain disruptions and labor constraints of $61.3\nmillion.

The rapid recovery of residential demand contributed 3.4% of the favorable increase, while disciplined price actions to offset inflationary raw material costs resulted in favorable price mix of approximately 15.1% versus the pro forma prior year.\nOperating income for the year ended December 31, 2021 increased to $137.8 million as compared to an operating loss of $(61.9) million for the year ended December 31, 2020 primarily due to a goodwill impairment of $176.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2020. Excluding the 2020 goodwill impairment of $176.8 million and a 2021 asset impairment of $13.9 million related to a discontinued product line, operating income increased 32.1% in 2021 primarily due to disciplined price actions net of inflation of $40.0 million, favorable volume of $12.2 million and lower strategic development costs, offsetting higher costs in manufacturing and SG&A.\nPro Forma Adjusted EBITDA was $265.7 million or 19.5% of pro forma net sales, a 160 basis point decline over the year ended December 31, 2020. As mentioned above, positive price mix net of inflation and higher volume partially offset increased manufacturing costs to serve our customers and inefficiencies from supply chain disruptions of $16.7 million and an increase in SG&A of $12.8 million from return of near-term costs, such as variable compensation and professional service expenses.\nTable 20: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Commercial </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ended </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Amounts in thousands) </td> <td>December 31,\n2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31,\n2020 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net Sales </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,896,780 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,585,798 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impact of divestitures(1)\n</td> <td>(231,347) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(375,261) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Pro forma net sales </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,665,433 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,210,537 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating income, GAAP </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,104,335 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>159,586 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Restructuring and impairment charges, net </td> <td>10,131 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>20,270 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Strategic development and acquisition related costs </td> <td>3,103 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(262) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Gain on divestitures </td> <td>(831,252) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Goodwill impairment </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5,407 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Depreciation and amortization </td> <td>36,282 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>45,213 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Other </td> <td>934 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>4,346 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted EBITDA </td> <td>323,533 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>234,560 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Impact of divestitures(1)\n</td> <td>(23,267) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(79,832) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Pro forma Adjusted EBITDA </td> <td>$ </td> <td>300,266 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>154,728 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Adjusted EBITDA as a % of net sales </td> <td>17.1 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>14.8 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Pro forma Adjusted EBITDA as a % of pro forma net sales </td> <td>18.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>12.8 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\n(1)Reflects the net adjustments of IMP and DBCI through the divestiture dates of August 9, 2021 and August 18, 2021, respectively, as if the divestitures had occurred on January 1, 2020.\nPro forma net sales for the year ended December 31, 2021 were higher by 37.6% compared to the year ended December 31, 2020 driven approximately by a 33.7% increase from disciplined price actions to mitigate rising steel costs. Additionally, higher volumes of 3.9% from recovering demand in the non-residential end markets also contributed to the increase in net sales. Included in pro forma net sales at December 31, 2021 are $21.9 million of net sales from Union Corrugating Company Holdings, Inc. ( UCC\u201d) from the acquisition date on December 3, 2021. The UCC acquisition furthers our presence in the high-growth residential metal roofing market.\nOperating income for the year ended December 31, 2021 increased $944.7 million compared to year ended December 31, 2020 primarily due to the gain on the sales of the IMP and DBCI businesses as a result of strategic portfolio rationalization actions to accelerate long-term value creation. Excluding the gain on the sales in 2021 and the goodwill impairment in 2020, operating income of $273.1 million increased 65.5% primarily from the realization of price actions taken to offset rising steel and other inflationary impacts. Additionally, higher volume of $26 million from recovering non-residential end markets offset manufacturing inefficiencies from steel constraints and higher SG&A costs. Included in operating income at December 31, 2021 is $1.8 million from UCC from the acquisition date.\nPro forma Adjusted EBITDA was $300.3 million or 18.0% of pro forma net sales, a 520 basis point improvement compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. Included in pro forma EBITDA at December 31, 2021 is $2.2 million from UCC from the acquisition date. As mentioned above, positive price mix net of inflation of approximately $147.6 million and higher volume of $26.3 million offset manufacturing inefficiencies of $14.7 million and higher SG&A costs of $13.6 million.\nUnallocated Operating Loss\nTable 21: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ended </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>(Amounts in thousands) </td> <td>December 31,\n2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31,\n2020 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Statement of operations data: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>SG&A expenses </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(180,817) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(131,087) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Strategic development and acquisition related costs </td> <td>(24,770) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(9,429) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Operating loss </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(205,587) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(140,516) </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nUnallocated (Corporate expenses) operating losses include items that are not directly attributed to or allocated to our reporting segments.

The unallocated operating loss for the year ended December 31, 2021 increased by $65.1 million or 46.3% compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. The change is primarily due to the increase in strategic development expenses as well as debt issuance costs and the return of near-term expenses such as variable compensation and professional services. Unallocated operating loss includes $29.0 million and $17.1 million of share-based compensation expense for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nGeneral\nOur ongoing principal source of funds is cash generated from operations, supplemented by borrowings against our asset-based lending and revolving credit facility, as necessary.

Proceeds from the offering of the 6.125% Senior Notes were used to pay down the Existing ABL Facility and Existing Cash Flow Revolver balances. Additionally, during fiscal 2020, we paid quarterly installments totaling $25.6 million on our Term Loan Facility and used $6.4 million to repurchase shares of our outstanding common stock under our stock repurchase programs.\nEquity Investment\nOn August 25, 2020, the Company filed a shelf registration statement on Form S-3, declared effective by the SEC on September 2, 2020, registering the resale of shares of the Company's common stock held by CD&R Pisces.

Additionally, the Company amended and refinanced its senior cash flow based and asset-based revolving credit facilities, extending the maturities to April 12, 2026.\nIn connection with the new Tranche B term loans, the Company also terminated two interest rate swaps and entered into two new swaps maturing in April 2026 on an aggregate notional value of $1.5 billion. The interest rate swaps effectively convert a portion of the floating rate interest payment into a fixed rate interest payment.\nWe may not be successful in refinancing, extending the maturity or otherwise amending the terms of our outstanding indebtedness in the future because of market conditions, disruptions in the debt markets, our financial performance or other reasons. Furthermore, the terms of any refinancing, extension or amendment may not be as favorable as the current terms of our indebtedness. If we are not successful in refinancing our indebtedness or extending its maturity, we and our subsidiaries\ncould face substantial liquidity problems and may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures, sell assets, seek additional capital or restructure our indebtedness.\nFor additional information, see Note 13 - Long-Term Debt and Note 14 - Derivatives in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.\nAdditional Liquidity Considerations\nWe periodically evaluate our liquidity requirements, capital needs and availability of resources in view of inventory levels, expansion plans, debt service requirements and other operating cash needs. To meet our short-term and long-term liquidity requirements, including payment of operating expenses and repayment of debt, we rely primarily on cash from operations. The following table summarizes key liquidity measures under the Current ABL Credit Agreement and the Current Cash Flow Credit Agreement in effect as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 (in thousands):\nTable 25: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Year Ended </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>December 31,\n2021 </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31,\n2020 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Asset-based revolving credit facility due April 2026 </td> <td>$ </td> <td>611,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>611,000 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Eligible borrowing base </td> <td>611,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>568,000 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less: Borrowings </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Less: LCs outstanding and priority payables </td> <td>45,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>40,000 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Net ABL availability </td> <td>566,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>528,000 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Plus: Cash flow revolver due April 2026 </td> <td>115,000 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>115,000 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Plus: cash and cash equivalents </td> <td>394,447 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>674,255 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Total Liquidity </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,075,447 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,317,255 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOn April 15, 2021, the Company redeemed its $645 million aggregate principal amount of 8.00% Senior Notes, as noted above, which reduced total liquidity. We expect that cash generated from operations and our availability under the ABL Credit Facility and Current Cash Flow Revolver will be sufficient to provide us the ability to fund our operations and to provide the increased working capital necessary to support our strategy and fund planned capital expenditures for fiscal 2022 and expansion when needed.\nConsistent with our growth strategy, we evaluate potential acquisitions that would provide additional synergies in our Windows, Siding and Commercial segments. From time to time, we may enter into letters of intent or agreements to acquire assets or companies in these segments. The consummation of these transactions could require substantial cash payments and/or issuance of additional debt.\nOn April 30, 2021, the Company acquired Prime Windows. Prime Windows serves residential new construction and repair and remodel markets with energy efficient vinyl window and door products from two manufacturing facilities in the United States, expanding our manufacturing capabilities and creating new opportunities for us in the Western United States. This acquisition was funded through borrowings under the Company's existing credit facilities.\nOn August 20, 2021, the Company acquired Cascade Windows. Cascade Windows serves the residential new construction and repair and remodel markets with energy efficient vinyl window and door products from various manufacturing facilities in the United States, expanding our manufacturing capabilities and creating new opportunities for us in the Western United States. This acquisition was funded with cash available on the balance sheet.\nOn December 3, 2021, the Company acquired Union Corrugating Company Holdings, Inc. ( UCC\u201d). UCC provides metal roofing, roofing components and accessories from locations primarily in the Central and Eastern U.S. regions. This acquisition was funded with cash available on the balance sheet.\nWe also evaluate possible dispositions of assets or businesses when such assets or businesses are no longer core to our operations and do not fit into our long-term strategy. On August 9, 2021, the Company completed the sale of its insulated metal panels ( IMP\u201d) business to Nucor Insulated Panel Group Inc. and certain of its subsidiaries (collectively, Nucor\u201d) in a cash transaction for $1 billion. The IMP transaction included products sold under the Metl-Span and CENTRIA brands. On August 18, 2021, the Company completed the sale of its roll-up sheet doors business to Janus International Group, Inc. ( Janus\u201d) in a cash transaction for $169 million. The roll-up sheet doors transaction included products sold under the DBCI brand.\nFrom time to time, we have used available funds to repurchase shares of our common stock under our stock repurchase program. On March 7, 2018, we announced that our Board of Directors authorized a new stock repurchase program for the repurchase of up to an aggregate of $50.0 million of our outstanding Common Stock. Under this repurchase program, we are authorized to repurchase shares at times and in amounts that we deem appropriate in accordance with all applicable securities laws and regulations. Shares repurchased are usually retired. There is no time limit on the duration of the program. During fiscal 2021, we did not repurchase shares under the stock repurchase program. As of December 31, 2021, approximately $49.1 million remained available for stock repurchases under the program. In addition to repurchases of shares of our common stock under our stock repurchase program, we also withhold shares of restricted stock to satisfy minimum tax withholding obligations arising in connection with the vesting of awards of share-based compensation.\nWe may from time to time take steps to reduce our debt or otherwise improve our financial position. These actions could include prepayments, open market debt repurchases, negotiated repurchases, other redemptions or retirements of outstanding debt, opportunistic refinancing of debt and raising additional capital. The amount of prepayments or the amount of debt that may be refinanced, repurchased or otherwise retired, if any, will depend on market conditions, trading levels of our debt, our cash position, compliance with debt covenants and other considerations. Our affiliates may also purchase our debt from time to time through open market purchases or other transactions. In such cases, our debt may not be retired, in which case we would continue to pay interest in accordance with the terms of the debt, and we would continue to reflect the debt as outstanding on our consolidated balance sheets.\nCONTINGENT LIABILITIES AND COMMITMENTS\nOur insurance carriers require us to secure standby letters of credit as a collateral requirement for our projected exposure to future period claims growth and loss development, including IBNR claims. For all insurance carriers, the total standby letters of credit are approximately $31.9 million and $27.2 million at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, which require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those estimates that may have a significant effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Our significant accounting policies are disclosed in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements. The following discussion of critical accounting policies addresses those policies that are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require significant judgment and estimates. We base our estimates and judgment on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nAccounting for acquisitions, intangible assets and goodwill. Accounting for the acquisition of a business requires the allocation of the purchase price to the various assets and liabilities of the acquired business. For most assets and liabilities, purchase price allocation is accomplished by recording the asset or liability at its estimated fair value. The most difficult estimations of individual fair values are those involving property, plant and equipment and identifiable intangible assets. We use all available information to make these fair value determinations and, for major business acquisitions, typically engage an outside appraisal firm to assist in the fair value determination of the acquired long-lived assets.\nThe Company has approximately $1,358.1 million of goodwill as of December 31, 2021, of which approximately $541.2 million pertains to our Windows segment, $655.1 million pertains to our Siding segment, and $161.8 million pertains to our Commercial segment. We perform an annual impairment assessment of goodwill. Additionally, we assess goodwill for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the fair values may be below the carrying values of the reporting units. Unforeseen events, changes in circumstances and market conditions and material differences in the value of intangible assets due to changes in estimates of future cash flows could negatively affect the fair value of our assets and result in a non-cash impairment charge. Some factors considered important that could trigger an impairment review include the following: significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results, significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business and significant sustained negative industry or economic trends, such as the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe fair value of our reporting units is based on a blend of estimated discounted cash flows and publicly traded company multiples. A significant reduction in projected sales and earnings which would lead to a reduction in future cash flows could indicate potential impairment. The results from each of these models are then weighted and combined into a single estimate of fair value for our reporting units. Estimated discounted cash flows are based on projected sales and related cost of sales. Publicly traded company multiples and acquisition multiples are derived from information on traded shares and analysis of recent acquisitions in the marketplace, respectively, for companies with operations similar to ours. The primary assumptions used in these various models include earnings multiples of acquisitions in a comparable industry, future cash flow estimates\nof each of the reporting units, weighted average cost of capital, working capital and capital expenditure requirements. Management does not believe the estimates used in the analysis are reasonably likely to change materially in the future, but we will continue to assess the estimates in the future based on the expectations of the reporting units. Changes in assumptions used in the fair value calculation could result in an estimated reporting unit fair value that is below the carrying value, which may result in an impairment of goodwill.\nWe completed our annual goodwill impairment test as of October 3, 2021 for each of our reporting units with goodwill. We have the option of performing an assessment of certain qualitative factors to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value or proceeding directly to a quantitative impairment test. We elected to apply the quantitative assessment for the goodwill impairment test for our reporting units within each of our operating segments as of October 3, 2021.\nA summary of the key assumptions utilized in the goodwill impairment analysis at October 3, 2021, as it relates to the fair values and the sensitivities for these assumptions follows:\nTable 26: <table><tr><td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>As of October 3, 2021 </td> </tr>\n<tr><td> </td> <td>Windows </td> <td> </td> <td>Siding </td> <td> </td> <td>Engineered Building Systems </td> <td> </td> <td>Metal Components </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Assumptions: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Income Approach: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr><td>Terminal growth rate </td> <td>3.5 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>3.0 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>3.0"}
