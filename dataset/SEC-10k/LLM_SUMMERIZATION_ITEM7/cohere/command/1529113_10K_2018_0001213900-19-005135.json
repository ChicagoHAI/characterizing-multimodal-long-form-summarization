In addition to historical information, this discussion and analysis here and throughout this Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements, due to a number of factors, including but not limited to, risks described in the section entitled Risk Factors.\u201d\nExcept where indicated, all share and per share data in this section, as well as the consolidated financial statements, reflect the 1-for-15 reverse split of the Company's outstanding common stock effected on March 1, 2017, the 1-for-30 reverse split of the Company's outstanding common stock effected on February 6, 2018, and the 1-for-40 reverse split of the Company's outstanding common stock effected on November 2, 2018 (collectively, the Reverse Splits\u201d). We have reflected the Reverse Splits herein, unless otherwise indicated.\nOverview of Our Business\nWe provide a number of different technology products and services to private and public sector customers. Effective January 1, 2017, the Company changed the way it analyzes and assesses divisional performance of the Company. The Company re-aligned its operating segments along those division business lines and operated in two segments, namely Indoor Positioning Analytics and Infrastructure. The Infrastructure business was part of the Spin-off of Sysorex and is no longer part of our reporting. Our Indoor Positioning Analytics ( IPA\u201d) products secure, digitize and optimize the interior of any premises with indoor positioning and data analytics that provide rich positional information, similar to a global positioning system, and browser-like intelligence for the indoors. In addition, we offer digital tear-sheets with optional invoice integration, digital ad delivery, and an e-edition designed for reader engagement for the media, publishing and entertainment industry.\nRevenues were flat in 2018 because of an increase in our IPA product revenues, which was offset by a decrease in our Shoom services revenue. We expect to continue to grow our IPA product line in 2019. The IPA product line does have long sales cycles, which are a result from customer-related issues such as budget and procurement processes but also because of the early stages of indoor-positioning technology and the learning curve required for customers to implement such solutions. Customers also engage in a pilot program first which prolongs sales cycles and is typical of most emerging technology adoption curves. We anticipate sales cycles to improve in 2019 as our customer base moves from early adopters to mainstream customers. The sales cycle is also improving with the increased presence and awareness of beacon and Wi-Fi locationing technologies in the market. IPA sales can be licensed-based with government customers but commercial customers typically prefer a SaaS or subscription model. Our other digital solutions are also delivered on a SaaS model and allow us to generate industry analytics that complement our indoor-positioning solutions.\nWe experienced a net loss of $24.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 and a net loss of $35.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. We cannot assure that we will ever earn revenues sufficient to support our operations, or that we will ever be profitable. In order to continue our operations, we have supplemented the revenues we earned with proceeds from the sale of our equity and debt securities and proceeds from loans and bank credit lines. Furthermore, except for our Payplant facility, we have no committed source of financing and we cannot assure that we will be able to raise money as and when we need it to continue our operations. If we cannot raise funds as and when we need them, we may be required to scale back our business operations by reducing expenditures for employees, consultants, business development and marketing efforts, selling assets or one or more products in our business, or otherwise severely curtailing our operations.\nRecent Events\nReverse Stock Splits\nDuring 2018 and 2017, the Company has effected three reverse stock splits: (1) a 1-for-15 reverse split of the Company's outstanding common stock effected on March 1, 2017; (2) a 1-for-30 reverse split of the Company's outstanding common stock effected on February 6, 2018; and (3) a 1-for-40 reverse split of the Company's outstanding common stock effected on November 2, 2018.\nJanuary 2018 Capital Raise\nOn January 5, 2018, the Company entered into a securities purchase agreement (the January 2018 SPA\u201d) with certain investors pursuant to which the Company agreed to sell, in a registered direct offering, an aggregate of 14,996 shares (the January 2018 Shares\u201d) of the Company's common stock at a purchase price of $212.40 per share for aggregate gross proceeds of approximately $3.2 million. After deducting placement agent fees and other expenses, the net proceeds from the offering was approximately $2.8 million. Concurrently with the sale of the January 2018 Shares, pursuant to the January 2018 SPA the Company also sold warrants to purchase up to 14,996 shares of common stock (the January 2018 Warrants\u201d). This offering closed on January 8, 2018.\nThe January 2018 Warrants became exercisable on February 2, 2018 (the January 2018 Warrant Initial Exercise Date\u201d), at an exercise price per share equal to $264.00, subject to certain adjustments pursuant to the terms of the January 2018 Warrants (the January 2018 Warrant Exercise Price\u201d), and will expire on the fifth anniversary of the January 2018 Warrant Initial Exercise Date. As a result of a Dilutive Issuance (as defined in the January 2018 Warrants) as of February 20, 2018, the January 2018 Warrant Exercise Price was adjusted to the floor price of $120.00 per share pursuant to the January 2018 Warrants.\nFebruary 2018 Public Offering\nOn February 20, 2018, the Company completed a public offering for approximately $18 million in securities, consisting of (i) an aggregate of 83,149 Class A units, at a price to the public of $94.00 per Class A unit, each consisting of one share of common stock, and a five-year warrant to purchase one share of common stock, and (ii) 10,184.9752 Class B units, at a price to the public of $1,000 per Class B unit, each consisting of one share of the Company's newly designated Series 3 convertible preferred stock, par value $0.001 per share ( Series 3 Preferred\u201d), with a stated value of $1,000 and initially convertible into approximately 11 shares of common stock at a conversion price of $94.00 per share for up to an aggregate of 108,351 shares of common stock and warrants exercisable for the number of shares of common stock into which the shares of Series 3 Preferred is initially convertible. The warrants ( February 2018 Warrant\u201d) were immediately exercisable at an exercise price of $140.00 per share (subject to adjustment).\nThe Company received approximately $18 million in gross proceeds from this offering, including the satisfaction of approximately $1 million in amounts payable to service providers. After satisfying the amounts due to service providers and deducting placement agent fees, the net cash proceeds from this offering was approximately $15.4 million. The Company used the net proceeds from the transactions for working capital and general corporate purposes, including research and development and sales and marketing.\nThe shares of Series 3 Preferred issued in this offering have all been converted into common stock. As a result of the April 2018 offering described below as of April 24, 2018, the exercise price of the February 2018 Warrants was adjusted to the floor price of $25.36 per share and the number of shares of common stock underlying the February 2018 Warrants was increased to an aggregate of 1,057,178 shares of common stock.\nApril 2018 Public Offering\nOn April 24, 2018, the Company completed a public offering consisting of 10,115 units at a price to the public of $1,000 per unit, each consisting of (i) one share of our newly designated Series 4 convertible preferred stock, par value $0.001 per share (the Series 4 Preferred\u201d), with a stated value of $1,000 and initially convertible into approximately 54 shares of common stock, at a conversion price of $18.40 per share (subject to adjustment) and (ii) one warrant to purchase such number of shares of common stock as each share of Series 4 Preferred is initially convertible into. The warrants are immediately exercisable at an exercise price of $26.80 per share (subject to adjustment).\nThe Series 4 Preferred contain an anti-dilution protection feature, to adjust the conversion price if shares of common stock are sold or issued for a consideration per share less than the conversion price then in effect (subject to certain exemptions), provided, that the conversion price will not be less than $4.96. In addition, on the 60th day following the original issuance date of the Series 4 Preferred, the conversion price was reduced, and only reduced, to the lesser of (x) the then conversion price, as may be adjusted, and (y) 80% of the VWAP (as defined in the certificate of designation filed for the Series 4 Preferred) on the trading day immediately prior to the 60th day, provided that the conversion price will not be less than $4.96. On June 25, 2018, in accordance with the terms of such price reset provision, the conversion price of the Series 4 Preferred was adjusted to $7.12, which was subsequent adjusted on January 15, 2019 in connection with the rights offering to $4.96. In addition, in connection with the rights offering, on January 15, 2019, the exercise price of the warrants issued in the April offering were also reduced to the floor price of $4.96 and the number of shares issuable upon exercise of such warrants was increased to 2,769,000 shares of common stock.\nThe Company received approximately $10.1 million in gross proceeds from this offering, before deducting placement agent fees and offering expenses payable by the Company. After deducting placement agent fees and expenses, the net proceeds from this offering were approximately $9.2 million. The Company intends to use the net proceeds from this offering for working capital, general corporate purposes (including research and development, sales and marketing and the satisfaction of outstanding amounts payable to our vendors in connection with trade payables). Additionally, the Company may use a portion of the net proceeds of this offering to finance acquisitions of, or investments in, competitive and complementary businesses, products or services as a part of our growth strategy. However, the Company does not have any current commitments with respect to any such acquisitions or investments.\nSpin-off of Sysorex, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiary, Sysorex Government Services, Inc.\nOn August 31, 2018, the Company completed the spin-off (the Spin-off\u201d) of its value added reseller business from its indoor positioning analytics business by way of a distribution of all the shares of common stock of the Company's wholly-owned subsidiary, Sysorex, to the Company's stockholders of record as of August 21, 2018 (the Record Date\u201d) and certain warrant holders. The distribution occurred by way of a pro rata stock distribution to such common stock, preferred stock and warrant holders, each of whom received one share of Sysorex's common stock for every 3 shares of the Company's common stock (without taking into effect the Reverse Split effected on November 2, 2018) held on the Record Date or such number of shares of common stock issuable upon complete conversion of the preferred stock or exercise of the warrants.\nOctober 2018 and December 2018 Note Purchase Agreements and Promissory Notes\nOn October 12, 2018 the Company entered into a note purchase agreement with an institutional investor (the Holder\u201d), pursuant to which the Company agreed to issue and sell to the Holder an unsecured promissory note (the October 2018 Note\u201d) in an aggregate principal amount of $2.52 million (the Initial Principal Amount\u201d), which is payable on or before the date that is 12 months from the issuance date. The Initial Principal Amount includes an original issue discount of $500,000.00 and $20,000.00 that the Company agreed to pay to the Holder to cover the Holder's legal fees, accounting costs, due diligence, monitoring and other transaction costs. In exchange for the October 2018 Note, the Holder paid an aggregate purchase price of $2.0 million. Interest on the October 2018 Note accrues at a rate of 10% per annum and is payable on the maturity date or otherwise in accordance with the October 2018 Note. Beginning on the date that is 6 months from the issuance date and at the intervals indicated below until the October 2018 Note is paid in full, the Holder shall have the right to redeem up to an aggregate of 1/3 of the initial principal balance of the October 2018 Note each month (each monthly exercise, a Monthly Redemption Amount\u201d) by providing written notice (each, a Monthly Redemption Notice\u201d) delivered to the Company; provided, however, that if the Holder does not exercise any Monthly Redemption Amount in its corresponding month then such Monthly Redemption Amount shall be available for the Holder to redeem in any future month in addition to such future month's Monthly Redemption Amount. Upon receipt of any Monthly Redemption Notice, the Company shall pay the applicable Monthly Redemption Amount in cash to the Holder within 5 business days of the Company's receipt of such Monthly Redemption Notice.\nOn December 21, 2018, the Company entered into a note purchase agreement with an institutional investor (the Holder\u201d), pursuant to which the Company agreed to issue and sell to the Holder an unsecured promissory note (the December 2018 Note\u201d) in an aggregate principal amount of $1.895 million (the Initial Principal Amount\u201d), which is payable on or before the date that is 10 months from the issuance date. The Initial Principal Amount includes an original issue discount of $375,000 and $20,000 that the Company agreed to pay to the Holder to cover the Holder's legal fees, accounting costs, due diligence, monitoring and other transaction costs. In exchange for the December 2018 Note, the Holder paid an aggregate purchase price of $1.5 million. Interest on the December 2018 Note accrues at a rate of 10% per annum and is payable on the maturity date or otherwise in accordance with the December 2018 Note. The Company may pay all or any portion of the amount owed earlier than it is due; provided, that in the event the Company elects to prepay all or any portion of the outstanding balance, it shall pay to the Holder 115% of the portion of the outstanding balance the Company elects to prepay. Beginning on the date that is 6 months from the issuance date and at the intervals indicated below until the December 2018 Note is paid in full, the Holder shall have the right to redeem up to an aggregate of 1/3 of the initial principal balance of the December 2018 Note each month (each monthly exercise, a Monthly Redemption Amount\u201d) by providing written notice (each, a Monthly Redemption Notice\u201d) delivered to the Company; provided, however, that if the Holder does not exercise any Monthly Redemption Amount in its corresponding month then such Monthly Redemption Amount shall be available for the Holder to redeem in any future month in addition to such future month's Monthly Redemption Amount. Upon receipt of any Monthly Redemption Notice, the Company shall pay the applicable Monthly Redemption Amount in cash to the Holder within 5 business days of the Company's receipt of such Monthly Redemption Notice.\nOn February 9, 2019, the note purchase agreements were each amended to delete the phrase by cancellation or exchange of the Note, in whole or in part\u201d. The Company also agreed to pay the Note Holder's fees and other expenses in an aggregate amount of $80,000.00 (the Fee\u201d) in connection with the preparation of the amendment by adding $40,000.00 of the Fee to the outstanding balance of each of the notes issued pursuant to the note purchase agreements.\nSysorex Loan Transaction\nOn December 31, 2018, the Company and Sysorex entered into a note purchase agreement pursuant to which the Company agreed to purchase from Sysorex at a purchase price equal to the Loan Amount (as defined below), a secured promissory note (the Secured Note\u201d) for up to an aggregate principal amount of 3.0 million (the Principal Amount\u201d), including any amounts advanced through the date of the Secured Note (the Prior Advances\u201d), to be borrowed and disbursed in increments (such borrowed amount, together with the Prior Advances, collectively referred to as the Loan Amount\u201d), with interest to accrue at a rate of ten percent (10%) per annum on all such Loan Amounts, beginning as of the date of disbursement with respect to any portion of such Loan Amount. In addition, Sysorex agreed to pay $20,000 to the Company to cover the Company's legal fees, accounting costs, due diligence, monitoring and other transaction costs incurred in connection with the purchase and sale of the Secured Note (the Transaction Expense Amount\u201d), all of which amount is included in the Principal Amount. The initial Loan Amount, therefore, includes any amounts disbursed to Sysorex and the Transaction Expense Amount.\nSysorex may borrow repay and borrow under the Secured Note, as needed, for a total outstanding balance, exclusive of any unpaid accrued interest, not to exceed the Principal Amount at any one time.\nAll outstanding principal amounts and accrued unpaid interest owing under the Secured Note shall become immediately due and payable on the earlier to occur of (i) the twenty-four (24) month anniversary of the date the Secured Note is issued (the Maturity Date\u201d), (ii) at such date when declared due and payable by the Company upon the occurrence of an Event of Default (as defined in the Secured Note), or (iii) at any such earlier date as set forth in the Secured Note. All accrued unpaid interest shall be payable in cash.\nPursuant to the terms of the Secured Note, Sysorex granted the Company, subject to any and all Payplant Liens (as defined in the Secured Note) and Permitted Liens (as defined in the Secured Note), a continuing first priority security interest in all assets of Sysorex whether owned as of the date of the Secured Note or subsequently acquired, including all proceeds therefrom (collectively, the Collateral\u201d) to secure the payment of the Secured Note and all other loans and advances (including all renewals, modifications and extensions thereof) and all obligations of any and every kind and nature of Sysorex to the Company, whether arising prior to, under or after the date of the Secured Note, however incurred or evidenced, plus all interest, reasonable costs, reasonable expenses and reasonable attorneys' fees, which may be made or incurred by the Company in the disbursement, administration, and collection of such amounts, and in the protection, maintenance, and liquidation of the Collateral.\nOn February 4, 2019, the documents were amended to increase the maximum Principal Amount that may be outstanding at any time under the Secured Note from $3.0 million to $5.0 million.\nConvertible Note Exchange\nOn January 29, 2019, the Company and the holder (the Note Holder\u201d) of that certain outstanding convertible promissory note, issued on November 17, 2017 (as amended, supplemented or otherwise modified, the Original Note\u201d), with an outstanding balance of $383,768.07 (the Remaining Balance\u201d), entered into an exchange agreement (the Exchange Agreement\u201d), pursuant to which the Company and the Note Holder agreed to (i) partition a new convertible promissory note in the form of the Original Note (the Partitioned Note\u201d) in the original principal amount equal to the Remaining Balance (the Exchange Amount\u201d) and then cause the Remaining Balance to be reduced by the Exchange Amount; and (ii) exchange the Partitioned Note for the delivery of 172,869 shares (each, an Exchange Share\u201d and collectively, the Exchange Shares\u201d) of the Company's common stock at an effective price per Exchange Share equal to $2.22 (the Exchange\u201d). The Exchange was completed on January 29, 2019. Following such partition of the Original Note, the Original Note was deemed paid in full, was automatically deemed canceled, and shall not be reissued.\nRights Offering\nOn January 15, 2019, the Company closed its rights offering (the Rights Offering\u201d) for aggregate gross proceeds to the Company of $12.0 million and net proceeds of approximately $10.77 million after deducting expenses relating to dealer-manager fees and expenses.\nThe Company sold an aggregate of 12,000 units consisting of one share of Series 5 Convertible Preferred Stock with a stated value of $1,000 (and immediately convertible into shares of common stock at a conversion price of $3.33 per share) and 300 warrants to purchase common stock with an exercise price of $3.33 per share. The warrants are exercisable for 5 years after the date of issuance. The Series 5 Convertible Preferred Stock and the warrants comprising the units immediately separated upon the closing of the Rights Offering.\nAtlas Technology Settlement\nOn February 20, 2019, the Company, Sysorex and Atlas Technology Group, LLC ( Atlas\u201d) entered into a settlement agreement (the Settlement Agreement\u201d) in connection with the satisfaction of an arbitration award in an aggregate amount of $1,156,840.25 plus pre-judgment interest equal to an aggregate of $59,955.28 (the Award\u201d) granted to Atlas following arbitration proceedings arising out of an engagement agreement, dated September 8, 2016, by and between Atlas and the Company as well as its subsidiaries, including the predecessor to Sysorex (the Engagement Agreement\u201d).\nPursuant to the Settlement Agreement, Atlas agreed to (a) reduce the Award by $275,000 resulting in a net award of $941,795.53 (the Net Award\u201d) and (b) accept an aggregate of 749,440 shares of freely-tradable common stock of the Company (the Settlement Shares\u201d), in satisfaction of the Award, which was determined by dividing 120% of the Net Award by $1.508, which was the minimum price,\u201d as defined under Nasdaq Listing Rule 5635(d). The closing occurred on February 21, 2019.\nThe Award is deemed satisfied in full and the parties have released each other from any claims arising out of the Engagement Agreement. In connection with the Spin-off, the Company and Sysorex each agreed pursuant to the terms and conditions of that certain Separation and Distribution Agreement, dated August 7, 2018, as amended, that 50% of the costs and liabilities related to the arbitration action arising from the Engagement Agreement would be shared by each party following the Spin-off. As a result, Sysorex is obligated to indemnify the Company for half of the total amount paid by the Company to satisfy the Award.\nIn the event that the total net proceeds received by Atlas or its designees from the sale of the Settlement Shares (exclusive of brokerage fees) exceeds the amount of the Net Award, Atlas agreed to deliver an amount equal to the difference between the sale proceeds and the Net Award to the legal counsel for the Company and Sysorex to be applied against fees incurred in connection with the arbitration and the Settlement Agreement.\nJOBS Act\nPursuant to Section 107 of the JOBS Act, emerging growth companies may delay adopting new or revised accounting standards until such time as those standards apply to private companies. We have irrevocably elected to opt out of this exemption from new or revised accounting standards and, therefore, are subject to the same new or revised accounting standards as other public companies that are not emerging growth companies.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ( GAAP\u201d). In connection with the preparation of our consolidated financial statements, we are required to make assumptions and estimates about future events, and apply judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses and the related disclosures. We base our assumptions, estimates and judgments on historical experience, current trends and other factors that management believes to be relevant at the time our consolidated financial statements are prepared. On a regular basis, we review the accounting policies, assumptions, estimates and judgments to ensure that our consolidated financial statements are presented fairly and in accordance with GAAP. However, because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty, actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates, and such differences could be material.\nOur significant accounting policies are discussed in Note 2 of the audited consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 which are included elsewhere in this 10-K. We believe that the following accounting estimates are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results, and they require our most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, resulting from the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. There have been no changes to estimates during the periods presented in the filing. Historically changes in management estimates have not been material.\nRevenue Recognition\nIn March 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB\u201d) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU\u201d) No. 2016-08, Revenue from Contracts with Customers - Principal versus Agent Considerations\u201d, in April 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-10, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) - Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing\u201d and in May 9, 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-12, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)\u201d, or ASU 2016-12. This update provides clarifying guidance regarding the application of ASU No. 2014-09 - Revenue From Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), ( ASU 2014-09\u201d) which is not yet effective. These new standards provide for a single, principles-based model for revenue recognition that replaces the existing revenue recognition guidance. In July 2015, the FASB deferred the effective date of ASU 2014-09 until annual and interim periods beginning on or after December 15, 2017 and has replaced most existing revenue recognition guidance under GAAP. ASU 2016-12 may be applied retrospectively to historical periods presented or as a cumulative-effect adjustment as of the date of adoption. We have adopted ASU 2016-12 using a modified retrospective approach and will be applied prospectively in our financial statements from January 1, 2018 forward. Revenues under ASU 2016-12 are required to be recognized either at a point in time\u201d or over time\u201d, depending on the facts and circumstances of the arrangement, and will be evaluated using a five-step model. The adoption of Topic 606 did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements, neither at initial implementation nor will it have a material impact on an ongoing basis.\nSoftware As A Service Revenue Recognition\nWith respect to sales of our maintenance, consulting and other service agreements including our digital advertising and electronic services, customers pay fixed monthly fees in exchange for the Company's service. The Company's performance obligation is satisfied over time as the digital advertising and electronic services are provided continuously throughout the service period. The Company recognizes revenue evenly over the service period using a time-based measure because the Company is providing continuous access to its service.\nProfessional Services Revenue Recognition\nThe Company's professional services include fixed fee and time and materials contracts. Fixed fees are paid monthly, in phases, or upon acceptance of deliverables. The Company's time and materials contracts are paid weekly or monthly based on hours worked. Revenue on time and material contracts is recognized based on a fixed hourly rate as direct labor hours are expended. Materials, or other specified direct costs, are reimbursed as actual costs and may include markup. The Company has elected the practical expedient to recognize revenue for the right to invoice because the Company's right to consideration corresponds directly with the value to the customer of the performance completed to date. For fixed fee contracts including maintenance service provided by in house personnel, the Company recognizes revenue evenly over the service period using a time-based measure because the Company is providing continuous service. Because the Company's contracts have an expected duration of one year or less, the Company has elected the practical expedient in ASC 606-10-50-14(a) to not disclose information about its remaining performance obligations. Anticipated losses are recognized as soon as they become known. For the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Company did not incur any such losses. These amounts are based on known and estimated factors.\nContract Balances\nThe timing of our revenue recognition may differ from the timing of payment by our customers. We record a receivable when revenue is recognized prior to payment and we have an unconditional right to payment. Alternatively, when payment precedes the provision of the related services, we record deferred revenue until the performance obligations are satisfied. The Company had deferred revenue of approximately $235,000 as of December 31, 2018 related to cash received in advance for product maintenance services provided by the Company's technical staff. The Company expects to satisfy its remaining performance obligations for these maintenance services and recognize the deferred revenue and related contract costs over the next twelve months.\nLong-lived Assets\nWe account for our long-lived assets in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC\u201d) 360, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets\u201d ( ASC 360\u201d), which requires that long-lived assets be evaluated whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable or the useful life has changed. Some of the events or changes in circumstances that would trigger an impairment test include, but are not limited to:\nTable 42: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>significant under-performance relative to expected and/or historical results (negative comparable sales growth or operating cash flows for two consecutive years); </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 43: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>significant negative industry or economic trends; </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 44: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>knowledge of transactions involving the sale of similar property at amounts below our carrying value; or </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 45: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>our expectation to dispose of long-lived assets before the end of their estimated useful lives, even though the assets do not meet the criteria to be classified as held for sale.\u201d </td> </tr>\n</table>\nLong-lived assets are grouped for recognition and measurement of impairment at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets. The impairment test for long-lived assets requires us to assess the recoverability of our long-lived assets by comparing their net carrying value to the sum of undiscounted estimated future cash flows directly associated with and arising from our use and eventual disposition of the assets. If the net carrying value of a group of long-lived assets exceeds the sum of related undiscounted estimated future cash flows, we would be required to record an impairment charge equal to the excess, if any, of net carrying value over fair value.\nWhen assessing the recoverability of our long-lived assets, which include property and equipment and finite-lived intangible assets, we make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors. Some of these assumptions involve a high degree of judgment and also bear a significant impact on the assessment conclusions. Included among these assumptions are estimating undiscounted future cash flows, including the projection of comparable sales, operating expenses, capital requirements for maintaining property and equipment and residual value of asset groups. We formulate estimates from historical experience and assumptions of future performance, based on business plans and forecasts, recent economic and business trends, and competitive conditions. In the event that our estimates or related assumptions change in the future, we may be required to record an impairment charge. Based on our evaluation we did not record a charge for impairment for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017.\nThe benefits to be derived from our acquired intangibles, will take additional financial resources to continue the development of our technology. Management believes our technology has significant long-term profit potential, and to date, management continues to allocate existing resources to the develop products and services to seek returns on its investment. We continue to seek additional resources, through both capital raising efforts and meeting with industry experts, as part of our continued efforts. Although there can be no assurance that these efforts will be successful, we intend to allocate financial and personnel resources when deemed possible and/or necessary. If we choose to abandon these efforts, or if we determine that such funding is not available, the related development of our technology (resulting in our lack of ability to expand our business), may be subject to significant impairment.\nAs described previously, we continue to experience weakness in market conditions, a depressed stock price, and challenges in executing our business plans. The Company will continue to monitor these uncertainties in future periods, to determine the impact.\nWe evaluate the remaining useful lives of long-lived assets and identifiable intangible assets whenever events or circumstances indicate that a revision to the remaining period of amortization is warranted. Such events or circumstances may include (but are not limited to): the effects of obsolescence, demand, competition, and/or other economic factors including the stability of the industry in which we operate, known technological advances, legislative actions, or changes in the regulatory environment. If the estimated remaining useful lives change, the remaining carrying amount of the long-lived assets and identifiable intangible assets would be amortized prospectively over that revised remaining useful life. We have determined that there were no events or circumstances during the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, which would indicate a revision to the remaining amortization period related to any of our long-lived assets. Accordingly, we believe that the current estimated useful lives of long-lived assets reflect the period over which they are expected to contribute to future cash flows and are therefore deemed appropriate.\nGoodwill and Indefinite-lived Assets\nWe have recorded goodwill and other indefinite-lived assets in connection with our acquisition of Shoom. Goodwill, which represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets of the acquired company, is not amortized. Indefinite-lived intangible assets are stated at fair value as of the date acquired in a business combination. The recoverability of goodwill is evaluated at least annually and when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.\nWe analyze goodwill first to assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform a detailed goodwill impairment test as required. The more-likely-than-not threshold is defined as having a likelihood of more than 50%.\nEvents and circumstances for an entity to consider in conducting the qualitative assessment are:\nTable 46: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>Macroeconomic conditions such as a deterioration in general economic conditions, limitations on accessing capital, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, or other developments in equity and credit markets. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 47: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>Industry and market considerations such as a deterioration in the environment in which an entity operates, an increased competitive environment, a decline in market-dependent multiples or metrics (considered in both absolute terms and relative to peers), a change in the market for an entity's products or services, or a regulatory or political development. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 48: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>Cost factors such as increases in raw materials, labor, or other costs that have a negative effect on earnings and cash flows. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 49: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>Overall financial performance such as negative or declining cash flows or a decline in actual or planned revenue or earnings compared with actual and projected results of relevant prior periods. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 50: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>Other relevant entity-specific events such as changes in management, key personnel, strategy, or customers, contemplation of bankruptcy, or litigation. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 51: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>Events affecting a reporting unit such as a change in the composition or carrying amount of its net assets, a more-likely-than-not expectation of selling or disposing of all, or a portion, of a reporting unit, the testing for recoverability of a significant asset group within a reporting unit, or recognition of a goodwill impairment loss in the financial statements of a subsidiary that is a component of a reporting unit. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 52: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>If applicable, a sustained decrease in share price (considered in both absolute terms and relative to peers). </td> </tr>\n</table>\nAcquired In-Process Research and Development ( IPR&D\u201d)\nIn accordance with authoritative guidance, we recognize IPR&D at fair value as of the acquisition date, and subsequently account for it as an indefinite-lived intangible asset until completion or abandonment of the associated research and development efforts. Once an IPR&D project has been completed, the useful life of the IPR&D asset is determined and amortized accordingly. If the IPR&D asset is abandoned, the remaining carrying value is written off. During fiscal year 2014, we acquired IPR&D through the acquisition of AirPatrol and in 2015 through the acquisition of the assets of LightMiner. Our IPR&D is comprised of AirPatrol and LightMiner technology, which was valued on the date of the acquisition. It will take additional financial resources to continue development of these technologies.\nWe continue to seek additional resources, through both capital raising efforts and meeting with industry experts, for further development of the AirPatrol technology. Through December 31, 2018, we have made some progress with raising capital since these acquisitions, building our pipeline and getting industry acknowledgment. We are being recognized by leading industry analysts in their report on leading indoor positioning companies and also was awarded the IoT Security Excellence award by TMC. However, management is focused on growing revenue from these products and continues to actively and aggressively pursue efforts to recognize the value of the AirPatrol and LightMiner technologies. Although there can be no assurance that these efforts will be successful, we intend to allocate financial and personnel resources when deemed possible and/or necessary. If we choose to abandon these efforts, or if we determine that such funding is not available, the related IPR&D will be subject to significant impairment.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets Subject to Amortization\nWe amortize intangible assets with finite lives over their estimated useful lives and review them for impairment whenever an impairment indicator exists. We continually monitor events and changes in circumstances that could indicate carrying amounts of our long-lived assets, including our intangible assets, may not be recoverable. When such events or changes in circumstances occur, we assess recoverability by determining whether the carrying value of such assets will be recovered through the undiscounted expected future cash flows. If the future undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying amount of these assets, we recognize an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the assets. We did not recognize any intangible asset impairment charges for the year ended December 31, 2018. See Acquired In-Process Research and Development ( IPR&D\u201d)\u201d for further information.\nDeferred Income Taxes\nIn accordance with ASC 740 Income Taxes\u201d ( ASC 740\u201d), management routinely evaluates the likelihood of the realization of its income tax benefits and the recognition of its deferred tax assets. In evaluating the need for any valuation allowance, management will assess whether it is more likely than not that some portion, or all, of the deferred tax asset may not be realized. Ultimately, the realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during those periods in which temporary differences become deductible and/or tax credits and tax loss carry-forwards can be utilized. In performing its analyses, management considers both positive and negative evidence including historical financial performance, previous earnings patterns, future earnings forecasts, tax planning strategies, economic and business trends and the potential realization of net operating loss carry-forwards within a reasonable timeframe. To this end, management considered (i) that we have had historical losses in the prior years and cannot anticipate generating a sufficient level of future profits in order to realize the benefits of our deferred tax asset; (ii) tax planning strategies; and (iii) the adequacy of future income as of and for the year ended December 31, 2018, based upon certain economic conditions and historical losses through December 31, 2018. After consideration of these factors, management deemed it appropriate to establish a full valuation allowance.\nA liability for unrecognized tax benefits\u201d is recorded for any tax benefits claimed in the Company's tax filings that do not meet these recognition and measurement standards. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, no liability for unrecognized tax benefits was required to be reported. The guidance also discusses the classification of related interest and penalties on income taxes. The Company's policy is to record interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions as a component of income tax expense. No interest or penalties were recorded during the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017.\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts\nWe maintain our reserves for credit losses at a level believed by management to be adequate to absorb potential losses inherent in the respective balances. We assign an internal credit quality rating to all new customers and update these ratings regularly, but no less than annually. Management's determination of the adequacy of the reserve for credit losses for our accounts and notes receivable is based on the age of the receivable balance, the customer's credit quality rating, an evaluation of historical credit losses, current economic conditions, and other relevant factors.\nAs of December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, reserves for credit losses included a reserve for doubtful accounts of approximately $464,000 and $1.1 million, respectively, due to the aging of the items greater than 120 days outstanding and other potential non-collections.\nBusiness Combinations\nWe account for business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting, and accordingly, the assets and liabilities of the acquired business are recorded at their fair values at the date of acquisition. The excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value is recorded as goodwill. Any changes in the estimated fair values of the net assets recorded for acquisitions prior to the finalization of more detailed analysis, but not to exceed one year from the date of acquisition, will change the amount of the purchase price allocable to goodwill. Any subsequent changes to any purchase price allocations that are material to our consolidated financial results will be adjusted. All acquisition costs are expensed as incurred and in-process research and development costs are recorded at fair value as an indefinite-lived intangible asset and assessed for impairment thereafter until completion, at which point the asset is amortized over its expected useful life. Separately recognized transactions associated with business combinations are generally expensed subsequent to the acquisition date. The application of business combination and impairment accounting requires the use of significant estimates and assumptions.\nUpon acquisition, the accounts and results of operations are consolidated as of and subsequent to the acquisition date and are included in our Consolidated Financial Statements from the acquisition date.\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe account for equity instruments issued to non-employees in accordance with accounting guidance, which requires that such equity instruments are recorded at their fair value on the measurement date, which is typically the date the services are performed.\nWe account for equity instruments issued to employees in accordance with accounting guidance that requires that awards are recorded at their fair value on the date of grant and are amortized over the vesting period of the award. We recognize compensation costs over the requisite service period of the award, which is generally the vesting term of the equity instrument issued.\nThe Black-Scholes option valuation model is used to estimate the fair value of the options or the equivalent security granted. The model includes subjective input assumptions that can materially affect the fair value estimates. The model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options or warrants. The expected volatility is estimated based on the average of historical volatilities for industry peers.\nThe principal assumptions used in applying the Black-Scholes model along with the results from the model were as follows:\nTable 53: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>For the Years Ended\nDecember 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Risk-free interest rate </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.79-3.01 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.27 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Expected life of option grants </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 5-6 years </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7 years </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Expected volatility of underlying stock </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>45.64-46.18 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>47.34 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Dividends assumption </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>-- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>-- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Company recorded a charge of $1.5 million, for the amortization of employee stock options.\nResults of Operations\nYear Ended December 31, 2018 compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2017\nThe following table sets forth selected consolidated financial data as a percentage of our revenue and the percentage of period-over-period change:\nTable 54: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Years ended </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, 2018 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, 2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>(in thousands, except percentages) </td> <td> </td> <td>Amount </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>% of\nRevenues </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Amount </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>% of\nRevenues </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>%\nChange </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Product revenues </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,135 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>30 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>535 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>112 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Services revenues </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,621 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>70 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,400 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>86 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(23 </td> <td>)% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Cost of revenues - Products </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>490 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>494 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1 </td> <td>)% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Cost of revenues - Services </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>586 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>738 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>19 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(21 </td> <td>)% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Gross profit </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,680 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>71 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,703 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>69 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1 </td> <td>)% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Operating expenses </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>21,082 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>561 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>17,733 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>451 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>19 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Loss from operations </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(18.402 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(490 </td> <td>)% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(15,030 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(382 </td> <td>)% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>22 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net loss </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(24,561 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(654 </td> <td>)% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(35,030 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(890 </td> <td>)% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(30 </td> <td>)% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net loss attributable to stockholders </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(44,624 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,188 </td> <td>)% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(35,769 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(909 </td> <td>)% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>25 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenues\nRevenues for the year ended December 31, 2018 were $3.8 million compared to $3.9 million for the comparable period in the prior year for a decrease of $0.1 million, or approximately 2.6%. Revenues between the two comparable periods are relatively flat due to an increase in our IPA product revenues, which was offset by a decrease in our Shoom services revenue.\nOur revenues for the year ended December 31, 2018 include our IPA and other product lines that remain following the Spin-off. Such revenues do not include the revenues of our historical value added reseller business, as such business was part of the Spin-off of Sysorex. Accordingly, the revenues for the year ended December 31, 2018 represent a decline of approximately 90% from the total historical revenues reported for the year ended December 31, 2017, which included the aggregate revenues of our IPA business and the value added reseller business.\nCost of Revenues\nCost of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2018 were $1.1 million compared to $1.2 million for the comparable period in the prior year. This decrease of $0.1 million, or approximately 8.3%, was primarily attributable the nominally lower revenue with higher gross margins during the year ended December 31, 2018.\nThe gross profit margin for the year ended December 31, 2018 was 71% compared to 69% for the year ended December 31, 2017. This slight increase in margin is primarily due to the sales mix of products and services sold during the year ended December 31, 2018.\nOperating Expenses\nOperating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2018 were $21.1 million and $17.7 million for the comparable period ended December 31, 2017. This increase of $3.4 million is primarily attributable to higher IT infrastructure costs, compensation, cost of public offerings, and legal and professional fees as well as a $636,000 intangibles impairment, $690,000 of deconsolidation costs related to the Spin-off and a litigation settlement of $560,000.\nLoss From Operations\n\\\nLoss from operations for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $18.4 million as compared to $15 million for the comparable period in the prior year. This increase of $3.4 million was primarily attributable to the higher operating expenses during the year ended December 31, 2018 as discussed in the reporting caption above. In addition, total losses reported include losses associated with the value added reseller business prior to the spin-off of the value added reseller business in the deconsolidated operations line item.\nOther Income/Expense\nOther income/expense for the year ended December 31, 2018 was a loss of $1.4 million compared to a loss of $3.1 million for the comparable period in the prior year. This decrease in loss of $1.7 million is primarily attributable to a $643,000 decrease in interest expense due to the amortization of deferred financing costs in 2017 and lower interest on credit facilities and notes in 2018 and forgiveness of debt and a non-cash extinguishment loss for the value of the common shares issued as repayment for the debenture in 2017.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nThere was no provision for income taxes for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 as the Company was in a net taxable loss position. Deferred tax assets resulting from such losses are fully reserved as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 since, at present, the Company has no history of taxable income and it is more likely than not that such assets will not be realized.\nNet Gain and Net Loss Attributable To Non-Controlling Interest\nNet gain attributable to non-controlling interest for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $11,000. Net loss attributable to non-controlling interest for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $17,000. This increase in gain of $28,000 was attributable to the gain from Sysorex India.\nNet Loss Attributable To Stockholders of Inpixon\nNet loss attributable to stockholders of Inpixon for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $24.6 million compared to $35.0 million for the comparable period in the prior year. This decrease in loss of $10.4 million was primarily attributable to the $2 million lower other income/expenses offset by the $3.4 million increase in operating expenses during the year ended December 31, 2018 plus the $12 million lower loss from deconsolidated operations of the Spin-off during the year ended December 31, 2018.\nNon-GAAP Financial information\nEBITDA\nEBITDA is defined as net income (loss) before interest, provision for (benefit from) income taxes, and depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA is used by our management as the matrix in which it manages the business. It is defined as EBITDA plus adjustments for other income or expense items, non-recurring items and non-cash stock-based compensation.\nAdjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2018 was a loss of $15.0 million compared to a loss of $12.1 million for the prior year period.\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of net income/loss attributable to stockholders of Inpixon, which is our GAAP operating performance measure, to Adjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 (in thousands):\nTable 55: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>For the Years Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net loss attributable to common stockholders </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(44,624 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(35,769 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Adjustments: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Non-recurring one-time charges: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Acquisition transaction/financing costs </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>108 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Costs associated with public offering </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>327 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>212 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Impairment of goodwill </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>636 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,392 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Write off of project expenses </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>726 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Gain on earnout </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(934 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(561 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Gain on the sale of Sysorex Arabia </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(23 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Change in the fair value of derivative liability </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(48 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(555 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Severance </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>27 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Stock based compensation - acquisition costs </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Provision for doubtful accounts </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(659 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>952 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Gain on the sale of contracts </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(601 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Gain on the settlement of obligations </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(307 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(430 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Exchange of warrants for shares </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>434 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Extinguishment loss for debt modification </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,523 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Debt forgiveness </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>635 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Settlement of litigation </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>559 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Deemed dividend to preferred stockholders </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,407 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>756 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Deemed dividend for triggering of warrant down round feature </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13,645 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Stock-based compensation - compensation and related benefits </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,494 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,526 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Interest expense </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,044 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,821 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Depreciation and amortization </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,186 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,895 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Adjusted EBITDA </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(15,049 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(12,130 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe rely on Adjusted EBITDA, which is a non-GAAP financial measure for the following:\nTable 56: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>To review and assess the operating performance of our Company as permitted by Accounting Standards Codification Topic 280, Segment Reporting;

We believe it provides an additional way for investors to view our operations, when considered with both our GAAP results and the reconciliation to net income (loss). By including this information, we can provide investors with a more complete understanding of our business.

Thus, we strongly urge investors not to consider this metric in isolation or as a substitute for net income (loss) and the other consolidated statement of operations data prepared in accordance with GAAP. Some of these limitations include the fact that:\nTable 58: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect our cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments; </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect the significant interest expense or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on our debt; </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>Although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future, and Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements; </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect income or other taxes or the cash requirements to make any tax payments; and </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>Other companies in our industry may calculate Adjusted EBITDA differently than we do, thereby potentially limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure. </td> </tr>\n</table>\nBecause of these limitations, Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered a measure of discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business or as a measure of performance in compliance with GAAP.

Footnote 1 to the notes to our consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2018 include language referring to our recurring and continuing losses from operations and expressing substantial doubt in our ability to continue as a going concern without additional capital becoming available. Management's plans and assessment of the probability that such plans will mitigate and alleviate any substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern, is dependent upon the ability to obtain additional equity or debt financing, attain further operating efficiency, reduce expenditures, and, ultimately, to generate sufficient levels of revenue, which together represent the principal conditions that raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2018 do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources - Payplant\nSee the discussion above in the section titled Loan and Security Agreement\u201d for information concerning this loan.\nAs of December 31, 2018, the principal amount outstanding under the Loan Agreement was $23,000.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources as of December 31, 2018 Compared With December 31, 2017\nThe Company's net cash flows used in operating, investing and financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 and certain balances as of the end of those periods are as follows (in thousands):\nTable 67: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>For the Years Ended\nDecember 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(26,765 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,249 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net cash used in investing activities </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,429 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,318 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net cash (used in) provided by financing activities </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>28,996 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(2,660 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Effect of foreign exchange rate changes on cash </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(5 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(21 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net increase (decrease) in cash </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>797 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(1,750 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n</table>\nTable 68: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>As of December 31,\n2018 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>As of December 31,\n2017 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Cash and cash equivalents </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,008 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>119 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Working capital (deficit) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(3,926 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(32,822 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n</table>\nOperating Activities for the year ended December 31, 2018\nNet cash used in operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2018 was $26.8 million.

In addition to historical information, this discussion and analysis here and throughout this Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements, due to a number of factors, including but not limited to, risks described in the section entitled Risk Factors.\u201d\nExcept where indicated, all share and per share data in this section, as well as the consolidated financial statements, reflect the 1-for-15 reverse split of the Company's outstanding common stock effected on March 1, 2017, the 1-for-30 reverse split of the Company's outstanding common stock effected on February 6, 2018, and the 1-for-40 reverse split of the Company's outstanding common stock effected on November 2, 2018 (collectively, the Reverse Splits\u201d). We have reflected the Reverse Splits herein, unless otherwise indicated.\nOverview of Our Business\nWe provide a number of different technology products and services to private and public sector customers. Effective January 1, 2017, the Company changed the way it analyzes and assesses divisional performance of the Company. The Company re-aligned its operating segments along those division business lines and operated in two segments, namely Indoor Positioning Analytics and Infrastructure. The Infrastructure business was part of the Spin-off of Sysorex and is no longer part of our reporting. Our Indoor Positioning Analytics ( IPA\u201d) products secure, digitize and optimize the interior of any premises with indoor positioning and data analytics that provide rich positional information, similar to a global positioning system, and browser-like intelligence for the indoors. In addition, we offer digital tear-sheets with optional invoice integration, digital ad delivery, and an e-edition designed for reader engagement for the media, publishing and entertainment industry.\nRevenues were flat in 2018 because of an increase in our IPA product revenues, which was offset by a decrease in our Shoom services revenue. We expect to continue to grow our IPA product line in 2019. The IPA product line does have long sales cycles, which are a result from customer-related issues such as budget and procurement processes but also because of the early stages of indoor-positioning technology and the learning curve required for customers to implement such solutions. Customers also engage in a pilot program first which prolongs sales cycles and is typical of most emerging technology adoption curves. We anticipate sales cycles to improve in 2019 as our customer base moves from early adopters to mainstream customers. The sales cycle is also improving with the increased presence and awareness of beacon and Wi-Fi locationing technologies in the market. IPA sales can be licensed-based with government customers but commercial customers typically prefer a SaaS or subscription model. Our other digital solutions are also delivered on a SaaS model and allow us to generate industry analytics that complement our indoor-positioning solutions.\nWe experienced a net loss of $24.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 and a net loss of $35.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. We cannot assure that we will ever earn revenues sufficient to support our operations, or that we will ever be profitable. In order to continue our operations, we have supplemented the revenues we earned with proceeds from the sale of our equity and debt securities and proceeds from loans and bank credit lines. Furthermore, except for our Payplant facility, we have no committed source of financing and we cannot assure that we will be able to raise money as and when we need it to continue our operations. If we cannot raise funds as and when we need them, we may be required to scale back our business operations by reducing expenditures for employees, consultants, business development and marketing efforts, selling assets or one or more products in our business, or otherwise severely curtailing our operations.\nRecent Events\nReverse Stock Splits\nDuring 2018 and 2017, the Company has effected three reverse stock splits: (1) a 1-for-15 reverse split of the Company's outstanding common stock effected on March 1, 2017; (2) a 1-for-30 reverse split of the Company's outstanding common stock effected on February 6, 2018; and (3) a 1-for-40 reverse split of the Company's outstanding common stock effected on November 2, 2018.\nJanuary 2018 Capital Raise\nOn January 5, 2018, the Company entered into a securities purchase agreement (the January 2018 SPA\u201d) with certain investors pursuant to which the Company agreed to sell, in a registered direct offering, an aggregate of 14,996 shares (the January 2018 Shares\u201d) of the Company's common stock at a purchase price of $212.40 per share for aggregate gross proceeds of approximately $3.2 million. After deducting placement agent fees and other expenses, the net proceeds from the offering was approximately $2.8 million. Concurrently with the sale of the January 2018 Shares, pursuant to the January 2018 SPA the Company also sold warrants to purchase up to 14,996 shares of common stock (the January 2018 Warrants\u201d). This offering closed on January 8, 2018.\nThe January 2018 Warrants became exercisable on February 2, 2018 (the January 2018 Warrant Initial Exercise Date\u201d), at an exercise price per share equal to $264.00, subject to certain adjustments pursuant to the terms of the January 2018 Warrants (the January 2018 Warrant Exercise Price\u201d), and will expire on the fifth anniversary of the January 2018 Warrant Initial Exercise Date. As a result of a Dilutive Issuance (as defined in the January 2018 Warrants) as of February 20, 2018, the January 2018 Warrant Exercise Price was adjusted to the floor price of $120.00 per share pursuant to the January 2018 Warrants.\nFebruary 2018 Public Offering\nOn February 20, 2018, the Company completed a public offering for approximately $18 million in securities, consisting of (i) an aggregate of 83,149 Class A units, at a price to the public of $94.00 per Class A unit, each consisting of one share of common stock, and a five-year warrant to purchase one share of common stock, and (ii) 10,184.9752 Class B units, at a price to the public of $1,000 per Class B unit, each consisting of one share of the Company's newly designated Series 3 convertible preferred stock, par value $0.001 per share ( Series 3 Preferred\u201d), with a stated value of $1,000 and initially convertible into approximately 11 shares of common stock at a conversion price of $94.00 per share for up to an aggregate of 108,351 shares of common stock and warrants exercisable for the number of shares of common stock into which the shares of Series 3 Preferred is initially convertible. The warrants ( February 2018 Warrant\u201d) were immediately exercisable at an exercise price of $140.00 per share (subject to adjustment).\nThe Company received approximately $18 million in gross proceeds from this offering, including the satisfaction of approximately $1 million in amounts payable to service providers. After satisfying the amounts due to service providers and deducting placement agent fees, the net cash proceeds from this offering was approximately $15.4 million. The Company used the net proceeds from the transactions for working capital and general corporate purposes, including research and development and sales and marketing.\nThe shares of Series 3 Preferred issued in this offering have all been converted into common stock. As a result of the April 2018 offering described below as of April 24, 2018, the exercise price of the February 2018 Warrants was adjusted to the floor price of $25.36 per share and the number of shares of common stock underlying the February 2018 Warrants was increased to an aggregate of 1,057,178 shares of common stock.\nApril 2018 Public Offering\nOn April 24, 2018, the Company completed a public offering consisting of 10,115 units at a price to the public of $1,000 per unit, each consisting of (i) one share of our newly designated Series 4 convertible preferred stock, par value $0.001 per share (the Series 4 Preferred\u201d), with a stated value of $1,000 and initially convertible into approximately 54 shares of common stock, at a conversion price of $18.40 per share (subject to adjustment) and (ii) one warrant to purchase such number of shares of common stock as each share of Series 4 Preferred is initially convertible into. The warrants are immediately exercisable at an exercise price of $26.80 per share (subject to adjustment).\nThe Series 4 Preferred contain an anti-dilution protection feature, to adjust the conversion price if shares of common stock are sold or issued for a consideration per share less than the conversion price then in effect (subject to certain exemptions), provided, that the conversion price will not be less than $4.96. In addition, on the 60th day following the original issuance date of the Series 4 Preferred, the conversion price was reduced, and only reduced, to the lesser of (x) the then conversion price, as may be adjusted, and (y) 80% of the VWAP (as defined in the certificate of designation filed for the Series 4 Preferred) on the trading day immediately prior to the 60th day, provided that the conversion price will not be less than $4.96. On June 25, 2018, in accordance with the terms of such price reset provision, the conversion price of the Series 4 Preferred was adjusted to $7.12, which was subsequent adjusted on January 15, 2019 in connection with the rights offering to $4.96. In addition, in connection with the rights offering, on January 15, 2019, the exercise price of the warrants issued in the April offering were also reduced to the floor price of $4.96 and the number of shares issuable upon exercise of such warrants was increased to 2,769,000 shares of common stock.\nThe Company received approximately $10.1 million in gross proceeds from this offering, before deducting placement agent fees and offering expenses payable by the Company. After deducting placement agent fees and expenses, the net proceeds from this offering were approximately $9.2 million. The Company intends to use the net proceeds from this offering for working capital, general corporate purposes (including research and development, sales and marketing and the satisfaction of outstanding amounts payable to our vendors in connection with trade payables). Additionally, the Company may use a portion of the net proceeds of this offering to finance acquisitions of, or investments in, competitive and complementary businesses, products or services as a part of our growth strategy. However, the Company does not have any current commitments with respect to any such acquisitions or investments.\nSpin-off of Sysorex, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiary, Sysorex Government Services, Inc.\nOn August 31, 2018, the Company completed the spin-off (the Spin-off\u201d) of its value added reseller business from its indoor positioning analytics business by way of a distribution of all the shares of common stock of the Company's wholly-owned subsidiary, Sysorex, to the Company's stockholders of record as of August 21, 2018 (the Record Date\u201d) and certain warrant holders. The distribution occurred by way of a pro rata stock distribution to such common stock, preferred stock and warrant holders, each of whom received one share of Sysorex's common stock for every 3 shares of the Company's common stock (without taking into effect the Reverse Split effected on November 2, 2018) held on the Record Date or such number of shares of common stock issuable upon complete conversion of the preferred stock or exercise of the warrants.\nOctober 2018 and December 2018 Note Purchase Agreements and Promissory Notes\nOn October 12, 2018 the Company entered into a note purchase agreement with an institutional investor (the Holder\u201d), pursuant to which the Company agreed to issue and sell to the Holder an unsecured promissory note (the October 2018 Note\u201d) in an aggregate principal amount of $2.52 million (the Initial Principal Amount\u201d), which is payable on or before the date that is 12 months from the issuance date. The Initial Principal Amount includes an original issue discount of $500,000.00 and $20,000.00 that the Company agreed to pay to the Holder to cover the Holder's legal fees, accounting costs, due diligence, monitoring and other transaction costs. In exchange for the October 2018 Note, the Holder paid an aggregate purchase price of $2.0 million. Interest on the October 2018 Note accrues at a rate of 10% per annum and is payable on the maturity date or otherwise in accordance with the October 2018 Note. Beginning on the date that is 6 months from the issuance date and at the intervals indicated below until the October 2018 Note is paid in full, the Holder shall have the right to redeem up to an aggregate of 1/3 of the initial principal balance of the October 2018 Note each month (each monthly exercise, a Monthly Redemption Amount\u201d) by providing written notice (each, a Monthly Redemption Notice\u201d) delivered to the Company; provided, however, that if the Holder does not exercise any Monthly Redemption Amount in its corresponding month then such Monthly Redemption Amount shall be available for the Holder to redeem in any future month in addition to such future month's Monthly Redemption Amount. Upon receipt of any Monthly Redemption Notice, the Company shall pay the applicable Monthly Redemption Amount in cash to the Holder within 5 business days of the Company's receipt of such Monthly Redemption Notice.\nOn December 21, 2018, the Company entered into a note purchase agreement with an institutional investor (the Holder\u201d), pursuant to which the Company agreed to issue and sell to the Holder an unsecured promissory note (the December 2018 Note\u201d) in an aggregate principal amount of $1.895 million (the Initial Principal Amount\u201d), which is payable on or before the date that is 10 months from the issuance date.

Interest on the December 2018 Note accrues at a rate of 10% per annum and is payable on the maturity date or otherwise in accordance with the December 2018 Note. The Company may pay all or any portion of the amount owed earlier than it is due; provided, that in the event the Company elects to prepay all or any portion of the outstanding balance, it shall pay to the Holder 115% of the portion of the outstanding balance the Company elects to prepay. Beginning on the date that is 6 months from the issuance date and at the intervals indicated below until the December 2018 Note is paid in full, the Holder shall have the right to redeem up to an aggregate of 1/3 of the initial principal balance of the December 2018 Note each month (each monthly exercise, a Monthly Redemption Amount\u201d) by providing written notice (each, a Monthly Redemption Notice\u201d) delivered to the Company; provided, however, that if the Holder does not exercise any Monthly Redemption Amount in its corresponding month then such Monthly Redemption Amount shall be available for the Holder to redeem in any future month in addition to such future month's Monthly Redemption Amount. Upon receipt of any Monthly Redemption Notice, the Company shall pay the applicable Monthly Redemption Amount in cash to the Holder within 5 business days of the Company's receipt of such Monthly Redemption Notice.\nOn February 9, 2019, the note purchase agreements were each amended to delete the phrase by cancellation or exchange of the Note, in whole or in part\u201d. The Company also agreed to pay the Note Holder's fees and other expenses in an aggregate amount of $80,000.00 (the Fee\u201d) in connection with the preparation of the amendment by adding $40,000.00 of the Fee to the outstanding balance of each of the notes issued pursuant to the note purchase agreements.\nSysorex Loan Transaction\nOn December 31, 2018, the Company and Sysorex entered into a note purchase agreement pursuant to which the Company agreed to purchase from Sysorex at a purchase price equal to the Loan Amount (as defined below), a secured promissory note (the Secured Note\u201d) for up to an aggregate principal amount of 3.0 million (the Principal Amount\u201d), including any amounts advanced through the date of the Secured Note (the Prior Advances\u201d), to be borrowed and disbursed in increments (such borrowed amount, together with the Prior Advances, collectively referred to as the Loan Amount\u201d), with interest to accrue at a rate of ten percent (10%) per annum on all such Loan Amounts, beginning as of the date of disbursement with respect to any portion of such Loan Amount. In addition, Sysorex agreed to pay $20,000 to the Company to cover the Company's legal fees, accounting costs, due diligence, monitoring and other transaction costs incurred in connection with the purchase and sale of the Secured Note (the Transaction Expense Amount\u201d), all of which amount is included in the Principal Amount. The initial Loan Amount, therefore, includes any amounts disbursed to Sysorex and the Transaction Expense Amount.\nSysorex may borrow repay and borrow under the Secured Note, as needed, for a total outstanding balance, exclusive of any unpaid accrued interest, not to exceed the Principal Amount at any one time.\nAll outstanding principal amounts and accrued unpaid interest owing under the Secured Note shall become immediately due and payable on the earlier to occur of (i) the twenty-four (24) month anniversary of the date the Secured Note is issued (the Maturity Date\u201d), (ii) at such date when declared due and payable by the Company upon the occurrence of an Event of Default (as defined in the Secured Note), or (iii) at any such earlier date as set forth in the Secured Note. All accrued unpaid interest shall be payable in cash.\nPursuant to the terms of the Secured Note, Sysorex granted the Company, subject to any and all Payplant Liens (as defined in the Secured Note) and Permitted Liens (as defined in the Secured Note), a continuing first priority security interest in all assets of Sysorex whether owned as of the date of the Secured Note or subsequently acquired, including all proceeds therefrom (collectively, the Collateral\u201d) to secure the payment of the Secured Note and all other loans and advances (including all renewals, modifications and extensions thereof) and all obligations of any and every kind and nature of Sysorex to the Company, whether arising prior to, under or after the date of the Secured Note, however incurred or evidenced, plus all interest, reasonable costs, reasonable expenses and reasonable attorneys' fees, which may be made or incurred by the Company in the disbursement, administration, and collection of such amounts, and in the protection, maintenance, and liquidation of the Collateral.\nOn February 4, 2019, the documents were amended to increase the maximum Principal Amount that may be outstanding at any time under the Secured Note from $3.0 million to $5.0 million.\nConvertible Note Exchange\nOn January 29, 2019, the Company and the holder (the Note Holder\u201d) of that certain outstanding convertible promissory note, issued on November 17, 2017 (as amended, supplemented or otherwise modified, the Original Note\u201d), with an outstanding balance of $383,768.07 (the Remaining Balance\u201d), entered into an exchange agreement (the Exchange Agreement\u201d), pursuant to which the Company and the Note Holder agreed to (i) partition a new convertible promissory note in the form of the Original Note (the Partitioned Note\u201d) in the original principal amount equal to the Remaining Balance (the Exchange Amount\u201d) and then cause the Remaining Balance to be reduced by the Exchange Amount; and (ii) exchange the Partitioned Note for the delivery of 172,869 shares (each, an Exchange Share\u201d and collectively, the Exchange Shares\u201d) of the Company's common stock at an effective price per Exchange Share equal to $2.22 (the Exchange\u201d). The Exchange was completed on January 29, 2019. Following such partition of the Original Note, the Original Note was deemed paid in full, was automatically deemed canceled, and shall not be reissued.\nRights Offering\nOn January 15, 2019, the Company closed its rights offering (the Rights Offering\u201d) for aggregate gross proceeds to the Company of $12.0 million and net proceeds of approximately $10.77 million after deducting expenses relating to dealer-manager fees and expenses.\nThe Company sold an aggregate of 12,000 units consisting of one share of Series 5 Convertible Preferred Stock with a stated value of $1,000 (and immediately convertible into shares of common stock at a conversion price of $3.33 per share) and 300 warrants to purchase common stock with an exercise price of $3.33 per share. The warrants are exercisable for 5 years after the date of issuance. The Series 5 Convertible Preferred Stock and the warrants comprising the units immediately separated upon the closing of the Rights Offering.\nAtlas Technology Settlement\nOn February 20, 2019, the Company, Sysorex and Atlas Technology Group, LLC ( Atlas\u201d) entered into a settlement agreement (the Settlement Agreement\u201d) in connection with the satisfaction of an arbitration award in an aggregate amount of $1,156,840.25 plus pre-judgment interest equal to an aggregate of $59,955.28 (the Award\u201d) granted to Atlas following arbitration proceedings arising out of an engagement agreement, dated September 8, 2016, by and between Atlas and the Company as well as its subsidiaries, including the predecessor to Sysorex (the Engagement Agreement\u201d).\nPursuant to the Settlement Agreement, Atlas agreed to (a) reduce the Award by $275,000 resulting in a net award of $941,795.53 (the Net Award\u201d) and (b) accept an aggregate of 749,440 shares of freely-tradable common stock of the Company (the Settlement Shares\u201d), in satisfaction of the Award, which was determined by dividing 120% of the Net Award by $1.508, which was the minimum price,\u201d as defined under Nasdaq Listing Rule 5635(d). The closing occurred on February 21, 2019.\nThe Award is deemed satisfied in full and the parties have released each other from any claims arising out of the Engagement Agreement. In connection with the Spin-off, the Company and Sysorex each agreed pursuant to the terms and conditions of that certain Separation and Distribution Agreement, dated August 7, 2018, as amended, that 50% of the costs and liabilities related to the arbitration action arising from the Engagement Agreement would be shared by each party following the Spin-off. As a result, Sysorex is obligated to indemnify the Company for half of the total amount paid by the Company to satisfy the Award.\nIn the event that the total net proceeds received by Atlas or its designees from the sale of the Settlement Shares (exclusive of brokerage fees) exceeds the amount of the Net Award, Atlas agreed to deliver an amount equal to the difference between the sale proceeds and the Net Award to the legal counsel for the Company and Sysorex to be applied against fees incurred in connection with the arbitration and the Settlement Agreement.\nJOBS Act\nPursuant to Section 107 of the JOBS Act, emerging growth companies may delay adopting new or revised accounting standards until such time as those standards apply to private companies. We have irrevocably elected to opt out of this exemption from new or revised accounting standards and, therefore, are subject to the same new or revised accounting standards as other public companies that are not emerging growth companies.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ( GAAP\u201d). In connection with the preparation of our consolidated financial statements, we are required to make assumptions and estimates about future events, and apply judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses and the related disclosures. We base our assumptions, estimates and judgments on historical experience, current trends and other factors that management believes to be relevant at the time our consolidated financial statements are prepared. On a regular basis, we review the accounting policies, assumptions, estimates and judgments to ensure that our consolidated financial statements are presented fairly and in accordance with GAAP. However, because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty, actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates, and such differences could be material.\nOur significant accounting policies are discussed in Note 2 of the audited consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 which are included elsewhere in this 10-K. We believe that the following accounting estimates are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results, and they require our most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, resulting from the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. There have been no changes to estimates during the periods presented in the filing. Historically changes in management estimates have not been material.\nRevenue Recognition\nIn March 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB\u201d) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU\u201d) No. 2016-08, Revenue from Contracts with Customers - Principal versus Agent Considerations\u201d, in April 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-10, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) - Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing\u201d and in May 9, 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-12, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)\u201d, or ASU 2016-12. This update provides clarifying guidance regarding the application of ASU No. 2014-09 - Revenue From Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), ( ASU 2014-09\u201d) which is not yet effective. These new standards provide for a single, principles-based model for revenue recognition that replaces the existing revenue recognition guidance. In July 2015, the FASB deferred the effective date of ASU 2014-09 until annual and interim periods beginning on or after December 15, 2017 and has replaced most existing revenue recognition guidance under GAAP. ASU 2016-12 may be applied retrospectively to historical periods presented or as a cumulative-effect adjustment as of the date of adoption. We have adopted ASU 2016-12 using a modified retrospective approach and will be applied prospectively in our financial statements from January 1, 2018 forward. Revenues under ASU 2016-12 are required to be recognized either at a point in time\u201d or over time\u201d, depending on the facts and circumstances of the arrangement, and will be evaluated using a five-step model. The adoption of Topic 606 did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements, neither at initial implementation nor will it have a material impact on an ongoing basis.\nSoftware As A Service Revenue Recognition\nWith respect to sales of our maintenance, consulting and other service agreements including our digital advertising and electronic services, customers pay fixed monthly fees in exchange for the Company's service. The Company's performance obligation is satisfied over time as the digital advertising and electronic services are provided continuously throughout the service period. The Company recognizes revenue evenly over the service period using a time-based measure because the Company is providing continuous access to its service.\nProfessional Services Revenue Recognition\nThe Company's professional services include fixed fee and time and materials contracts. Fixed fees are paid monthly, in phases, or upon acceptance of deliverables. The Company's time and materials contracts are paid weekly or monthly based on hours worked. Revenue on time and material contracts is recognized based on a fixed hourly rate as direct labor hours are expended. Materials, or other specified direct costs, are reimbursed as actual costs and may include markup. The Company has elected the practical expedient to recognize revenue for the right to invoice because the Company's right to consideration corresponds directly with the value to the customer of the performance completed to date. For fixed fee contracts including maintenance service provided by in house personnel, the Company recognizes revenue evenly over the service period using a time-based measure because the Company is providing continuous service. Because the Company's contracts have an expected duration of one year or less, the Company has elected the practical expedient in ASC 606-10-50-14(a) to not disclose information about its remaining performance obligations. Anticipated losses are recognized as soon as they become known. For the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Company did not incur any such losses. These amounts are based on known and estimated factors.\nContract Balances\nThe timing of our revenue recognition may differ from the timing of payment by our customers. We record a receivable when revenue is recognized prior to payment and we have an unconditional right to payment. Alternatively, when payment precedes the provision of the related services, we record deferred revenue until the performance obligations are satisfied. The Company had deferred revenue of approximately $235,000 as of December 31, 2018 related to cash received in advance for product maintenance services provided by the Company's technical staff. The Company expects to satisfy its remaining performance obligations for these maintenance services and recognize the deferred revenue and related contract costs over the next twelve months.\nLong-lived Assets\nWe account for our long-lived assets in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC\u201d) 360, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets\u201d ( ASC 360\u201d), which requires that long-lived assets be evaluated whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable or the useful life has changed. Some of the events or changes in circumstances that would trigger an impairment test include, but are not limited to:\n \u25cf significant under-performance relative to expected and/or historical results (negative comparable sales growth or operating cash flows for two consecutive years); \n \u25cf significant negative industry or economic trends; \n \u25cf knowledge of transactions involving the sale of similar property at amounts below our carrying value; or \n \u25cf our expectation to dispose of long-lived assets before the end of their estimated useful lives, even though the assets do not meet the criteria to be classified as held for sale.\u201d \nLong-lived assets are grouped for recognition and measurement of impairment at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets. The impairment test for long-lived assets requires us to assess the recoverability of our long-lived assets by comparing their net carrying value to the sum of undiscounted estimated future cash flows directly associated with and arising from our use and eventual disposition of the assets. If the net carrying value of a group of long-lived assets exceeds the sum of related undiscounted estimated future cash flows, we would be required to record an impairment charge equal to the excess, if any, of net carrying value over fair value.\nWhen assessing the recoverability of our long-lived assets, which include property and equipment and finite-lived intangible assets, we make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors. Some of these assumptions involve a high degree of judgment and also bear a significant impact on the assessment conclusions. Included among these assumptions are estimating undiscounted future cash flows, including the projection of comparable sales, operating expenses, capital requirements for maintaining property and equipment and residual value of asset groups. We formulate estimates from historical experience and assumptions of future performance, based on business plans and forecasts, recent economic and business trends, and competitive conditions. In the event that our estimates or related assumptions change in the future, we may be required to record an impairment charge. Based on our evaluation we did not record a charge for impairment for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017.\nThe benefits to be derived from our acquired intangibles, will take additional financial resources to continue the development of our technology. Management believes our technology has significant long-term profit potential, and to date, management continues to allocate existing resources to the develop products and services to seek returns on its investment. We continue to seek additional resources, through both capital raising efforts and meeting with industry experts, as part of our continued efforts. Although there can be no assurance that these efforts will be successful, we intend to allocate financial and personnel resources when deemed possible and/or necessary. If we choose to abandon these efforts, or if we determine that such funding is not available, the related development of our technology (resulting in our lack of ability to expand our business), may be subject to significant impairment.\nAs described previously, we continue to experience weakness in market conditions, a depressed stock price, and challenges in executing our business plans. The Company will continue to monitor these uncertainties in future periods, to determine the impact.\nWe evaluate the remaining useful lives of long-lived assets and identifiable intangible assets whenever events or circumstances indicate that a revision to the remaining period of amortization is warranted. Such events or circumstances may include (but are not limited to): the effects of obsolescence, demand, competition, and/or other economic factors including the stability of the industry in which we operate, known technological advances, legislative actions, or changes in the regulatory environment. If the estimated remaining useful lives change, the remaining carrying amount of the long-lived assets and identifiable intangible assets would be amortized prospectively over that revised remaining useful life. We have determined that there were no events or circumstances during the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, which would indicate a revision to the remaining amortization period related to any of our long-lived assets. Accordingly, we believe that the current estimated useful lives of long-lived assets reflect the period over which they are expected to contribute to future cash flows and are therefore deemed appropriate.\nGoodwill and Indefinite-lived Assets\nWe have recorded goodwill and other indefinite-lived assets in connection with our acquisition of Shoom. Goodwill, which represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets of the acquired company, is not amortized. Indefinite-lived intangible assets are stated at fair value as of the date acquired in a business combination. The recoverability of goodwill is evaluated at least annually and when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.\nWe analyze goodwill first to assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform a detailed goodwill impairment test as required. The more-likely-than-not threshold is defined as having a likelihood of more than 50%.\nEvents and circumstances for an entity to consider in conducting the qualitative assessment are:\n \u25cf Macroeconomic conditions such as a deterioration in general economic conditions, limitations on accessing capital, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, or other developments in equity and credit markets. \n \u25cf Industry and market considerations such as a deterioration in the environment in which an entity operates, an increased competitive environment, a decline in market-dependent multiples or metrics (considered in both absolute terms and relative to peers), a change in the market for an entity's products or services, or a regulatory or political development. \n \u25cf Cost factors such as increases in raw materials, labor, or other costs that have a negative effect on earnings and cash flows. \n \u25cf Overall financial performance such as negative or declining cash flows or a decline in actual or planned revenue or earnings compared with actual and projected results of relevant prior periods. \n \u25cf Other relevant entity-specific events such as changes in management, key personnel, strategy, or customers, contemplation of bankruptcy, or litigation. \n \u25cf Events affecting a reporting unit such as a change in the composition or carrying amount of its net assets, a more-likely-than-not expectation of selling or disposing of all, or a portion, of a reporting unit, the testing for recoverability of a significant asset group within a reporting unit, or recognition of a goodwill impairment loss in the financial statements of a subsidiary that is a component of a reporting unit. \n \u25cf If applicable, a sustained decrease in share price (considered in both absolute terms and relative to peers). \nAcquired In-Process Research and Development ( IPR&D\u201d)\nIn accordance with authoritative guidance, we recognize IPR&D at fair value as of the acquisition date, and subsequently account for it as an indefinite-lived intangible asset until completion or abandonment of the associated research and development efforts. Once an IPR&D project has been completed, the useful life of the IPR&D asset is determined and amortized accordingly. If the IPR&D asset is abandoned, the remaining carrying value is written off. During fiscal year 2014, we acquired IPR&D through the acquisition of AirPatrol and in 2015 through the acquisition of the assets of LightMiner. Our IPR&D is comprised of AirPatrol and LightMiner technology, which was valued on the date of the acquisition. It will take additional financial resources to continue development of these technologies.\nWe continue to seek additional resources, through both capital raising efforts and meeting with industry experts, for further development of the AirPatrol technology. Through December 31, 2018, we have made some progress with raising capital since these acquisitions, building our pipeline and getting industry acknowledgment. We are being recognized by leading industry analysts in their report on leading indoor positioning companies and also was awarded the IoT Security Excellence award by TMC. However, management is focused on growing revenue from these products and continues to actively and aggressively pursue efforts to recognize the value of the AirPatrol and LightMiner technologies. Although there can be no assurance that these efforts will be successful, we intend to allocate financial and personnel resources when deemed possible and/or necessary. If we choose to abandon these efforts, or if we determine that such funding is not available, the related IPR&D will be subject to significant impairment.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets Subject to Amortization\nWe amortize intangible assets with finite lives over their estimated useful lives and review them for impairment whenever an impairment indicator exists. We continually monitor events and changes in circumstances that could indicate carrying amounts of our long-lived assets, including our intangible assets, may not be recoverable. When such events or changes in circumstances occur, we assess recoverability by determining whether the carrying value of such assets will be recovered through the undiscounted expected future cash flows. If the future undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying amount of these assets, we recognize an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the assets. We did not recognize any intangible asset impairment charges for the year ended December 31, 2018. See Acquired In-Process Research and Development ( IPR&D\u201d)\u201d for further information.\nDeferred Income Taxes\nIn accordance with ASC 740 Income Taxes\u201d ( ASC 740\u201d), management routinely evaluates the likelihood of the realization of its income tax benefits and the recognition of its deferred tax assets. In evaluating the need for any valuation allowance, management will assess whether it is more likely than not that some portion, or all, of the deferred tax asset may not be realized. Ultimately, the realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during those periods in which temporary differences become deductible and/or tax credits and tax loss carry-forwards can be utilized. In performing its analyses, management considers both positive and negative evidence including historical financial performance, previous earnings patterns, future earnings forecasts, tax planning strategies, economic and business trends and the potential realization of net operating loss carry-forwards within a reasonable timeframe. To this end, management considered (i) that we have had historical losses in the prior years and cannot anticipate generating a sufficient level of future profits in order to realize the benefits of our deferred tax asset; (ii) tax planning strategies; and (iii) the adequacy of future income as of and for the year ended December 31, 2018, based upon certain economic conditions and historical losses through December 31, 2018. After consideration of these factors, management deemed it appropriate to establish a full valuation allowance.\nA liability for unrecognized tax benefits\u201d is recorded for any tax benefits claimed in the Company's tax filings that do not meet these recognition and measurement standards. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, no liability for unrecognized tax benefits was required to be reported. The guidance also discusses the classification of related interest and penalties on income taxes. The Company's policy is to record interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions as a component of income tax expense. No interest or penalties were recorded during the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017.\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts\nWe maintain our reserves for credit losses at a level believed by management to be adequate to absorb potential losses inherent in the respective balances. We assign an internal credit quality rating to all new customers and update these ratings regularly, but no less than annually. Management's determination of the adequacy of the reserve for credit losses for our accounts and notes receivable is based on the age of the receivable balance, the customer's credit quality rating, an evaluation of historical credit losses, current economic conditions, and other relevant factors.\nAs of December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, reserves for credit losses included a reserve for doubtful accounts of approximately $464,000 and $1.1 million, respectively, due to the aging of the items greater than 120 days outstanding and other potential non-collections.\nBusiness Combinations\nWe account for business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting, and accordingly, the assets and liabilities of the acquired business are recorded at their fair values at the date of acquisition. The excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value is recorded as goodwill. Any changes in the estimated fair values of the net assets recorded for acquisitions prior to the finalization of more detailed analysis, but not to exceed one year from the date of acquisition, will change the amount of the purchase price allocable to goodwill. Any subsequent changes to any purchase price allocations that are material to our consolidated financial results will be adjusted. All acquisition costs are expensed as incurred and in-process research and development costs are recorded at fair value as an indefinite-lived intangible asset and assessed for impairment thereafter until completion, at which point the asset is amortized over its expected useful life. Separately recognized transactions associated with business combinations are generally expensed subsequent to the acquisition date. The application of business combination and impairment accounting requires the use of significant estimates and assumptions.\nUpon acquisition, the accounts and results of operations are consolidated as of and subsequent to the acquisition date and are included in our Consolidated Financial Statements from the acquisition date.\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe account for equity instruments issued to non-employees in accordance with accounting guidance, which requires that such equity instruments are recorded at their fair value on the measurement date, which is typically the date the services are performed.\nWe account for equity instruments issued to employees in accordance with accounting guidance that requires that awards are recorded at their fair value on the date of grant and are amortized over the vesting period of the award. We recognize compensation costs over the requisite service period of the award, which is generally the vesting term of the equity instrument issued.\nThe Black-Scholes option valuation model is used to estimate the fair value of the options or the equivalent security granted. The model includes subjective input assumptions that can materially affect the fair value estimates. The model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options or warrants. The expected volatility is estimated based on the average of historical volatilities for industry peers.\nThe principal assumptions used in applying the Black-Scholes model along with the results from the model were as follows:\n\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Company recorded a charge of $1.5 million, for the amortization of employee stock options.\nResults of Operations\nYear Ended December 31, 2018 compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2017\nThe following table sets forth selected consolidated financial data as a percentage of our revenue and the percentage of period-over-period change:\n\nRevenues\nRevenues for the year ended December 31, 2018 were $3.8 million compared to $3.9 million for the comparable period in the prior year for a decrease of $0.1 million, or approximately 2.6%. Revenues between the two comparable periods are relatively flat due to an increase in our IPA product revenues, which was offset by a decrease in our Shoom services revenue.\nOur revenues for the year ended December 31, 2018 include our IPA and other product lines that remain following the Spin-off. Such revenues do not include the revenues of our historical value added reseller business, as such business was part of the Spin-off of Sysorex. Accordingly, the revenues for the year ended December 31, 2018 represent a decline of approximately 90% from the total historical revenues reported for the year ended December 31, 2017, which included the aggregate revenues of our IPA business and the value added reseller business.\nCost of Revenues\nCost of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2018 were $1.1 million compared to $1.2 million for the comparable period in the prior year. This decrease of $0.1 million, or approximately 8.3%, was primarily attributable the nominally lower revenue with higher gross margins during the year ended December 31, 2018.\nThe gross profit margin for the year ended December 31, 2018 was 71% compared to 69% for the year ended December 31, 2017. This slight increase in margin is primarily due to the sales mix of products and services sold during the year ended December 31, 2018.\nOperating Expenses\nOperating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2018 were $21.1 million and $17.7 million for the comparable period ended December 31, 2017. This increase of $3.4 million is primarily attributable to higher IT infrastructure costs, compensation, cost of public offerings, and legal and professional fees as well as a $636,000 intangibles impairment, $690,000 of deconsolidation costs related to the Spin-off and a litigation settlement of $560,000.\nLoss From Operations\n\\\nLoss from operations for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $18.4 million as compared to $15 million for the comparable period in the prior year. This increase of $3.4 million was primarily attributable to the higher operating expenses during the year ended December 31, 2018 as discussed in the reporting caption above. In addition, total losses reported include losses associated with the value added reseller business prior to the spin-off of the value added reseller business in the deconsolidated operations line item.\nOther Income/Expense\nOther income/expense for the year ended December 31, 2018 was a loss of $1.4 million compared to a loss of $3.1 million for the comparable period in the prior year. This decrease in loss of $1.7 million is primarily attributable to a $643,000 decrease in interest expense due to the amortization of deferred financing costs in 2017 and lower interest on credit facilities and notes in 2018 and forgiveness of debt and a non-cash extinguishment loss for the value of the common shares issued as repayment for the debenture in 2017.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nThere was no provision for income taxes for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 as the Company was in a net taxable loss position. Deferred tax assets resulting from such losses are fully reserved as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 since, at present, the Company has no history of taxable income and it is more likely than not that such assets will not be realized.\nNet Gain and Net Loss Attributable To Non-Controlling Interest\nNet gain attributable to non-controlling interest for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $11,000. Net loss attributable to non-controlling interest for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $17,000. This increase in gain of $28,000 was attributable to the gain from Sysorex India.\nNet Loss Attributable To Stockholders of Inpixon\nNet loss attributable to stockholders of Inpixon for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $24.6 million compared to $35.0 million for the comparable period in the prior year. This decrease in loss of $10.4 million was primarily attributable to the $2 million lower other income/expenses offset by the $3.4 million increase in operating expenses during the year ended December 31, 2018 plus the $12 million lower loss from deconsolidated operations of the Spin-off during the year ended December 31, 2018.\nNon-GAAP Financial information\nEBITDA\nEBITDA is defined as net income (loss) before interest, provision for (benefit from) income taxes, and depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA is used by our management as the matrix in which it manages the business. It is defined as EBITDA plus adjustments for other income or expense items, non-recurring items and non-cash stock-based compensation.\nAdjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2018 was a loss of $15.0 million compared to a loss of $12.1 million for the prior year period.\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of net income/loss attributable to stockholders of Inpixon, which is our GAAP operating performance measure, to Adjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 (in thousands):\n\nWe rely on Adjusted EBITDA, which is a non-GAAP financial measure for the following:\n\nWe have presented Adjusted EBITDA above because we believe it conveys useful information to investors regarding our operating results. We believe it provides an additional way for investors to view our operations, when considered with both our GAAP results and the reconciliation to net income (loss). By including this information, we can provide investors with a more complete understanding of our business. Specifically, we present Adjusted EBITDA as supplemental disclosure because of the following:\n \u25cf We believe Adjusted EBITDA is a useful tool for investors to assess the operating performance of our business without the effect of interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization and other non-cash items including stock based compensation, amortization of intangibles, change in the fair value of shares to be issued, change in the fair value of derivative liability, impairment of goodwill and one time charges including gain/loss on the settlement of obligations, severance costs, provision for doubtful accounts, acquisition costs and the costs associated with the public offering. \u25cf We believe that it is useful to provide to investors with a standard operating metric used by management to evaluate our operating performance; and \u25cf We believe that the use of Adjusted EBITDA is helpful to compare our results to other companies. \nEven though we believe Adjusted EBITDA is useful for investors, it does have limitations as an analytical tool. Thus, we strongly urge investors not to consider this metric in isolation or as a substitute for net income (loss) and the other consolidated statement of operations data prepared in accordance with GAAP. Some of these limitations include the fact that:\n \u25cf Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect our cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments; \u25cf Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; \u25cf Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect the significant interest expense or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on our debt; \u25cf Although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future, and Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements; \u25cf Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect income or other taxes or the cash requirements to make any tax payments; and \u25cf Other companies in our industry may calculate Adjusted EBITDA differently than we do, thereby potentially limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure. \nBecause of", "item_7_truncated": "ITEM 7: MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In addition to historical information, this discussion and analysis here and throughout this Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements, due to a number of factors, including but not limited to, risks described in the section entitled Risk Factors.\u201d\nExcept where indicated, all share and per share data in this section, as well as the consolidated financial statements, reflect the 1-for-15 reverse split of the Company's outstanding common stock effected on March 1, 2017, the 1-for-30 reverse split of the Company's outstanding common stock effected on February 6, 2018, and the 1-for-40 reverse split of the Company's outstanding common stock effected on November 2, 2018 (collectively, the Reverse Splits\u201d). We have reflected the Reverse Splits herein, unless otherwise indicated.\nOverview of Our Business\nWe provide a number of different technology products and services to private and public sector customers. Effective January 1, 2017, the Company changed the way it analyzes and assesses divisional performance of the Company. The Company re-aligned its operating segments along those division business lines and operated in two segments, namely Indoor Positioning Analytics and Infrastructure. The Infrastructure business was part of the Spin-off of Sysorex and is no longer part of our reporting. Our Indoor Positioning Analytics ( IPA\u201d) products secure, digitize and optimize the interior of any premises with indoor positioning and data analytics that provide rich positional information, similar to a global positioning system, and browser-like intelligence for the indoors. In addition, we offer digital tear-sheets with optional invoice integration, digital ad delivery, and an e-edition designed for reader engagement for the media, publishing and entertainment industry.\nRevenues were flat in 2018 because of an increase in our IPA product revenues, which was offset by a decrease in our Shoom services revenue. We expect to continue to grow our IPA product line in 2019. The IPA product line does have long sales cycles, which are a result from customer-related issues such as budget and procurement processes but also because of the early stages of indoor-positioning technology and the learning curve required for customers to implement such solutions. Customers also engage in a pilot program first which prolongs sales cycles and is typical of most emerging technology adoption curves. We anticipate sales cycles to improve in 2019 as our customer base moves from early adopters to mainstream customers. The sales cycle is also improving with the increased presence and awareness of beacon and Wi-Fi locationing technologies in the market. IPA sales can be licensed-based with government customers but commercial customers typically prefer a SaaS or subscription model. Our other digital solutions are also delivered on a SaaS model and allow us to generate industry analytics that complement our indoor-positioning solutions.\nWe experienced a net loss of $24.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 and a net loss of $35.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. We cannot assure that we will ever earn revenues sufficient to support our operations, or that we will ever be profitable. In order to continue our operations, we have supplemented the revenues we earned with proceeds from the sale of our equity and debt securities and proceeds from loans and bank credit lines. Furthermore, except for our Payplant facility, we have no committed source of financing and we cannot assure that we will be able to raise money as and when we need it to continue our operations. If we cannot raise funds as and when we need them, we may be required to scale back our business operations by reducing expenditures for employees, consultants, business development and marketing efforts, selling assets or one or more products in our business, or otherwise severely curtailing our operations.\nRecent Events\nReverse Stock Splits\nDuring 2018 and 2017, the Company has effected three reverse stock splits: (1) a 1-for-15 reverse split of the Company's outstanding common stock effected on March 1, 2017; (2) a 1-for-30 reverse split of the Company's outstanding common stock effected on February 6, 2018; and (3) a 1-for-40 reverse split of the Company's outstanding common stock effected on November 2, 2018.\nJanuary 2018 Capital Raise\nOn January 5, 2018, the Company entered into a securities purchase agreement (the January 2018 SPA\u201d) with certain investors pursuant to which the Company agreed to sell, in a registered direct offering, an aggregate of 14,996 shares (the January 2018 Shares\u201d) of the Company's common stock at a purchase price of $212.40 per share for aggregate gross proceeds of approximately $3.2 million. After deducting placement agent fees and other expenses, the net proceeds from the offering was approximately $2.8 million. Concurrently with the sale of the January 2018 Shares, pursuant to the January 2018 SPA the Company also sold warrants to purchase up to 14,996 shares of common stock (the January 2018 Warrants\u201d). This offering closed on January 8, 2018.\nThe January 2018 Warrants became exercisable on February 2, 2018 (the January 2018 Warrant Initial Exercise Date\u201d), at an exercise price per share equal to $264.00, subject to certain adjustments pursuant to the terms of the January 2018 Warrants (the January 2018 Warrant Exercise Price\u201d), and will expire on the fifth anniversary of the January 2018 Warrant Initial Exercise Date. As a result of a Dilutive Issuance (as defined in the January 2018 Warrants) as of February 20, 2018, the January 2018 Warrant Exercise Price was adjusted to the floor price of $120.00 per share pursuant to the January 2018 Warrants.\nFebruary 2018 Public Offering\nOn February 20, 2018, the Company completed a public offering for approximately $18 million in securities, consisting of (i) an aggregate of 83,149 Class A units, at a price to the public of $94.00 per Class A unit, each consisting of one share of common stock, and a five-year warrant to purchase one share of common stock, and (ii) 10,184.9752 Class B units, at a price to the public of $1,000 per Class B unit, each consisting of one share of the Company's newly designated Series 3 convertible preferred stock, par value $0.001 per share ( Series 3 Preferred\u201d), with a stated value of $1,000 and initially convertible into approximately 11 shares of common stock at a conversion price of $94.00 per share for up to an aggregate of 108,351 shares of common stock and warrants exercisable for the number of shares of common stock into which the shares of Series 3 Preferred is initially convertible. The warrants ( February 2018 Warrant\u201d) were immediately exercisable at an exercise price of $140.00 per share (subject to adjustment).\nThe Company received approximately $18 million in gross proceeds from this offering, including the satisfaction of approximately $1 million in amounts payable to service providers. After satisfying the amounts due to service providers and deducting placement agent fees, the net cash proceeds from this offering was approximately $15.4 million. The Company used the net proceeds from the transactions for working capital and general corporate purposes, including research and development and sales and marketing.\nThe shares of Series 3 Preferred issued in this offering have all been converted into common stock. As a result of the April 2018 offering described below as of April 24, 2018, the exercise price of the February 2018 Warrants was adjusted to the floor price of $25.36 per share and the number of shares of common stock underlying the February 2018 Warrants was increased to an aggregate of 1,057,178 shares of common stock.\nApril 2018 Public Offering\nOn April 24, 2018, the Company completed a public offering consisting of 10,115 units at a price to the public of $1,000 per unit, each consisting of (i) one share of our newly designated Series 4 convertible preferred stock, par value $0.001 per share (the Series 4 Preferred\u201d), with a stated value of $1,000 and initially convertible into approximately 54 shares of common stock, at a conversion price of $18.40 per share (subject to adjustment) and (ii) one warrant to purchase such number of shares of common stock as each share of Series 4 Preferred is initially convertible into. The warrants are immediately exercisable at an exercise price of $26.80 per share (subject to adjustment).\nThe Series 4 Preferred contain an anti-dilution protection feature, to adjust the conversion price if shares of common stock are sold or issued for a consideration per share less than the conversion price then in effect (subject to certain exemptions), provided, that the conversion price will not be less than $4.96. In addition, on the 60th day following the original issuance date of the Series 4 Preferred, the conversion price was reduced, and only reduced, to the lesser of (x) the then conversion price, as may be adjusted, and (y) 80% of the VWAP (as defined in the certificate of designation filed for the Series 4 Preferred) on the trading day immediately prior to the 60th day, provided that the conversion price will not be less than $4.96. On June 25, 2018, in accordance with the terms of such price reset provision, the conversion price of the Series 4 Preferred was adjusted to $7.12, which was subsequent adjusted on January 15, 2019 in connection with the rights offering to $4.96. In addition, in connection with the rights offering, on January 15, 2019, the exercise price of the warrants issued in the April offering were also reduced to the floor price of $4.96 and the number of shares issuable upon exercise of such warrants was increased to 2,769,000 shares of common stock.\nThe Company received approximately $10.1 million in gross proceeds from this offering, before deducting placement agent fees and offering expenses payable by the Company. After deducting placement agent fees and expenses, the net proceeds from this offering were approximately $9.2 million. The Company intends to use the net proceeds from this offering for working capital, general corporate purposes (including research and development, sales and marketing and the satisfaction of outstanding amounts payable to our vendors in connection with trade payables). Additionally, the Company may use a portion of the net proceeds of this offering to finance acquisitions of, or investments in, competitive and complementary businesses, products or services as a part of our growth strategy. However, the Company does not have any current commitments with respect to any such acquisitions or investments.\nSpin-off of Sysorex, Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiary, Sysorex Government Services, Inc.\nOn August 31, 2018, the Company completed the spin-off (the Spin-off\u201d) of its value added reseller business from its indoor positioning analytics business by way of a distribution of all the shares of common stock of the Company's wholly-owned subsidiary, Sysorex, to the Company's stockholders of record as of August 21, 2018 (the Record Date\u201d) and certain warrant holders. The distribution occurred by way of a pro rata stock distribution to such common stock, preferred stock and warrant holders, each of whom received one share of Sysorex's common stock for every 3 shares of the Company's common stock (without taking into effect the Reverse Split effected on November 2, 2018) held on the Record Date or such number of shares of common stock issuable upon complete conversion of the preferred stock or exercise of the warrants.\nOctober 2018 and December 2018 Note Purchase Agreements and Promissory Notes\nOn October 12, 2018 the Company entered into a note purchase agreement with an institutional investor (the Holder\u201d), pursuant to which the Company agreed to issue and sell to the Holder an unsecured promissory note (the October 2018 Note\u201d) in an aggregate principal amount of $2.52 million (the Initial Principal Amount\u201d), which is payable on or before the date that is 12 months from the issuance date. The Initial Principal Amount includes an original issue discount of $500,000.00 and $20,000.00 that the Company agreed to pay to the Holder to cover the Holder's legal fees, accounting costs, due diligence, monitoring and other transaction costs. In exchange for the October 2018 Note, the Holder paid an aggregate purchase price of $2.0 million. Interest on the October 2018 Note accrues at a rate of 10% per annum and is payable on the maturity date or otherwise in accordance with the October 2018 Note. Beginning on the date that is 6 months from the issuance date and at the intervals indicated below until the October 2018 Note is paid in full, the Holder shall have the right to redeem up to an aggregate of 1/3 of the initial principal balance of the October 2018 Note each month (each monthly exercise, a Monthly Redemption Amount\u201d) by providing written notice (each, a Monthly Redemption Notice\u201d) delivered to the Company; provided, however, that if the Holder does not exercise any Monthly Redemption Amount in its corresponding month then such Monthly Redemption Amount shall be available for the Holder to redeem in any future month in addition to such future month's Monthly Redemption Amount. Upon receipt of any Monthly Redemption Notice, the Company shall pay the applicable Monthly Redemption Amount in cash to the Holder within 5 business days of the Company's receipt of such Monthly Redemption Notice.\nOn December 21, 2018, the Company entered into a note purchase agreement with an institutional investor (the Holder\u201d), pursuant to which the Company agreed to issue and sell to the Holder an unsecured promissory note (the December 2018 Note\u201d) in an aggregate principal amount of $1.895 million (the Initial Principal Amount\u201d), which is payable on or before the date that is 10 months from the issuance date. The Initial Principal Amount includes an original issue discount of $375,000 and $20,000 that the Company agreed to pay to the Holder to cover the Holder's legal fees, accounting costs, due diligence, monitoring and other transaction costs. In exchange for the December 2018 Note, the Holder paid an aggregate purchase price of $1.5 million. Interest on the December 2018 Note accrues at a rate of 10% per annum and is payable on the maturity date or otherwise in accordance with the December 2018 Note. The Company may pay all or any portion of the amount owed earlier than it is due; provided, that in the event the Company elects to prepay all or any portion of the outstanding balance, it shall pay to the Holder 115% of the portion of the outstanding balance the Company elects to prepay. Beginning on the date that is 6 months from the issuance date and at the intervals indicated below until the December 2018 Note is paid in full, the Holder shall have the right to redeem up to an aggregate of 1/3 of the initial principal balance of the December 2018 Note each month (each monthly exercise, a Monthly Redemption Amount\u201d) by providing written notice (each, a Monthly Redemption Notice\u201d) delivered to the Company; provided, however, that if the Holder does not exercise any Monthly Redemption Amount in its corresponding month then such Monthly Redemption Amount shall be available for the Holder to redeem in any future month in addition to such future month's Monthly Redemption Amount. Upon receipt of any Monthly Redemption Notice, the Company shall pay the applicable Monthly Redemption Amount in cash to the Holder within 5 business days of the Company's receipt of such Monthly Redemption Notice.\nOn February 9, 2019, the note purchase agreements were each amended to delete the phrase by cancellation or exchange of the Note, in whole or in part\u201d. The Company also agreed to pay the Note Holder's fees and other expenses in an aggregate amount of $80,000.00 (the Fee\u201d) in connection with the preparation of the amendment by adding $40,000.00 of the Fee to the outstanding balance of each of the notes issued pursuant to the note purchase agreements.\nSysorex Loan Transaction\nOn December 31, 2018, the Company and Sysorex entered into a note purchase agreement pursuant to which the Company agreed to purchase from Sysorex at a purchase price equal to the Loan Amount (as defined below), a secured promissory note (the Secured Note\u201d) for up to an aggregate principal amount of 3.0 million (the Principal Amount\u201d), including any amounts advanced through the date of the Secured Note (the Prior Advances\u201d), to be borrowed and disbursed in increments (such borrowed amount, together with the Prior Advances, collectively referred to as the Loan Amount\u201d), with interest to accrue at a rate of ten percent (10%) per annum on all such Loan Amounts, beginning as of the date of disbursement with respect to any portion of such Loan Amount. In addition, Sysorex agreed to pay $20,000 to the Company to cover the Company's legal fees, accounting costs, due diligence, monitoring and other transaction costs incurred in connection with the purchase and sale of the Secured Note (the Transaction Expense Amount\u201d), all of which amount is included in the Principal Amount. The initial Loan Amount, therefore, includes any amounts disbursed to Sysorex and the Transaction Expense Amount.\nSysorex may borrow repay and borrow under the Secured Note, as needed, for a total outstanding balance, exclusive of any unpaid accrued interest, not to exceed the Principal Amount at any one time.\nAll outstanding principal amounts and accrued unpaid interest owing under the Secured Note shall become immediately due and payable on the earlier to occur of (i) the twenty-four (24) month anniversary of the date the Secured Note is issued (the Maturity Date\u201d), (ii) at such date when declared due and payable by the Company upon the occurrence of an Event of Default (as defined in the Secured Note), or (iii) at any such earlier date as set forth in the Secured Note. All accrued unpaid interest shall be payable in cash.\nPursuant to the terms of the Secured Note, Sysorex granted the Company, subject to any and all Payplant Liens (as defined in the Secured Note) and Permitted Liens (as defined in the Secured Note), a continuing first priority security interest in all assets of Sysorex whether owned as of the date of the Secured Note or subsequently acquired, including all proceeds therefrom (collectively, the Collateral\u201d) to secure the payment of the Secured Note and all other loans and advances (including all renewals, modifications and extensions thereof) and all obligations of any and every kind and nature of Sysorex to the Company, whether arising prior to, under or after the date of the Secured Note, however incurred or evidenced, plus all interest, reasonable costs, reasonable expenses and reasonable attorneys' fees, which may be made or incurred by the Company in the disbursement, administration, and collection of such amounts, and in the protection, maintenance, and liquidation of the Collateral.\nOn February 4, 2019, the documents were amended to increase the maximum Principal Amount that may be outstanding at any time under the Secured Note from $3.0 million to $5.0 million.\nConvertible Note Exchange\nOn January 29, 2019, the Company and the holder (the Note Holder\u201d) of that certain outstanding convertible promissory note, issued on November 17, 2017 (as amended, supplemented or otherwise modified, the Original Note\u201d), with an outstanding balance of $383,768.07 (the Remaining Balance\u201d), entered into an exchange agreement (the Exchange Agreement\u201d), pursuant to which the Company and the Note Holder agreed to (i) partition a new convertible promissory note in the form of the Original Note (the Partitioned Note\u201d) in the original principal amount equal to the Remaining Balance (the Exchange Amount\u201d) and then cause the Remaining Balance to be reduced by the Exchange Amount; and (ii) exchange the Partitioned Note for the delivery of 172,869 shares (each, an Exchange Share\u201d and collectively, the Exchange Shares\u201d) of the Company's common stock at an effective price per Exchange Share equal to $2.22 (the Exchange\u201d). The Exchange was completed on January 29, 2019. Following such partition of the Original Note, the Original Note was deemed paid in full, was automatically deemed canceled, and shall not be reissued.\nRights Offering\nOn January 15, 2019, the Company closed its rights offering (the Rights Offering\u201d) for aggregate gross proceeds to the Company of $12.0 million and net proceeds of approximately $10.77 million after deducting expenses relating to dealer-manager fees and expenses.\nThe Company sold an aggregate of 12,000 units consisting of one share of Series 5 Convertible Preferred Stock with a stated value of $1,000 (and immediately convertible into shares of common stock at a conversion price of $3.33 per share) and 300 warrants to purchase common stock with an exercise price of $3.33 per share. The warrants are exercisable for 5 years after the date of issuance. The Series 5 Convertible Preferred Stock and the warrants comprising the units immediately separated upon the closing of the Rights Offering.\nAtlas Technology Settlement\nOn February 20, 2019, the Company, Sysorex and Atlas Technology Group, LLC ( Atlas\u201d) entered into a settlement agreement (the Settlement Agreement\u201d) in connection with the satisfaction of an arbitration award in an aggregate amount of $1,156,840.25 plus pre-judgment interest equal to an aggregate of $59,955.28 (the Award\u201d) granted to Atlas following arbitration proceedings arising out of an engagement agreement, dated September 8, 2016, by and between Atlas and the Company as well as its subsidiaries, including the predecessor to Sysorex (the Engagement Agreement\u201d).\nPursuant to the Settlement Agreement, Atlas agreed to (a) reduce the Award by $275,000 resulting in a net award of $941,795.53 (the Net Award\u201d) and (b) accept an aggregate of 749,440 shares of freely-tradable common stock of the Company (the Settlement Shares\u201d), in satisfaction of the Award, which was determined by dividing 120% of the Net Award by $1.508, which was the minimum price,\u201d as defined under Nasdaq Listing Rule 5635(d). The closing occurred on February 21, 2019.\nThe Award is deemed satisfied in full and the parties have released each other from any claims arising out of the Engagement Agreement. In connection with the Spin-off, the Company and Sysorex each agreed pursuant to the terms and conditions of that certain Separation and Distribution Agreement, dated August 7, 2018, as amended, that 50% of the costs and liabilities related to the arbitration action arising from the Engagement Agreement would be shared by each party following the Spin-off. As a result, Sysorex is obligated to indemnify the Company for half of the total amount paid by the Company to satisfy the Award.\nIn the event that the total net proceeds received by Atlas or its designees from the sale of the Settlement Shares (exclusive of brokerage fees) exceeds the amount of the Net Award, Atlas agreed to deliver an amount equal to the difference between the sale proceeds and the Net Award to the legal counsel for the Company and Sysorex to be applied against fees incurred in connection with the arbitration and the Settlement Agreement.\nJOBS Act\nPursuant to Section 107 of the JOBS Act, emerging growth companies may delay adopting new or revised accounting standards until such time as those standards apply to private companies. We have irrevocably elected to opt out of this exemption from new or revised accounting standards and, therefore, are subject to the same new or revised accounting standards as other public companies that are not emerging growth companies.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles ( GAAP\u201d). In connection with the preparation of our consolidated financial statements, we are required to make assumptions and estimates about future events, and apply judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses and the related disclosures. We base our assumptions, estimates and judgments on historical experience, current trends and other factors that management believes to be relevant at the time our consolidated financial statements are prepared. On a regular basis, we review the accounting policies, assumptions, estimates and judgments to ensure that our consolidated financial statements are presented fairly and in accordance with GAAP. However, because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty, actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates, and such differences could be material.\nOur significant accounting policies are discussed in Note 2 of the audited consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 which are included elsewhere in this 10-K. We believe that the following accounting estimates are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results, and they require our most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, resulting from the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. There have been no changes to estimates during the periods presented in the filing. Historically changes in management estimates have not been material.\nRevenue Recognition\nIn March 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ( FASB\u201d) issued Accounting Standards Update ( ASU\u201d) No. 2016-08, Revenue from Contracts with Customers - Principal versus Agent Considerations\u201d, in April 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-10, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) - Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing\u201d and in May 9, 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-12, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)\u201d, or ASU 2016-12. This update provides clarifying guidance regarding the application of ASU No. 2014-09 - Revenue From Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), ( ASU 2014-09\u201d) which is not yet effective. These new standards provide for a single, principles-based model for revenue recognition that replaces the existing revenue recognition guidance. In July 2015, the FASB deferred the effective date of ASU 2014-09 until annual and interim periods beginning on or after December 15, 2017 and has replaced most existing revenue recognition guidance under GAAP. ASU 2016-12 may be applied retrospectively to historical periods presented or as a cumulative-effect adjustment as of the date of adoption. We have adopted ASU 2016-12 using a modified retrospective approach and will be applied prospectively in our financial statements from January 1, 2018 forward. Revenues under ASU 2016-12 are required to be recognized either at a point in time\u201d or over time\u201d, depending on the facts and circumstances of the arrangement, and will be evaluated using a five-step model. The adoption of Topic 606 did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements, neither at initial implementation nor will it have a material impact on an ongoing basis.\nSoftware As A Service Revenue Recognition\nWith respect to sales of our maintenance, consulting and other service agreements including our digital advertising and electronic services, customers pay fixed monthly fees in exchange for the Company's service. The Company's performance obligation is satisfied over time as the digital advertising and electronic services are provided continuously throughout the service period. The Company recognizes revenue evenly over the service period using a time-based measure because the Company is providing continuous access to its service.\nProfessional Services Revenue Recognition\nThe Company's professional services include fixed fee and time and materials contracts. Fixed fees are paid monthly, in phases, or upon acceptance of deliverables. The Company's time and materials contracts are paid weekly or monthly based on hours worked. Revenue on time and material contracts is recognized based on a fixed hourly rate as direct labor hours are expended. Materials, or other specified direct costs, are reimbursed as actual costs and may include markup. The Company has elected the practical expedient to recognize revenue for the right to invoice because the Company's right to consideration corresponds directly with the value to the customer of the performance completed to date. For fixed fee contracts including maintenance service provided by in house personnel, the Company recognizes revenue evenly over the service period using a time-based measure because the Company is providing continuous service. Because the Company's contracts have an expected duration of one year or less, the Company has elected the practical expedient in ASC 606-10-50-14(a) to not disclose information about its remaining performance obligations. Anticipated losses are recognized as soon as they become known. For the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Company did not incur any such losses. These amounts are based on known and estimated factors.\nContract Balances\nThe timing of our revenue recognition may differ from the timing of payment by our customers. We record a receivable when revenue is recognized prior to payment and we have an unconditional right to payment. Alternatively, when payment precedes the provision of the related services, we record deferred revenue until the performance obligations are satisfied. The Company had deferred revenue of approximately $235,000 as of December 31, 2018 related to cash received in advance for product maintenance services provided by the Company's technical staff. The Company expects to satisfy its remaining performance obligations for these maintenance services and recognize the deferred revenue and related contract costs over the next twelve months.\nLong-lived Assets\nWe account for our long-lived assets in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification ( ASC\u201d) 360, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets\u201d ( ASC 360\u201d), which requires that long-lived assets be evaluated whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable or the useful life has changed. Some of the events or changes in circumstances that would trigger an impairment test include, but are not limited to:\n \u25cf significant under-performance relative to expected and/or historical results (negative comparable sales growth or operating cash flows for two consecutive years); \n \u25cf significant negative industry or economic trends; \n \u25cf knowledge of transactions involving the sale of similar property at amounts below our carrying value; or \n \u25cf our expectation to dispose of long-lived assets before the end of their estimated useful lives, even though the assets do not meet the criteria to be classified as held for sale.\u201d \nLong-lived assets are grouped for recognition and measurement of impairment at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets. The impairment test for long-lived assets requires us to assess the recoverability of our long-lived assets by comparing their net carrying value to the sum of undiscounted estimated future cash flows directly associated with and arising from our use and eventual disposition of the assets. If the net carrying value of a group of long-lived assets exceeds the sum of related undiscounted estimated future cash flows, we would be required to record an impairment charge equal to the excess, if any, of net carrying value over fair value.\nWhen assessing the recoverability of our long-lived assets, which include property and equipment and finite-lived intangible assets, we make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors. Some of these assumptions involve a high degree of judgment and also bear a significant impact on the assessment conclusions. Included among these assumptions are estimating undiscounted future cash flows, including the projection of comparable sales, operating expenses, capital requirements for maintaining property and equipment and residual value of asset groups. We formulate estimates from historical experience and assumptions of future performance, based on business plans and forecasts, recent economic and business trends, and competitive conditions. In the event that our estimates or related assumptions change in the future, we may be required to record an impairment charge. Based on our evaluation we did not record a charge for impairment for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017.\nThe benefits to be derived from our acquired intangibles, will take additional financial resources to continue the development of our technology. Management believes our technology has significant long-term profit potential, and to date, management continues to allocate existing resources to the develop products and services to seek returns on its investment. We continue to seek additional resources, through both capital raising efforts and meeting with industry experts, as part of our continued efforts. Although there can be no assurance that these efforts will be successful, we intend to allocate financial and personnel resources when deemed possible and/or necessary. If we choose to abandon these efforts, or if we determine that such funding is not available, the related development of our technology (resulting in our lack of ability to expand our business), may be subject to significant impairment.\nAs described previously, we continue to experience weakness in market conditions, a depressed stock price, and challenges in executing our business plans. The Company will continue to monitor these uncertainties in future periods, to determine the impact.\nWe evaluate the remaining useful lives of long-lived assets and identifiable intangible assets whenever events or circumstances indicate that a revision to the remaining period of amortization is warranted. Such events or circumstances may include (but are not limited to): the effects of obsolescence, demand, competition, and/or other economic factors including the stability of the industry in which we operate, known technological advances, legislative actions, or changes in the regulatory environment. If the estimated remaining useful lives change, the remaining carrying amount of the long-lived assets and identifiable intangible assets would be amortized prospectively over that revised remaining useful life. We have determined that there were no events or circumstances during the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, which would indicate a revision to the remaining amortization period related to any of our long-lived assets. Accordingly, we believe that the current estimated useful lives of long-lived assets reflect the period over which they are expected to contribute to future cash flows and are therefore deemed appropriate.\nGoodwill and Indefinite-lived Assets\nWe have recorded goodwill and other indefinite-lived assets in connection with our acquisition of Shoom. Goodwill, which represents the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets of the acquired company, is not amortized. Indefinite-lived intangible assets are stated at fair value as of the date acquired in a business combination. The recoverability of goodwill is evaluated at least annually and when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.\nWe analyze goodwill first to assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform a detailed goodwill impairment test as required. The more-likely-than-not threshold is defined as having a likelihood of more than 50%.\nEvents and circumstances for an entity to consider in conducting the qualitative assessment are:\n \u25cf Macroeconomic conditions such as a deterioration in general economic conditions, limitations on accessing capital, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, or other developments in equity and credit markets. \n \u25cf Industry and market considerations such as a deterioration in the environment in which an entity operates, an increased competitive environment, a decline in market-dependent multiples or metrics (considered in both absolute terms and relative to peers), a change in the market for an entity's products or services, or a regulatory or political development. \n \u25cf Cost factors such as increases in raw materials, labor, or other costs that have a negative effect on earnings and cash flows. \n \u25cf Overall financial performance such as negative or declining cash flows or a decline in actual or planned revenue or earnings compared with actual and projected results of relevant prior periods. \n \u25cf Other relevant entity-specific events such as changes in management, key personnel, strategy, or customers, contemplation of bankruptcy, or litigation. \n \u25cf Events affecting a reporting unit such as a change in the composition or carrying amount of its net assets, a more-likely-than-not expectation of selling or disposing of all, or a portion, of a reporting unit, the testing for recoverability of a significant asset group within a reporting unit, or recognition of a goodwill impairment loss in the financial statements of a subsidiary that is a component of a reporting unit. \n \u25cf If applicable, a sustained decrease in share price (considered in both absolute terms and relative to peers). \nAcquired In-Process Research and Development ( IPR&D\u201d)\nIn accordance with authoritative guidance, we recognize IPR&D at fair value as of the acquisition date, and subsequently account for it as an indefinite-lived intangible asset until completion or abandonment of the associated research and development efforts. Once an IPR&D project has been completed, the useful life of the IPR&D asset is determined and amortized accordingly. If the IPR&D asset is abandoned, the remaining carrying value is written off. During fiscal year 2014, we acquired IPR&D through the acquisition of AirPatrol and in 2015 through the acquisition of the assets of LightMiner. Our IPR&D is comprised of AirPatrol and LightMiner technology, which was valued on the date of the acquisition. It will take additional financial resources to continue development of these technologies.\nWe continue to seek additional resources, through both capital raising efforts and meeting with industry experts, for further development of the AirPatrol technology. Through December 31, 2018, we have made some progress with raising capital since these acquisitions, building our pipeline and getting industry acknowledgment. We are being recognized by leading industry analysts in their report on leading indoor positioning companies and also was awarded the IoT Security Excellence award by TMC. However, management is focused on growing revenue from these products and continues to actively and aggressively pursue efforts to recognize the value of the AirPatrol and LightMiner technologies. Although there can be no assurance that these efforts will be successful, we intend to allocate financial and personnel resources when deemed possible and/or necessary. If we choose to abandon these efforts, or if we determine that such funding is not available, the related IPR&D will be subject to significant impairment.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets Subject to Amortization\nWe amortize intangible assets with finite lives over their estimated useful lives and review them for impairment whenever an impairment indicator exists. We continually monitor events and changes in circumstances that could indicate carrying amounts of our long-lived assets, including our intangible assets, may not be recoverable. When such events or changes in circumstances occur, we assess recoverability by determining whether the carrying value of such assets will be recovered through the undiscounted expected future cash flows. If the future undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying amount of these assets, we recognize an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the assets. We did not recognize any intangible asset impairment charges for the year ended December 31, 2018. See Acquired In-Process Research and Development ( IPR&D\u201d)\u201d for further information.\nDeferred Income Taxes\nIn accordance with ASC 740 Income Taxes\u201d ( ASC 740\u201d), management routinely evaluates the likelihood of the realization of its income tax benefits and the recognition of its deferred tax assets. In evaluating the need for any valuation allowance, management will assess whether it is more likely than not that some portion, or all, of the deferred tax asset may not be realized. Ultimately, the realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during those periods in which temporary differences become deductible and/or tax credits and tax loss carry-forwards can be utilized. In performing its analyses, management considers both positive and negative evidence including historical financial performance, previous earnings patterns, future earnings forecasts, tax planning strategies, economic and business trends and the potential realization of net operating loss carry-forwards within a reasonable timeframe. To this end, management considered (i) that we have had historical losses in the prior years and cannot anticipate generating a sufficient level of future profits in order to realize the benefits of our deferred tax asset; (ii) tax planning strategies; and (iii) the adequacy of future income as of and for the year ended December 31, 2018, based upon certain economic conditions and historical losses through December 31, 2018. After consideration of these factors, management deemed it appropriate to establish a full valuation allowance.\nA liability for unrecognized tax benefits\u201d is recorded for any tax benefits claimed in the Company's tax filings that do not meet these recognition and measurement standards. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, no liability for unrecognized tax benefits was required to be reported. The guidance also discusses the classification of related interest and penalties on income taxes. The Company's policy is to record interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions as a component of income tax expense. No interest or penalties were recorded during the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017.\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts\nWe maintain our reserves for credit losses at a level believed by management to be adequate to absorb potential losses inherent in the respective balances. We assign an internal credit quality rating to all new customers and update these ratings regularly, but no less than annually. Management's determination of the adequacy of the reserve for credit losses for our accounts and notes receivable is based on the age of the receivable balance, the customer's credit quality rating, an evaluation of historical credit losses, current economic conditions, and other relevant factors.\nAs of December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, reserves for credit losses included a reserve for doubtful accounts of approximately $464,000 and $1.1 million, respectively, due to the aging of the items greater than 120 days outstanding and other potential non-collections.\nBusiness Combinations\nWe account for business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting, and accordingly, the assets and liabilities of the acquired business are recorded at their fair values at the date of acquisition. The excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value is recorded as goodwill. Any changes in the estimated fair values of the net assets recorded for acquisitions prior to the finalization of more detailed analysis, but not to exceed one year from the date of acquisition, will change the amount of the purchase price allocable to goodwill. Any subsequent changes to any purchase price allocations that are material to our consolidated financial results will be adjusted. All acquisition costs are expensed as incurred and in-process research and development costs are recorded at fair value as an indefinite-lived intangible asset and assessed for impairment thereafter until completion, at which point the asset is amortized over its expected useful life. Separately recognized transactions associated with business combinations are generally expensed subsequent to the acquisition date. The application of business combination and impairment accounting requires the use of significant estimates and assumptions.\nUpon acquisition, the accounts and results of operations are consolidated as of and subsequent to the acquisition date and are included in our Consolidated Financial Statements from the acquisition date.\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe account for equity instruments issued to non-employees in accordance with accounting guidance, which requires that such equity instruments are recorded at their fair value on the measurement date, which is typically the date the services are performed.\nWe account for equity instruments issued to employees in accordance with accounting guidance that requires that awards are recorded at their fair value on the date of grant and are amortized over the vesting period of the award. We recognize compensation costs over the requisite service period of the award, which is generally the vesting term of the equity instrument issued.\nThe Black-Scholes option valuation model is used to estimate the fair value of the options or the equivalent security granted. The model includes subjective input assumptions that can materially affect the fair value estimates. The model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options or warrants. The expected volatility is estimated based on the average of historical volatilities for industry peers.\nThe principal assumptions used in applying the Black-Scholes model along with the results from the model were as follows:\nTable 53: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>For the Years Ended\nDecember 31, </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Risk-free interest rate </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.79-3.01 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2.27 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Expected life of option grants </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> 5-6 years </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7 years </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Expected volatility of underlying stock </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>45.64-46.18 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>47.34 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Dividends assumption </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>-- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>-- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n</table>\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Company recorded a charge of $1.5 million, for the amortization of employee stock options.\nResults of Operations\nYear Ended December 31, 2018 compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2017\nThe following table sets forth selected consolidated financial data as a percentage of our revenue and the percentage of period-over-period change:\nTable 54: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Years ended </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, 2018 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>December 31, 2017 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>(in thousands, except percentages) </td> <td> </td> <td>Amount </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>% of\nRevenues </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>Amount </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>% of\nRevenues </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>%\nChange </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Product revenues </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>1,135 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>30 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>535 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>14 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>112 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Services revenues </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,621 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>70 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>3,400 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>86 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(23 </td> <td>)% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Cost of revenues - Products </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>490 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>494 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1 </td> <td>)% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Cost of revenues - Services </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>586 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>16 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>738 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>19 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(21 </td> <td>)% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Gross profit </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,680 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>71 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>2,703 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>69 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1 </td> <td>)% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Operating expenses </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>21,082 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>561 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>17,733 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>451 </td> <td>% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>19 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Loss from operations </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(18.402 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(490 </td> <td>)% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(15,030 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(382 </td> <td>)% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>22 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net loss </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(24,561 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(654 </td> <td>)% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(35,030 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(890 </td> <td>)% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(30 </td> <td>)% </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net loss attributable to stockholders </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(44,624 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(1,188 </td> <td>)% </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(35,769 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(909 </td> <td>)% </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>25 </td> <td>% </td> </tr>\n</table>\nRevenues\nRevenues for the year ended December 31, 2018 were $3.8 million compared to $3.9 million for the comparable period in the prior year for a decrease of $0.1 million, or approximately 2.6%. Revenues between the two comparable periods are relatively flat due to an increase in our IPA product revenues, which was offset by a decrease in our Shoom services revenue.\nOur revenues for the year ended December 31, 2018 include our IPA and other product lines that remain following the Spin-off. Such revenues do not include the revenues of our historical value added reseller business, as such business was part of the Spin-off of Sysorex. Accordingly, the revenues for the year ended December 31, 2018 represent a decline of approximately 90% from the total historical revenues reported for the year ended December 31, 2017, which included the aggregate revenues of our IPA business and the value added reseller business.\nCost of Revenues\nCost of revenues for the year ended December 31, 2018 were $1.1 million compared to $1.2 million for the comparable period in the prior year. This decrease of $0.1 million, or approximately 8.3%, was primarily attributable the nominally lower revenue with higher gross margins during the year ended December 31, 2018.\nThe gross profit margin for the year ended December 31, 2018 was 71% compared to 69% for the year ended December 31, 2017. This slight increase in margin is primarily due to the sales mix of products and services sold during the year ended December 31, 2018.\nOperating Expenses\nOperating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2018 were $21.1 million and $17.7 million for the comparable period ended December 31, 2017. This increase of $3.4 million is primarily attributable to higher IT infrastructure costs, compensation, cost of public offerings, and legal and professional fees as well as a $636,000 intangibles impairment, $690,000 of deconsolidation costs related to the Spin-off and a litigation settlement of $560,000.\nLoss From Operations\n\\\nLoss from operations for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $18.4 million as compared to $15 million for the comparable period in the prior year. This increase of $3.4 million was primarily attributable to the higher operating expenses during the year ended December 31, 2018 as discussed in the reporting caption above. In addition, total losses reported include losses associated with the value added reseller business prior to the spin-off of the value added reseller business in the deconsolidated operations line item.\nOther Income/Expense\nOther income/expense for the year ended December 31, 2018 was a loss of $1.4 million compared to a loss of $3.1 million for the comparable period in the prior year. This decrease in loss of $1.7 million is primarily attributable to a $643,000 decrease in interest expense due to the amortization of deferred financing costs in 2017 and lower interest on credit facilities and notes in 2018 and forgiveness of debt and a non-cash extinguishment loss for the value of the common shares issued as repayment for the debenture in 2017.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nThere was no provision for income taxes for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 as the Company was in a net taxable loss position. Deferred tax assets resulting from such losses are fully reserved as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 since, at present, the Company has no history of taxable income and it is more likely than not that such assets will not be realized.\nNet Gain and Net Loss Attributable To Non-Controlling Interest\nNet gain attributable to non-controlling interest for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $11,000. Net loss attributable to non-controlling interest for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $17,000. This increase in gain of $28,000 was attributable to the gain from Sysorex India.\nNet Loss Attributable To Stockholders of Inpixon\nNet loss attributable to stockholders of Inpixon for the year ended December 31, 2018 was $24.6 million compared to $35.0 million for the comparable period in the prior year. This decrease in loss of $10.4 million was primarily attributable to the $2 million lower other income/expenses offset by the $3.4 million increase in operating expenses during the year ended December 31, 2018 plus the $12 million lower loss from deconsolidated operations of the Spin-off during the year ended December 31, 2018.\nNon-GAAP Financial information\nEBITDA\nEBITDA is defined as net income (loss) before interest, provision for (benefit from) income taxes, and depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA is used by our management as the matrix in which it manages the business. It is defined as EBITDA plus adjustments for other income or expense items, non-recurring items and non-cash stock-based compensation.\nAdjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2018 was a loss of $15.0 million compared to a loss of $12.1 million for the prior year period.\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of net income/loss attributable to stockholders of Inpixon, which is our GAAP operating performance measure, to Adjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 (in thousands):\nTable 55: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>For the Years Ended\nDecember 31,\n</td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2018 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2017 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Net loss attributable to common stockholders </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(44,624 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(35,769 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Adjustments: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Non-recurring one-time charges: </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Acquisition transaction/financing costs </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>108 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>5 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Costs associated with public offering </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>327 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>212 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Impairment of goodwill </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>636 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>8,392 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Write off of project expenses </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>726 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Gain on earnout </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(934 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(561 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Gain on the sale of Sysorex Arabia </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(23 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Change in the fair value of derivative liability </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(48 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(555 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Severance </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>15 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>27 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Stock based compensation - acquisition costs </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>7 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Provision for doubtful accounts </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(659 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>952 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Gain on the sale of contracts </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(601 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Gain on the settlement of obligations </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(307 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>(430 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Exchange of warrants for shares </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>434 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Extinguishment loss for debt modification </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,523 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Debt forgiveness </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>635 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Settlement of litigation </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>559 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Deemed dividend to preferred stockholders </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,407 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>756 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Deemed dividend for triggering of warrant down round feature </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>13,645 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>- </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Stock-based compensation - compensation and related benefits </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,494 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>1,526 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Interest expense </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>2,044 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>3,821 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Depreciation and amortization </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,186 </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td> </td> <td>6,895 </td> <td> </td> </tr>\n<tr> <td>Adjusted EBITDA </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(15,049 </td> <td>) </td> <td> </td> <td>$ </td> <td>(12,130 </td> <td>) </td> </tr>\n</table>\nWe rely on Adjusted EBITDA, which is a non-GAAP financial measure for the following:\nTable 56: <table> <tr> <td> </td> <td>\u25cf </td> <td>To review and assess the operating performance of our Company as permitted by Accounting Standards Codification Topic 280, Segment Reporting;

We believe it provides an additional way for investors to view our operations, when considered with both our GAAP results and the reconciliation to net income (loss). By including this information, we can provide investors with a more complete understanding of our business. Specifically, we present Adjusted EBITDA as supplemental disclosure because of the following:\n \u25cf We believe Adjusted EBITDA is a useful tool for investors to assess the operating performance of our business without the effect of interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization and other non-cash items including stock based compensation, amortization of intangibles, change in the fair value of shares to be issued, change in the fair value of derivative liability, impairment of goodwill and one time charges including gain/loss on the settlement of obligations, severance costs, provision for doubtful accounts, acquisition costs and the costs associated with the public offering. \u25cf We believe that it is useful to provide to investors with a standard operating metric used by management to evaluate our operating performance; and \u25cf We believe that the use of Adjusted EBITDA is helpful to compare our results to other companies. \nEven though we believe Adjusted EBITDA is useful for investors, it does have limitations as an analytical tool. Thus, we strongly urge investors not to consider this metric in isolation or as a substitute for net income (loss) and the other consolidated statement of operations data prepared in accordance with GAAP. Some of these limitations include the fact that:\n \u25cf Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect our cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments; \u25cf Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; \u25cf Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect the significant interest expense or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on our debt; \u25cf Although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future, and Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements; \u25cf Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect income or other taxes or the cash requirements to make any tax payments; and \u25cf Other companies in our industry may calculate Adjusted EBITDA differently than we do, thereby potentially limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure. \nBecause of"}
